Mr. President, it is with great pride that I rise to \naddress my colleagues for the first time from the floor of the U.S. \nSenate, the world's greatest deliberative body. I am honored to be \nstanding where once stood Senator Margaret Chase Smith, who was such an \ninspiration to me as a young girl growing up in Caribou, ME.\n  In all of history, only 26 women have served in the Senate, only 15 \nof us elected in our own right. I am especially proud that my home \nState is the first to send two Republican women to serve in the Senate \nat the same time. And I am very pleased to be sharing that honor with \nmy colleague, Senator Olympia Snowe.\n  During my youth, the people of Maine were fortunate to have an \ninspiring example of a woman who stood tall for her principles and for \nher State. As a Senator from 1949 to 1972, Margaret Chase Smith taught \nus that women could reach the highest levels of government and that \nhard work, common sense, and integrity are rewarded.\n  Equally important, Senator Smith taught us how to govern. She \nrecognized it is only through civil discourse and a spirit of \ncooperation that the people's business gets done. And she showed us \nall, through her deeds as well as her words, that there is a difference \nbetween the principle of compromise and the compromise of principle. \nCompromising one's principles is wrong. Compromising on how to achieve \nthose principles is the essence of a healthy democracy.\n  Each of us is called to serve, and the different ways in which we are \ncalled form the fabric of this great Nation. Some are called to heal \nand become doctors and nurses. Others are called to impart wisdom to \nthe next generation and become teachers. Others are called to work in \nthe businesses, large and small, that provide the products and services \nthat enrich our daily lives. Still others are called to be the \nentrepreneurs who create the jobs that keep this country at the \nforefront of the world's economy.\n\n[[Page S982]]\n\n  With a father, grandfather, great-grandfather, and great-great-\ngrandfather who all served in the Maine Legislature, I heard the call \nto public service at an early age. And that call was not limited to the \nmen in my family, as my mother served as head of the local school \nboard, as mayor of Caribou, and as the chair of the board of trustees \nof Maine's State university system. With my family background, no \ngreater honor could be bestowed upon me than to represent the people of \nMaine in the U.S. Senate.\n  In undertaking my duties as Senator, Mr. President, I come to \nWashington not as an enemy of government but as one committed to \nimproving it. We need a vigorous debate in this country about the role \nof government, a reassessment of what it can and cannot do. There are \nsome problems that only the Federal Government has the resources and \nthe authority to address, but many times the answers are found not in \nWashington but in our neighborhoods, our communities, our States, and \nultimately in ourselves.\n  If there is one change in government on which we should all be able \nto agree, it is that we need to start to be more forthright with the \nAmerican people about the difficult challenges facing us. A well-known \nMaine business sells hunting boots, and if you buy a pair of them you \ncan be confident they will withstand the test of time. Take them apart \nand you will understand why. They contain no bells or whistles. If our \nFederal budget were as honestly constructed as a pair of Maine boots, \nfuture taxpayers could sleep as well as Maine woodsmen.\n  In assessing the role of government, we must never forget that the \ngreat advances we have made over the years can ultimately be traced to \nthe energy and creativity of our citizens. Indeed, perhaps the most \nprofound change in political thought around the globe during the past \ntwo decades has been the recognition that there is usually a \ncorrelation between less government and more progress.\n  Government must foster the energy and creativity of our private \nsector. As Winston Churchill once said, ``Some see private enterprise \nas a predatory target to be shot, others as a cow to be milked, but few \nsee it as a sturdy horse pulling the wagon.'' I do see private \nenterprise as that sturdy horse, and in that wagon which it is pulling \nare the jobs that are so critical to all of our constituents.\n  Wherever I travel in Maine, the primary concern of the people is \njobs. In the past, they were worried about whether jobs would be there \nfor their children and their grandchildren. Today, they are worried \nabout their own jobs as well--some about getting jobs and many more \nabout keeping the ones that they have. We live in the midst of an \nexciting and dynamic technological revolution, but it is accompanied by \nwidespread anxiety about our futures. One need only visit with former \nmill workers in Millinocket or Biddeford, ME, to understand that fear.\n  To respond to the concerns of our citizens, Government policies must \npromote job creation and retention, and the starting point is small \nbusiness. In my State, it is the 30,000 small businesses that provide \nmost of the new employment opportunities, and it is small businesses \nthat will account for two-thirds of the new jobs in the next decade.\n\n  Even though small businesses provide the spark that ignites many of \nthe new ideas that benefit us all, Government policies often serve to \ninhibit rather than foster these enterprises. A glaring example is the \nonerous estate tax that deters families from passing on a successful \nbusiness from one generation to the next. An owner of such a business \nin Maine once told me that he made the painful decision to sell his \nfamily business to a large out-of-State corporation rather than leave \nit to his children and force them to assume a large debt to pay the \nFederal estate tax. He was forced to abandon what he and his father \nbefore him had spent their lives building. Making matters worse, the \nnew corporate owner consolidated its administrative operations out of \nState, costing Maine more than 50 good jobs. That is wrong. That is the \nkind of policy we must change.\n  If excessive taxes cause the downfall of some enterprises, others are \ndone in by unreasonable regulations. This occurred in Lubec, ME, \nlocated in one of the most beautiful but also one of the poorest parts \nof my State. During my Senate campaign, I toured the empty shell of the \nMcCurdy Fish Co., a family owned business that had operated in Lubec \nfor more than 90 years, providing 20 good, much-needed jobs to this \narea. It was closed down by new Federal regulations with which it \nsimply could not afford to comply. Adding insult to injury, just across \nthe border the company's Canadian competitor continued processing fish \nin the same manner as had the Lubec company and exported its product \ninto the United States, free from these expensive regulations.\n  Mr. President, another essential step to promoting an economic \nclimate that creates jobs is balancing the Federal budget. It has been \nestimated that a balanced budget would reduce interest rates by more \nthan 1 percent, a strong stimulus for growth and employment.\n  To ensure long-term prosperity, we must learn to live within our \nmeans. Not since 1969 has this Nation seen a balanced budget. More than \n25 years of skyrocketing spending and an unwillingness to make \nsacrifices have ballooned our debt to more than $5.2 trillion. We must \nact now or leave a legacy of crushing debt to the next generation. At \nthe rate we are going, we may cross that bridge to the 21st century, \nonly to arrive in a land of unkept promises and unpaid bills.\n  To avoid this fate, one of my top priorities will be to pass a \nbalanced budget amendment to the Constitution. History shows that it \nwill take a constitutional requirement for Congress to embrace fiscal \nresponsibility as a permanent obligation rather than as a passing fad.\n  Fiscal responsibility also means Medicare and Social Security must be \nplaced on a sound financial footing. Only through effective action on \nthese fronts will we be able to keep our promises to our seniors \nwithout bankrupting our children.\n  A third key to jobs is quality education. The fruits of the new age \nin which we live will be shared by most of our citizens only if the \ndoors of opportunity are open wide. Contrary to what some would have \nyou believe, we do not face a choice between the greed of a few and the \nwell-being of the many. Rather, we need policies that will ensure that \nwhen an entrepreneur drops the stone of innovation into the \ntechnological pool, the benefits ripple throughout society. Government \ncannot and should not assure equality of outcomes. But without equality \nof opportunity, the American dream is unfairly denied.\n  The reality of today's workplace is that 85 percent of the new jobs \nwill require some sort of post-secondary education, whether that be a \ncommunity college, a technical or vocational education, or a bachelor's \ndegree and beyond. We must do what we can to open the doors to a post-\nsecondary education for anyone who wants it, and to ensure that cost is \nnot the barrier that separates those who pursue higher education from \nthose who do not. Increasingly, we are finding that the growing gap \nbetween the rich and the poor in this Nation is an education gap.\n\n  A final element in achieving broad-based participation in the new \nAmerican-led industrial and technological revolution is fair trade. The \nprimary victims of unfair trading practices are workers, particularly \nthose with the fewest skills and the least education. Let me be clear: \nI am a strong advocate of free trade, but we cannot sustain majority \nsupport for that policy unless we take a strong stand against unfair \npractices.\n  While mine is a message of jobs and opportunity, I know that there \nare those who, through no fault of their own, are unable to get by \nwithout help from their government. Hubert Humphrey once said, ``the \nmoral test of a government is how * * * [it] * * * treats those who are \nin the dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of \nlife, the elderly; and those who are in the shadows of life--the sick, \nthe needy and the handicapped.'' As we go about the difficult task of \nbalancing the budget, of choosing among many worthwhile programs, we \nmust take care not to leave behind those who truly need our help.\n  Those are the principles upon which my vision of the future of \nAmerica is based. And I bring one other principle\n\n[[Page S983]]\n\nto this body, one which will guide me more than any other as I embark \nupon this exciting journey, and that is a steadfast commitment to the \npeople of Maine. Whether it is fighting for Maine's fair share of \nFederal contracts, urging a business to expand and create jobs in our \nState, or helping a constituent navigate the bureaucratic maze in order \nto receive veterans' benefits, it will be service to the people of my \nState that will be my highest priority as Maine's newest Senator.\n  Just 1 year ago, I stood in Bangor, ME, with my family and my friends \nat my side, and announced my intention to seek a seat in the U.S. \nSenate. I told the people of Maine then that I would represent them \nwith dignity and determination, with energy and enthusiasm. My approach \nwill be simple and straightforward: I will listen to all points of \nview, I will engage in constructive dialog with my colleagues, I will \ncompromise when compromise is warranted, but, after all is said and \ndone, I will fight for those changes that will make the Federal \nGovernment better able to serve the people of Maine.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The acting majority leader.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to compliment Senator Collins for \nan outstanding maiden speech, her first speech on the Senate floor. I \nthink the speech speaks very well for itself and for Senator Collins. I \nthink it also speaks very well for the State of Maine, in showing \nexcellent taste, making an excellent decision in electing Senator \nCollins. I look forward to working with her and joining with her and \nwith Senator Snowe and following the tradition of Senator Margaret \nChase Smith, who was one of the pioneers in the Senate.\n  I wish to compliment the Senator from Maine for an outstanding \nspeech. Several of the things which she mentioned in her speech we have \nvery high on our agenda. Senator Collins mentioned that she wanted to \npass a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. We are going to \nbe discussing that today, and hopefully we will be voting on that very \nsoon, certainly by the end of this month.\n  Hopefully, we will pass it. I might mention, Senator Collins' \nelection may well be the deciding vote in making that happen, because \nin the last Congress, we failed by one vote. So, again, every election \nis important.\n  I compliment the Senator from Maine for an outstanding speech and \nreassure her that I share many of her objectives. She mentioned \nreducing the inheritance tax to help small business. I couldn't agree \nmore.\n  I compliment her on an outstanding speech and compliment the people \nof Maine for sending two outstanding Senators to serve and join us in \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the regular order? Are we in \nmorning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business, and the \nSenator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/05/senate-section/article/S981-5", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S983-S985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to speak a little bit about \nthe issue of education, which was raised so aggressively by the \nPresident in his State of the Union Address last night. I congratulate \nhim, once again, for focusing the country's attention on this critical \nconcern. It is something that we, as a nation, have focused our \nenergies on ever since we began, and many could argue that one of the \nreally unique miracles of American society has been our educational \nsystem.\n  With each generation, we have asked ourselves, is our system working \nwell, is it working right, is it producing individuals who are trained \nand capable of participating in the issues which their generation will \nface? In many instances, the answer has regrettably come back, no, \nmaybe we aren't or we are not doing quite enough.\n  I, for example, remember that in 1980, we had the report of ``A \nNation at Risk,'' and that report identified as a country, because of \nour educational failings, we were falling behind, falling behind our \nsister nations in the industrial world in the area of educating our \nstudents and their capacity to compete, especially in areas such as \nscience and math. So a major initiative was undertaken as a result of \nthat.\n  Then when I was Governor of New Hampshire back in 1988, President \nBush had just been elected, and he proclaimed that he would be the \neducation President and gathered, for the first time, I believe--maybe \nit was the second time in history--all the Governors in one location \nfor the purpose of taking on a one-item agenda. That was in \nCharlottesville, VA, and the issue was education.\n  At that time, Governor Clinton from Arkansas was, I believe, the \nchairman of the Governors conference and played a major role in \nidentifying five major policies which would be the goals to get us to \nthe year 2000 to improve our educational system.\n  One of those policies involved being a leader in the world by the \nyear 2000, I believe it was--it might have been earlier--in the area of \nmath and science education.\n  Now we have President Clinton coming forward and saying, again, and \naccurately so, that our educational system is not accomplishing what we \nneed as a nation. It is not educating our children to the level that is \nnecessary for us, as a nation, to compete. And so we revisit the issue.\n  The question is, how do we revisit the issue? Do we learn from our \nmistakes of the past, or do we simply go forward with another new set \nof initiatives which may or may not accomplish our goals or may not \naccomplish more than what was accomplished in the last efforts. This is \nwhat I want to discuss, because I think the President, for all his \nenergy and his enthusiasm and his rightly directed purpose, which is to \nimprove education, has, to some degree, missed the point.\n  There are a lot of issues of education, but there are parts of \neducation which work well, and one of the core parts of education that \nworks well is the ability to keep the control over education at the \nlocal level. The essence of quality education, the formula for quality \neducation is not a formula which says dollars equal better education. \nIt is a formula that has variables in it, including dollars, including \nteachers, including principals, including school boards. But that \nformula doesn't necessarily have as a major function in it--we are \ntalking now about secondary and elementary education--the Federal \nGovernment deciding the purposes, the roles, the curriculums of \neducation. Rather, the essence of that formula is that the local \ncommunity, the teachers, the parents, the principals, the school boards \ncollaborate to produce quality education.\n  So the Federal role in education is narrow, because there could be \nnothing more disruptive or, in my opinion, nothing that would undermine \neducation more fundamentally than to move the decision process out of \nthe hands of the parents, out of the hands of the teachers, out of the \nhands of the principals to Washington. We would end up with a \nbureaucratic structure which would not respond to the needs of better \neducation.\n\n  No, the Federal role is narrow. It should be focused, focused on \nplaces where it can make an impact, and that is what we tried to do or \nattempted to do. Sometimes we tried to go beyond that. Basically, that \nis what we tried to do. The Federal role has been, for example, in \npostsecondary education. The Federal role is significant, important, \nand appropriate in assisting students in being able to move on past \ntheir high school years to higher education, and the President's \ninitiatives in this area are something that we want to look at because \nthey could be a valuable addition.\n  The Federal role in the secondary school level has been really \nlimited and focused to a couple of specific areas where we felt the \nFederal Government could play a major part--chapter 1, Head Start, and \nspecial needs students.\n  But now the President comes forward and lays out a whole brand new \nset of initiatives, new spending programs, $43 billion in new \nprogrammatic activity, not pursuing programs that are on the books, but \nsetting off on brandnew programs, and you have to ask yourself:\n\n[[Page S984]]\n\n First, how many of those programs are appropriate to the Federal \nGovernment and, second, and even more important, is that the best use \nof those dollars, because there is something that is missing here.\n  At the local school level, the Federal Government has said you must \neducate the special needs child under Public Law 94-142. This was an \nexcellent decision, that we require that the special needs child would \nbe able to be educated in the least restrictive, most mainstreamed \nenvironment, and it has worked well. But when we passed that law, the \nFederal Government also said that we were going to be a partner in that \neducation; that we, the Federal Government, because we were insisting \nthat the local government undertake this role in the elementary and \nsecondary schools, that we, the Federal Government, would pay for 40 \npercent of the cost of special education in this country. Today, the \nFederal Government doesn't pay for 40 percent of the cost of special \neducation, it pays for approximately 6 percent, and the impact on the \nlocal school systems of the Federal Government not stepping forward and \ndoing what it said it would do to assist in educating special needs \nstudents has been dramatic.\n  We have seen a shift in resources at the local level which has been \narbitrarily created because of the Federal Government's failure to live \nup to its responsibility.\n  In the local schools in my State, for example, the local property \ntaxpayer bears the burden of education primarily, and this is true \nthroughout New England to a large degree, and many other States, I am \nsure. What happens is that because the Federal Government is unwilling \nto pay the 40 percent it said it would pay for a special needs student, \nthe local property taxpayer has to pick up that 40 percent, or the \ndifference between what the Federal Government is paying and what it \nsaid it would pay, which is about 34 percent.\n  That has meant that resources which might have been used for the \naverage student, maybe to have an extra art class or an extra language \nclass or an extra math class, or might have been used for the athletic \nprogram or for the cultural programs in the school system or might have \nsimply been left with the local property taxpayers so that they could \nmeet their mortgage payments more easily or their car payments more \neasily, that money is going to educate the special-needs student.\n  What we have created is a conflict, an inappropriate, unfair \nconflict, especially to the special-needs student, because what has \nhappened is that in many communities where you have children who need \nspecial assistance, that special assistance is extremely expensive, and \nthe parents of the students who are not special-needs students look at \nthe parents of the students who are special-needs students and say, \n``Why is your son or daughter getting $10,000, $20,000, $30,000 spent \non their education annually when my son or daughter is only having \n$3,000 or $4,000 or $5,000 spent on him or her?'' ``It's just not \nfair,'' they are saying.\n  So you have this conflict. And it is not right. There is no reason \nwhy that special-needs student should be separated out and find that \nthey are looked upon in a jaundiced way by the community, by the other \nparents, and parents conflicting with parents, the school board \nconflicting with parents.\n  The only reason it is occurring is because the Federal Government has \nfailed to live up to its obligations on this special education. We said \nwe would pay 40 percent of the cost of special education, and instead \nwe are paying 6 percent. That has created this conflict at the local \nlevel, which has placed the special needs student in a really unfair \nand inappropriate position.\n  You have to ask yourself, why do we do this? Why does the Federal \nGovernment do this? Well, it is called an unfunded mandate.\n  The first act of the Republican Congress 2 years ago was to pass a \nbill, which I helped author but which was really energized and driven \nby the Senator from Idaho, Senator Kempthorne, which said we will not \npass unfunded mandates any longer. Unfortunately, this one is already \non the books. It is the largest unfunded mandate in the education \narena; maybe outside of a couple of environmental unfunded mandates, \nthe largest unfunded mandate in the country. It has had this really \nperverse effect, both of the tax burden on the local communities and \nthe States, but, more importantly, the relationship between the \nstudents in a school system. And it is not right.\n  What we have said is we are going to correct this. We said it in the \nunfunded mandate language that we passed. More recently we made a \ncommitment, as a Republican Senate anyway, to try to redress this. As \nwe closed out the last budget year, we passed the omnibus \nappropriations bill. In that appropriations bill, at my suggestion, but \nwith Senator Lott's leadership, we put in $780 million more into \nspecial education over what had originally been planned. It does not \nget us up to 40 percent. Maybe it got us up to 7 percent from 6 percent \nor 8 percent from 6 percent, but it was a downpayment. For example, in \nNew Hampshire an extra $3.5 million coming to special needs kids toward \nthe Federal obligation. So we showed we were serious, as a Republican \nCongress.\n  Then to confirm and dot the ``i'' and cross the ``t'' and put the \nexclamation point in, we have introduced Senate bill 1. Senate bill 1 \nsays that we, as a Republican Senate, commit ourselves to getting to \nfull funding of the special education accounts in a 7-year period on a \nramped-up basis, which means that this year we need to add additional \nmoneys in the special education accounts.\n  Why does this all relate to the President's speech? It relates to the \nPresident's speech for this one very obvious reason. The President has \nproposed $43 billion in new spending on education. We have not yet seen \nhis budget to know where he is going to get this money. We do not know \nwhat accounts he is going to take the $43 billion from. We have heard \nhim say he is going to do this in the context of reaching a balanced \nbudget by the year 2002, which is our goal and our purpose.\n  Taking that at face value, that he is going to have legitimate \naccounting mechanisms and have made hard decisions for the purposes of \ngenerating these dollars, it means that a large amount of new dollars \nis being reallocated from some other accounts into the education \naccounts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 3 minutes, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. That means the President is saying, let us spend another \n$43 billion in education, new dollars on new programs. Well, how can he \nsay that when we are not paying what we have already got on the books? \nThat is the point.\n  How can we go out and put on the books new programs for building \nconstruction, which clearly is not a Federal role to begin with, new \nprograms for a variety of different initiatives in education which may \nbe only marginally in the role of the Federal Government, brand new \nprograms, when we are not paying the cost of special education, when we \nare pitting the special-education students and their parents against \nthe average students and parents in a school system, when we have \ncreated this horrendous situation in the local communities where the \nlocal school dollars are being drained off to pay for a Federal \nobligation because the Federal Government is not willing to step up to \nthe bar and make its payment?\n\n  It is wrong. What we have done is wrong. Yet now we have the \nPresident suggesting a whole new group of expenditures in education.\n  I suggest, before we step down this road of new education \ninitiatives, before we start building schools for school districts--\nsomething that is clearly not a Federal role--that we pay for what is a \nFederal role, and that we relieve this problem, and that we take out \nfrom over the head of the special-needs students the cloud that the \nFederal Government has failed to pay its fair share.\n  So I am just putting the Senate on record that I am going to work \nwith the Senate leadership and other Senators who I know feel this \nway--and there are a lot of us here who feel this way because S. 1 is a \nconsensus bill amongst Republican Senators--to make sure that, before \nwe begin any\n\n[[Page S985]]\n\nnew education initiatives, we fund the one we have on the books, we \nfund the special-needs program, and we fund it appropriately.\n  So every amendment, every proposal that comes to this floor for a new \neducation initiative will have with it, I assure you, an amendment \nwhich will say, special ed is our first obligation, the special-needs \nchild is our first obligation. Let us look to that before we start a \nnew program. Let us fulfill our obligations, before we start a new \nprogram, to the special-needs students and to the local taxpayer.\n  Mr. President, thank you for your courtesy and for the extra time. I \nyield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thank you.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Wyoming, [Mr. Thomas] or \nhis designee, is recognized to speak for up to 60 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Thank you, Mr. President. Let me assure you that I do not \nintend to talk for 60 minutes. However, we do intend to use some time \nas a special order today and will be doing this over a period of time \nto talk about issues that are important, I think, to the American \npeople and that are important to this Congress, the issues that we now \nbegin to deal with.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/05/senate-section/article/S983-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S985-S988]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. We are going to talk about the budget--not a new idea, \nbut, I suspect, the most important issue that we have to talk about, \nbecause everything else, everything else that is discussed here, \neverything else that is decided here will be a function of doing \nsomething with the budget.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire, who just finished, talked about \neducation and special education, which happens to be something that I \nam very interested in, but it is budgetary; it has to do with the \nbudget.\n  The budget has to do with more than just arithmetic, more than just a \nbalance sheet; it has to do with priorities, it has to do with fiscal \nresponsibility for our kids, and our grandkids, it has to do with \ndeciding what our direction will be in this country in terms of the \nFederal Government.\n  So, Mr. President, we want to talk about that this morning. I will be \njoined by several of my associates in the freshman and sophomore class \nwho have come together to put a focus on events, and particularly a \nfocus to try to talk about how what we do here with regard to the \nbudget in this instance has to do with where we live, has to do with \nyou and me in terms of our families, has to do with how we have the \nresources to send our kids to school and pay our bills. There is a \ndirect relationship.\n  So let me yield 10 minutes to my friend, the new Senator from \nArkansas, Senator Hutchinson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Senator. Mr. President, I rise today to \nvoice my support for the balanced budget amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution, Senate Joint Resolution 1. I speak not only for myself, \nbut I think I speak for thousands and thousands of Arkansas voters and \ntheir families who sent me to Washington with a primary goal of \nbalancing the Federal budget and getting our books in order.\n  Arkansans, like most Americans, are hard-working, decent people with \njobs and families facing constant pressure to make ends meet. Gathered \naround the kitchen table, these families, like so many others, pay \ntheir bills, attempt to budget for future expenses, and say no to the \nthings they cannot afford. They act responsibly. Also, they act with \nthe fear that a prolonged illness or unexpected job loss could push \nthem over the edge, robbing them of financial security and destroying \neverything that they have worked for and saved. America's families have \nbeen forced to live within these limits. My question to the U.S. Senate \nis, can we ask any less of the Federal Government?\n  My colleagues, we carry a heavy burden. That burden is both the \nannual deficit that we caused and the debt that we have created. As of \nFebruary 3 of this year, our national debt stood at over $5 trillion. \nWhenever I hear these numbers I have to ask myself, what does that \nnumber mean, what does it mean to me, or better yet, how can we \nvisualize numbers of this magnitude? Author David Schwartz has written \na book entitled ``How Much Is a Million?'' It is a book to help parents \nexplain large numbers to their children. Maybe it will help us as well. \nOne of his examples says, ``If a billion kids were to stand on each \nother to make a human tower, they would stand up past the moon. * * * \nIf you stood a trillion kids on top of each other, they would pass \nbeyond Mars and Jupiter * * * and almost as far as Saturn's rings.'' In \nanother case he says, ``If you wanted to count from one to one trillion \n* * * it would take you about 200,000 years.''\n  Let me take a moment to put this kind of massive debt into \nperspective for those slightly older: $5 trillion of debt translates \ninto over $19,000 for every man, every woman, and every child in \nAmerica. That is practically equal to having an additional midsized car \npayment without having a vehicle. The debt of an average family is more \nthan $72,000. That could be the equivalent of owning a second residence \nwithout being able to stay there. For a family or person who owns a \nhome, it amounts to an additional $37,000 on average tacked on to their \nmortgage, without raising the value of their home. For many young \nadults who are taking advantage of student loans to obtain a better \neducation, the national debt can ring up $2,200 in additional costs on \nthat loan. This significantly impacts the paycheck of the recent young \ncollege graduate who must make larger than anticipated loan payments at \nan entry-level salary. For those persons trying to afford a new car, \nthe national debt means the price of that car will go up another \n$1,000.\n  At the conclusion of 1 hour of debate, the 60 minutes that Senator \nThomas has reserved, 1 hour of debate on this resolution, our country \nwill owe roughly $29 million more than it did when we started the \ndebate.\n  Last night, the President advocated that we change the Constitution \nto protect victims rights, but he rejected and condemned the notion \nthat we should amend the Constitution to ensure that our Government \nlives within its means. As if we were rewriting the Constitution to \nensure a balanced budget, saying that is not a requirement, we should \nnot do that. We have the authority; all we have to have is the \ndiscipline. I will sign it; you pass it. And yet in the same speech \nadvocating that we change the Constitution to protect victims rights.\n  There are those who have said that a balanced budget amendment would \nwreck the economy. Well, business probably more than any other part of \nour economy has felt the effects of our huge national debt. Government \nhas siphoned billions of dollars in investment capital, which, in turn, \nrestricts our economy from reaching a higher growth potential. Deficits \nmake businesses compete with Government for money, causing interest \nrates to be higher than they should be. With interest rates higher than \nnecessary and private capital formation being stifled, it is quite \npossible to foresee lower living standards in the future, even in this \ntime of slow growth we have experienced.\n  National growth rates of 2 to 3 percent simply are inadequate for \nAmerica. Balancing the budget can mean an additional $88.2 billion of \ncapital investment in the first 7 years that we have a balanced budget. \nThe less money being taken by Government, the more money that is \navailable for economic development and job growth. Even more important, \nwe have seen evidence that our debt and annual deficits have restrained \nthe ability to make a better life for all of us.\n  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported that deficits have kept \nour standard of living down by 5 percent. However, if we decide to make \nthe choice to balance the budget by the year 2001, the General \nAccounting Office has stated it would lead to a 35-percent increase in \nthe standard of living. Just think what that would mean in spending \npower to middle-class Americans. A balanced budget amendment will \npropel Congress to do what legislative remedies, with such words as \n``firewalls,'' ``spending ceilings,'' and ``lock boxes,'' what all of \nthose statutory techniques have failed to accomplish since 1968. This \nmeasure will give the impetus to set goals and make priorities without \nbudget gimmicks which have characterized the process over the\n\n[[Page S986]]\n\nlast 30 years. It will make the budget process look more like what \nhappens with our families than the current situation.\n\n  For most of the history of our country, the budget was balanced. \nPermanent deficits were viewed as intolerable. Permanent deficits were \nviewed as something that was wrong. Chronic deficits were unacceptable \nnot because of the constitutional prohibition, but because of a deeply \nembedded moral belief that permanent deficits were simply wrong, a \nprinciple held by politicians and the general public alike. With the \ncreation of entitlement programs in the 1960's, the proclivity of \npoliticians to expand these popular and expensive entitlement programs \nhave gone virtually unchecked. The intolerable increase in spending has \nhad the inevitable result of persistent deficits and an ever expanding \nnational debt.\n  James Buchanan, a professor of economics at George Mason who \ntestified in 1995 before the Senate Judiciary Committee, said, ``The \nimmorality of the intergenerational transfer that deficit financing \nrepresents cries out for correction.'' He is so right. He calls it the \n``immorality of the intergenerational transfer of deficit spending.'' \nWhat he calls the ``immorality of intergeneration transfer'' is nothing \nless than one generation stealing from another generation. The \nfundamental moral code of our Judeo-Christian tradition says ``thou \nshall not steal.'' That sets the standard. Every time we as a \nGovernment spend one dollar that we do not have, we are stealing from \nour children.\n  From the establishment of the Republic, our Founders saw public debt \nnot only as immoral but as the principal threat to the survival of our \nrepresentative democracy. James Madison said, ``I go on the principle \nthat a public debt is a public curse and in a republican government, a \ngreater curse than any other.'' George Washington, in his farewell \naddress, called the accumulation of debt ``ungenerously throwing upon \nposterity the burden of which we ourselves ought to bear.''\n  Indeed, the War of Independence was fought over the principle of \ntaxation without representation. The Founders also knew that deficit \nspending would impose exorbitant tax rates on coming generations to pay \nfor the debt accumulated by our own conspicuous consumption.\n  My colleagues, this is the ultimate taxation without representation. \nWhen we immorally steal from our children, from our grandchildren, \nensuring that they are going to face ever increasing levels of taxation \nwithout the right to have any say about it today, Mr. President, the \ntime has come for us to stop stealing from our children and stop the \nchronic deficit spending by the adoption of a balanced budget amendment \nto the Constitution, sending it to the States for ratification. We must \ndo it now.\n  I thank Senator Thomas for yielding.\n  (Disturbance in the visitors' galleries.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The gallery is reminded not to display \nexpression of approval or disapproval.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arkansas.\n  It seems to me that is a very important aspect of this business of \nbalancing the budget. It is not only a mechanical matter, it is not \nonly a fiscal matter, it is a moral matter, and whether or not we have \nthe responsibility to balance the budget and pass on to our kids \nsomething that is as good as we had.\n  Certainly the economics of it are very important, the economics in \nterms of the amount of interest we pay and all those things.\n  But it is a moral imperative that we be responsible for what we are \ndoing. If we are going to buy it, we have to pay for it. That is a \ngreat concept. I thank the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Let me now yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Ohio, Senator DeWine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague and friend from \nWyoming.\n  I rise today also to support the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. There is no doubt about the need for a balanced budget. \nWe all agree on the huge benefits that will accrue to America if we put \nour fiscal house in order.\n  To begin with, it would stave off a horrible catastrophe. Mr. \nPresident, if we do not establish a balanced budget and if we choose \ninstead to continue on our present course, by the year 2012, the whole \nbudget is going to be eaten up by entitlements and by interest on the \nnational debt. There will be absolutely no money in the domestic \ndiscretionary budget for investment in the future of our children--no \nmoney, zero. No money for Pell grants, no money for student loans, no \nmoney for National Institutes of Health research, none of the things \nthat really are an investment in our children, our grandchildren, and \nour great grandchildren. This alone is good enough reason to balance \nthe budget--to avoid a social and fiscal disaster.\n  Mr. President, there will also be a huge positive benefit from a \nbalanced budget. According to the latest estimates from the \nCongressional Budget Office, a permanently balanced budget could make \nour country 25 percent richer by the year 2030. That is outstanding \nnews. That's why so many Americans are very happy to see the signals \ncoming out of the budget process that we may be getting close to an \nagreement on a balanced budget. That would mean a better future for \nAmerica. It's that simple. We all agree on this.\n  But the question we have to ask ourselves now is: Do we need to write \nthis practice of budget balancing into the Constitution of the United \nStates? Some might contend that our recent success at reducing the \ndeficit proves that a constitutional amendment is unnecessary. Some may \nsay and may tell us that if it's not broken, we don't need to fix it.\n  Mr. President, that may seem to make sense on the surface, but that \nargument flies in the face of history. It doesn't make sense when we \nconsider the fact that it has taken the Congress 27 years to make the \nlimited progress we are seeing today--27 years. It took 27 years, Mr. \nPresident. The last time the Federal budget was balanced was in 1969. \nMy wife Fran and I were graduating from Miami University in Ohio in \n1969.\n  So of all the arguments against the constitutional amendment, the \nargument that it's easy enough to balance the budget is certainly one \nof the weakest. No, Mr. President, our decision on the balanced budget \namendment has to be based on a much more fundamental criteria. Indeed, \non a matter of conscience.\n  The question all of us have to ask ourselves is simply this: How \nimportant is a balanced budget? Does it rise to the level of a \nconstitutional principle? In other words, is it a fundamental component \nof what we want to be as a nation? This is a question we all have to \nanswer for ourselves, reflecting on our own deepest values, as well as \nthose of the people who sent us here to make the decisions.\n  My decision is based on the America I want my children and my \ngrandchildren to inherit a nation bound by its fundamental law to pay \nits bills on time, to avoid pulverizing future generations with a \ntowering national debt; in simple terms, Mr. President, an America that \nsays no longer are we going to borrow from our children and \ngrandchildren so we can live better today.\n  In my view, Mr. President, that is as close to a bedrock principle as \nwe can find in political life. I believe it must be in the \nConstitution. I believe history tells us that it has to be in the \nConstitution. That is why I believe, for my family, for the people of \nthe State of Ohio and future generations, as well as the present \ngeneration, we must pass the constitutional amendment and send it out \nto the States.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio. You hear \nthese arguments, and almost no one would disagree with the notion that \nwe need to pay the bills. Few would argue with the idea that it is \nirresponsible for us to leave it for someone else to pay later. Yet, it \nhas been 1969 since we have had a balanced budget. There is a \nlegitimate argument to be addressed that we must be flexible if there \nis a war or a disaster. There has to be some movement, as there is in \nyour family. But the fact is that we haven't done it.\n\n[[Page S987]]\n\n We have not done it. So we need to make some difference. You can't \nexpect to change things if you continue to follow the same course. That \nis precisely what has gone on here.\n  So we have an opportunity now, for the first time in some time, to do \nwhat I think most people believe ought to be done. You might ask why \nare the freshmen and sophomores particularly doing this this morning, \nand doing it as a focus on issues throughout the year? I think it is \nbecause we are the ones who have most recently gone through the \nelections, who have most recently been to Greybull, WY, and small towns \nin Ohio. We know that people want to balance the budget. We know that \nthe folks where we come from say, ``Look, we have to be fiscally \nresponsible, and our State has a balanced budget amendment. We have to \ndo that stuff, and it works.'' Furthermore, we want some control of the \ngrowth in Federal Government. We don't want it to grow exponentially. \nWe want it to be under control. Everyone in this place says, ``Yes, I \nam for a balanced budget, but I don't want to do anything that would \ncause us to have to do that. I don't want any discipline applied.'' I \nthink that is the issue that we are coming upon, the issue we will deal \nwith. Do you want a balanced budget? Yes. How do we get there? Just do \nit. Well, that doesn't work, and it hasn't worked for some time.\n\n  So that's what it's all about and where we are. We are talking about \na process to cause us to do the things that almost unanimously we would \nchoose to do. Mr. President, I am glad to be joined by the Senator from \nKansas to talk a bit about the balanced budget.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the senior Senator from \nKansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Wyoming for \nrecognizing me for this opportunity. This is my first opportunity to \nspeak, as well, on the U.S. Senate floor. It is a tremendous honor, \nprivilege, and responsibility to do so. I am delighted to be speaking \non the U.S. Senate floor for the first time about balancing the budget \nand about the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, which I \nfeel is basically very important and critical for future generations. \nNow is the time for us to act and to address not just the financial \nhealth of our country, but also the freedom of our children and \ngrandchildren, by passing the balanced budget constitutional amendment.\n  The U.S. Constitution is not only the foundation of our country, but \nalso the standard bearer of our worth as a principled nation. The \nConstitution has guaranteed and defended the freedom of the American \npeople. The balanced budget amendment is necessary to protect and \ndefend that freedom for future generations.\n  But we must act now to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution \nby giving it the strength it will need to continue protecting and \ndefending the American people. The balanced budget constitutional \namendment will protect our families, our children--my children, Abby, \nAndy, and Liz--and our future from the excesses of a government which, \nfor much of this century, has shown its contempt for the integrity of \nour people by equivocations and false assurances. Deficit spending must \nstop, and the budget must be balanced. Right now, as I speak and as we \nhave heard several speakers just before me speak on the U.S. Senate \nfloor, our Federal debt is at an astounding $5.3 trillion, which means \nthat every American--every man, woman, and child--in this country owes \ntoday over $19,000 per person. They can't just pay that off and say, \n``I am done with my share of the Federal debt.'' It keeps growing and \ngrowing. This is wrong. It is immoral and must stop.\n\n  Opponents of the balanced budget amendment will try, and have tried, \nto frame this debate in terms of fear. The Keynesian apostles will tell \nthat you the economy will collapse in tough times. But the debate over \nthe balanced budget constitutional amendment should not and must not be \na debate framed in fear and falsehoods. It is really a debate about \nhope and about the future, and ultimately about the American dream.\n  That is why I believe that good Government is not sustained by the \npolitics of cynicism and fear. Quite to the contrary, it is sustained \nrather by the honest desire of each individual to work for that which \nhe believes to be right and just. The balanced budget is both right and \njust.\n  It is right because it means an end to the days of reckless \nGovernment spending when politicians made pork barrel promises that \nadded too little to the public good and too much to the public debt.\n  The balanced budget amendment is just because it helps our families \nand protects our children by curbing the practice of tax and spend. It \nis just because it means an end to the hidden tax that our Government \nlevies every year when it fails to balance its budget and pay down its \ndebt.\n  It is a moral imperative, as some of my colleagues have spoken to, \nthat we balance the budget and that we give ourselves the tools we need \nto balance the budget. How will future generations judge us if we have \nnot the moral wherewithal to abolish the shameful practice of enslaving \nour children to the reckless desires of our bloated Federal Government? \nThe system of burdening our children with the full cost of our present \nconsumption is a great crime. We must not hesitate to bring it to an \nend.\n  One of the most insidious aspects of the budget deficit is that it \namounts to a hidden tax on our income and on our children's future \nincome. This hidden tax is felt by everyone who has taken out a loan to \npay for school, buy a car, or purchase a home. Higher interest rates \nare the taxes levied by a government that has not the courage to live \nresponsibly, or even honestly. By balancing the budget, we will pay \ndown the debt and we will free future generations from the shackles of \nGovernment debt. But we will do much more than free future generations.\n  A balanced budget will draw down interest rates, spurring new \ninvestment decisions, and increasing our gross domestic product. Lower \nunemployment and higher productivity is not the empty promise of a \ncampaign season, it is the real promise of a constitutional amendment \nto balance the budget.\n  Yet, the ivory tower has railed against the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment because it would mean the end to unlimited \nGovernment deficit spending. The effects of a balanced budget promise a \nbrighter future not only for our children and grandchildren but for \nourselves as well. By eliminating the hidden tax on our American \nfamilies, a family could easily save over $1,500 per year. A balanced \nbudget will produce that savings. Estimates by the Joint Economic \nCommittee indicate that yearly savings on an $80,000 home mortgage \nwould be over $1,200, and a student fresh out of school paying back a \ncollege loan would save about $180 per year because of the resultant \nlower interest rates. American families and children are already taxed \ntoo much. They are taxed to the max. They, more than anyone else, \ndeserve a break.\n  The balanced budget amendment is right in principle and in practice. \nIn fact, it was Jefferson in 1816 who acknowledged, ``Public debt is \nthe greatest of the dangers to be feared.''\n  As I said frequently during my campaign for the U.S. Senate, which \nwas just completed and which placed me in this body with the gracious \nwill of the people of Kansas, I believe that we are each placed on this \nEarth for a reason and for a short season. I believe that the task of \nour generation is to renew the American culture and to restore \nresponsible Government and the promise of the American dream to the \npeople.\n  We must act now. And in this matter of balancing the budget, we must \nact now and pass the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the senior Senator from \nWyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I thank my friend from Kansas and welcome him in his \ninitial visit to the floor. I am sure he will be back many times, and I \nhope that is the case.\n  Mr. President, we have now an opportunity. I am optimistic about it. \nWe all heard the President's State of the Union Message last night. He \nlisted a great many things that he is interested in. Certainly most of \nthem are positive\n\n[[Page S988]]\n\nkinds of things that, in one way or another, we want to work with as \nwell.\n\n  So we listened to the President. We listened to the voters. We \nlistened to the American people. And now we are ready to work on some \nsolutions toward really all of America.\n  There is a plan soon for the congressional leadership to visit with \nthe President, to sit down and talk about a number of things. Balancing \nthe budget is one. Improving education, certainly, to move more and \nmore education toward local communities and parental involvement; to \nprovide some permanent tax relief so that we can increase investments, \nso that we can increase jobs, and so that we can increase the ability \nof families to prepare for themselves. Much of that is affected by what \nwe do. What we do about interest rates that have a direct impact on the \nbudget has much to do with what we do with this debt, a debt of $5.5 \ntrillion, the interest upon which will become, if not this year, soon, \nthe largest single line-item in the budget--$275 billion in interest, \nnone of which is used for education, none of which is used to fight \ndrugs, and none of which is used for investment--interest on the debt \nthat we accumulate.\n  Mr. President, I am excited that the President of the United States \nsaid to us last year that the ``era of big Government is over.'' He \nsaid that the Government is not the answer to everything, that we need \nto be responsible, that we need to be responsible to ourselves as \nindividuals and citizens. Certainly, that is true. We need to be \nresponsible as a Government, and we need to be responsible as people \nwho have been sent here to deal with the budget--about physical \nmatters.\n  So that is what we are dealing with, two things: One is balancing the \nbudget and being responsible; and then having the ability, which we \nhave not had for 28 or 29 years, of doing it, and how do we change \nthings to cause that to happen? We believe that it is the balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution, which provides, as it does in \nWyoming, Mr. President--as you well know just coming from the \nlegislature there--a requirement as a legislature and the Governor not \nto spend beyond its revenues. It works. Many other States have the same \nkind of thing.\n  So we have heard for some time from our voters and our constituents \nthat they want smaller Government, a Government that is more efficient, \nand a budget that is balanced. We have heard from the President that he \nis ready for a smaller Government, that the era of big Government is \nover.\n  We will see his budget, I think, tomorrow, and that will be when the \nrubber really hits the road. It is not just talking about it, but doing \nit. We will be sharing that responsibility with the President to do \nthat.\n  There will be all kinds of suggestions as to how a balanced budget \nought to be changed. There will be some scare tactics saying it is \ngoing to ruin Social Security. If you want to protect Social Security, \nyou need to balance the budget. I am one who believes that we ought to \nhave a Social Security net for the elderly. I want to continue it. I do \nnot want to see it run out. The same is true with Medicare. The best \nway to do that is to balance the budget. If we do not do that, we will \nnot have money to do any of those kinds of things.\n  So we will hear a lot about it. We need a budget that is honest. We \nneed one that is out there not one that is backloaded, where it looks \ngood for a couple of years and all of a sudden for somebody else it is \npiled up at a very high rate. We need one that is honest and \nforthright. We do not need gimmicks. We do not need to move things from \none place to another. We do not need to trigger it so that it takes \nover in a certain way. We do not need budgets that have tax relief in \nit for a little while and then they go away. We need some real honest \nbudgeting so that everyone is confident in understanding that that is \nwhere we are.\n  I hope each of us remembers the impact it has on everyone at home. \nInterest rates could be lower. Debt for kids to go to school could be \nless. Borrowing on our homes, borrowing on our cars, these are all \nrelated. This is not an abstract thing that belongs in somebody's \naccounting book. This is not for accountants and CPAs only. They affect \neach of us where we live. Families pay $1,500 a year easily on mortgage \npayments. So these are the kinds of things that we are doing.\n  So I think all of my associates welcome the President's commitment to \na balanced budget. We certainly look forward to his ideas and to how \nthat budget will work as he releases it tomorrow. But most of all, I \nthink we need to take the responsibility to make the changes that have \nto be made, and now is the time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed in \nmorning business for as much time as I consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have had ample discussion this morning \nabout a wide range of public issues, discussion about the President's \nState of the Union Address, and a discussion about the agenda before \nthe Congress. I wanted to comment on a bit of that, and then begin a \ndiscussion about the constitutional amendment to balance the budget, \nwhich the Senate will shortly take up.\n  First the general issues. I do not think there is a difference \nbetween folks who serve in this body on Government or the size of \nGovernment. I mean, I don't think there is a case where one side says, \n``We want bigger Government.''\n  I don't want a bigger Government. I want a better country, and there \nare some circumstances under which the requirement for schools and \nroads and other things that we do together in Government are necessary. \nI want us to improve the things we do in Government. But there are \nthings that are important for us to do together in Government.\n  Part of the agenda that we discuss, part of the reason for us being \nin a U.S. Senate, is to decide what to do together to make this a \nbetter country.\n  Provide for the common defense? Yes, we do that. We have a Defense \nDepartment. We created it, and we fund it. We ask men and women in \nuniform to go out and help preserve this country's liberty and put \ntheir lives on the line to do so. That is part of Government.\n  Roads, schools, research in health care at the National Institutes of \nHealth, the Coast Guard, and so much more--we do those things together. \nWe should do them well. We should make sure they contribute to a better \ncountry and achieve the goals and objectives that we have for those \nfunctions.\n  Some come to the floor and they say: Our objective is less \nGovernment, balance the budget, two or three other things, and that's \nall. My objective is this: I want better schools for our kids in this \ncountry, and we can do that and we should do that. And I want better \npaychecks for workers in this country.\n  That has always been the legacy of what we fight for, a country in \nwhich workers might expect that they will have more opportunity, more \njob security, more advancement, their children will have more income \nand better opportunity and better educations.\n  I believe we ought to have good health care in our country, and that \ndoes not come by accident. At the turn of the century you were expected \nto live to be age 48; 100 years later you are expected to live to \nnearly 78. Is that magic? No. Massive research in health care in this \ncountry has developed breathtaking new medicine, breathtaking new \nprocedures so that those with cataracts now get surgery and see, those \nwhose heart muscles get plugged now get open heart surgery and live, \nthose with bad hips get their hips replaced and are out of the \nwheelchair and walk. Good health care.\n  We don't see people getting on airplanes, leaving America to find \ngood health care elsewhere. Our health care system is the envy of the \nworld. By accident? No. Wonderful men and women working in health care, \nand a substantial amount of research, especially\n\n[[Page S989]]\n\nGovernment sponsored research, have allowed these breathtaking \nbreakthroughs to occur.\n  Safe streets? We want safe streets and safe neighbors. That deals \nwith crime. That responds to police and security, the kinds of things \nthat we also do in Government.\n  Restoration of values? Yes, that is of interest. Really, not so much \nGovernment, but we all ought to care about it and work together on it.\n  It starts in the home, the community, the neighborhood, the family. \nAnd a balanced budget? Absolutely. We ought not spend beyond our means.\n  So better schools, bigger paychecks for workers, good health care, \nsafe streets, a sound defense, restoration of values, balancing the \nbudget--all of these things are things that we think can make this a \nbetter country and we ought to work on together.\n  It is interesting to me that in the context of the balanced budget, \nwe really also will have to talk about priorities. As we balance the \nbudget--and we should--what are our priorities? What is important and \nwhat is not important? What do we invest in and what don't we invest \nin?\n  For instance, do we build the star wars program? Do we build a \nprogram that will cost well over $100 billion, a program that many say \nis not needed? Do we build that and then say we do not have enough \nmoney to expand the Head Start Program for early intervention for kids?\n  These questions are examples of the choices we must make. We must \nchoose priorities that we want to develop. That is precisely what the \nCongress must be about: making choices, some of them very hard.\n  I want to make one point as I begin talking about the constitutional \namendment to balance the budget. I am not someone who believes that we \nhave made a lot of wrong choices in this country. I have heard people \nstand on this floor and talk about shame on the last 50 years in this \ncountry, shame on us, this country somehow has gone down the wrong \nroad. What an awful place, we hear.\n  I tell you, this country remains the beacon of hope for the rest of \nthe world. I traveled in six countries in November, and one of the \nrefrains I heard everywhere I went was they would like to come to \nAmerica. They like America. America is opportunity. America is freedom. \nAmerica is still a beacon of hope.\n  We can dwell on the negative, and we have plenty of challenges and \nthere are negatives, but look at the positives as well. This country is \na remarkable country, with a remarkable economy and a market system \nthat provides great jobs and great opportunity for a lot of people.\n  I agree with those who say there is no social program in this \ncountry--none--that is as important as a good job that pays well. There \nis no social program as important as a good job that pays well. And \nthat's why our economy and the market system that we have had has \nperformed so well and helped us create a country that grows and \nprospers.\n  As I said, we have lots of challenges, but part of why this has all \nhappened is we have made a lot of right choices. We decided that we \nwere going to have a substantial system of universal education for \nvirtually anyone who wanted it. What happened?\n  What happened was we led the world in virtually every area of \ntechnology and achievement. Who stood people on the Moon? The United \nStates of America. How did that happen? It happened because massive \ninvestments in education unleashed the potential, the technology, the \nunderstanding and the knowledge that allowed us first to fly and then \nto fly to the Moon. And that has been true in virtually every other \narea of our life. Yes, space, technology, walking on the Moon, but \nhealth care, and in virtually every other area as well.\n  We have made all kinds of decisions about what we do in all of these \nareas, and some of them have been great decisions. Let's have a Head \nStart Program. Let's invest in young kids. Let's build the best system \nof colleges in the world--in the world. No one else comes close to us. \nWe have done all these things--including building up our national \ndefense. There is no other military in any country that parallels ours \nor matches our strength.\n  So it is time for us to understand a bit about what we have built, \nthat this is a remarkable achievement.\n\n  Where do we go from here? We can undercut all of those achievements \nand weaken this country substantially if we don't balance our budget. I \nagree with that. We ought to balance the Federal budget. I will say \nthis, that I am one of those in 1993 who cast a very controversial \nvote, and the vote cut spending and increased some taxes. It carried by \none single vote, and since that time, the unified budget deficit is \ndown 60 percent.\n  I am pleased I did it. Was it an easy vote? No. The political vote \nwould have been to say, ``No, I don't want to do any heavy hitting.'' I \ndid it because it was the right thing for this country. Controversial, \nyes, but right. We made some progress in reducing the Federal budget \ndeficit, but it is not enough, and we must do more to balance the \nbudget. The debate will be about changing the Constitution to balance \nthe budget.\n  Let me say that I am someone who will support a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget. Do I think it is a great choice? No, \nnot necessarily, but do I think it probably is a reasonable choice, \ngiven the need for fiscal policy discipline in our country? Yes. But I \ninsist that it be done the right way, not the wrong way.\n  I have been in the room where they wrote the Constitution of the \nUnited States, and for those who want to visit it, George Washington's \nchair still sits in front of the room. Fifty-five of them wrote a \nConstitution over 200 years ago. Some here think it is a rough draft. \nEvery second day they want to make a change in the Constitution. I, \nfrankly, don't see a lot of folks who can represent Madisons, Masons, \nor Franklins these days. So if we are going to change the Constitution, \nwe need to think it through.\n  We are going to have a proposition on the floor of the Senate that \nsays, let us amend the U.S. Constitution to require a balanced budget. \nAnd it says that for describing when a budget is in balance, all \nspending and all revenue will be considered to determine whether the \nbudget is in balance.\n  The dilemma with that is this: In 1983 this country recognized it was \ngoing to have a difficult time with Social Security in the long term \nbecause America was growing older and there were going to be more \npeople retiring relative to people working to support them in Social \nSecurity. So we decided that we would do something different for a \nchange. We would begin saving in the Social Security system. In other \nwords, each year taking in more in Social Security revenue than we need \nto expend, and that money would then be saved so that when the baby \nboomers retire after the turn of the century, we could more easily \nafford to pay them the benefits they will have earned.\n  I was involved in that decision. I was on the House Ways and Means \nCommittee, and I cast a vote in support of that legislation. But the \ndecision was not to increase payroll taxes and accrue a body of savings \nso that someday later somebody can misuse it to claim they balanced the \nbudget with Social Security trust funds. That is not what we said. We \nsaid, let's increase savings so that savings will be available after \nthe turn of the century.\n  When you describe a balanced budget proposal that says let's take \nSocial Security trust funds and throw them over here to use the surplus \nto show we balanced the budget, I want to show you what happens. What \nhappens is the very year in which the budget is balanced, according to \nthe majority that is supporting this constitutional amendment, the very \nyear in which they claim the budget of the United States is in balance, \nFederal debt will rise in that year by nearly $130 billion.\n  Question: If the Federal debt is increasing by $130 billion in a \nyear, is the budget in balance? If the budget is in balance, why would \none have to increase the Federal debt?\n  Answer: Because the budget isn't in balance. They pretend it is in \nbalance, they say it is in balance, but they use the Social Security \ndedicated trust funds to make it look like it is in balance, but it is \nnot. The Federal debt will continue to increase.\n  The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has put out a report that \nI hope my colleagues will read. In it they describe exactly this \ndilemma. The constitutional amendment that is going to\n\n[[Page S990]]\n\nbe debated, and I will address this matter again during that debate, is \nan amendment that offers no choice. It says we will take the Social \nSecurity trust funds and use them as an offset for other revenue and \nclaim we balanced the budget, when we really have not.\n  We will give our Senate colleagues an opportunity to vote on another \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. It is one that does it \nthe right way. It says let us balance the budget. Let us require in the \nConstitution that we balance the budget. But let us do it exclusive of \nthe Social Security trust funds because we promised that we would save \nthose trust funds for the future when they are needed.\n  This publication by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities \ndescribes chapter and verse of exactly what is happening in this area. \nI have heard people come to the floor and say, ``Oh, what a bunch of \nprattle that is. What a bunch of nonsense, these folks worried about \nSocial Security.'' Well, it is not prattle, and it is not nonsense.\n  We had a column by Mr. Krauthammer in the Washington Post last week. \nIt is the third column he has written on this subject. In it he says \nessentially what he has said before. He says, there is no Social \nSecurity trust fund. There is no Social Security trust fund.\n  Let me suggest a tour to him in Parkersburg, WV, where, under armed \nguard, the bonds that are the securities of the Social Security trust \nfund exist. It would not be too long a drive for him to go on up there \nand take a look at those bonds.\n  He is wrong. There is a Social Security trust fund. The dilemma is \nthat there will not be anything there of meaning unless we decide to \nmake the right choice here.\n  Mr. Krauthammer also says that Social Security is a pay-as-you-go \nsystem. He must have missed 1983, because in 1983 it was decided that \nit will be more than a pay-as-you-go system. It was decided in 1983 \nthat we would collect more money than is necessary in current years, \nspecifically in order to accrue a surplus. Social Security is more than \na pay-as-you-go system. So, when Mr. Krauthammer says it is pay-as-you-\ngo, he clearly does not understand the law and clearly does not \nunderstand what the Congress did to save some money.\n  Let me read for him and for others something from the 1983 commission \non Social Security because they described exactly the plan. This is a \nquote by commission member Robert Ball in testimony before the House \nWays and Means Committee talking about separating the Social Security \nsystem from the operating budget.\n\n       Only by such a separation can it be made unmistakably clear \n     that Social Security decisions are being made for reasons \n     internal to [Social Security] and not for the purpose of \n     making a unified budget look better. Since Social Security \n     funds can be used only for Social Security benefits and to \n     pay for the cost of administration, I believe that separation \n     is also better accounting practice.\n\n  The point is, the increase in taxes and the other things that were \nnecessary to accrue this surplus in Social Security will all be \nobliterated by a decision to enshrine in the Constitution a practice of \nmisusing the Social Security trust funds.\n  Mr. Krauthammer does not like this problem. He says, well, this \ndebate is without substance. I can only say that his argument is \nwithout substance. He is flat, dead wrong on this issue, demonstrably \nwrong. And he ought to know it. The minimum amount of research would \ntell him that.\n  The same is true of colleagues here who have taken three lines of \ndefense offered at different times by different people.\n  One will pop up like one of these little carnival games and will say, \n``Well, first of all, there is no Social Security trust fund,'' and \nmake a long, windy argument about it, and then sit down.\n  Then someone else will pop up at another moment and say, ``All right, \nthere is a Social Security trust fund, but we are not misusing the \nmoney,'' and then vanish.\n  Then a day later someone else will pop up and say, ``All right, there \nis a Social Security trust fund, and we are misusing the money, and we \npledge to stop doing it by the year 2008.''\n  Those are the three stages of denial I have heard on the floor of the \nSenate, all from supporters of a constitutional amendment that would \nenshrine in the Constitution the practice of taking Social Security \ntrust funds, using them as an offset against other revenue, and \nclaiming you have balanced the budget at the same time that the Federal \ndebt will increase by $130 billion the year they claim the budget is in \nbalance.\n\n  There is a way to solve this. A way to solve it is to vote for a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget that does not use or \nmisuse the Social Security trust funds. I will offer it, along with my \ncolleagues, Senator Reid, Senator Hollings, Senator Ford, Senator \nFeinstein, and others, and we will give people an opportunity to say, \n``Yes, I support a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, but \nwhen we do it, let us make sure we really balance the budget.''\n  Let us make sure we keep the promise of accruing the surpluses in the \nSocial Security trust fund and make sure that no one is able to misuse \nthe Social Security trust fund in the future.\n  Mr. President, there will be much more to discuss on this subject. I \nwanted to make note of the piece that Mr. Krauthammer did because it is \nthe third time that he has essentially written the same piece, \nmisunderstanding the issue in this country.\n  Everybody has a right to be wrong. I do not quarrel with that.\n  I just say that someone got up this morning and went to work. That \nperson will work hard all day, and then collect a paycheck and discover \nthat part of that paycheck is taken away first. The part taken away is \ncalled Social Security taxes, and it is promised by the Government to \nthe worker that the amount of money we took from your paycheck is going \nto be put in a fund, and it is a fund dedicated for one purpose, Social \nSecurity. That worker does not deserve to have someone in Congress now \nsay, ``Oh, but we changed our mind. That's the premise under which we \ntook it from you, but we're using it for another purpose.'' That is \nprecisely what is happening today. I think we ought to stop it. There \nis a way to stop it when we have these votes in the coming days or \nweeks.\n  We can amend the Constitution the right way, or we can, as is usually \nthe wont around here, mess around some more, talk and talk some more, \nand claim and claim some more that we have really done something worthy \nand meritorious and have balanced the budget, and then have some \nconstituent stand up in a town meeting some night, somewhere, and ask \nyou, ``Mr. Senator, if you balanced the budget, why did my son or \ndaughter just inherit a Federal debt that went up $130 billion this \nyear?'' I want to be in the room with a microphone to record the \nresponse because there is not a response that is adequate.\n  What our constituents should expect from us is that we balance the \nbudget the right way and that we amend the Constitution the right way. \nI hope at the end of this debate this Senate and this Congress will \nhave determined to do that.\n  It is not just a few Democrats who believe this is a serious problem. \nSeveral dozen Republicans over in the House of Representatives, some of \nwhom I have talked to, make exactly the same case in the House of \nRepresentatives. So it is not a one-sided issue. We have Republicans \nand Democrats who believe that there is a right way and a wrong way to \ndo things. Some of us are going to insist that when we do something as \nsignificant as amending the U.S. Constitution that finally we do it the \nright way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I want to spend a few minutes commenting \non some of the points the President made last night in his State of the \nUnion Address. I was particularly impressed and encouraged about his \ndecision to make education the centerpiece of that speech and his \ndecision to make education the first priority of his administration \nthis next 4 years.\n  One aspect of what he talked about in education, I think, is \nextremely important, and that is standard setting. We have had debates \nin Congress for many years now about the issue of standards. In fact, I \nintroduced legislation in 1990 to establish national standards in \neducation, and, of course, we are continuing to pursue that through the \nNational Education Goals Panel, which I serve on along with Senator \nJeffords.\n  I am persuaded that part of what the American people would like to \nsee in their educational system is higher standards and more \naccountability. They want to be sure that teachers are performing to a \nhigh standard, students are performing to a high standard, and the \nparents of children in our public schools want to know where their \nchildren stand relative to other students around the country, around \ntheir State, and in general.\n  The President in particular talked about how he was going to work \nthrough the Department of Education to adapt two widely used high-\nquality tests--the fourth grade NAEP reading test, the National \nAssessment of Educational Progress, which is already being used in more \nthan 40 States, and the now-familiar eighth grade math test, the TIMSS \ntest, which recently confirmed how poorly many of our students are \ndoing relative to the achievement level of other nations.\n  The President proposed adapting those two tests into a new test that \nwill be available free of charge to every student, every school \ndistrict, and every State in the Nation that wishes to participate in \nit. This is going to be done in the next 2 years.\n  I think this will be a major step forward, because what it will do is \nto allow us to give very hard, objective information about which of our \nschools are succeeding and which of our schools are failing. We have \nthe anomalous situation that, because of our inability to track \nperformance, we have in many school districts and major cities in the \ncountry some schools that are doing superbly and other schools that are \ndoing miserably. Parents, unfortunately, sometimes do not even know \nwhich of those two schools their children are in.\n  For this reason, we need to give parents clear indications of which \nschools are doing the best job in educating students. Currently, we \nhave a hodgepodge of different tests, a hodgepodge of different \nstandards around the country. Parents who are interested in finding out \nhow their children are doing often are misled by inaccurate \ninformation. So I very much commend the President for this initiative \nto adapt these two well-recognized tests into something which each \nstudent can take, each parent can understand, each school can \nunderstand. I think that will be a major step forward.\n  Let me also talk about another aspect of the standards issue, which \nthe President, I hope, will also move ahead on very aggressively, and \nthat is the teaching of advanced placement courses. Many of us are \nfamiliar with advanced placement courses because of our own children \ngoing through high school. These are courses that are taught in the \n11th and 12th grades, generally to students who are planning to go on \nto college and who want to get advanced credit so they can avoid taking \nthe same course once they get there.\n  We have not done what we should at the national level to encourage \nStates and school districts to expand instruction in advanced placement \ncourses. I believe this year, for the first time, we will see a change \nin that. I hope to see the President, in the budget we receive \ntomorrow, requesting some funds to assist low-income students in the \ncost of taking those advanced placement courses and tests. That, I \nbelieve, would be another major step forward.\n\n  I had the chance to speak to the New Mexico Legislature on Monday of \nthis week, and I talked to them about the challenge that my State faces \nin expanding access to advanced placement classes. These courses should \nbe available to all students. They are highly demanding, but any \nwilling student can succeed in them.\n  Many people know about the advanced placement program because of a \nmovie that came out several years ago called ``Stand and Deliver.'' \nThis was a movie that Edward James Olmos starred in. It was the story \nof Jaime Escalante, a high school calculus teacher, I believe in \nGarfield High School in east Los Angeles. He had become very famous in \nthat school and in that school district because of his success in \nteaching students, many of them students without a good academic \ngrounding. He would teach those students this advanced placement course \nin calculus.\n  The reason he became famous and the reason that movie was made was \nnot because he was teaching any old calculus course. He was teaching a \ncourse that was an advance placement course so that anybody in the \ncountry who paid attention would know that was a high-quality course. \nIf his students in east Los Angeles passed that course, they were every \nbit as good as any student in Manhattan, or Ohio, or in New Mexico, or \nanywhere else. So they got the recognition that they deserved. He got \nthe recognition that he deserved. They were very proud of their \nachievement.\n  I have believed for a very long time that one reason our school \nsystem falls short is that we expect too little of our students. We \nhave low expectations for what our students can learn, what our \nchildren can learn. The truth is, if you expect very little, you will \nreceive very little. We need to expect higher performance by our \nstudents, higher performance levels by our teachers, and through this \nadvanced placement set of courses we do exactly that.\n  New Mexico lags behind the national average fairly significantly in \nthe per capita rate of 11th and 12th graders who take advance placement \ncourses. In my State I think the percentage is something like 24 \npercent. Nationally it is 40 percent. We need to do better than that. \nWe can do better than that. We are setting about working with the \nbusiness community and our State legislature to bring together the \nresources to expand the training of advanced placement teachers and to \nexpand course work in advanced placement courses.\n\n  I think one other point needs to be made. It should be obvious to \neverybody. You are not going to bring about a major reform of \neducation, a major improvement and upgrading of education, without a \nvery major program to reeducate and develop the human capacity to do \nthat. We need to have training courses for our teachers in the summer. \nThese advanced placement courses are very good. But, unfortunately, too \nfew teachers are able to take advantage of them, or do take advantage \nof them.\n  So we need to think seriously in this Congress about what we can do \nto support the retraining that is needed to get people to these higher \nstandards that the President is talking about. This is an essential \npart of the agenda that we need to confront over the next couple of \nyears.\n  I commend again the President for his leadership in putting this on \nthe front burner for the country. I hope we, in Congress, are up to the \ntask of following his lead. I think he has identified a very important \npriority for our country. It is the one that I hear the most about.\n  I get around New Mexico a lot, and people want to know why we can't \ndo a better job of educating kids in this country. I hope that we can.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Yes. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I was interested in the Senator's statement. He, I think, \nidentifies one of the priorities of many of us in this Congress. If we \ndo not make an investment in education of America's youth then the \ncountry does not have much of a future. I am enormously proud of what \nwe have done in\n\n[[Page S992]]\n\nthe investment in the Head Start Program, for example. This does not \nstart in grade school or high school or college. It starts in the early \nintervention years with Head Start. The Head Start Program we know \nworks. It produces enormous dividends. It gradually improves the \nopportunity of young people who come from difficult circumstances.\n  But one of the things that it seems to me we should invest in is safe \nschools. First of all, if the school is not safe and the students feel \ninsecure, they cannot learn. And the other ingredient is a teacher who \nknows how to teach--a good teacher, a student willing to learn, and a \nparent who cares. If any one of those are missing, it does not work \nvery well.\n  But let us talk about the safe school issue first. The Senator from \nNew Mexico I know heard me describe on the floor a bill which I \nintroduced late last year on this issue. If I might, with the \nindulgence of the Senator from New Mexico, I would like to describe \nagain a circumstance that exists that I am trying to correct dealing \nwith safe schools in New York City.\n  A young boy came into a school with a loaded pistol in his belt and a \njacket covering his loaded pistol. He went through the school, walked \ndown the hallway to his classroom, and a security guard identified or \nsaw the bulge in the young 16-year-old's jacket and apprehended this \nyoung boy and took a loaded pistol from this young fellow. A loaded \npistol with this young fellow walking down the school hallway; the \nsecurity guard removes it. It goes to court and goes to a disciplinary \nproceeding. The result of it all was that the court said the \nexclusionary rule applied to the disciplinary proceeding and the \nsecurity guard had no right to search that kid and take the gun away.\n  When I read that I thought, ``Can this be right? Could anybody use \nthat kind of strange thinking to conceive of that kind of decision?''\n  You go to the airport and get on a plane going to New Mexico or North \nDakota. They will run you through a metal detector because they say, \n``You can't get on an airplane with a gun. We will not allow it.'' But \nit is OK to go through a school hallway to a classroom with a loaded \npistol with a 16-year-old. I do not think so. That does not make any \nsense to me.\n\n  So I introduced legislation dealing with that issue. The exclusionary \nrule, my eye. A 16-year-old and a loaded pistol--I want a security \nguard to take that pistol away in a schoolroom because my kids and \nyours and all of the kids in this country deserve to be safe in school.\n  That is the first element: Safety in school.\n  The second is what the Senator from New Mexico is talking about: \nDirecting investment into programs that we know work and we know yield \nsignificant returns. He talked about good teachers, and the President \ntalked about attracting and keeping good teachers in our classrooms. \nNothing could be more important than that because we send our kids to \nsomeone else most of the day. We place them in their hands. I have been \nin a school that the Senator from New Mexico has. He knows some of \nthese teachers. I leave that school thinking, ``Wow, this is an \nincredible person. What a job they do with these young kids.'' There \nare times when perhaps you find something that you think isn't quite \nright. The President addressed that last night.\n  But the key, it seems to me, is matching the three things: First, a \nteacher who really knows how to teach; a kid who is willing to learn; \nand a parent who cares about that kid's education and is with that kid \nat the end of the day before they go to bed at night, reviewing the \nhomework. All of those elements come together to make an educational \nsystem work.\n  But the Senator from New Mexico is right. We need in this country at \nthe State and local level and at the Federal level to decide that the \neducation of our children is a priority for us because educating our \nchildren is an investment in our country's future.\n  I really appreciate the statement which the Senator from New Mexico \nmade.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I appreciate, Mr. President, the statement of the \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  Let me just add one other element to this. I commend him for his \nproposal to deal with the problem of someone coming into school with a \ngun and no one being able to apprehend him. I am also persuaded that \nvirtually everything we want to see happen better in our schools will \nbe facilitated if we recognize that we need to have smaller classrooms.\n  Much of the crime, discipline, and absentee problems in our schools \ntoday are because the schools are too large and because the teachers do \nnot know the students by their first names. The students don't feel \naccountable to their peers. We put 40 kids into a class and wonder why \nthe teacher can't teach all of them. We put 2,000 or 3,000 kids in a \nhigh school and wonder why the principal can't keep track of everybody.\n  There have been some very good studies done that show that the \noptimum size for a high school, for example, is somewhere between 600 \nand 900 kids, and that when you go over 900 the quality of the \nstudents' performances start dropping, the discipline problems start \nrising, and the incidence of criminal problems start rising. We need to \nfactor this issue into what we do as well.\n  Of course, we in Congress don't make the laws that govern the size of \nthe schools, and we should not. But we need to encourage States and \nlocal school districts to take that into account when they decide to \nbuild a new high school. You don't necessarily need to tear down the \nold building. You can take an existing complex and break it into two or \nthree high schools just as well as leaving it in one 3,000-person high \nschool.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield further, Mr. President, I was \nin a school recently called the Ojibwa School on an Indian reservation \nin North Dakota. When the Senator from New Mexico talks about \nconstruction, the President last evening talked about our trying to \nprovide help to State and local governments with respect to school \nconstruction. I can tell you that in the Ojibwa School, and others that \nI have visited, there is a significant need for some construction, some \nmaintenance, and some repair. I worry very much that these little kids \non that Indian reservation going to this school are going to be in \nsignificant trouble some day because the repairs have not been made. \nThat school is not a safe school. We have report after report and \ninvestigation after investigation. Now we have another one going on. \nBut we very much need to invest in the infrastructure of these schools.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is right. We do not run the schools, and \nshould not. Local school boards should run the local schools, and the \nStates are involved largely in the State judgments about what the \ncurriculum is, and so on. But we can marginally help in a range of \nother ways and do Head Start and college. We also can help in the kinds \nof things the President recommended in providing some resources for \nschool construction in areas where you need to have some additional \nconstruction to repair and bring up to standard some of our schools.\n  Again, I say finally, the question around here is always a question \nof choices: What is your priority?\n  Two years ago, I was on this floor talking about the strange sense I \nhad when I looked at a budget document offered and actually passed--it \nwas subsequently vetoed--which said let us double the amount of money \nwe spend for star wars and let us cut by half the amount of money we \nspend for Star Schools. Star Schools was not a very big program, but it \nwas a really interesting program--directed investment to try to help \ncertain people. I just thought that was a strange priority. But the \npriority I hope for all of us is to find some way to advance the \nopportunity to improve our schools in this country for the future of \nthis country.\n  I appreciate the Senator from New Mexico yielding.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I appreciate the Senator from North Dakota and his \ncomments.\n  Let me say one other thing and then I will yield the floor, Mr. \nPresident. I was on a radio interview program earlier this morning, and \none of the reporters, who is a very knowledgable reporter, said to me, \n``The President said we ought to increase funding for education by 20 \npercent. That is a very major increase. Can we afford that kind of an \nincrease given the budgetary constraints on us?''\n\n[[Page S993]]\n\n  My response was that you have to look at this in the context of the \noverall Federal budget. In the overall Federal budget, we spend \nsomewhere near 1.5 percent on education, which represents less than 10 \npercent of overall spending by States and localities. So what the \nPresident is saying is that we ought to spend 1.8 percent, or \nthereabouts, on education. Most of the people I talk to in New Mexico \ndo not think that is excessive. I think it is not unreasonable for the \nFederal Government to give education that high a priority.\n  So I hope very much we follow the President's lead. I hope very much \nwe will make education the centerpiece of our efforts here in this \n105th Congress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. President, it was with great sadness that my wife and \nI learned this morning of the death of a dear friend of over two and \none-half decades, Pamela Harriman, our country's Ambassador to France.\n  As I said, for the better part of about 25 years, Pamela and Averell, \nfirst of all, were friends and two people who encouraged me early on in \nmy political life when I first ran for office. Later, after her husband \nAverell passed away, Pamela continued to extend that hand of friendship \nto me, my wife, and our family.\n  I remember when I first came to Washington as a freshman Congressman \nin 1975, I was amazed at how Pamela Harriman and Averell at that time \nopened up their home to younger Members. I know a lot has been made \nabout how the movers and shakers of the world were always at Pamela \nHarriman's house. But it was not just them; she always made sure her \nhome and house was open to the new people who came to Washington. She \nwas constantly promoting and encouraging young people, young Members of \nCongress, new people who were here, to showcase their ideas, to \nencourage them, to push harder and to climb up the ladder. So I \nremember her very fondly for the encouragement and support that she \ngave this Senator in my early years of seeking public office.\n  During the last decade, the 1980's, Pamela Harriman was always there \nin our party, the Democratic Party, trying to rebuild and to encourage \npeople to seek public office. As I said, she was always encouraging the \nformulation of new ideas and approaches. I think our party owes her a \ngreat debt for all that she did to encourage these younger people and \nto keep us pulled together during the decade of the 1980's. During the \nPresidential election of 1992, she was very active in helping then \nGovernor Clinton gain the White House.\n  For the last 3\\1/2\\ years, Pamela Harriman served this country \nhonorably and well and I think with great distinction as our Ambassador \nto France. As I have had occasion to travel overseas, I have heard, on \nmany occasions, from individuals in different parts of Europe about \nwhat a great representative of America Pamela Harriman was. She was \nindeed that.\n  Pamela Harriman was always proud of her British ancestry and \nheritage. She was even more proud of the fact that she was an American. \nShe was always undeniably gracious to all who came within her reach. \nShe was always open to new ideas, as I said, of the younger people \ncoming into Government and politics. She always found time to give \nencouragement, help, and support.\n  So it is a sad day for our country, for all of her friends, and for \nall of those of us in the Democratic Party who looked to her for help \nand support for so many years. Ruth, my wife, and I extend our deepest \nsympathies to the Harriman family. I just want to say that Pamela \nHarriman indeed left a very indelible mark, not only in the city of \nWashington, not only on the Democratic Party, but indeed on the United \nStates of America. She will be greatly missed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, may I inquire what the current order of \nbusiness is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business.\n\n\n                 WELCOMING FORMER SENATOR ALAN J. DIXON\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I note the presence of a colleague and \nfriend on the floor, the former Senator from Illinois. We are pleased \nto have him come back and visit us. I just want to take this \nopportunity to tell him how much we appreciated his service and how \nmuch I enjoyed serving with him on the Senate Armed Services Committee. \nI hope he is doing well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/05/senate-section/article/S993-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S993-S994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       AMBASSADOR PAMELA HARRIMAN\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to honor the life and legacy of \nAmbassador Pamela Harriman. She was a gallant and courageous lady--and \na very dear friend.\n  Pamela Harriman lived a full and exciting life. We all know of her \ngrace and her charm. But she was so much more.\n  She was, for me, first of all a good friend. She and I worked \ntogether on issues and politics for many years. She was a tremendous \nsupporter of women candidates, and I often turned to her for her \ninsight and counsel. I will always treasure the memory of my last visit \nwith Ambassador Harriman. She helped me to work with European space \nagencies--to foster better links with our space program. She was, as \nalways, perceptive and enthusiastic about the prospect of greater \ncooperation between America and Europe.\n  She wanted to make a contribution to our political system. She \nbrought together leaders from all sectors of society to discuss a wide \nrange of important issues. She fostered the kind of civil political \ndiscourse that is so often lacking.\n  Ambassador Harriman had the kind of strong patriotism that comes from \nbeing born in another country--and from witnessing first hand what \nAmerica did during the Second World War. She often talked about living \nthrough the Battle of Britain--and how America's military partnership \nhelped the\n\n[[Page S994]]\n\nBritish people to keep their morale high. She loved her adopted \ncountry--and she served it with great honor.\n  She was one of our Nation's most effective ambassadors. During a \nperiod of prickly relations with France, she was able to reassure the \nFrench of the importance of our friendship and alliance.\n  The French liked and trusted her. She knew the language, the people, \nand the country. She respected their history and their culture. The \nFrench honored her with their highest cultural honor--the commander of \nthe Order of Arts and Letters.\n  Mr. President, Ambassador Harriman's sudden death was a tragedy. But \nher life was a triumph. Her family is in my prayers. I will miss her \ndeeply.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/05/senate-section/article/S993-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Madam President, I strongly support S. 122, the Stop Tax-\nexempt Arena Debt Issuance Act--let me say that again--the Stop Tax-\nExempt Arena Debt Insurance Act--a measure that has been introduced by \nSenator Moynihan. This bill would amend title I, section 141, of the \nInternal Revenue Code by closing a tax loophole that has been \nbeneficial to a select few individuals: owners of professional sports \nteams. For the average taxpayer, however, it is nothing more than \nprofessional sports welfare.\n  Provisions of the 1986 Tax Reform Act were supposed to prevent \nprofessional sports teams from building sports facilities with tax-\nexempt bonds. Under the law, professional sports teams are categorized \nas a private entity, and, as such, the issuing of private activity \nbonds is taxed. However, due to clever maneuvering, professional sports \nteams have circumvented the intent of the law by encouraging State \ngovernments to issue governmental bonds, which are exempted from \nFederal taxes, for the purpose of constructing large sports facilities. \nWhile such a tactic is technically legal, professional sports teams \nowners have manipulated the law for their own personal gain.\n  Many large metropolitan areas have attempted to lure professional \nsports teams to relocate by offering generous incentive packages, \nincluding the construction of new stadia. Many of the proposed \nfacilities cost in excess of $225 million. The Congressional Research \nService has reported that the Federal share for a $225 million stadium \ncould be as high as 34 percent. In plain monetary figures, that is $75 \nmillion over the lifetime of the stadium--$75 million that might better \nbe spent and more usefully spent on benefits for the Nation, like books \nfor our schools, safer roads and bridges for commuters, and more police \nto keep our streets safer. Madam President, the list is endless. \nInstead, the Federal Government receives no tax revenue, and money that \ncould have been spent on these other, more deserving programs, is \nwasted, in my opinion.\n  I commend my colleague, Senator Moynihan, for offering S. 122. I \nagree with his desire to close this tax loophole that is mainly \nbeneficial to a few select and wealthy individuals. In this time of \nfiscal austerity, the Federal Government cannot afford to subsidize \nsuch programs. S. 122 seeks to preserve the intentions of the 1986 Tax \nReform Act by ensuring that professional sports teams do not use--\ndirectly, or indirectly--Federal funds for the construction of their \nsports facilities. I have nothing in particular against sports or \nsports teams.\n  I just think America has its values standing on their heads when it \nputs sports ahead of the development of the minds, the intellects of \nyoung people. But that is a discussion for another day. Professional \nsports in the United States is a lucrative and financially healthy \nprivate industry. It does not need this kind of public Federal subsidy \nwhile so many other pressing needs are feeling the slash of the budget-\ncutter's pencil.\n  S. 122 is equally important for another reason. By seeking to prevent \nprofessional sports teams and localities from circumventing the obvious \nintentions of the 1986 tax law, S. 122 illustrates how complex our Tax \nCode has become. For far too long, tax loopholes, such as those \ncontained in Section 141 of the code, have reduced the fairness and \nefficiency of our Tax Code. They are as leeches draining the health and \nequity of the U.S. tax code. These tax expenditures--that portion of \nour budget that proceeds for the most part on automatic pilot--have not \nbeen subject to the same level of scrutiny as have other forms of \nfederal spending. This must change.\n  Madam President, in fiscal year 1995, total tax expenditures--or \nloopholes--reduced Federal revenues by approximately $500 billion, an \namount equal to nearly one-third of the entire Federal budget. Clearly, \ntax expenditures need further scrutiny, and, where they are deemed to \nbe outdated or unnecessary--or unnecessary--they need to be repealed. \nBy identifying and correcting one of these wasteful tax loopholes, \nSenator Moynihan has introduced S. 122. It represents a step in the \nright direction.\n  Madam President, I thank my colleague, Senator Moynihan, for his \nleadership. And I thank Senator Hatch for allowing me the privilege of \ngoing forward at this time. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/05/senate-section/article/S994-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, today we begin one of the most important \ndebates that has ever taken place in the U.S. Senate or in the Congress \nof the\n\n[[Page S995]]\n\nUnited States. The subject matter goes to the very heart of our \nFounding Fathers' hope for our constitutional system--a system that \nwould protect individual freedom through the maxim of limited \nGovernment.\n  In the latter half of this century, however, the intentions of the \nFramers of the Constitution have been betrayed by the Congress' \ninability to control its own spending habits. The size of this Federal \nleviathan has grown to such an extent that the very liberties of the \nAmerican people are threatened.\n  I just stood at a press conference with our Democratic cosponsors of \nthis amendment, and there was a huge table filled with unbalanced \nbudgets since 1969.\n  History was made in the 104th Congress when 300 of our courageous \ncolleagues in the House of Representatives, both Democrats and \nRepublicans, approved a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. \nUnfortunately, the same measure was defeated in this Chamber by one \nsolitary single vote.\n  This year we begin a new Congress following an intensive fall \ncampaign in which people in every State across this Nation made \nunmistakably clear their insistence that we put our fiscal house in \norder. The eyes of the people, now more than two-thirds of whom favor a \nbalanced budget amendment, now turn to us to follow through on our \npromises.\n  I am pleased to be joined by 61 of my colleagues, including every \nRepublican Senator in the U.S. Senate and 7 bold Democrats who have \ndone exactly that in sponsoring Senate Joint Resolution 1, the balanced \nbudget constitutional amendment. Madam President, as we begin the \ndebate on Senate Joint Resolution 1 proposing an amendment to the U.S. \nConstitution to require balanced annual Federal budgets, I want to \nsummarize why I feel this amendment should be added to the basic great \nlaw of this great Nation.\n  Let me say that as a lifelong student of the Constitution and having \nserved on the Judiciary Committee in this body during my tenure here of \n20 years, I do not lightly suggest amending our founding document. Yet, \nall other avenues having failed us, I believe it appropriate to take \nrecourse to our basic charter to rein in an abused power of the purse--\nas has been done in similar situations in our history since the Magna \nCarta--in order that we might save future generations from the heavy \nburden of irresponsible Government borrowing.\n  Madam President, let me just summarize the reasons I believe the \nproposed balanced budget amendment should be presented to the States \nfor ratification. We have to have a two-thirds vote in both of the \nbodies and submit this amendment to the States, and we have to get \nthree-quarters of them to ratify the amendment before it can be entered \ninto the Constitution. It is a tough process. It ought to be a tough \nprocess.\n  These are some of the reasons why I believe this amendment should be \npresented to the States for their ratification:\n  No. 1, integrity and accountability. It will bring immediate \ncredibility to our current budget process and negotiations, and it will \nrestore a measure of integrity and accountability to our Government.\n  No. 2, our children's future. Passing the balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment is a vote for our children's economic freedom.\n  No. 3, family financial security. Passing the balanced budget \namendment will improve the economic health and stability of all \nAmerican families.\n  No. 4, economic strength. The stabilizing effect the balanced budget \namendment will have on the economy is clear, and it will enable us to \nrein in the level of our country's foreign-held debt.\n  No. 5, retirement security. If we pass this balanced budget \nconstitutional amendment it will literally save Social Security. It \nwill stabilize the economy which will benefit all current and future \nretirees. Without it, all of these programs will be placed in jeopardy.\n  Now let me describe these reasons in more detail. On the issue of \nintegrity and accountability, our national debt is rocketing out of \ncontrol and the American people are paying a very heavy price for it. \nAs you can see by this chart, the debt was relatively stable for many \ndecades, up to about 1970, a little bit before 1970. In recent years \nthe debt has increased at alarming rates under the watch of both \npolitical parties. The fact is, our deficits have been structural and \nthey will not be eliminated in the long run without the discipline of a \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment.\n  They really shot up in the 1980's, right on through the 1990's, and \nstill that arrow is going almost straight up, even today, even with the \nefforts and actions that have been taken.\n  Since 1978, there have been no fewer than five major statutory \nschemes or regimes enacted which promised to deliver balanced budgets, \nand these include Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. But there has not been a \nsingle balanced budget since 1969, which was the only balanced budget \nsince 1960.\n  While I support the steps we have taken to pass the balanced budget \nplan, I question whether, without the weight of a constitutional \nrequirement to balance the budget, we will achieve balance by the year \n2002. Without a balanced budget amendment, every year Congress has to \nact, and we have seen the lack of will to do what's right around here. \nFor this reason, I feel passage of the balanced budget amendment is \ncritical.\n  Let's just acknowledge what every American citizen knows. In recent \ndecades, Washington has been biased to spending, without feeling any \nconstraints by the amount of money it actually has on hand. Washington \nhas lost the habit of prioritized spending options. Any ideas with \npolitical appeal get enacted regardless of cost. We borrow the money if \nwe run short. That is what we have been doing for most of the last 60 \nyears. Those listening could try this thinking on their own budgets at \nhome. Buy any item that looks appealing next time you are at the mall. \nJust put it on the card. What happens to your budget? Something like \nthis chart probably, but hopefully not quite so high.\n  Washington, however, is not as constrained as the average American. \nWashington spends in this way, and when the bill comes, it signs the \ndebt over to the American people. In addition to paying their own \nbills, the American people have to pay Washington's bills in the form \nof higher taxes, of course, and accumulated debt. They also pay them in \nthe form of higher interest rates on their homes, their cars, or \nstudent loans. They pay in the form of lower job growth, lower wages, \nand they even pay in the form of decreased services from the Government \nbecause more of the budget is being spent on interest rather than on \neducation, health care, job training, child care, the environment, et \ncetera.\n  The point is that Americans are getting fed up with Washington \nbecause they feel the pinch put on them by Washington's spendthrift \nways. They know they have to make hard choices about how they will \nspend their own money, but they feel that Washington does not feel \nconstrained to make hard choices about spending priorities. It's not \neven Washington's own money that it's spending so freely; it is the \nAmerican people's money. No wonder the American people are tired of it.\n  Besides being dismayed by Washington's free spending habits, the \nAmerican people also believe that Washington is not accountable for its \ndecisionmaking. The balanced budget amendment responds to both of these \nconcerns. On this chart is the actual text of the balanced budget \namendment before the Senate at this time. This balanced budget \namendment will require Washington to make tough choices about spending \npriorities within the constraint of the amount of money it has, or it \nrequires Members of Congress to go on record for its borrowing and \ntaxing decisions. There will be no more voice votes when it comes to \nraising taxes. There will be no more voice votes when it comes to \nraising the deficit. You are going to have to stand up and vote. This \namendment will see to that. It also requires Congress to achieve some \nmeasure of increased consensus about spending priorities if it is going \nto finance that spending by borrowing.\n  The concept is simple: Don't borrow, unless a significant number of \nMembers are willing to go on record as saying this spending is such a \npriority that we must borrow to do it. That would go a long way toward \nletting Americans know that their Government is deliberating about its \nspending\n\n[[Page S996]]\n\nhabits, making choices among competing options, and only spending \nbeyond its means when it really needs to in order to achieve a goal so \nimportant that a supermajority of Members could agree. The balanced \nbudget amendment will go a long way toward restoring the people's faith \nin the integrity of our budget process and in the accountability of \nWashington for its decisions.\n\n  A vote for the balanced budget amendment is a vote for integrity and \naccountability in Washington.\n  Now, our children's future. Our national debt now tops $5.3 trillion. \nThat averages out to about $20,000 in debt for every man, woman, and \nchild in America. That is what our fiscal insanity has brought us to. A \nchild born in America today comes into this world $20,000 in debt--and \nthat is going up. Do we have the right to spend our children's future \nfor our own comfort today?\n  Over time, the disproportionate burdens placed or imposed on today's \nchildren and their children by a continuing pattern of deficits could \ninclude some combination of the following: Increased taxes, reduced \npublic welfare benefits, reduced pensions and Social Security benefits, \nreduced benefits or expenditures on infrastructure and other public \ninvestments, diminished capital formation, diminished job creation, \ndiminished productivity enhancement and less real wage growth in the \nprivate economy, higher interest rates, higher inflation, increased \nindebtedness to and economic dependence on foreign creditors, and \nincreased risk of default on the Federal debt.\n  Madam President, I have said this in the past. This is ``fiscal child \nabuse'' and it must end. It is our children's future versus \nWashington's spending addiction. I hope the Senate of the United States \nwill come down overwhelmingly on the side of our children's future by \npassing this amendment.\n  A vote for the balanced budget amendment is a vote for our children's \neconomic security.\n  Now, what about family financial security? It is not just our \nchildren that we hurt with these outrageous deficits. We are \nsuffocating our own families. The impact of higher interest rates, \nhigher taxes, lower wage and job growth, and higher mortgages are felt \nat kitchen tables all across America. The Concord Coalition has \nestimated that the interest payments on our mountainous debt amount to \n$5,360 a year for a family of four. Just to pay the interest against \nour national debt, it's $5,360 a year.\n  Chairman Kasich of the House Budget Committee has pointed out that \nthree of the causes of the ``middle class squeeze''--high taxes, \ncounterproductive Government spending policies, and anemic wage \ngrowth--are at least partly caused by continued borrowing by the \nFederal Government. He points out that the baby boom generation pays \ntaxes that are at least 50 percent higher than those paid by their \ngrandparents. Real per hour wages inched up just one-third of 1 percent \nannually over the past 4 years, which is one-seventh the rate of growth \nin the period between 1960 and 1974, and productivity over the past 4 \nyears grew at only one-fifth the rate of that same period. Economist \nLester Thurow noted that the one-earner middle-class family is extinct \nand explains that almost one-third of all men between the ages of 25 \nand 34 make less each year than is required to keep the average family \nof four above the poverty level. These combined pressures tear at the \nvery fabric of our Nation and our families.\n  By contrast, implementing the balanced budget amendment will lower \ninterest rates, making it easier for our families to pay their \nmortgages, their car loans, and their student loans. Economist at DRI-\nMcGraw-Hill estimate that a balanced budget rule would result in a 2-\npercent drop in interest rates. Now, DRI-McGraw-Hill is one of the best \neconometric groups in the country. A balanced budget rule would mean \nannual savings of $1,230 on a middle-class family's home mortgage, $216 \neach year for an average student loan, and $180 each year on the \naverage car loan.\n  The good effects of our overall economic health will help family \nbudgets in many other possible forms, such as a higher paycheck, more \njob opportunity or security, lower taxes in the future, and a greater \nability to save and invest for the future. The Joint Economic Committee \nhas estimated that the average American family would have an additional \n$1,500 a year if we implemented a balanced budget rule. A balanced \nbudget amendment will make it easier for American families to afford a \nhouse, a car, or to send a child to college. This offers a real way to \nrelieve the pressure on American families who are struggling to stay \ntogether and get ahead. A vote for the balanced budget amendment is a \nvote for the economic health and stability of American families.\n  Now, economic stability. Economists from all over this country agree \nthat the balanced budget amendment should pass. They agree that ``we \nhave lost the moral sense of fiscal responsibility that served to make \nformal constitutional restraints unnecessary.'' Hundreds of economists \nsupport the balanced budget amendment as being good for the national \neconomy by increasing both investor and business confidence, both \nforeign and domestic.\n\n  Some economists are against us on the balanced budget amendment. As a \ngeneral rule, they are academics who depend upon the Government in many \nways for their moneys and in many respects love the spending practices \nof the Federal Government. Not all--some sincerely worry about the \namendment. But there are also many, many who worry that if we do not \npass the amendment we are really going to be in trouble, and economic \nstability will be threatened.\n  If the Government would stop borrowing so much money, interest rates \nwould come down and money would be available for businesses to invest \nin creating jobs and paying higher wages. The Director of the \nCongressional Budget Office, June E. O'Neill, has testified recently \nthat ``balancing budget will induce favorable changes in the economy,'' \nand among those favorable changes she specifically pointed to \n``interest rates, economic growth, and the share of GDP represented by \ncorporate profits.'' All of this can put real money in the pockets of \nreal people, including small business owners and employees.\n  CBO Director O'Neill has also suggested that taking action now to \nbalance the budget can assure greater budgetary stability in the \nfuture. Greater budget stability means greater tax stability. And that \nmeans that Americans, and their families, and the businesses they own, \ncan plan for the future better, with less risk that shifting tax policy \nwill wipe out their plans in unforeseen ways. At the very least, this \nwill save Americans substantial amounts on tax attorneys. But long-term \nplanning, with less risk from shifting tax policy, can pay dividends \nthroughout the economy.\n  Decreasing our dependence on debt to finance Government activities \nwill also increase our national economic sovereignty. Interest payments \non our debt are increasingly leaving the country. This chart, based on \nTreasury Department statistics, shows that from 1992 to 1995, the \nportion of our debt held by foreign interests has increased 28 percent. \nThat is money that leaves the United States, thus weakening our \nnational economy, and perhaps slowly jeopardizing our national \nindependence. It has been said, ``It is tough to get tough with your \nbanker.'' The less we borrow from foreigners, the less dependent we are \non foreigners, and the more independent we will be as a nation.\n  By returning honesty to budgeting, the balanced budget amendment will \nimprove our economy and our economic independence.\n\n\n                          retirement security\n\n  The balanced budget amendment is important to current and future \nretirees.\n  This is a very important chart because this chart is based on the \nSocial Security trustees' intermediate projections. As you can see \nhere, while we run modest yearly surpluses until the year 2015--down \nhere is the 2015, and the green shows the moderate surpluses above \nzero, we get to 2015. The long-term projections are mammoth annual \ndeficits--the red line--mammoth annual deficits that start about the \nyear 2015, if we are lucky. That is assuming a rosy economic picture \nover the next 19 years. The long-term projections are for mammoth \nannual deficits projected at current dollars at as much as $7 trillion \nfor today's children when they retire.\n\n[[Page S997]]\n\n  The word ``trust'' in the Social Security trust fund refers to the \ntrust retirees repose in the Government to meet its future obligations. \nWe will be hard pressed to meet our obligations if we do not get our \ndebt under control now and force ourselves to avoid the growth of debt \nin the future. The balanced budget amendment will force and empower us \nto meet these future obligations.\n  In addition, the economic benefits of the amendment will benefit \ncurrent and future retirees who are increasingly relying on private \nfinancial investments for retirement security. There are 34 million \nhouseholds that have invested in the stock market in some form. As \nfinancial expert Jim Cramer notes, if you have a pension, it's likely \nthat it's invested in stocks. If you have a 401K plan, it's probably \ninvested in stocks. Worth magazine's Ken Kurson points out that in \n1996, 34 percent of households headed by someone under 35 had some sort \nof mutual fund. Simply put, many Americans are relying less on \nGovernment and more on themselves and their own investments for their \nretirement security. The balanced budged amendment will strengthen the \nmarkets and the investments these Americans are relying on.\n  No matter the source of retirement security, the balanced budget \namendment will benefit current and future older Americans.\n  Some have argued that we should take Social Security out of the \npurview of the balanced budget amendment. They argue that we should \ntake the highest items in the Federal budget and the most important \nitem in the Federal budget out of the budget because they think that \nmight protect Social Security. Give me a break. That is not going to \nprotect Social Security. It is going to jeopardize it, because what \nhappens is that if we take it out now, even the President has admitted \nthat you cannot balance the budget by the year 2002 if you do not keep \nSocial Security in the total unified budget.\n  So it is a gradual way that we get there, and if we get there, then \nSocial Security will be much more stable. When we get to these years \nwhen it starts to drop off, we have to take care of it, and, frankly, \nwe have to do it within reasonable constraints and do it right.\n  The fact is that some argue that we should keep Social Security in \nthe amendment until the year 2003 and then all of a sudden take it out \nwhen all of these deficits occur. The reason they want that is so they \ncan keep spending. As far as everybody knows, if we take Social \nSecurity out of the purview of the balanced budget, we would be \ncreating the biggest loophole in the history of this country and they \ncould spend anything they want by simply labeling it Social Security.\n  Madam President, this scares me to death. It is true. These are the \ntrustees' estimates here. That is assuming a fairly rosy economic \npicture. If we hit a recession or depression during this period of \ntime, it is going to be worse. And the deficits might actually start \nbefore then. But that is the best analysis that we can get at this \ntime.\n  Madam President, only the force of the Constitution can balance out \nthe incentives for irresponsibility that dominate the Congress, and \nonly the balanced budget amendment can save this country from being \nswallowed in debt.\n  A vote for the balanced budget amendment is a vote for a stronger and \na freer future for all Americans.\n  When we began this debate, we had at least 68 Members of the Senate \nwho committed and promised that they would vote for this amendment. We \nneed 67. So we believe the votes should be here. We believe people are \nhonorable and will honor their commitments when they ran for office and \nwhen they appeared before their families and friends and voting \nconstituents within their respective States. They all knew at the time \nthat this was the only amendment we could possibly pass. They all knew \nat the time that this is a bipartisan consensus amendment brought about \nby both Democrats and Republicans, and that we have worked for over 20 \nyears on this amendment. They all knew at the time that this was the \none time in history when we could really get this done. And I hope we \ndo. I believe we will because I believe our fellow Senators will live \nup to the word that they gave to their constituents.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I wonder if I could ask the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Utah a question. Shall we vote now?\n  Mr. HATCH. We would be happy to do it, if the Senator wants to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Shall we call the roll?\n  Mr. HATCH. Sure. That would be fine with me.\n  Mr. LEAHY. It would be fine with me.\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not think it would be fine with that side, but it \nwould be fine with me.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I suspect that you probably have at least one leader on \nthat side who might not be in favor.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will clear the way.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Why not talk with him while I give my opening statement to \nsee if we want to do that.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let us let everybody say what they want to say about this \non both sides, and at a reasonable time we would like to----\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator would like to this afternoon----\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to do it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Why not talk with him.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will.\n  Mr. LEAHY. And see if it could be cleared here, too.\n  Madam President, last night in his State of the Union Address, the \nPresident of the United States spoke of the difference between taking \naction to balance the Federal budget and the political exercise of \nconsidering a constitutional amendment on balancing the budget. I \nmention this because the American people know there is a big difference \nbetween talking about a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, \na big difference between talking about what you might or might not do, \nand actually doing it. Here is what President Clinton said.\n\n       Balancing the budget requires only your vote and my \n     signature. It does not require us to rewrite our \n     Constitution. I believe it is both unnecessary and unwise to \n     adopt a balanced budget amendment that would cripple our \n     country in time of economic crisis and force unwanted \n     results, such as judges halting Social Security checks or \n     increasing taxes.\n\n  Listen to what the President said. Balancing the budget requires only \nthe vote of the Congress and his signature.\n  This from a President who in the 22 years I have been here is the \nonly President who has brought the deficit down 4 years in a row--the \nonly President who has done that. In fact, if we were not paying the \ninterest on the deficits run up during Presidents Reagan and Bush \nadministrations, we would have a surplus today and not a deficit.\n  In fact, I believe he is probably the only President in my lifetime, \nRepublican or Democrat, who has 4 years in a row brought the deficit \ndown and certainly the only one since the last President, a Democrat, \nwho had a surplus. That was President Johnson. Deficits have run since \nthen, and only President Clinton has brought them down four times in a \nrow and is about to submit a budget which will bring the deficits down \nfor the fifth time in a row.\n  That is a record which certainly in modern times, certainly the \npostwar time, no President, Democrat, or Republican, has done and is a \nmarked contrast to the two Republican Presidents who preceded him who \ntripled the national debt, who took all the debt from 200 years and \ntripled it in just 12 years.\n  So President Clinton is committed to signing a balanced budget that \nprotects America's values, honors our promises to seniors and our \nveterans and fulfills our responsibilities to the disadvantaged and the \nyoung. If this Congress, the 105th, will join him for the good of the \nNation and the future, we can, in fact, be the Congress that finally \nbalances the budget.\n  Madam President, I would like to be part of that Congress, and I \nwould like to see Democrats and Republicans work together to bring \nabout that kind of a balanced budget. But that would mean each one of \nus, every man and woman in this body and every man and woman in the \nother body, will have to stand up and cast votes that are politically \nunpopular--not a vote that sounds very popular but does not cut a \nsingle program and does nothing to balance the budget.\n\n[[Page S998]]\n\n  My good friend from Utah has talked about the public opinion polls \nthat say how popular a balanced budget is. I support a balanced budget. \nI voted for more deficit reduction than most of the Members of this \nbody. But wanting it and voting it can be sometimes two different \nthings. It is easy to stand up, as we all do, in town meetings back \nhome and say we want a balanced budget. It is very difficult to come \nback and face special interest groups on the right and left and say we \nare going to cast votes to achieve balance.\n\n  This is not one of those tough votes. This proposed constitutional \namendment is unnecessary, it is unwise, it is unsound, and it is \ndangerous.\n  First, it demeans our Constitution. It will destabilize the power \namong our three branches of Government. That balance of power between \nour three branches of Government gives this, the greatest and most \npowerful democracy in history, its greatest protection. It would head \nus down the road to minority rule and undermine our constitutional \ndemocracy. It would likely result in a shifting of burdens, \nresponsibilities and costs to State governments. Whether my own State \nof Vermont, the State of Maine, the State of Utah, or any other of the \n50 States, these State governments are ill-equipped to assume the vast \nburdens of the Federal Government.\n  Both because of what it would do and what it would not accomplish, \nadoption of this proposed 28th amendment to the U.S. Constitution would \nbe wrong. Treasury Secretary Rubin testified that the proposed \nconstitutional amendment would ``subject the Nation to unacceptable \neconomic risks in perpetuity. It would be a terrible, terrible mistake \nfor this country.''\n  Treasury Secretary Rubin commands the highest respect of both \nRepublicans and Democrats and certainly within the financial community, \nand when he speaks of the unacceptable economic risks in perpetuity we \nought to stop and listen to him. We should also listen to the 11 Nobel \nlaureates in economics who joined 1,000 other economists who condemn \nthe proposal as unsound and unnecessary. It is what the Los Angeles \nTimes calls a false political star.\n  Now, there are responsible ways to reduce our budget deficit, but \nfocusing our attention on this proposed amendment only delays us from \nmaking progress on what are some very tough choices. This is the same \nold sleight of hand that we have witnessed around here since 1982 when \npeople began voting for a constitutional amendment on the budget rather \nthan to vote to balance the budget. A lot of people stood up to say, \n``Yes, I voted to amend the Constitution to balance the budget.''\n  Hurrah, hurrah, how brave they are, but they cannot quite step up \nhere and vote on these tough issues that actually do balance the \nbudget. There is no magic in the proposed constitutional amendment. The \nmagic is hard work. Reducing the deficit will take hard work, and it \nwill require hard choices.\n  Some may even use a ``feel good'' vote for this proposed amendment as \nthe excuse to sit back and await the ratification process in the \nStates, and then they would sit back and await the consideration of \nimplementing legislation. Then they would sit back and await the \nconsideration of budgets consistent with such implementing legislation. \nThen maybe, just maybe, they would start making the necessary cuts.\n  Madam President, it is like some of the people who stand on the floor \nof this body or the other body and say that we have to amend the \nConstitution and have term limits. There are those who stand up and \nsay, ``I have been arguing for term limits for 20 years,'' some who \nhave been arguing term limits before some of the Members of this body \nwere born, and they will keep on into the next century saying we have \nto have a constitutional amendment for term limits.\n  I heard one Member of the House, who has been here, I think, 14 \nterms, say, ``If I do nothing before I leave here, we are going to get \nterm limits--if it takes me another 14 terms to get term limits.''\n  What makes more sense, instead of looking for bumper sticker \namendments and bumper sticker politics, is to cast votes that will cut \nthe deficit now. Do not wait until the next century. I want to continue \nto lower the deficit now, not wait for two more election cycles to pass \nbefore balancing the budget sometime after the year 2002, which, \nincidentally, is the earliest date this amendment could be effective.\n  We showed in the last two Congresses we could make progress in \nundoing the mistakes of the deficits-building decade of the 1980's \nwithout having this proposed amendment in the Constitution. For the \nfirst time since Harry Truman was President, the deficit has declined 4 \nyears in a row and with the help of President Clinton we have reduced \nthe deficit 63 percent over the last 4 years. We have reduced the \ndeficit, as a percentage of our economy, from 4.7 to 1.4 percent. These \nmay seem like just numbers, but what we have done is we have reduced \nthe deficit as a percentage of our economy to the lowest among the \nworld's industrialized countries. Instead of constantly standing up \nsupporting this because it might sound like good politics, let us be \nhonest with the people we represent. We have done better than any \nindustrialized country in the world.\n\n  As part of our efforts we passed legislation that saves tens of \nbillions of dollars of taxpayer-financed Government programs. These are \ntough votes. For example, the distinguished senior Senator from \nIndiana, Senator Lugar, and I sponsored legislation that reorganized \nthe U.S. Department of Agriculture to become a more efficient and \neffective agency. The Leahy-Lugar bill passed Congress at the end of \n1994. It will result in saving over $3 billion, but it has to close \n1,200 USDA field offices including, should anybody ask, a large number \nof offices in my home State of Vermont.\n  What the distinguished Senator from Indiana and I did was not just to \ntalk about it, we actually put together a piece of legislation which \nmeans in every single State in this country somebody is going to feel \nthe pain. I know because I got letters from all over the country about \nit. But we passed it.\n  Maybe some of the same people who so eagerly support this \nconstitutional amendment should ask themselves, are they responsible \nfor the huge and unprecedented budget deficits of the Reagan and Bush \nyears? Many are. I am one of only five remaining Senators in this body \nwho voted against the 1981 Reagan budget package that increased defense \nspending by a huge amount while cutting taxes by a huge amount and \nwhich, of course, caused our debt to explode. The 12 years following \nReaganomics have left us with over $2.6 trillion in additional debt.\n  Do we have a deficit today? Of course we do. If we did not have to \npay the interest on the debt run up during President Reagan and \nPresident Bush's terms, we would have a surplus today. I commend, \nagain, the President, who, while inheriting a huge national debt, a \nhuge deficit, and a huge debt service when he came into office, has \nbrought the deficit down. President Clinton has, four times in a row, \nbrought the deficit down and is about to do it a fifth time in a row, \nsomething that none of us in our lifetime have seen.\n  But this proposed constitutional amendment remains now what it was \nthen: political cover for the failed policies of the 1980's and their \ntragic legacy. Those mistakes continue to cost our country hundreds of \nmillions of dollars every workday in interest on deficits run up during \nthe last two Republican administrations. Think of that--hundreds of \nmillions of dollars every single workday just on interest alone based \non the deficits of those years. As I said before, were it not for the \ninterest on this debt, we would have had a balanced budget in each of \nthe last several years.\n  The proposed constitutional amendment contains no protection against \nthe Federal Government seeking to balance its budget by shifting costs \nand burdens to the States. That is the ultimate budget gimmick--pass \nthe buck to the States. The proposed constitutional amendment would be \na prescription for disaster, especially for small States that are ill-\nequipped to handle the extra load. We know what happened in the 1980's; \nFederal contributions to State and local governments fell sharply, by \nabout a third. During that same decade, my home State of Vermont had to \nmake up the difference. We had to raise the State income tax rate from \n23 to 28 percent. In addition, State and local property taxes and taxes \nof all kinds had to be increased.\n  I remember talking to so many people in my State of Vermont, hard-\n\n[[Page S999]]\n\nworking men and women, people who bring home a weekly paycheck and pay \nthe mortgages, set money aside for their children to go to college. \nThey keep our economy going. I said, ``Have you felt these huge tax \ncuts that we read you have gotten under Reaganomics?'' Except for a \ncouple of my friends who, frankly, Madam President, make a heck of a \nlot more money than I do, they had not. In fact, what they had seen, \nthe average person had seen their taxes go up. They saw Social Security \ntaxes go up, they saw their local taxes go up, they saw their State \ntaxes go up to cover the differences.\n\n  That is not the way to cut the Federal deficit. It is the Federal \ndeficit. You do not cut it by simply shifting the burdens to State and \nlocal government and telling them to raise the taxes on their people. \nWorking people cannot afford tax increases any more just because they \nare imposed by State and local authorities and not by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  While we passed unfunded mandates legislation last Congress, even \nthat legislation offers insufficient protection. My concerns extend \nbeyond new legislation that the lawyers determine include legally \nbinding obligations. I am concerned as well about those programs that \nrespond to the basic needs of individuals.\n  Human needs are no less real because they are not set forth in a \nFederal statute. Hunger, cold, illness, the ills of the aged--these do \nnot need statutory definition to cause suffering. With or without \ndefinition, they do cause suffering. If we try to balance the Federal \nbudget by scaling back services, we are just as surely going to be \nshifting the costs and burdens of these unmet needs, as well as Federal \nmandates, on State and local governments.\n  I know the people of Vermont are not going to let their neighbors go \nhungry or go without medical care, and I expect people elsewhere will \nnot either. As much as our churches and synagogues and our charities \nand our communities will contribute, a large part of the problem and a \nlarge share of the costs are still going to fall to State and local \ngovernments.\n  The distinguished majority leader in the other body, Richard Armey, \nsaid in 1995 that he did not want to spell out the effects of this \nconstitutional amendment before it is passed because he is afraid that \nCongress would not vote to pass it if it knew what it would do. He \nlater reinforced his remarks by warning supporters not to reveal where \nthe necessary cuts would be made because knees would buckle.\n  If we are going to be asked to consider this constitutional \namendment, let us find out what the impact is likely to be. Certainly, \nbefore any State is called upon to consider ratification of such a \nconstitutional amendment, we ought to know what the impact is going to \nbe. Every State ought to be able to look at the debate here and our \nactions here and know what the impact is going to be if they ratify. \nEach State should be advised of the likely effects on its economy and, \nin particular, on personal income levels and job losses in that State. \nLet us get some of the answers. Let us know where we are headed.\n  In fact, I believe this proposed constitutional amendment would \ninvite the worst kind of cynical evasion and budget gimmickry. The \nexperience of States that do have balanced budget requirements only \nbears this out. My State, which has one of the best credit ratings in \nthe country, takes care of its budget without having in its State \nconstitution a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. Because \nwe know we have good times and bad times, we have provisions to set \naside a rainy day fund. We know that there are things that we have to \ndo in our small State economy at a time of recession to help.\n  But look what happens with States with a balanced budget requirement. \nMany that do achieve compliance do so only with what the former \ncomptroller of New York State calls dubious practices and financial \ngimmicks. These gimmicks include shifting expenditures to off-budget \naccounts, postponing payments to school district suppliers, delaying \nrefunds to taxpayers, deferring contributions to pension funds, and \nselling State assets. The proposed constitutional amendment does not \nprohibit the Federal Government from using the same and other dubious \npractices and gimmicks.\n  With Congress facing a constitutional mandate, the overwhelming \ntemptation will be to exaggerate estimates of economic growth and tax \nreceipts, underestimate spending, and engage in all kinds of accounting \ntricks as was done before the honest budgeting efforts of 1993. The \nresult will be that those who do business with the Government may never \nbe certain in what fiscal year the Government will choose to pay up or \ndeliver, and those who rely on tax refunds can certainly expect \nextended delays from the IRS.\n  Passing a constitutional directive that will inevitably encourage \nevasion is only going to invite public cynicism and scorn, and not just \ntoward the Congress. That, Madam President, does bother me, since we \nrepresent one of the three branches of Government. What bothers me far \nmore is cynicism toward the Constitution itself.\n\n  None of us in this body owns the seat that we are in. We are all here \nfor 6 years at a time. Some day we will leave, as we should, either by \nour own choice or because we are given an invitation to do so by the \nvoters of our State. But while we are here, we have a responsibility to \nthe institutions of this country, and certainly to our Constitution, an \noath that we each take solemnly and without any reservation.\n  (Mr. CRAIG assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we are, in some ways, an unprecedented \ncountry. No nation, no democracy has achieved the power that we have. \nIn fact, in history, no country, democracy or otherwise, has had the \ngreat economy and the great power of the United States. But no other \ncountry has had a constitution like ours, a short constitution, a \nsimple constitution, an understandable constitution. Since the Bill of \nRights, it has only been amended 17 times. In one of those cases, it \nwas amended for prohibition and then to repeal prohibition.\n  I mention this because I think there is a definite connection between \nthe greatness of the United States, the fact that we maintain our \ndemocratic principles and, notwithstanding our enormous power, a \nrespect for Government and a respect for our Constitution based on the \nknowledge of that Government and that Constitution and not because a \ndictator and army tell us we have to.\n  But that has meant that the men and women who have occupied these \nseats that we only temporarily occupy, the men and women who have \noccupied the seats in the other body that were only temporarily \noccupied, were wise enough--even though there were hundreds and \nhundreds of proposals over 200 years--were wise enough not to amend the \nConstitution willy-nilly, especially for those things that can be taken \ncare of legislatively. As the President said last night, it only \nrequires our vote and his signature for a balanced budget, not a \nconstitutional amendment.\n  Our predecessors on both sides of the aisle and our predecessors on \nboth sides of the aisle in the other body were wise enough to refrain, \nno matter how popular it sounded or no matter how much it helped them \nin their elections, from amending the Constitution willy-nilly, \nespecially for those things they knew they could do legislatively.\n  It is one thing to amend the Constitution to limit the terms of \nPresidents or to set up successions when there is a vacancy in the Vice \nPresidency or the Presidency itself. Those are of constitutional \nimport. But something we can do simply legislatively, why amend the \nConstitution? Let's not debase our national charter with a misguided \npolitical attempt to curry favor with the American people by this \ndeclaration against budget deficits. Let us not make the mistake of \nother countries and turn our Constitution into a series of hollow \npromises.\n  We are too great a nation for that. We are too great a democracy for \nthat, and the loopholes in Senate Joint Resolution 1 already abound. \nOne need only consult the language of the proposed amendment and \nmajority report for the first sets of exceptions and creative \ninterpretations that will allow Congress to reduce the deficit only so \nfar as Members choose to cast responsible votes. The Judiciary \nCommittee reports that the Congress will have flexibility in \nimplementing the constitutional amendment. It will leave the critical \ndetails to implementing legislation.\n\n[[Page S1000]]\n\n  This proposed constitutional amendment uses the seemingly \nstraightforward term ``fiscal year.'' But according to the committee \nreport, this time period can mean whatever a majority in Congress wants \nit to mean. It has no immutable definition. It may mean one thing this \nyear, and we may decide the next year it means something else. It can \nbe shifted around the calendar as Congress deems appropriate. Watch out \nfor the shifting of fiscal years in order to juggle accounts when \nelections are approaching.\n  This proposed amendment gives congressional leeway to rely \non estimates to balance the budget, to make temporary self-correcting \nimbalances and to ignore very small or negligible deficits. But what is \ntemporary? What is self-correcting? What is small? What is negligible?\n\n  With apologies to one of our distinguished predecessors, the Senator \nfrom Illinois, Senator Everett Dirksen, a billion here, a billion \nthere; after a while, it does not add up. This is a lawyer's dream.\n  What is negligible? We think a billion is negligible, and somebody \nsues, or a whole lot of people sue. My guess is that unless it becomes \na political bone of contention between political parties as we approach \nan election, we could go a long time without Congress declaring itself \nin violation of this proposed amendment.\n  What happens if the President of the United States says, ``Well, here \nare my estimates. My estimates are we are going to receive x number of \ndollars and my estimates are we are going to spend x number of \ndollars,'' and it turns out he is wrong? What do we do? Sue him?\n  What happens if the Congress does the same thing? We estimate in our \nbudget resolution we are going to receive x number of dollars and spend \nx number of dollars. What happens if we are wrong? Do all 535 Members \ngo to jail or just those who voted for it?\n  This proposed constitutional amendment could be economically ruinous. \nDuring a recession, deficits rise because tax receipts go down. But \nvarious Government payments, like unemployment insurance, go up. By \ncontrast, the amendment would demand the taxes be raised and spending \nbe cut during a recession or depression. It is almost like when \nPresident Herbert Hoover, as we started into a slight recession, said \nthe thing that would give the most confidence to the country would be \nto force through a balanced budget. He did, and we went through the \nworst depression in this century.\n  As Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin testified in the Judiciary \nCommittee, ``the balanced budget amendment would turn slowdowns into \nrecessions and recessions into more severe recessions or even \ndepressions.''\n  Economic policy has to be flexible enough to change with a changing \nand increasingly global economy. But the requirements of this proposal \nwould tie Congress' hands to address regional, national, and \ninternational problems. We should not hamstring the legislative power \nthat is expressly authorized in article I, section 8, of the \nConstitution. Let us not undo that which our Founders wisely provided: \nflexibility.\n  This proposed constitutional amendment risks seriously undercutting \nthe protection of our constitutional separation of powers. No one has \nyet convincingly explained how the proposed amendment would work and \nwhat role would the President play and what role would the courts play \nin its implementation and enforcement?\n  I can just see the new law school courses all over the country. How \ndo you sue under the constitutional amendment?\n  When you put the budget in the Constitution, economic policy would \ninevitably throw the Nation's fiscal policy into the courts. That is \nthe last place issues of taxing and spending should be decided. \nBasically what it does is it destroys this delicate balance between the \nthree branches of government: the executive, the legislative, and the \njudicial.\n  I cannot understand why Members of Congress want to give up their \npowers to the judiciary, because the effect of the proposed amendment \ncould be to toss important issues of spending priorities and funding \nlevels to the President or to thousands of lawyers in hundreds of \nlawsuits in dozens of Federal and State courts.\n  If approved, the amendment would have let Congress off the hook by \nkicking massive responsibilities for how tax dollars are spent to \nunelected judges and the President. Judge Robert Bork warned of the \ndanger more than a decade ago. Again, Mr. President, why--why--would we \ngive up the constitutional powers we have had for 200 years and give \nthem over to the courts who do not want them and have not asked for \nthem?\n  So instead of creating future constitutional questions, let us do the \njob we were elected to do. Let us remember what the President said last \nnight: You vote it, I sign it; we have a balanced budget. Simple as \nthat. But it means we have to make the tough choices and cast the \ndifficult votes and make progress toward a balanced budget.\n  I worry, Mr. President, that perhaps some, because it is a lot \neasier, just vote for a constitutional amendment which has huge \npopularity. It is a lot easier to do that than to vote against a whole \nlot of programs where your vote is not popular.\n  It is not popular to actually cast the votes to balance the budget. \nIt is easy to cast the vote for the constitutional amendment. It is \nsort of like saying, ``I will vote today to eliminate cancer.'' Who \ndisagrees with that? Or the person says, ``I'm against cancer. I don't \nwant to give up smoking, but I'm against cancer.'' It is the difficult \nsteps.\n  This proposed constitutional amendment undermines the fundamental \nprinciple of majority rule by imposing a three-fifths supermajority \nvote to adopt certain budgets and raise the debt limit.\n  Again, has anybody read a history book in this body? Has anybody \nfound out how this country started? Go back to our Founders. Our \nFounders rejected such supermajority voter requirements on matters that \nare within Congress' purview. Alexander Hamilton described \nsupermajority requirements as poison. I sometimes wonder if anybody \naround here even knows who Alexander Hamilton or Thomas Jefferson, \nGeorge Washington or these people were.\n  Hamilton observed that:\n\n       Supermajority requirements serve to destroy the energy of \n     the Government and to substitute the pleasure, caprice or \n     artifices of an insignificant, turbulent or corrupt junto to \n     the regular deliberations and decisions of a respectable \n     majority.\n\n  These supermajority requirements are a recipe for increased gridlock, \nnot more efficient action. If there are some in here who have not read \nThe Federalist Papers, just recall the lessons of the last 2 years when \nthe Government was shut down by a determined minority intent on getting \nits way. The Nation was pushed to the brink of default when a group \npledged that, no matter what, they would not vote on raising the debt \nlimit, they were going to let the Government be shut down. Whether it \nwas political or they went out the wrong door in an airplane or \nwhatever, they shut down the Federal Government.\n  That cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. It certainly \ncost everybody in private enterprise in this area, just about any area \nin the country, hundreds of millions of dollars more. We looked \nridiculous to the rest of the world. But all because a minority made \nthat determination.\n  Such supermajority requirements reflect a basic distrust, not just of \nCongress, but of the electorate itself. I reject that notion. I have \nfaith in the electorate. I am prepared to keep faith with and in the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. President, we have also said that ``The devil is in the \ndetails.'' I believe Emerson first said that. The proposed \nconstitutional amendment uses such general terms even its sponsors \nconcede that implementing legislation will be necessary to clarify how \nit is going to work.\n  So we ask, what will the implementing legislation say? Well, we are \nnot going to find out until we see the implementing legislation. \nBasically this says, ``Trust us. Pass this. And we'll tell you \nafterward what it means.'' That is kind of like somebody saying, ``I'll \nsell you this business. Would you sign this contract in blank? Give me \nall your money, but I will fill in the terms afterward.''\n\n  I am a Vermonter. We just do not quite do it that way back home. We \ntrust each other, but we kind of like to see the details. The questions \nraised by this proposed constitutional amendment still lack \nsatisfactory answers.\n\n[[Page S1001]]\n\n For example, what programs are going to be off budget? What role will \nthe courts and what role will the President have in executing and \nenforcing the amendment? How much of our constitutional power do we \ngive up? What is really compliance with the amendment? How much of a \ndeficit may be financed and then carried over to the next year? There \nare a lot of questions like these that are critical to our \nunderstanding of this amendment. And they have not been answered.\n  Should Congress be asked to amend the Constitution by signing what \namounts to a blank check? I disagree with that. No Congress should be \nasked to do that. Nor should each State be asked to ratify a pig in a \npoke.\n  In the interest of fair disclosure, Congress should first determine \nthe substance of any implementing legislation as it did in connection \nwith the 18th amendment, the other attempt to draft a substantive \nbehavioral policy into the Constitution. Let us go look at the \nimplementing legislation first.\n  In my view, this amendment does not meet the requirements of article \nV of the Constitution for proposals to the States because it is not \nconstitutionally necessary. It is only with resolve and hard work that \nwe make progress. Neither is evident in the proposed constitutional \namendment.\n  I have heard some of the speeches about why it would be good \npolitics, popular politics to vote for this. Politics--good, popular or \notherwise--have no place when we are dealing with the Constitution of \nthe United States. We inherited a great legacy from those who went \nbefore us because they resisted the temptation to play politics and to \namend our Constitution willy-nilly.\n  As a result, we are the greatest and strongest democracy history has \never known. The bedrock of it is our Constitution, which sets up three \nbranches of Government, with powers that make sure there are checks and \nbalances. This amendment destroys so much of what this country has \nrested on for over 200 years.\n  So instead of a bumper sticker for the Constitution, what we need is \nthe wisdom to ask what programs we must cut, and the courage to explain \nto the American people that there is no procedural gimmick that can cut \nthe deficit or the debt. There is no nice, easy self-serving item. \nThere is only hard work. But I think the American people would rather \nhave the hard work than have us fool around with our Constitution.\n  Yesterday the Wall Street Journal printed an editorial titled \n``Constitutional boondoggle'' in its editorial page. The editorial \nsays:\n\n       We do need to get the national debt declining . . .\n\n  I agree.\n\n       We do need to restrain federal spending.\n\n  Again, Mr. President, I agree.\n\n       We do need to resolve the Medicare crisis . . .\n\n  Mr. President, I agree.\n\n       We do need to look beyond the year 2002.\n\n  Mr. President, I agree. But then they said:\n\n       But these battles have to be fought one by one, and [they] \n     can't be solved by amending the Constitution.\n\n  Once again, Mr. President, I agree.\n  The Wall Street Journal editorial concludes:\n\n       The concept embodied in the proposed [constitutional] \n     amendment measures nothing useful; it is at best a \n     distraction, and at worst, causes confusion that makes the \n     right things harder to do, not easier.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the Wall Street Journal editorial be printed \nin the Record immediately after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, think back again to last night's State of \nthe Union address. The President said all it takes is for us to cast \nthe votes and for me to sign the bill to balance the budget. Many of us \nwho cast those tough votes to cut programs, to bring the deficits down, \nhave faced in the short term the wrath of our constituents but in the \nlong term a realization that we have done the right thing for the \ncountry.\n  I am proud that I have voted for budgets that have now, 4 years in a \nrow, brought down the deficits, something that has not happened \ncertainly in the last 15 years or so. We have had a President who has \nhad the courage to give us four budgets in a row that bring down the \ndeficits. They have meant tough votes.\n  Some Members who voted to bring down the deficit have probably lost \nelections because of those tough votes. How much better they have been \nto themselves, to their children and their children's children because \nthey resisted the temptation, as Senators and Representatives have for \nover 200 years, to amend our Constitution unnecessarily.\n  So let us not proceed to a view of short-run popularity but with a \nvision of our responsibilities to our constituents and the Nation in \naccordance with our cherished Constitution.\n  Mr. President, first and foremost I am going to cast votes on this \nfloor to protect that Constitution, popular or otherwise. I take my \noath of office seriously. I appreciate the privilege the people of \nVermont have given me to represent them in this body. There is nothing \nI will ever do in my life that will make me as proud as being in this \nbody representing the people of Vermont. As I have told the people of \nVermont in each one of my elections, I will protect the Constitution \nfirst and foremost. As I told them in my last two elections, I will \nvote against this constitutional amendment because it does not protect \nour country, it demeans the Constitution, and it lets us off the hook \nfrom doing the things that we really should do.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 4, 1997]\n\n                       Constitutional Boondoggle\n\n       With President Clinton about to deliver his State of the \n     Union Address and new budget, this is an apt moment to say \n     that the President is right and the Republicans are wrong on \n     item one of the GOP Congressional agenda. The balanced budget \n     amendment is a flake-out.\n       The notion of amending the Constitution to outlaw budget \n     deficits is silly on any number of counts. Politically it's \n     empty symbolism. Legally it clutters the Constitution with \n     dubious prose. Today's lesson, though, concerns economics and \n     accounting. You can't measure economic rectitude by any one \n     number, let alone the ``deficit,'' however defined, let alone \n     the deficit projections the proposals will inevitably involve \n     in practice. The attempt to enshrine such a number in the \n     Constitution is bound to prove a snare and a delusion.\n       The proposal passed by the Senate Judiciary Committee says \n     that outlays (``except for those for repayment of debt \n     principal'') shall not exceed receipts (``except those \n     derived from borrowing''). While this concept sounds simple, \n     in fact it reflects neither accounting principles nor \n     economic reality.\n       If you can balance your family budget, the thinking goes, \n     the government can balance the federal budget. But applying \n     the budget amendment's principles to households would outlaw \n     home mortgages, which have proved a boon to countless \n     families and the general economy. What a family balances is \n     its operating budget, a concept foreign to the federal \n     accounts. In corporate accounting, similarly, the health of \n     an enterprise is measured by careful distinctions such as \n     accruals or depreciation. Even the balanced budget restraints \n     of state and local governments exclude spending on capital \n     improvements financed by bond issues approved by voters.\n       The reality is that borrowing money is not a sin; it \n     depends on how much money, and in particular on the uses of \n     the borrowed funds. Even the amendment itself recognizes this \n     by allowing Congress to waive the amendment by majority vote \n     when war is declared or when a joint resolution declares ``a \n     military conflict which causes an imminent and serious \n     military threat to national security.'' Other emergencies \n     would presumably be dealt through the provision that Congress \n     could approve borrowing by a two-thirds vote.\n       Republicans back the amendment because it scores well with \n     focus group participants, who don't understand the \n     difficulties, and with Ross Perot, who doesn't care. They \n     also hope that limiting the government's power to borrow will \n     force it to limit spending. Democrats seem pretty much to \n     agree, and want to voice support for the amendment to appease \n     focus groups while also killing it to avoid a spending \n     straitjacket. We're not so sure.\n       For one thing, we've observed how European politicians, \n     even supposedly conservative ones, have been behaving toward \n     the budget-deficit requirements they imposed on themselves in \n     the Maastricht agreement. To get within the numerical \n     criteria, the Italians are taking their railroads off and on \n     budget; the French government, in return for an infusion of \n     funds this year, assumed pension obligations running into the \n     far future. Governmental accounting, you see, simply counts \n     formal government debt; it ignores unfunded governmental \n     promises.\n       This is a loophole enormous enough that Rep. Fernand St \n     Germain could drive half of\n\n[[Page S1002]]\n\n     the S crisis through it in one night in 1980, when he \n     doubled deposit-insurance limits. Another enormous loophole \n     is the government's ability to offload, or ``mandate,'' costs \n     on corporations, individuals and state and local governments \n     without running any receipts or outlays through the \n     Washington books. And when the bill for Rep. St Germain's \n     coup suddenly came due in 1989, would it really have been \n     better to avoid borrowing and put the rest of the government \n     through a temporary wringer?\n       These imperfections might not matter if the amendment did \n     no harm, but it's easy enough to imagine scenarios in which \n     it would keep us from doing the economically right thing. \n     Take the proposals by the most conservative bloc in the \n     recent Social Security Commission. They would allow current \n     taxpayers to personally invest part of what they owe in \n     payroll tax, giving them a better return. But meeting \n     obligations to those retiring before their benefits were \n     funded would require a big issue of government debt. The new \n     debt would merely formally recognize current obligations, and \n     the privatization would dramatically reduce future \n     obligations. Though this transaction would plainly improve \n     the federal fisc, the balanced budget amendment would outlaw \n     it.\n       Or for that matter, take the Reagan defense build-up, which \n     led to victory in the Cold War. The balanced budget amendment \n     would have allowed a majority to vote for borrowing if \n     fighting broke out, but not for expenditures to deter it. Is \n     this what we want?\n       And take the Reagan tax cuts, which in combination with \n     Paul Volcker's tight money, led the country out of 1970s \n     malaise, conquering inflation without an extended recession. \n     Clearly, deficit projections would have prevented the tax \n     changes.\n       Yes, this policy mix gave us deficits, but the 1980s \n     deficits are themselves a large part of the reason we have a \n     new concern with budget discipline today. Indeed, it seems to \n     us that history argues that discipline comes from forcing \n     governments to borrow, and pay interest--instead of raising \n     taxes or making unfunded promises or issuing unfunded \n     mandates. Yet in the form passed by the Finance Committee, \n     the amendment says you need a majority to raise taxes, a \n     majority to declare a military emergency, but two-thirds to \n     borrow.\n       What President Reagan understood is that if you limit \n     taxes, spending will sooner or later have to follow. For \n     permanent budget discipline, the best idea now on the table \n     is Rep. Joe Barton's proposal, up for a vote in the House \n     April 15, simply to require a two-thirds vote to raise taxes. \n     If that should pass, nature will take its course.\n       We do need to get the national debt declining as a per cent \n     of economic output. We do need to restrain federal spending. \n     We do need to solve the Medicare crisis, as Senator Phil \n     Gramm notes alongside. We do need to look beyond the year \n     2002. But these battles have to be fought one by one, and \n     can't be solved by amending the Constitution. The concept \n     embodied in the proposed amendment measures nothing useful; \n     it is at best a distraction, and at worst spreads confusion \n     that will make the right things harder to do, not easier.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, Senator Thurmond, who has worked on the \nbalanced budget amendment for all this time that he has been in this \nbody, the imminent President pro tempore of this body, who deserves so \nmuch credit for even getting it up for us to vote on it, has asked that \none of our new Senators from Nebraska be given the opportunity to take \nhis place at this point. He wanted to defer to the distinguished \nSenator from Nebraska who will be giving his maiden speech on the \nbalanced budget amendment in the Senate. I am proud of him for doing \nso. It is an honor to all of us that Senator Thurmond would do this.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska proceed with his remarks, and then I ask unanimous consent \nthat the distinguished Senator from Nevada be allowed to proceed.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, certainly the Senator from Nebraska, who \nhas been waiting some time, should go next, but perhaps somebody on \nthis side of the issue might go after the Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me amend my unanimous consent.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The distinguished Senator from Utah and I have had enough \nbills on the floor. It might be good to go back and forth.\n  Mr. HATCH. Senator Bryan would like to go after Senator Hagel, if \nthere is not another opponent who wishes to speak.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If we do not have another opponent, I am certainly willing \nto yield to the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. I wanted to make it clear. We will finish here about 5:30 \ntoday, I understand, and certainly we want to have both of these \nSenators give their speech.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I assumed the excitement level would be at such a high \nlevel we might want to go on all night, but if the distinguished \nSenator from Utah wants to stop, I will contain my excitement.\n  Mr. HATCH. We are only doing it to accommodate our friends on the \nother side who have a dinner. I would like to get the remarks in, and I \nparticularly want to listen to these two Senators.\n  I yield to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the junior Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Thank you, Mr. President. Let me also add my thanks to the \ndistinguished senior Senator from South Carolina, Senator Thurmond, for \ngiving me an opportunity to take his place this afternoon in this \ndebate over the balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to add my strong support for Senate Joint \nResolution 1, the balanced budget amendment. I believe Americans want a \nsmaller, less intrusive Federal Government. They want more freedom from \nthe burdens of Government. This is America, a country born from a \ndesire to escape the yoke of oppressive government. Our Founding \nFathers did not trust government. They trusted the people.\n  As we approach a new century, we have again reached a turning point \nin America's history. We have been given a charge, as a nation and as \nrepresentatives of the people, to work together to prioritize the role \nof Government, to redefine the role of Government in our lives. How \nmuch Government do we want? How much do we want Government to do for \nus? What do we want Government to do for us? How much Government are we \nwilling to pay for?\n  Reducing the role of the Federal Government will require tough \nchoices. A balanced budget amendment will not make those tough choices \nand difficult decisions. It is the responsibility of those of us \nentrusted by the American people in leadership positions in this \ncountry to make those tough choices and those difficult decisions. \nHowever, a balanced budget amendment will force us to step up to these \ndecisions and help make us better able and disciplined to make those \nchoices necessary to ensure a strong future for this country.\n  The American people are tired of political posturing and partisan \nrhetoric. They want action. They want results. They want us to do what \nwe said we would do. We are not here to defend the status quo. We are \nhere to solve problems. We are here to ensure that the taxpayers get \nthe most efficient and effective use of their tax dollars. After all, \nthe money we spend is not our money. It is not the Senate's money. It \nis not the President's money. It is the American people's money. They \nearned it. They work for it. It is up to us to spend it wisely. And \nright now the American people do not believe that Washington spends \ntheir money wisely. The American people want us to get control of this \ncountry's fiscal policy. They want fiscal responsibility.\n  That is why a balanced budget amendment is so important. It will \nforce discipline upon the Congress of the United States, a fiscal \ndiscipline that has been absent since 1969, the last time America \nbalanced its budget; 36 of the last 37 budgets in this country have not \nbeen balanced. It will force us to be honest with the American people.\n  As our former colleague, Paul Simon, a strong proponent of the \nbalanced budget amendment, wrote just last week in the New York Times: \n``Elected officials like to do popular things, and there is no popular \nway to balance the Federal budget.'' The balanced budget amendment will \ngive us the constitutional discipline to do the right thing.\n  This debate is about accountability. This debate is about \nresponsibility and leadership. It is about restoring the confidence and \ntrust of the American people and their Government.\n  We have all been called upon to provide leadership. There is no \nbigger challenge facing the future of this country than paying down our \nenormous national debt.\n  During the debate on the balanced budget amendment there will be \nnumbers and numbers and more numbers. But I ask you to focus on these \nnumbers: America made gross interest payments of $344 billion in fiscal \nyear 1996 on our national debt. That's $344 billion that was not used \nto improve our schools, strengthen our national defense, protect our \nenvironment, or\n\n[[Page S1003]]\n\nbuild new transportation systems. And that's just the annual interest. \nThe only thing that we are doing is paying interest on the national \ndebt. We are not even beginning to touch the principal. Each day, we \nadd an average of $700 million to our national debt that already totals \n$5.3 billion. By the time we reach anyone's plan for a balanced budget, \nthe national debt will be $7 trillion.\n  The national debt that we are leaving for our children and our \nchildren and grandchildren is the real issue in this debate.\n  What we are doing in cheating the generations that follow us is \nimmoral. We must put our Government in a position to begin paying down \nour national debt. We must begin to put our fiscal house in order, or \nour next generation--and I see young people in the galleries today--\nwill face a disaster. They will have a limited future because they will \nhave limited opportunities. This debate is about their future, the \nfuture of America, the future of our children and their children.\n  It strikes me as ironic, Mr. President, that opponents of the \nbalanced budget amendment argue that it will cause cuts in education, \nSocial Security, Medicare, and other programs. What they fail to tell \nthe American people is that if we do nothing--if we fail to act--\ndeficits and our debt will continue to rise until there is nothing left \nin the Federal budget for education, entitlement programs, national \ndefense, or any other programs--including Social Security.\n  The real threat to Social Security is the national debt. If we don't \nact to balance the budget and stop adding to that debt, then we are \ntruly placing the future of Social Security in jeopardy.\n  Furthermore, exempting Social Security from the balanced budget \namendment would actually make Social Security more vulnerable. We are \nall well aware that Social Security will begin to run a deficit of \ntrillions of dollars early in the next century. Taking Social Security \noff budget would put it out on a plank all by itself when that time \ncomes. Including Social Security in our total unified budget \ncalculations ensures that Congress will have to deal with this crisis \nbefore it hits. How can we take America's largest program off budget?\n  If Congress took Social Security off budget and ran trillions of \ndollars of deficits in it, Congress could still say that they balanced \nthe budget. That is ludicrous. That is folly. But, more important, it's \ndishonest. Does anyone truly believe that Social Security will suffer \nif we balance our budget? Let's get real. Social Security has been, and \nwill continue to be, the highest priority program in the Federal \nbudget.\n  Let me say this as straightforward as I can. The best thing we can do \nto ensure a sound future for Social Security and America is balance a \nunified Federal budget.\n  Let's be honest with the American people and say it straight. We have \nto balance our budget. We cannot continue to pile on to the debt that \nwe are leaving this next generation and then expect them to be \ncompetitive in the global economy of the 21st century. If it takes an \namendment to the Constitution to balance the budget, we should have \none. Our Framers gave us that option. When it was required to do the \nright thing for the people and the Nation, the Framers gave us \namendments to the Constitution to help ensure that we balance our \nbudget, and we need a balanced budget constitutional amendment. So \nlet's get at it. Let's show the American people that we are going to do \nwhat we said we would do.\n  The future for our next generations is growth and more economic \nopportunities for all Americans. Only through growing our economy, \ncutting taxes, cutting regulation, and cutting Government spending will \nwe be able to pay off our national debt.\n  We cannot delay these decisions any longer. Generation after \ngeneration will live with the consequences of our actions or our \ninactions. Will they live with the crushing debt of our indecision? Or \nwill they look back and say that we did rise to the occasion and to the \nchallenge? Will they say that we faced the deficit and the debt \nhonestly and took action and ensured the survival of the American \ndream?\n  The magic of America has always been that each generation has done \nbetter than the last because it had more opportunities. I do not want \nto look my 6-year-old and 4-year-old in their eyes in 20 years and say \nto them that I was a Member of the U.S. Senate, but I didn't do enough \nto protect their future.\n  I will not allow that to be the legacy of this U.S. Senator, nor do I \nbelieve that this is the legacy my distinguished colleagues wish to \nleave to their children, grandchildren, and America.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, today, we being consideration of a \nproposed constitutional amendment to require the Federal Government to \nachieve and maintain a balanced budget.\n  Undoubtedly, it is the desire of every Member who supports the \nbalanced budget amendment to see the Federal budget deficit eliminated \nso that we may begin to cut away at the Federal debt which is currently \nover $5.28 trillion. Without a balanced budget amendment, there has \nbeen little pressure on the President to submit a balanced budget and \non the Congress to make tough legislative choices on Federal spending. \nI would note that the Republican-controlled Congress is working hard to \nbalance the Federal budget. However, we need a balanced budget \namendment as part of the Constitution. As the Congress authorizes \nFederal spending, we must understand the reality that there are a \nfinite number of tax dollars available for public spending and various \nproposals would compete on merit and need, not popularity.\n  The balanced budget amendment would instill legislative \naccountability as the Congress considers various proposals for \nincreased Federal spending. Currently, there is no real check on \nrunaway Federal spending, and there will never be a shortage of \nlegislation creating new Federal programs or efforts to increase \nspending in existing programs. Without a balanced budget amendment, \nbudget deficits over the long term will continue to rise and the \nFederal debt will continue to grow. There have been times when gestures \nwere made to bring spending within our means but those efforts were \nshortlived. Statutes to reduce Federal spending have not been enough. \nThey are too easily cast aside and the Federal Government rolls along \non its path of fiscal irresponsibility.\n  I am convinced that without the mandate of a balanced budget \namendment, Federal spending will continue to eclipse receipts and the \nAmerican people will continue to shoulder inordinate tax burdens to \nsustain an indefensible Federal appetite for spending. In 1950, an \naverage American family with two children sent $1 out of every $50 it \nearned to the Federal Government. Today, the average American family is \nspending $1 out of every $4 it earns to the Federal Government.\n  Mr. President, we can trace the debate on a balanced budget amendment \nback in our history for 200 years. A defining moment may well have been \nthe appointment of Thomas Jefferson as Minister to France. Thomas \nJefferson was abroad when the Constitution was written and he did not \nattend the constitutional convention. If Jefferson had been in \nattendance, it is quite possible that he would have been successful in \nhaving language placed in the Constitution to limit the spending \nauthority of the Federal Government. Upon studying the Constitution, \nThomas Jefferson wrote in a letter of a change he so fervently believed \nshould become part of the Constitution. He wrote the following:\n\n       I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our \n     Constitution. I would be willing to depend on that alone for \n     the reduction of the administration of our government to the \n     genuine principles of its Constitution. I mean an \n     additional article taking from the government the power of \n     borrowing.\n\n  Further, Jefferson stated,\n\n       To preserve our independence, we must not let our rulers \n     load us with perpetual debt. We must make our election \n     between economy and liberty, or profusion and servitude.\n\n  Another former President, Andrew Jackson, stated the following,\n\n       Once the budget is balanced and the debts paid off, our \n     population will be relieved from a considerable portion of \n     its present burdens and will find . . . additional means for \n     the display of individual enterprise.\n\n  President Harrison described unnecessary public debt as ``criminal.''\n\n[[Page S1004]]\n\n  Mr. President, early American Presidents and public leaders \nunderstood the dangers of excessive public debt. For almost 150 years, \nbalanced budgets or budget surpluses were the fiscal norm followed by \nthe Federal Government. The unwritten rule followed by Presidents and \nlegislators until recently in our Nation's history was to achieve \nbalanced budgets except in wartime. Unfortunately, the role and the \nsize of the Federal Government has grown out of control. In the past \nthree decades, the Federal Government has run deficits in every year \nexcept one. Further, the Federal Government has run deficits in 56 of \nthe last 64 years.\n  The Federal debt has grown as deficits have continued and the debt is \nnow over $5.28 trillion. It took this Nation over 200 years to run the \nfirst trillion dollar debt yet we have recently been adding another \ntrillion dollars to our debt about every 5 years.\n  I have been deeply concerned during my time in the Senate over the \ngrowth of the Federal Government. It has been too easy for the Congress \nto pass legislation creating new Federal programs and spending more tax \ndollars whenever there is a call for Federal intervention. Of course, \nthe Federal Government has an appropriate role to protect the citizens \nof this Nation, but it is not realistic to believe that Washington \nshould respond to every perceived problem with a new Federal approach. \nThis Nation has drifted from its original foundations as a national \ngovernment of limited authority. I believe the adoption of a balanced \nbudget amendment will do much to return us to a more limited Federal \nGovernment and decentralized authority and the mandates of such an \namendment will increase legislative accountability. A balanced budget \namendment is the single most important addition we can propose to the \nConstitution to begin reducing the size of the Federal Government.\n  Mr. President, we have seen the national debt and deficits rise in \nlarge part because the Federal Government has grown. The first $100 \nbillion budget in the history of the Nation occurred in 1962. This was \nalmost 180 years after the Nation was founded. Yet, it took only 9 \nyears, from 1962 to 1971, for the Federal budget to reach $200 billion. \nThen, the Federal budget continued to skyrocket; $300 billion in 1975, \n$500 billion in 1979, $800 billion in 1983, and the first $1 trillion \nbudget in 1987. The budget for fiscal year 1996 was over $1.5 trillion. \nFederal spending has gripped Congress as a narcotic but it is time to \nbreak the habit and restore order to the fiscal policy of this Nation.\n  Two years ago, we were only one vote short of the votes needed to \npass the balanced budget amendment. We now have another opportunity to \nsend the balanced budget amendment to the American people for \nratification. I hope we do not fail the American people on this \nhistoric opportunity and instead present to the States our proposed \namendment to mandate balanced Federal budgets. It is time to act to \nsecure the future for all Americans.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as you can see, this is a very important \namendment. This is a very important debate. This particular debate is \ngoing to determine whether this country is going to go ahead with a \nfiscally responsible Government or whether it isn't. And, frankly, I \nthink it is time that we do vote on this and that we do what is right \nfor our country.\n  We are waiting for a couple of Senators who would like to come and \nspeak to this.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator from \nNebraska for his maiden speech on the floor of the Senate on the \nbalanced budget amendment. He did a very good job. He made a lot of \nvery important points. I hope everybody in this country will pay \nattention to him.\n  This is a fellow who has sacrificed for his country. He was a war \nhero. He has been much decorated. He decided he wanted to run for the \nU.S. Senate so he could make a difference, and he made a real \ndifference here today. I personally commend him for it and thank him \nfor it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while I disagree with the position of the \ndistinguished Senator from Nebraska, I, too, compliment him on his \nfirst speech. He obviously had given great thought to it and to his \nposition. It was sort of in the dim recesses of my own memory of the \nfirst time I spoke on the floor. I know it is a special time. I applaud \nhim for waiting to speak on this matter. Whichever side we are on, we \nall agree that it is a very serious matter.\n  I notice that the distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts is \non the floor and wishes to speak. Following the sort of informal \narrangement the Senator from Utah and I have worked out, trying to go \nback and forth, I will yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMassachusetts [Mr. Kennedy].\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont. Mr. \nPresident, I support a balanced budget, but I oppose this \nconstitutional amendment. It is unnecessary, unwise, and untimely. At \nthe very moment when Congress is about to balance the Federal budget \nthe right way, our Republican friends are attempting to do it the wrong \nway, by writing an inflexible requirement into the Constitution.\n  Tomorrow, President Clinton will give Congress an opportunity to \napprove a balanced budget that genuinely protects the priorities of \nAmerican families on key issues, such as Social Security, Medicare, \neducation, jobs, health care, and the environment, while achieving the \ngoal of a balanced budget in the year 2002. That is what American \nfamilies want and need, not a risky and unnecessary constitutional \namendment that would jeopardize these priorities, hamstring the \neconomy, and place a straitjacket in the Constitution.\n  Our Republican friends refuse to admit the extraordinary progress we \nhave already made under President Clinton to balance the budget. Twelve \nyears of Reagan-Bush budgets tripled the national debt and quadrupled \nthe deficit. But in 4 years under President Clinton's leadership, we \nhave reduced the deficit by nearly two-thirds, and the goal of a \nbalanced budget is clearly within our grasp.\n  The proposed constitutional amendment has several fatal flaws. One of \nthe most flagrant is the clear threat it poses to Social Security. \nToday, over 43 million senior citizens rely on Social Security as a \nlifeline, and millions more are counting on it for their future. Yet \nthe balanced budget constitutional amendment does not protect Social \nSecurity--it endangers it.\n  For over a decade, beginning with the Reagan administration when \nSocial Security first came under heavy hostile fire from some members \nof the Republican Party, large bipartisan majorities in both the Senate \nand the House of Representatives have consistently dealt with that \nthreat by providing clear protection for that basic program. Major \nlegislation in 1983, 1985, and 1990 all protected Social Security by \nplacing it outside the regular budget process. Yet this proposed \nconstitutional amendment would undo all those protections, and put \nSocial Security on the chopping block with all other programs.\n  When we were considering the markup of the balanced budget amendment, \nI made this point. Those who took a different position said, ``Well, \nSocial Security will be protected in any event because of the existing \nstatutes.'' But what they fail to understand is that we are talking \nabout a constitutional amendment that will override those particular \nstatutes. Those statutes will be ineffective because of the new \nconstitutional mandate.\n  We will erode the protections afforded Social Security in the past. \nThe protections recommended by the Social Security Commission in 1983, \nwhich were effectively adopted in the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget \nstatute and restated, with bipartisan support, in 1990. These are \nimportant pieces of legislation that clearly said that Social Security \nis different.\n  Social Security is special. Social Security represents dollars paid \nin by workers with the clear understanding and effective guarantee that \nthey will\n\n[[Page S1005]]\n\nbe paid back at retirement. Social Security is different, as all of us \nwell understand, from other provisions of legislation--direct \nappropriations and the discretionary budget, which funds, for example, \neducation programs, NIH, the military, and the entitlement programs, \nplus the interest on the debt. As much as I strongly support the \ncommitments at NIH or the Pell Grant Program, citizens do not pay into \nthose programs expecting to get something back in the future.\n  That is why, Mr. President, it has been the time-honored position of \nthis body--with bipartisan support--to place a firewall around Social \nSecurity. But not under the balanced budget amendment. It is right in \nthere along with other programs, eligible for the chopping block.\n  This proposal could easily force the Federal Government to stop \nmaking payments on Social Security checks. As House sponsors of the \namendment have admitted, ``The President would be bound, at the point \nat which the Government runs out of money, to stop issuing checks.'' \nThat would be a disaster for senior citizens on fixed incomes who count \non Social Security to pay their rent, buy their food, or pay their \nheating bills.\n  How can any senior citizen count on Republican pledges that say, \n``Trust us. We won't hurt Social Security''? Our answer is clear--stop \ndissembling about Social Security. Stop playing this phony shell game \nwith Social Security. We all know how to protect Social Security--so I \nsay, protect it.\n  The second fatal flaw surrounding this amendment is the pretense of \nbroad public approval. Proponents claim the amendment has widespread \nsupport among families in communities across the country. The polls \nseem--but only seem--to confirm that. A balanced budget constitutional \namendment does have superficial appeal. It sounds good in a sound bite, \nbut it can't survive serious debate.\n  Families don't balance their budgets this way. If they did, they \ncould never buy a home through a mortgage, or borrow money to send \ntheir children to college or to buy a car.\n  That is the family budget. We hear, ``Well, the families have to \naccount for their funding.'' They do, and we should. And we will under \nPresident Clinton's budget. But to say that the families of this \ncountry do not mortgage their homes and pay off the debt over a period \nof time or borrow to send their children to college or to buy a car is \nmisstating and misrepresenting what is really happening on Main Street \nUSA.\n  Our Republican friends should not be lulled into a false sense of \npublic support for this phony amendment. When families across America \nrealize its flaws, this amendment will flunk the kitchen table test.\n  The third fatal flaw in this amendment is its threat to the economy. \nRepublicans tell us that this proposal is good for families. But over \n1,000 economists, including 7 Nobel prize winners, have condemned the \namendment as an unacceptable risk to the health of the economy.\n  As Secretary of the Treasury Bob Rubin told the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, the amendment would ``subject the Nation to unacceptable \neconomic risks in perpetuity * * *. A balanced budget amendment could \nturn slowdowns into recessions, and recessions into more severe \nrecessions or even depressions.''\n  Mr. President, we have seen an expanding and growing economy in \nrecent years. It has worked very well for an important percentage of \nthe American people. It has not worked as well for all working families \nin this country. We acknowledge that. That is an area which I think we \nhave to give greater focus and attention. But we do not have the \ndramatic swings that we experienced at other times in our economic \nhistory. Times that had a disastrous effect on working families--in \nparticular, working families at the lower level of the economic ladder. \nSo why are we putting them at risk with the balanced budget amendment? \nThe wealthiest individuals are not going to be hurt if their Social \nSecurity check is cut or the Pell Grant program is reduced. Working \nfamilies will be at risk. And the working poor have the most to lose \nbecause, if this country is put into a depression, they are the ones \nwho will forfeit their jobs and the opportunity to provide for their \nfamilies.\n  This amendment could spell disaster for working families during times \nof recession. The amendment turns off the economy's automatic \nstabilizers. That could cause unemployment to rise dramatically.\n  It is estimated that the unemployment rate in the 1992 recession \nwould have risen to 9 percent, instead of 7.7 percent, and an \nadditional 1 million Americans would have been thrown into the \nunemployment lines. What sense does it make to pass a fell-good \nconstitutional amendment that could have harsh and extreme consequences \nlike that?\n  Proponents claim that Congress would act in time to avoid any \neconomic emergency. Does anyone seriously believe that? Under the \nthree-fifths rule in this amendment, a willful minority could hold the \neconomy and the entire country hostage indefinitely.\n  The House sponsors of the amendment have acknowledged this problem. \nThey admit the amendment would have the effect of ``lowering the \nblackmail threshold * * * from 50 percent plus one in either body to 40 \npercent plus one.'' That is the height of irresponsible government.\n  I say, let's work together, on both sides of the aisle, to pass an \nhonest balanced budget that protects the Nation's priorities, protects \nthe economy, and protects the Constitution too. Amending the \nConstitution is a transparent partisan political gimmick, and I'm \nconvinced the people will see through it as this debate continues.\n  Mr. President, I look forward later in this debate to have the chance \nto debate the issues on Social Security, the enforcement provision, how \nthis measure would tend to force amendments, and we will work with the \nleadership, Senators Leahy and Hatch, to offer those amendments in a \ntimely way to permit Members to engage in this debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  I note by way of a prefacing comment the amendment that we are \ndebating is a significant one. Obviously, there is going to be \nprolonged and thoughtful debate on the merits of Senate Joint \nResolution 1, as is appropriate.\n  I note that not all Democrats agree with the position I take in \nsupport of this amendment, and not all members of the same family \nagree. The very able and distinguished senior Senator from \nMassachusetts has made an eloquent statement here just moments ago in \nopposition. His articulate and able nephew joined us at a press \nconference earlier today with equal vigor arguing for its ratification. \nSo this will have some ramifications, I am sure, in terms of the \nprocess here in Washington.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate the comment. It is two out of three. We \nhave two out of three members of the family who oppose it. But I \nappreciate the Senator's pointing out the one member of the family. We \nwill have a chance to talk to him.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I will be happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. I think we see some hope for the Kennedy family.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I do not want to transgress and separate that wall of \nseparation between church and state, but I think there may be a period \nof redemption here for those who have not yet been enlightened by our \nview.\n  It is always a pleasure to engage the Senator from Massachusetts in \nconversation because I know that he advocates from a position of \nconviction, sincerely a colleague whom I respect even though in this \nparticular case I find myself in disagreement with his position.\n  Mr. President, this debate will climax later this month when the \nSenate tries to muster the 67 votes necessary to make this the 28th \namendment to the Constitution. The outcome of this vote will have \nhistoric consequences which will significantly affect this country for \ndecades to come. If we are successful in getting this amendment added \nto our Constitution, it will be this Congress' legacy to the history \nbooks and to our children and our grandchildren.\n\n[[Page S1006]]\n\n  The President spoke eloquently last evening in his State of the Union \nAddress. I have known the President for at least 15 years, when he and \nI served as chief executive officers of our respective States, and I \nhave never heard him speak more eloquently. I believe it is the most \neloquent of the State of the Union Messages that I have heard as a \nMember of this body. He spoke at considerable length about our children \nand the 21st century. We are part of the 20th century. As he pointed \nout, those who are born this year will have little or no memory of the \ncentury that has been the governing influence in the lives of every \nMember of this institution and those who report our actions for this \ngeneration.\n  I believe with equal sincerity that the action we take on this \namendment is, likewise, for our children and their legacy so that they \nmay have the same economic opportunities we have. It is my sense, and I \nwill speak to this more in just a moment, that we foreclose and \nmortgage their future if we do not arrest a trend that has been \ninstitutionalized with both Democratic and Republican administrations \nand with Democratic and Republican Congresses.\n  As I commented earlier this month at a press conference with my able \ncolleague, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, both \nthe White House and the Congress have supported a balanced budget. \nDemocrats and Republicans in the Congress support a balanced budget. It \nhas become the Holy Grail, if you will, of American political strategy \nto reach a balanced budget. Suffice it to say, our track record has not \nbeen particularly impressive. In 59 of the last 67 years, we have \nfailed to balance the budget, and as a consequence these numbers are \nstaggering. I want to talk to that issue a little bit more in a moment.\n  I do not underestimate the seriousness of an undertaking to amend the \nConstitution. We have only done so 27 times in our history, and so we \nshould approach this carefully and analytically. This will and should \nbe a lengthy debate, with serious consideration given to legitimate \npoints of view, but in the final analysis I believe it is imperative \nthat Congress send to the States some form of a balanced budget \namendment. Other approaches have been tried and failed, but for the \nfuture economic well-being of our country, our children, and \nour grandchildren, we must take this step.\n\n  The wording of the resolution is straightforward and the text is \nbarely two pages long. Under Senate Joint Resolution 1, total Federal \nspending must not exceed total Federal revenues for each year unless a \n60-percent supermajority of those elected in both the House and the \nSenate vote to allow the Congress to authorize a specific amount of \ndeficit spending.\n  While the wording is straightforward, the significance in terms of \nits impact on our country cannot be overestimated. Balanced budget \namendments are not alien to our Government. In fact, almost all States \nhave balanced budget requirements either in their constitutions or in \ntheir statutes.\n  As Governor of Nevada, I was required to balance the State's budget. \nIt was not always an easy task, particularly during the economic \nslowdown of the early 1980's which affected my own State of Nevada and \nmany other States. The year that I was elected Governor, in 1982, the \nrecession had reached its low point in my State, and in January 1983, \nas I assumed office, we were not sure in that first month whether we \ncould handle the payroll for State government. It was close. It was nip \nand tuck.\n  It is always the lot of those who seek support for programs, many of \nwhich I support, many of which the Members of this Chamber are \nsupportive of, it is always the nature of those groups to ask more than \nthey know you can provide, and Governors have the responsibility \nreinforced with a balanced budget provision, notwithstanding those \nrequests and the merit of many of them, to simply say I would love to \ndo it, I would like to do it, but we simply cannot do it because we do \nnot have the money to do it and we have to operate within the revenue \nstream that we have.\n  That is the way we conduct our personal affairs, in business and \nprivate life. We lack that institutional discipline, it seems to me, \nhere at the Federal level. And I say that without respect to \npartisanship. That is true with Democratic and Republican \nadministrations alike.\n  My experience born out of that time is that a balanced budget \nrequirement instills fiscal discipline in a system that is otherwise \npredisposed to avoid making hard, unpopular choices, and for the most \npart States have performed admirably when it comes to fiscal \nresponsibility. We cannot say the same for the Federal Government in \nrecent history.\n  In our country's first 150 years, there was almost an unwritten rule \nthat the Federal Government should balance its budget. The United \nStates Government ran deficits during the War of 1812, the Civil War \nand the Spanish-American War, to name a few occasions. But in other \nperiods the Federal Government ran surpluses to reduce its outstanding \ndebts. On the whole, only emergencies justified running deficits. \nHowever, in the past 36 years, the Federal Government has balanced its \nbudget only once, in fiscal year 1969, and has failed in 59 of the last \n67 years.\n  That is not an impressive record. None of us ought to be proud of \nthat record. Let me emphasize, because this is bipartisan, that \noccurred under Republican administrations, Democrat administrations, \nRepublican Congresses, and Democrat Congresses. So institutionally we \nall share the failure in being able to achieve that balanced budget.\n  Since 1980, the accumulated Federal debt has skyrocketed from less \nthan $1 trillion to over $5 trillion. That represents $20,000 for every \nAmerican, man, woman, and child. This has taken place in an era when \nour country has not been at war and has enjoyed relatively healthy \neconomic conditions. No one can claim national emergency necessitated \nrunning these deficits.\n  Many in Washington believe there is now a true commitment to fiscal \ndiscipline. On the Federal level, in the last few years there has been \nsome cause for optimism. For the first time since before the American \nCivil War, for four consecutive years, the annual deficit has declined. \nThe President can take credit for that as well as the Congress for \nactions that have been taken.\n  What we do not hear is that in the current budget year we are \ndeveloping, the deficits will begin to rise again, and so they will in \neach successive year to the year 2002. That success has been achieved \nas a result of a number of things that we have done in the Congress and \nin an economy that has enjoyed a surprising long run in growth. The \ndeficit has been cut in half from its projected level just 4 years ago \nand the deficit has fallen from 4.9 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct in 1992 to 1.4 percent in 1996.\n  I know, and I think every Member of this Chamber knows, it is going \nto be extremely difficult, but we must complete the task and balance \nthe budget by 2002. I am pleased to note and to sense a strong \nbipartisan will to achieve this goal. When we debate the budget \nresolution and 13 appropriations bills later this year, our will to \nachieve a balanced budget by 2002 will be sorely tested. I am \noptimistic, and I am hopeful we will rise to that challenge.\n  If we can balance the budget by 2002, some may ask, why do we need a \nbalanced budget constitutional amendment? The simple answer is that \nthis amendment is in the form of an insurance policy that Congress will \nlive up to its good intentions. The amendment will keep our feet to the \nfire. While I respect the good intention of Members of Congress, \nhistory has proven that in the past three-quarters of a century we have \nnot been up to the challenge. As I indicated a moment ago, in 59 of the \nlast 67 years, the Federal Government has spent more money than it took \nin.\n  Additionally, since 1978, Congress has enacted five statutes \nrequiring a balanced Federal budget--clearly good intentions. But \nFederal statutes have not worked, which is why I believe an amendment \nto the Constitution is the next logical and necessary step we must \ntake. If we have the desire to balance the budget, why have we had so \nmuch difficulty in achieving this goal? While people in theory support \na balanced budget, I am sure my colleagues share the same experience \nthat I have had. At every townhall meeting, if asked, ``Do you favor \nthe Federal Government balancing its budget?'' The answer is \noverwhelmingly in the affirmative. But when it comes down to specific \ncuts, it is interesting that that\n\n[[Page S1007]]\n\nsame townhall meeting will say, ``But I don't want you to cut here.'' \nAnd in an audience of a couple hundred people, there are probably a \ndozen programs that those of our constituents who come to these \nmeetings suggest: Balance the budget but don't make any cuts in these \nrespective programs. They, like past Congresses, shy away from the hard \nchoices.\n  Unfortunately, the consequences of failing to make the hard choices \nare either very subtle or are not felt for years or decades. While cuts \nin food stamps or home heating assistance are felt immediately and \nenergize a specific constituency, a point or two rise in interest rates \ncaused by deficit spending is hidden. Some of the American people have \nto make the connection between large Federal budget deficits and higher \ninterest rates. These higher interest rates have a dramatic impact on \nthe American family's bottom line. In fact, DRI-McGraw-Hill estimates \nthat interest rates will drop by 2 percent if we balance the budget. \nThis will save an average family $2,169 per year in mortgage interest, \n$180 on an auto loan, and $216 on a typical student loan.\n  But the most insidious effects of deficit spending are the larger and \nlarger burdens we pass on to the next generation. In just a decade, the \ndeficit has gone from $8,000 for every man, woman, and child in this \ncountry to more than $20,000 this year. We are burdening future \ngenerations with the tab for our inability to bite the bullet, to make \nthe hard choices.\n  Our inability to balance the budget has had a compounding effect. \nEach year we fail to do so, the job becomes harder the next year, as we \nhave to pay more to service the national debt. In the past 20 years, \nthe percentage of our budget that goes to servicing the debt has risen \nfrom 7 to 15 percent. We lose 15 percent of our budget just paying for \nthe excesses of the past and just the interest, none of that retiring \nthe principal which is now approximately $5.3 trillion.\n  Put another way, $1 in every $6 of our Federal budget goes to paying \ninterest on our more than $5 trillion national debt. Before the first \nschool lunch is paid for, before another road is paved, before much-\nneeded repair is undertaken on our neglected National Park System, we \nspend in gross interest payments alone, $300 billion as the cost of \nservicing our national debt. It is the second largest Federal spending \nitem, following Social Security, and is equal to almost one-half of our \npersonal income taxes paid to the Federal Government. Yet we have \nnothing to show for it.\n\n  While there is little disagreement on the evils of budget deficits, \nthere is a serious disagreement and debate over whether Senate Joine \nResolution 1 addresses specific concerns people have. I want to address \none that is very sensitive and certainly worthy of being discussed and \ncarefully considered, and that is whether Social Security should be \nincluded in a balanced budget amendment.\n  I believe Social Security should be removed from the balanced budget \namendment. I do not do this lightly, because removing the Social \nSecurity surpluses will make it more difficult in our task of balancing \nthe budget. The surplus for 1996 was approximately $60 billion. But \nwhether Social Security should be taken out of the balanced budget \namendment depends on how you view the Social Security system. If you \nbelieve it to be a pay-as-you-go system where today's workers' payroll \ntaxes should go to pay the benefits of today's retirees, then Social \nSecurity should remain a part of the overall budget, and that is an \nhonest, philosophical point of view. If, however, you believe the funds \nbeing taken out of today's workers' payrolls should be set aside for \ntheir retirement, years from now, then Social Security should be taken \nout of budget.\n  In fact, Congress has spoken on this issue and, in 1990, enacted \nlegislation to take Social Security out of the unified budget. But my \nsupport for taking Social Security out of the balanced budget amendment \nis based on my conviction that we must start putting aside money for \nfuture retirees or we will face, as a country, financial calamity. The \nmath does not work out, for there will be far too few workers to \nsupport far too many retirees when the baby boom generation retires in \nthe next century.\n  Finally, we currently have 3.2 workers for every retiree. In the year \n2030, we will have only two workers for every retiree, and young people \ntoday are rightfully skeptical about what will be left to pay for their \nretirement. One way to restore their confidence would be to truly set \naside their payroll contribution by taking it out of a balanced budget \namendment. This would prohibit the Federal Government from using Social \nSecurity surpluses when it balances the budget, and Social Security \nwould look more like a traditional retirement system.\n  Over the next several weeks the Senate will engage in serious debate \nover the issue of excluding Social Security from a balanced budget \namendment. While I support such an amendment, I believe it is vital \nthat we pass a balanced budget amendment, even if it does not exclude \nSocial Security. The worst thing we can do for Social Security is to \nfail to pass any balanced budget amendment.\n  Without the fiscal discipline provided by the amendment, we will \nnever be able to keep our budget in order.\n  If we have learned nothing else from our past budget problems, it \nshould be that putting off the solution only makes matters more \ndifficult to rectify. A little pain now helps us to avoid a lot of pain \nlater. The fiscal discipline of the balanced budget amendment will make \nit much easier for us to responsibly assure the long-term solvency of \nthe Social Security System. The worst option for the long-term \nviability of Social Security, in my opinion, would be to continue with \nthe status quo and fail to enact a balanced budget amendment.\n  Let me just embellish upon that for a moment. I know that many of my \ncolleagues will be joining me in supporting an amendment to take Social \nSecurity off budget, and I believe they are sincere in desiring to \nprotect Social Security. But I must say, I find it difficult to follow \nthe logic that if there is not sufficient votes to take Social Security \noff budget in this constitutional amendment, that somehow voting \nagainst a balanced budget in some way protects Social Security.\n  I have been a Member of this body since 1989. I have seen budgets \nsubmitted by a Republican and a Democratic President, and we will see a \nbudget submitted to us tomorrow by this President. Each President has \nsubmitted as part of a budget proposal to us the Social Security \nsurplus. So tomorrow, the $60 billion that represents this year's \nsurplus will be included in the spending plan that is recommended to \nthe Congress.\n  So the notion that somehow if we fail to adopt a balanced budget \namendment we are protecting Social Security, I must say, is an argument \nthe logic of which I do not understand. We are currently using that \nsurplus in the Social Security budget to finance the operational \nexpenses of the Federal Government. Republican Presidents have done it; \nDemocratic Presidents have done it. And in my view, it is a misguided \nnotion that we protect Social Security by rejecting a balanced budget \namendment that does not contain the off-budget language.\n  Mr. President, this Congress has a historic opportunity to take \naction that will positively affect this country for generations to \ncome. If we fail, I am afraid we will continue to push financial \nburdens on those who come after us. Let this Congress' legacy be that \nit took bold action and that it did so in a bipartisan way, and that by \nso doing, we protect the future economic well-being of all Americans. I \nurge my colleagues to enact Senate Joint Resolution 1.\n  As I said at the outset, I do not take amending our Constitution \nlightly, but I feel, in light of the circumstances of our recent \nhistory, it is the only responsible course of action. History has shown \nus that good intentions, Federal statutory enactments have failed to do \nthe job. A balanced budget amendment will bring about the fiscal \ndiscipline our country so desperately needs, and I urge my colleagues, \nDemocrats and Republicans alike, to join with us in enacting a \nconstitutional amendment that will balance the Federal budget in the \nyear 2002, and, by so doing, ensure that our children and our \ngrandchildren will enjoy the economic opportunities that have been the \nprivilege of our generation to enjoy.\n\n[[Page S1008]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I will only take a moment, because the \ndistinguished Senator from Minnesota wishes to make a statement on the \nother side of the issue.\n  I thank my colleague from Nevada for an excellent set of remarks. He \nis a tremendous leader on this issue, the principal cosponsor of this \namendment on the Democratic side of the aisle. I thank him for all the \nwork he has done and the excellent remarks that he has made. It means \nan awful lot to all of us.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank my colleague from Utah for his generous remarks. I \nlook forward to working with him and our other colleagues in seeing \nthis measure is enacted into law.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to take a few seconds to point \nout this little stack. This is only 28. This stack is only 28 of the \nunbalanced budgets since 1969. We were afraid to put up the ones before \n1969, which was the last year when we had a balanced budget in this \ncountry. So those who get up and say, ``Well, we just simply ought to \nhave the will to do it,'' look at this stack. We are going to have to \ntake it down because we are afraid somebody will get hurt. We wanted \nthe American people to see just what they have lived with for 28 solid \nyears, and that doesn't even count the years before. It is pitiful for \npeople to stand up and say, ``Well, we don't need a balanced budget \namendment.'' That is pitiful, too,\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if Senator Hatch will yield for 1 minute.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield to the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to my fellow Senators, I happened \nto be on ``Meet the Press'' on Sunday. I couldn't put all 29 unbalanced \nbudgets there, but I put a couple. Frankly, I described this episode in \nAmerican history as 29 years of engagement where we have been engaged \nwith the American people and to the American people on a balanced \nbudget, and, as I put it, the time has come to get married, to tie the \nknot. The engagement has been too long, 29 years.\n\n  My second point is, for those who are listening and frequently see \nsome of us speak to these issues on the floor, before you believe the \nstatements coming from those who oppose this constitutional amendment \nthat by taking it off budget you make it more secure and more safe, \njust be patient. Some of us will convince you that by taking it off \nbudget, you put the Social Security trust fund at risk and pensions for \nthe future at risk, because they will be subject to exclusively the \nwill of a Congress.\n  That is all you need to worry about is to put a trust fund out there \nthat has money and let Congress have ahold of it and no balanced budget \nrequirement. You can just imagine what we are going to be able to show \nseniors what is going to happen to that fund if you take it off budget.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I won't make some of the arguments that \nhave been made in opposition to this amendment. With all due respect to \nmy colleagues, we can look back with a sense of history, and I think \nthere is probably plenty of blame on both sides--I am glad to say I \nwasn't here during most of that history--about budgets that were not in \nbalance. But the fact of the matter is, people in our country have made \nit really clear that they want to see us get our fiscal house in order. \nWe can do that, we should do that, and we don't need this amendment.\n  I do, in a moment, want to talk about who is at risk and exactly what \nkind of priorities I believe this amendment is going to lock us into, \nwhich I don't think are the priorities and values of people in our \ncountry.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Before I do that, I ask unanimous consent that Jordan Cross, who is \nan intern, be granted privilege of the floor for the duration of this \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, as we turn our thoughts to the new \ncentury--and I have a different context about this debate--we can \ncelebrate a great deal. The past 100 years have seen massive \nimprovements in the quality of our national life, American leadership \nin getting the world past murderous global conflict and successful \ntranscendence of economic crisis.\n  Our population is more diverse than ever, and at midcentury, we \ndismantled the legal framework encasing our original sin of State-\nsanctioned racism. We are, in many varied ways, a model for much of the \nworld.\n  But there is at least one way in which we are not a model, one area \nin which in recent times we have been moving in the wrong direction. \nThat is in fulfilling our national vow of equal opportunity.\n  We said in 1776 that every American should have the right to life, \nliberty, and the pursuit of happiness. In 1997, that national \ncommitment is in need of refurbishing and renewal. Mr. President, I \nwill explain in a moment why I start out with this context.\n  More than 35 million Americans--1 out of every 7 of our fellow \ncitizens--are officially poor. More than one out of every four children \nin our country today are poor. One out of every two children of color \nare poor in America today. And the poor are getting poorer.\n  In 1994, of the poor children under the age of 6, nearly half lived \nin families with incomes below half the poverty line. That figure has \ndoubled over the last 20 years, as has the number of people who work \nfull time, 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, and still are poor.\n  Mr. President, minorities are poorer than the rest of Americans. \nAfrican Americans are close to 30 percent and Hispanics at a little \nover 30 percent. And 44.6 percent of children who lived in families \nthat are female-headed families were poor in 1994. Almost half of all \nchildren who were poor live in female-headed households. Women are \ndisproportionately among the ranks of the poor in America. There is a \nconvergence between race and gender and poverty and children.\n  Mr. President, when I introduce my amendments in this debate that \nwill ensue over the next couple of weeks, I am going to talk in very \nconcrete terms about what it means to be poor in America.\n  Context, Time magazine, ``Special Report: How A Child's Brain \nDevelops, And What It Means for Child Care and Welfare Reform.'' This \nis startling. This is medical evidence that is irreducible and \nirrefutable, and the evidence says that the first 3 years are critical. \nWe have to make sure that, first of all, women that are expecting \nchildren have an adequate diet. Otherwise, their children at birth may \nnot have the opportunity and the chance that is the very essence of the \nAmerican dream. And if children do not have an adequate diet during \nthese early years, and decent health care, and children do not get a \nsmart start and have nurturing care and stimulation by age 3, it may \nvery well be that they will never be able to fully participate in the \neconomic and political and social and cultural life of our Nation.\n  What does this have to do with this debate? Let me be clear about who \nis at risk. According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities--by \nthe way, Bob Greenstein and the work of this organization is \nimpeccable. All of us on both sides of the aisle have a tremendous \namount of respect for their work.\n  According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, more than 93 \npercent of the budget reductions in entitlement programs in the 104th \nCongress came from programs for low-income people. Congress reduced \nentitlement programs by $65.6 billion over the period from 1996 to \n2002. Of that amount, $61 billion out of the $65 billion came out of \nlow-income entitlement programs. Entitlement programs not targeted on \nlow-income households were reduced only $4.6 billion--whether it was \nnutrition, whether it was health care, whether it was early childhood \ndevelopment.\n  I will tell you what was interesting. Those citizens in this country \nwho do not have the political power, who do not hire the lobbyists, who \nare not the heavy hitters--let me make a connection to campaign finance \nreform, who were not the big givers--they are the ones who \ndisproportionately were asked to pay the price.\n\n[[Page S1009]]\n\n  We had deficit reduction--talking about how to balance the budget--\nbased on the path of least political resistance. It was not the oil \ncompanies. It was not the pharmaceutical companies. It was not the big \ninsurance companies. But it was children, disproportionately low-income \ncitizens and disproportionately poor children in America.\n  Mr. President, therefore, the first amendment that I am going to \noffer, which I think is a litmus test for all of us--I hope I will get \nsupport from the other side of the aisle--will read as follows: ``This \namendment would exempt outlays that would disproportionately affect \nnutrition, health care, and education programs.''\n  Mr. President, this is an amendment that basically says that we want \nto make sure we would exempt outlays that would disproportionately \naffect the nutrition, health care, and educational programs and status \nof children.\n  Mr. President, it is a simple amendment. We have been hearing \nspeeches in which all of us have talked about education and children. \nWe love to have photo opportunities with children. This amendment just \nsays, ``OK, if you're going to lock us in to a balanced budget, I think \nwe need to get a commitment, based upon the record of the 104th \nCongress, that you are not going to make disproportionate cuts in \nprograms that deal with the educational, health care, and nutritional \nstatus of children.'' Everyone should vote yes for that.\n  Let us go on record. Let us be clear that we are not going to target \nfor cuts, we are not going to target for pain poor children in America, \nthat we will not make those disproportionate cuts in nutritional \nprograms for those children, in health care programs for those \nchildren, in educational programs and early childhood programs for \nthose children.\n  I think this amendment speaks to a very real concern that people have \nin this country. Exactly what is the agenda here?\n  Mr. President, the second amendment--let me repeat the first \namendment one more time: ``Federal outlays shall not be reduced in a \nmanner that disproportionately affects outlays for education, \nnutrition, and health care programs for children.''\n  That should be an amendment that I should get support on from both \nsides of the aisle. ``Federal outlays shall not be reduced in a manner \nthat disproportionately affects outlays for education, nutrition, and \nhealth care programs for children.''\n  Mr. President, the second amendment that I am going to offer is that \n``Funding for the Women, Infants, and Children Program shall be \nexempted from the definition of outlays for balanced budget \ncalculations, thus protecting such spending from cuts under a balanced \nbudget amendment.''\n  Mr. President, it is pretty simple. The Women, Infants, and Children \nProgram provided assistance in 1996 for 7.3 million women, infants, and \nchildren. However, it was only 60 percent of the eligible population, \nand 11 million mothers and children were eligible. Only 7.2 million \nwere covered, leaving 4 million women, infants, and children vulnerable \nand not benefiting from the Women, Infants, and Children Program.\n  We all know what the evidence suggests. And so my amendment just \nsimply says, we will exempt that from the definition of outlays for \nbalanced budget calculations, thus protecting this program. Are we \ngoing to protect it or not? I want to hear people tell me why we would \nnot go on record saying we would protect it.\n  The third amendment that I am going to lay out on the floor: \n``Funding for Head Start shall be exempted from the definition of \noutlays for balanced budget calculations, thus protecting such spending \nfrom cuts under the balanced budget amendment.''\n  Mr. President, in 1996, Head Start served 796,500 children. According \nto the Census Bureau, there were roughly 2 million American children \nliving in poverty. That leaves 1,200,000 children who were still \nunserved.\n  This program, which gives children just what the title says it does, \na head start, reached only 17 percent of eligible 3-year-olds and only \n41 percent of eligible 4-year-olds. The medical evidence is in. These \nare the ages where we need to support these children. These children, \njust because they come from poor households, deserve every bit of \nsupport we can give them.\n  This amendment lays itself on the line. If you are going to support \nthis amendment to balance the budget and lock us in, then I want a \ncommitment from this Senate that we will not target these children and \nwe will not have cuts in this vital program that gives children a head \nstart, some of the most vulnerable poor children in America.\n  Finally, Mr. President, another amendment--and these are just four I \nam going to preview. ``Funding for education shall be exempted from the \ndefinition of outlays for balanced budget calculations, thus protecting \nsuch spending from cuts under the balanced budget amendment.''\n  I heard the President last night talking about education. I heard the \nPresident last night talking about early childhood development. \nSenators were on their feet applauding. So I am just saying since I saw \nwhat we did last Congress, I saw where we made the cuts, I want to hear \nSenators argue with me that, if there is another position here--almost \nall those cuts affected low-income citizens. Almost all those cuts \naffected poor children in America, the very citizens who do not get to \nthe bargaining table, the very citizens who do not march on Washington, \nDC, the very citizens who do not have lobbyists.\n  So I say to my colleagues who support this, how about giving me some \nreassurance and, more importantly, how about giving people in our \ncountry reassurance that when we do this we will make sure, one more \ntime, that Federal outlays shall not be reduced in a manner that \ndisproportionately affects outlays for education, nutrition and health \ncare programs for children; that we go on record that we are not going \nto cut benefits that deal with the Women, Infants, and Children \nProgram; that we are going to make sure that a woman expecting a child \nhas an adequate diet; that we are not going to make cuts in Head Start, \nwe are going to make sure these children are given a head start; and we \nare not going to make cuts in educational programs. It is real simple. \nIt is up-or-down votes.\n  I want to know exactly where my colleagues want to take our country \nwith this constitutional amendment to balance the budget. I want to \nknow what the priorities are. I want to know where the cuts are going \nto be. My understanding, and I will talk much more about this when I \nbring the amendments to the floor, is that the majority party, roughly \nspeaking, has about $500 billion of tax cuts, most of it accelerated \nbeyond the year 2002--my colleague is shaking his head. We can have a \ndebate upon that, and I will be very reassured if that is not the case.\n  Mr. President, if we have hundreds of billions of dollars, even if it \nis not $500 billion, in tax cuts and then the tradeoff is going to be \ncuts, but where? What is going to be the offset? They do not want to go \nafter the corporate welfare. They do not want to go after the Pentagon \nbudget. They want to have hundreds of billions of dollars of tax cuts, \nmost of it benefiting high-income, wealthy people. Where will the cuts \nbe?\n  In the last Congress almost all cuts focused on low-income families, \nlow-income children, educational programs. All those programs were in \njeopardy last time.\n  This time I think we need a reassurance and we need a strong vote in \nfavor of each of these amendments so that we can have a reassurance for \nmany, many citizens in our country. The goodness of America says do not \ncut Head Start. The goodness of America says do not cut the Women, \nInfants, and Children Program. The goodness of America says do not cut \nhealth care programs that will affect the status of children. The \ngoodness of America says do not make disproportionate cuts in any of \nthose programs. They have worked. They are important. They are vital.\n  I hope I will get 100 votes for each of these amendments. If not, \nthen my colleagues will be making their point. My colleagues will be \nsaying we refuse to vote for an amendment that puts us on record that \nwe will not reduce Federal outlays in a manner that disproportionately \naffects outlays for education, nutrition, and health programs for \nchildren. I cannot imagine why any Senator would vote against such an \namendment. We should go on record\n\n[[Page S1010]]\n\nand let the goodness of the Senate speak out on these amendments.\n  I look forward to coming to the floor with each of these amendments. \nI will have much supporting evidence. I want to talk about what \nhappened in the last Congress. I want to go over exactly where we made \nthe cuts, and I want to see if I can get my colleagues to make a \ncommitment that we will not continue down this path. I really do \nbelieve that the vast majority of people in America think it would be \nwrong to make more cuts in programs like WIC and Head Start, more cuts \nin programs that affect the health care, nutrition and educational \nstatus of our children.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I think we are about to conclude the \nbusiness of the Senate for today. Prior to that happening, I want to \nmake some opening observations about this historic constitutional \namendment, Senate Joint Resolution 1, that we have on the floor this \nevening and on which we have started debate.\n  Let me also say to my colleague from Minnesota, who has eloquently \nand passionately laid out a variety of critically important items for \nus to debate in the coming days, my colleague from Minnesota mentioned \nprograms that I support. I have always voted for Head Start, and I have \nalways voted for Women, Infants and Children. Those are very important \nprograms for our country. I am also one who says those programs have to \nbe funded within the context of a balanced budget.\n  I am standing here beside this 6-foot tall stack of budget documents, \nwhat I call the budgets of the era of liberalism. This is when America \nsaid that poor people ought to be cared for, and unprecedented in the \nworld, this Nation poured out its riches to the poor. Mr. President, 28 \nyears of budgets are represented here, and benefits resulted from some \nof what was in them.\n  We started the WIC program. We started Head Start in these budgets. \nThey were funded last year and will continue to be funded. But what \nhappened along the way? People did not seem to get better. People \nseemed to get poorer. While this Nation spoke about having a safety \nnet, and it must speak to the need for a safety net for the truly \nneedy, we began to learn lessons in the 1960's, 1970's and 1980's. We \nbegan to learn that handouts are not necessarily a hand up. In a \nsociety as wealthy as ours, while we truly need to be kind and caring--\nand the Senator from Minnesota is truly that, and I think that all \nSenators are--somehow, along the way, we began to realize that the \ncumulative effect of all these spending programs was to put the whole \nNation at risk. These 28 budgets--28 budget packages submitted by six \npresidents, both Democrats and Republicans--also represent $5.3 \ntrillion worth of debt. Enough money is paid out annually in interest \nto service the debt that these budgets created to fund all the programs \nthat the Senator from Minnesota wants and many, many more.\n  That is what the debate is about today. This debate is not about \nWomen, Infants, and Children. This debate is not about Head Start. This \ndebate is about fiscal responsibility. This debate is about making \ntough policy choices.\n  I am amazed that the Senator from Minnesota would fear the \nconstitutional amendment, as eloquent as he is on the issues that he is \nimpassioned about, because he can appeal to me and he will get my \nvote--within the context of a balanced budget--for Head Start and for \nWomen, Infants, and Children. Then he and I, working together, will \nhave to work with our other colleagues to make sure that we choose a \nrational spending policy that prioritizes these programs because we \ndecide to reduce elsewhere.\n  What I will not do and what this Congress will not do is send to the \nAmerican people for ratification a constitutional amendment with a \nloophole in it large enough to drive all of the trucks that service the \nindustries in Minnesota through. We dare not send to the American \npeople a phony document that they might put in the Constitution, in \nwhich we exempt all of these programs from the responsible \ndecisionmaking that the Senator from Minnesota and I want to make here \non the floor.\n  Should we exempt Social Security? If we exempted Social Security and \nWomen, Infants, and Children and Head Start and all of the other \nprograms being suggested, that is probably better than a third of the \nbudget. How can we turn to the American people and say now we have a \nbalanced budget when we just took a third of it off-budget? No longer \nwould we have the right to make the choice to set priorities. These \nwould autopilot programs. But instead of protecting these programs, \nthey would become the loophole through which to channel all sorts of \nnew and increased spending. I do not think the Senator from Minnesota \nwants that. I think what the Senator from Minnesota is speaking to is \nsetting priorities, making tough choices for the right reasons on the \nright issues for people who are less fortunate. If that is what he \nmeans, and I know he means that because I know him well, then he will \nhave the Presiding Officer's support and he will have my support.\n\n  What we would like to ask him to do is to join us in pleading that we \nget away from this stack of 28 unbalanced budgets in a row, that we get \naway from adding to this $5.3 trillion worth of debt, with its $340 \nbillion a year worth of interest to service the debt. Those huge \ninterest payments actually strip this country of its resources to do \nwhat that Senator wants done. If we did not have to pay all that \ninterest, if we had paid off the past Federal debts, then we would have \na surplus today of more than $100 billion a year, available to spend on \nprograms like those the Senator from Minnesota advances.\n  The American people now agree with us. Mr. President, 70 or 80 \npercent plus of the American people say a balanced budget is critical. \nPresident Clinton said last night he was sending us a balanced budget \ntomorrow. I bet he funds WIC, and I bet he funds Head Start, and I bet \ninside that budget is Social Security. This President, our President, \nlast night said that was a balanced budget.\n  A few moments ago the Senator from Massachusetts was on the floor, \nand he said we should treat Social Security differently--that there \nwill be an amendment to treat Social Security differently--from how we, \nthe Republicans and some Democrats want to under the balanced budget. \nHe said he wanted to keep it separate and apart. Then he spoke \neloquently about the President's budget, and the President treats \nSocial Security exactly the way Republicans want to treat it, leaving \nit inside the budget, making sure that our Government's fiscal house is \nin order so that a government whose budget is balanced is a government \nthat can meet its obligation. That is really the issue here, and that \nis the crux of the debate that will go on over the course of the next \nseveral weeks.\n\n  The Senator from Minnesota has approached us this afternoon with four \namendments. They are important amendments and they should be debated; \nthey should be voted on. I hope that my colleagues, in considering any \namendment, will consider that all of the budget be a part of the whole \nand the whole should be balanced. The Secretary of the Treasury does \nnot suggest that we split anything out of the budget. He suggests that \nwe deal with a whole budget, that we don't start prying things apart. \nThe President will present that kind of a budget tomorrow. The reason \nthat we want to make sure that happens is that it is time this country \nmakes the tough choices. I think that when we make those tough choices, \nunder the responsibility of a balanced budget requirement in our \nConstitution, social spending programs critical to the truly needy of \nour country will survive.\n  For a few moments, Mr. President, let me talk about what stands \nbefore us here. Twenty-eight years of endlessly unbalanced budgets are \nstacked here at my right hand, 28 years of deficit spending, 28 years \nsince the last time this Government balanced its budget in 1969. Now, \n14 of these 28 budgets were never intended to be balanced. They were \nintended to be in deficit, to create debt. But 14 of them--the other \nhalf--promised a balanced budget at some point. It was the same kind of \npromise we heard from President Clinton last night. These were sincere \npromises, all 14 of these budgets that promised eventual balance, \nspread over the last 28 years. And I do not question this President's \nsincerity in promising yet another budget that reaches balance in a few \nyears. I believe that he\n\n[[Page S1011]]\n\nbelieves he can produce a balanced budget.\n  What was the rhetoric last night? ``You vote for it and I will sign \nit.'' The problem is choice making--choice making in an environment in \nwhich we don't have to make hard choices. And as a result of not having \nto make hard choices, wanting to serve the needs of the American \npeople, wanting to address the truly needy, Congresses and Presidents \ninstead have made easy choices, 28 long years of easy choices.\n  Oh, they were tough choices at the time, or at least they felt tough. \nBut when you know you don't have to balance the budget--you do not \nreally set priorities and make hard choices. And we went through an era \nwhen deficit spending was supposed to be good because it supposedly \nstimulated the economy and created jobs. Well, that may have been all \nright in some instances when we didn't have a $5.3 trillion debt, when \nservice on the debt was $5 or $6 billion a year and was a minuscule \npart of a total budget. All of a sudden, over the last decade and a \nhalf, this debt has exploded on the American scene and on the American \ntaxpayer's pocketbook. Today, Social Security and the interest on debt \ncreated by these 28 budgets now rival each other as to which is the \nlargest single expenditure in the annual budgets of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  That is why, consistently over recent years, the American people have \nsaid to this Congress--Republican or Democrat-- ``Get your fiscal house \nin order and balance the Federal budget.'' Seventy-plus percent of the \nAmerican people want a constitutional amendment. But recently polled, \nonly 12 percent really believed that we would get to a balanced budget \nby the year 2002. Why? Here is the reason why: 28 consistent years of \npromises made and promises broken to the real people of this country, \nthe taxpayer who now feels exploited and put upon largely because this \nCongress and Congresses like it promised but failed to deliver. Twenty-\neight years of budgets submitted by Presidents that promised deficit \nreduction or balanced budgets that never came to be.\n  Twenty-eight years of borrowing, a total of 36 deficits in 37 years, \n$5.3 trillion worth of gross debt. That is $20,000 of debt for every \nman, woman, and child in America. So the majority of all the real \npeople living in this country today have seen a budget actually \nbalanced only once or never. And they now question the integrity of \ntheir Government and the reality of what this country really is about \nand, more important, what its politicians are about.\n\n  We will honor the promises made by Social Security because we want to \nand because we must. It is a contract with the elderly of our country. \nA government whose budget is balanced is a government that can honor \nthat pledge. A government that is in bankruptcy sends no checks out to \na defense contractor, to an elderly person, or to a single parent on \nwelfare.\n  That's the reality of the debate. Somehow we think there are special \nneeds that could get separated out. At a time when our Government finds \nits fiscal house increasingly in trouble, if it goes bankrupt, no \nchecks go out. That is why, for over 3 years, those who believe in a \nbalanced budget amendment have argued against those who wish to exempt \nout Social Security and other unique social programs. We understand \nthat the threat to Social Security, the threat to Women, Infants and \nChildren, the threat to Head Start, is not the balanced budget \namendment, but the debt. Why are we having to cut back on spending on \nsome programs today? Because we did not balance the budget for so many \nyears before now. Because of deficits and because of a huge, heavy debt \nstructure, and because the American people are saying, ``Fix it, it's \nbroken, correct it.''\n  What does it mean? What does this stack of paper--thousands of pages \nof debt--say to the average American family? Well, it's something like \nthis, in the sense of what it costs them. Since the time I started \ndebating this issue in 1982 until today it represents $15,000 for every \nAmerican family in income loss, minimally--$15,000. That means that the \naverage American family's income today--if we had balanced the Federal \nbudget in 1982 and kept it balanced until 1997--would be $15,000 more. \nThose are not my figures. Those are the figures based on a study by the \nConcord Coalition. We talk of the needy and of wanting to care for \npeople. Put an extra $15,000 in every American family's budget and see \nwhat kind of help you have offered them. But, instead, the Government \nhas taken those fruits of their hard work to service the debt structure \nrepresented by 28 years of profligate deficit spending.\n  What does it mean to a household with a 30-year mortgage if the \neconomists are right and we pass this amendment and balance the budget? \nInterest rates drop 1\\1/2\\ to 2 points. And that $30,000 to the average \nAmerican family, saved on a 30-year mortgage, is a year in one of the \nmost expensive colleges in the country. Or if you are in Idaho, that is \n2\\1/2\\ to 3 years of college education in our land grant university. \nThat is a lot of money. Where does it go today? Out of the working \nperson's pocketbook into the IRS coffers to pay to service the debt \nstructure created right here by Congresses past--caring and well-\nmeaning Congresses--that created this stack of paper representing $5.3 \ntrillion worth of debt.\n  Well, if there is frustration in this debate for some of our Members, \nI don't reject their concerns and I don't take it lightly. I must say \nthat it may be frustration that we have inflicted upon ourselves, \nbecause it is now necessary to propose a constitutional amendment that \nis very simple. It gives us plenty of latitude to get our fiscal house \nin order by 2002. It does so in a way that also creates the necessary \nflexibility in times of real need and in times of war. It says that \nthere are margins in which deficit spending can occur, but now it will \ntake tough choices to deficit spend, not the automatic and easy choices \nof past years, not ``oh, well, we will make it up next year or a few \nyears down the road.''\n\n  We will see a variety of amendments to the balanced budget amendment \nthat will come to the floor in the next several weeks. Senators that \nwill talk impassionedly about certain priorities that are all critical \nand all important. And all these priorities can be served inside a \nbalanced budget by tough decisions and tough choices on this Congress.\n  What am I talking about this evening? Correcting a problem that we \ncreated, correcting a problem that threatens--not me, not the Presiding \nOfficer, and not the Senator from Vermont, but his children, my \nchildren, our grandchildren, and future generations of American \ncitizens who will want to be as productive as we hope we have been.\n  How important is correcting that problem of adding to the debt? The \nOffice of Management and Budget--President Clinton's Office of \nManagement and Budget--said that if we continue down the path that this \nCongress and other Congresses have been on, future generations would \npay 82 percent of their total income in taxes for all levels of \ngovernment because of debt, debt service, and government needs--82 \npercent. That means there is no money left to buy a house, there is no \nmoney to put in a savings account for a rainy day, and there is no \nmoney left for a college education.\n  So what happens? You turn to your government, and the endless process \nis always underway of a government having to do something for more \npeople because government has taken so much from those who worked so \nhard and find themselves getting nowhere.\n  That is why this has to be corrected, or there will be no future for \nthe young people of our country. Because a future in which 82 percent \nof your gross pay goes to all levels of government is no future at all. \nThose are some of the kinds of things we are talking about.\n  A child born today--again, not my figures, but those of the National \nTaxpayers Union--a child born today will pay an additional $180,000 in \ntaxes during his or her lifetime to service the Federal debt--debt that \nhis or her grandmas and grandpas spent but didn't pay for. And that is \na tragedy.\n  Our friend Paul Simon, the now retired Senator from Illinois, who is \nas liberal as I am conservative but who stood shoulder to shoulder with \nme for a decade fighting the battle of the balanced budget amendment to \nour Constitution, called it fiscal child abuse. And he is right. \nBecause that legacy of crushing debt is no future for any child\n\n[[Page S1012]]\n\nborn in America today, having that obligation out in front of them, \nbeing required of them by their Government for from which something \nthey get no value. That is why this issue has become the No. 1 issue in \nAmerica.\n  Our President spoke of valuable priorities last night, important \nissues--education, some tax cuts, the kind of priorities that an \nAmerican wants to be proud of and wants to be a part of. Republican or \nDemocrat, there were many of us who heard a President last night speak \nof issues that we can all identify with. But in doing so, we say, with \na simple caveat: They must be within the limit and the capacity of the \nability of the Government to pay for them, and the permission of our \ncitizens to pay for them, within a balanced budget. It is a simple \nrequirement. The problem is that the choices are tough, but that is \nwhat my job is and that is what I have hired on to do, as has the \nPresiding Officer, and as has the Senator from Vermont.\n  In the coming days, as we debate, I hope we can see the very clear \ndifferences between those who oppose requiring fiscal responsibility, \nwho do not want the citizens of this country through the Constitution \nto impose that kind of discipline on the floor of this Senate, and \nthose of us who say that after 28 years of endless spending, endless \ndebt, and endless deficits, it is time we offer the American people the \nchoice of whether to require that kind of constitutional discipline.\n  The time is growing late. It is our intent to adjourn as soon as we \ncan. But the debate will go on through tomorrow and next week, and we \nhope through the balance of February, as we deal with this issue and as \nMembers of the Senate speak their will, as they should, because I know \nof no issue more important than this constitutional amendment.\n\n  Our vote will not make it so. Our Founding Fathers decided that was \nnot our job. Our vote is simply to propose to the American people a \nconstitutional amendment. And then 38 States, three-fourths of the \nStates must vote to ratify, and the debate will go on in every State \ncapital across this country--the debate about Government, the Federal \nGovernment, and its budgets and its priorities. And that will be one of \nthe healthiest debates the American citizenry has ever been involved \nin. From that, Senators serving in this Congress and future Congresses \nwill not only have the absolute constitutional requirement to balance \nthe budget, but they will probably have a much clearer idea of what the \nAmerican people expect of their Federal Government. That ratification \nprocess is an important process. If we send forth this amendment, we \nwill have started in this country what I think not only assures that we \nget our fiscal house in order, but it assures future generations the \nsame kind of opportunity that all of us have had in our lifetime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will not be long because, if nobody else \nwants to go home, I know that staff who serve in this body probably \nwould like to, including the young pages on both sides of the aisle. \nThey are as important as any contributors to this body. They keep us \ngoing. I hope that for all of them their service here will be an \nexperience that they will remember all of their lives as worthwhile. I \nknow that former Senator Pryor, who just recently retired, had been a \npage and felt that way. I know two of my children were pages--here and \nin the other body--and feel that way.\n  Mr. President, my good friend from Idaho--he is my good friend--spoke \neloquently of the stacks of budgets. You know that every year we do \nhave a large document that represents the Federal budget, but I would \npoint out to him that no constitutional amendment is needed to balance \nthose budgets.\n  I have great affection for President Reagan. We had a very good \npersonal relationship. I used to kid him that every year he would talk \nabout a need for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, and \nthen he would send up a budget that increased our national debt, \nsomething he did more than any President in our Nation's history. By \nthe time he got done, he had doubled or tripled the national debt that \nhad taken over 200 years to build up.\n  He had wonderful speeches saying, ``Let us balance the budget. But, \nby the way, guys, here is my budget, and guess what is in it? It is one \nmore huge deficit.''\n  We talk about charts showing how the deficits went up and they did \nthroughout the 1980's. From President Reagan's election to President \nClinton's election, they skyrocketed more than in all the Nation's \nhistory put together before those 12 years--more than all the debt that \nhad been arisen from World War II, World War I, the Civil War, the War \nof 1812, from all of our wars combined, and from all of our depressions \nand from all of our recessions. In just 12 years, the amount of debt \nthat had grown up was doubled and tripled.\n  We talk about the last 28 years. Well, President Clinton is the only \nPresident in those 28 years--and now for 4 years in a row--who has \nbrought down the deficit. That is not withstanding the fact that he has \nto find in our budget several hundred million dollars every day, every \nsingle day, just to pay the interest on the debt that was built up \nduring President Reagan's and President Bush's terms.\n  I have great affection for President Reagan and President Bush. I \nfelt privileged to think of them as friends. But there is a big \ndifference between the rhetoric and the reality when it came to \nbalancing the budget with them. The debt that the Senator from Idaho so \neloquently speaks of, in terms of our children and our children's \nchildren, the vast bulk of that debt built up just during those 12 \nyears when some talked the talk but were not willing to walk the walk. \nAnd now we have to pay it off.\n  In 4 years, President Clinton has submitted budgets and fought hard \nfor them. For 4 years, he has brought the deficit down. No President in \nmy lifetime, Republican or Democrat, has done that. This year he is \ntrying to reduce the deficit, again, and achieve a balanced budget \nagreement for the next several years.\n\n  We talk of amending this Constitution, this little, short \nConstitution, the greatest Constitution democracy ever had and the \nreason we are the most powerful democracy known to history. We talk \nabout amending it as if we could, then we all go home and 10 years from \nnow somehow the amendment would magically come into play and the \nFederal budget would be balanced. President Clinton told us last night \nthat all it takes to balance the budget is our votes, courageous votes, \nand his signature. We can balance the budget and we can do it now \nwithout a constitutional amendment.\n  So, instead of amending our Constitution, why not proceed to use our \nvotes. I hold up here the voting lists with the names of all Senators \nand places marked where they can vote ``yea'' or ``nay.'' Every one of \nus can stand up and vote ``yea'' or ``nay'' for a balanced budget. That \nis all it takes. We do not have to go through and say 10 years from now \nmaybe the States will ratify it and it will be in place and maybe some \nfuture Congress will act to make the tough decisions. We can vote right \nthis minute, today, this month, this year and do what we should do--\nmake the tough decisions ourselves.\n  There are only five Senators remaining in this body who had the \ncourage to vote against Reaganomics, which tripled the national debt. I \nam proud to be one of those five. I have cast the tough votes. I have \nhad special-interest groups from the right and the left, from my State \nand your State and every other State, come and give me heck for voting \nagainst their favorite programs. I have probably written as much \nlegislation as anybody here that has cut huge hunks out of the Federal \nbudget, cuts that affected my State as well as others. But that is the \nway you do it. You do not cast a vote that is just a nice, popular \nthing that fits the polls of the moment. You cast votes that run the \ntest of time.\n  I urge us to be courageous and think of the future. My children are \ngoing to live most of their lives in the next century, and when I vote \nI think of what that next century will be. I do not want them burdened \nwith debt.\n  I wish the debt had not gone up as it did during the 1980's. I think \nit was a great mistake. This body went along\n\n[[Page S1013]]\n\nwith it. I commend the political abilities of President Reagan. He got \nwithin one-quarter of 1 percent of every single budget he ever asked \nfor. In fact, when we talk about the veto pen, the only appropriation, \nor spending bill that President Reagan ever vetoed was one that did not \ngive him as much money as he wanted. He never vetoed a bill because it \nhad too much money. The only spending bill he ever vetoed was one that \ndid not give him all the money he wanted. As I recall, the years when \nthe Democrats were in office, we actually came back with budgets that \nwere smaller than asked for.\n  What was, was; what is, is. What is today is the ability, as \nPresident Clinton said last night, to vote for and enact a balanced \nbudget.\n  Economists are not asking for a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution. Over 1,000 economists signed a letter, including 11 Nobel \nlaureates, saying do not amend the Constitution; it creates far more \nproblems than it solves. What they said was balance the budget, which \nwe can do if we have the courage, but do not amend the Constitution to \ndo it. Even as conservative a newspaper as the Wall Street Journal \nyesterday had an editorial saying do not vote for this constitutional \namendment. Certainly nobody thinks of Alan Greenspan as a profligate, \nshoot-for-the-Moon kind of spender, and Alan Greenspan said do not pass \nthis constitutional amendment. Secretary Rubin, one of the most trusted \nand respected Secretaries of the Treasury any administration has had, \nsays do not pass this constitutional amendment. Instead of passing a \nbumper-sticker form of economics, do what is right. Have the courage to \nvote for budgets and spending bills that bring about a balanced budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, for the past ten years I have spoken out \nin favor of a Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment, and have \nsupported and voted for this measure each time I have had the \nopportunity to do so.\n  In fact, in preparing for this statement, I looked back on my career \nin Congress to see how many times I have supported this measure, and I \nnoted with interest that in January 1987, my first month of being a \nmember of the House of Representatives, I joined as an original \ncosponsor to the Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment. One of the \nprimary sponsors of the legislation on the House side was my colleague, \nSenator Craig, and on the Senate side, Senator Hatch was in the \nforefront introducing the measure in this body. It is with great \npleasure that I join my friends in this effort once again, along with \nwell over 50 of my Senate colleagues.\n  Opponents believe it would be easy to give up on the idea of passing \nthe Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment. For a number of years, \ndespite the hard work of many individuals, this measure has failed to \npass through Congress and move on to the states for ratification where \nit belongs. I believe passage of this Amendment is in the best interest \nof the future of our country because it will force us to make the tough \ndecisions now that need to be made to balance the budget and eventually \neliminate the staggering debt that threatens the economic well-being of \nevery American.\n  Now, there are those that believe there is no need for the Balanced \nBudget Constitutional Amendment--that the federal government can be \nfiscally responsible without being mandated by the Constitution to do \nso. Well, I have been a Member of Congress for 10 years now, and I have \nyet to see Congress or the administration bite the bullet, balance the \nbudget, and tackle our enormous debt.\n  Just last week, the Congressional Budget Office released one of its \nannual reports making projections on the economic and budget outlook \nfor Fiscal Years 1998-2007. According to CBO, last year's deficit was \n$107 billion, making it the fourth year in a row that the deficit has \ndecreased. However, the news is not all good. CBO also projects that \nthe deficit will increase for Fiscal Year 1997 to become $124 billion. \nAnd, if we do not commit ourselves to balancing the budget, and \ndiscretionary spending keeps pace with inflation, this country will be \nfaced with a deficit estimated at $278 billion in 2007.\n  What does all this mean? It means that nothing ever changes. Year \nafter year we are faced with huge deficits and an increasing national \ndebt. Year after year we talk about doing the right thing, the \nresponsible thing, and passing a balanced budget. And yet, once again, \nhere we are debating the merits of the Balanced Budget Constitutional \nAmendment.\n  Back in my home state of Colorado, I have been conducting a series of \ntown meetings, discussing a wide range of issues with my friends and \nconstituents. When the discussion turns to balancing the budget, \nColoradans realize that if we do not address this important issue with \nConstitutional authority, the amount of the federal budget devoted \ntoward paying off the interest on the debt and the entitlement programs \nwill increase to the point that there will be barely any money left for \nthose programs which deserve and require Federal funding.\n  Currently, more than half of the $1.6 trillion in spending goes \ntoward the entitlements and mandatory spending. According to CBO, ``if \ncurrent policies remain unchanged, mandatory spending will be twice as \nlarge as discretionary spending by 2002.'' In addition, another 15 \npercent of all outlays goes toward interest costs on the debt. This is \nmoney that does not go toward education, law enforcement, national \nsecurity, or even our national parks and monuments. As far as I am \nconcerned, it is wasted money. My constituents realize this, and on \ntheir behalf I continue to fight for the Balanced Budget Constitutional \nAmendment.\n  Now, I am not saying that this Amendment will be the silver bullet \nwhich solves all of our problems. However, it will make us accountable \nto the Constitution and to the will of a majority of Americans and \nforce us to get our fiscal house in order. If we achieve a balanced \nbudget and reduce the deficit, we can expect even lower interest rates, \nan increased savings rate, and increased economic growth for every \nAmerican. Essentially, Americans can expect an increase in their \nstandard of living, and I think that is something everyone of us wants \nand deserves.\n  Congress came within one vote last session of passing the Balanced \nBudget Constitutional Amendment. I am optimistic that this year we can \npass this legislation and send the measure on to the states for their \ndeliberation. It is time to allow the American people and the state \nlegislatures the opportunity to debate the merits of the Balanced \nBudget Constitutional Amendment, and I hope that the Congress will see \nfit to entrust this measure to those who must ratify or reject it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to speak in \nbehalf of the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n  I especially thank two of my colleagues, Mr. Domenici, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, and Mr. Hatch, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee for their \nlongstanding leadership and efforts in behalf of this legislation and \nin effect, enabling us to protect the financial and economic future of \nour children and their children.\n  Mr. President, for those who have had the perseverance and tenacity \nto pursue this goal, it has at times been a lonely trail. Whatever \nsuccess we might achieve and I hope that we will achieve has been in \nlarge part due to the efforts of these two Senators.\n  I have read some interesting commentary regarding this effort. Our \nopponents predict dark budget clouds for Social Security and any other \nprogram deemed essential to a particular economic interest group. But, \ncontrary to that dire prediction, I see a bright future with the sum of \nthe balanced budget parts. I see a nation with 6.1 million more jobs in \n10 years. I see lower interest rates that will directly affect the \ndaily lives and pocketbooks of every citizen in terms of the amount of \nhard-earned income they pay now for living essentials, health care, \nhousing, education loans, food, and transportation. With a 2-percent \ndrop in interest rates, how would you like 6 months of groceries free \nor corresponding savings in your health care premium costs, mortgage \npayment, student loan? Compare those savings with the marginal \nreductions in the amount of growth of Federal programs.\n  In his State of the Union Address, the President said: ``Don't give \nme a balanced budget amendment; give me a balanced budget.''\n\n[[Page S1014]]\n\n  I must say I agree. But, with all due respect, Mr. President, many of \nmy colleagues and I have done just that to no avail. During the last \nsession of Congress, we sent two balanced budgets to 1600 Pennsylvania \nAvenue and despite exhaustive effort, we were not able to reach \nagreement or accommodation.\n  However, I must say that passing the balanced budget amendment and \ntwo budgets that were, in fact, in balance did provide the kind of \nfiscal backbone and tenacity not seen in the Congress for decades. In \nmy own case, I was proud of our efforts within the House Agriculture \nCommittee in enacting farm program and food stamp reform that also \nproduced an estimated $33 billion in savings over the life of the \nbudget agreement. So, I agree with you. It can be done. And, with our \nreform of farm program policy passing by overwhelming margins, we also \nproved there is bipartisan support for true reform and budget savings. \nWe also achieved considerable budget savings in discretionary spending \nat the conclusion of the appropriations process; something unique to \nthe last Congress.\n  However, the real problem is that while there is considerable talk \nabout accepting responsibility and standing four square for a balanced \nbudget, there are serious differences of opinion as to how to bring the \nbudget into balance. Which programs will be cut? Do we have the \npolitical wherewithal to save Medicare and other entitlements? In this \nregard, the President and many of our friends across the aisle stated \nover and over again they are for a balanced budget but not that \nbudget--that budget meaning any cuts in their favorite and priority \nprograms.\n  And, I must say, despite the fact that a Republican Congress and the \nPresident were within $10 a month difference in regard to preventing \nMedicare bankruptcy, the fact we were not able to reach agreement and \nthe fact that the Democrat Party made a conscious decision to make \nMedicare a top issue in last year's campaign, I am not overly confident \nany budget agreement can be worked out--unless we have to--unless there \nis some outside discipline that will force Congress to get the job \ndone. The lure of political opportunism is just too great, the coming \ndebate regarding Social Security being a classic example.\n\n  The real question is, does the Congress have the fortitude, the \nperseverance and the tenacity to balance the budget? Despite good men \nand women of both parties and the best of intentions, it is now the \n28th year in which a majority in the Congress has failed in efforts for \nthe Federal Government to live within its means. We all agree we must \nmake progress toward a balanced budget and then during the course of \npolitical deliberations we most generally agree to disagree as to how \nto achieve this goal. It is clear that if there is anything to be \nlearned during the time we have regretfully experienced ever increasing \ndeficits, it is that we need a balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution to get the job done.\n  With the fall of the Greek Republic as an example, there is a theory \nthat a democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. The \ntheory is it can only exist until the voters discover that they can \nvote themselves largesse from the public treasury. From that moment on, \nthe majority always votes for the candidates promising the most \nbenefits with the result that a democracy always collapses over a loose \nfiscal policy.\n  That is the theory. If true, it is a terrible prospect.\n  Mr. President, I choose not to accept that dire prediction but I must \nsay given our most recent history and given the fact our best efforts \nfell short during the last session of Congress, I believe this debate, \nthis legislation, and this time represents our vest best opportunity to \nset our Nation's fiscal house in order.\n  As President Clinton stated, ``We don't need a constitutional \namendment to balance the budget, we need action.'' Again, with due \nrespect to the President, it is indeed time for action and for action, \nwe need a constitutional amendment to get the job done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam President, I rise today to give some opening \nremarks with respect to the resolution on the balanced budget that is \nnow before us. I suspect during the course of the next several weeks in \nthe debate that is ahead, I will probably be here several more times to \ndiscuss various aspects of this resolution as well as some of the \namendments which are going to be offered. But today I thought I would \njust make some initial comments regarding what I consider to be the \nneed, the necessity really, for this amendment, both why we need a \nbalanced budget, why we need to have a balanced budget amendment, and \nwhy we need to do it now.\n  First of all, I think it should be clear to all Americans why we need \na balanced budget, although it certainly has not been the case that the \nCongress or the President, over the last many, many years, has \nresponded to the public's demands. The first reason is simple. We have \ngone literally a generation without balancing the budget.\n  Just a few minutes ago, all of these budgets were presented to us, \nreflecting the many years in which we have failed to balance the \nbudget. This is as close to balancing the budget as we have come today, \npiling these documents on top of each other and making sure they do not \nfall over, but that is as close to balancing the budget as we have been \nin a quarter of a century. These years of deficits have to come to an \nend.\n  We need a balanced budget also because a failure to balance the \nbudget has hurt the economy. To the extent that Government borrows, it \nmeans less capital is available for private citizens to borrow. That \nmeans that our economy cannot grow as fast as we would like it. It has \nespecially meant that families in America have suffered. Families have \nsuffered to the extent that the Federal Government's encroachment in \ncapital markets means higher interest rates, higher interest rates on \nnew home purchases, on new automobile loans, on student loans, on the \nvariety of other things which average, hardworking American families \nmust seek financing.\n  It has also hurt our families in the sense we are passing on to our \nchildren what is obviously a mountain of debt. Kids in America today, \nas one of the earlier speakers, the Senator from Idaho, indicated, \ninherit immediately upon their birth, an enormous responsibility for \ndebts built up by past Congresses. A child born in America today--and I \nhave a 5-month-old child so I suspect it applies to him--is immediately \nresponsible for paying over his or her lifetime something in the \nvicinity of $180,000 in taxes simply to pay his or her share of this \ndebt.\n  That is certainly not the kind of legacy that was passed on to my \ngeneration. It is not the legacy I intend to pass on to my children's \ngeneration. Therefore, it is essential that we balance the budget and \nwe do so immediately so we do not continue to hurt our families, our \nbusinesses, and especially our children.\n  The next question is why we need a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget. Indeed it is true, as many have said, that simply \nan action by Congress and the President would bring about a balanced \nbudget. But, as we have seen just in the last 2 years, saying it and \ndoing it are very different things. We reached an impasse in Washington \nin 1995. I don't think it's an impasse that was unique to the 104th \nCongress or President Clinton. I think it is the kind of impasse that \nis likely to be reached on almost any occasion in which the Congress of \nthe United States is controlled by one political party and the \nexecutive branch is controlled by someone from the other party. The \nimpasse was over spending priorities. But, even though everyone on all \nsides of the issue said they wanted a balanced budget, we did not get a \nbalanced budget because of that impasse. The absence of a \nconstitutional requirement that we balance the budget, that outlays not \nexceed revenues to the Federal Government, meant that the impasse \ncontinued in spite of the rhetoric on all sides, in spite of all of the \nbalanced budget proposals that flowed from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and \non Capitol Hill. Despite all of that, we never got to the balanced \nbudget. It is my view that, without an amendment, without a \nconstitutional requirement that the Congress and the President bring \nabout a balanced budget, impasses such as the one that existed during \nthe winter of 1995 will occur again.\n\n  Another reason I believe we need an amendment is because we do not \nknow\n\n[[Page S1015]]\n\nwhat the future will bring, and we need to have a permanent safeguard \nagainst the kinds of deficits that have plagued the Nation over the \npast quarter of a century. Yes, today, today in America, talking about \nbalancing the budget, advocating a balanced budget, is politically \npopular and what the American people are demanding. But, as we have \nseen for a quarter of a century, something that is simply politically \npopular may not get done. We have no idea what future Congresses will \nthink about this issue. If we provide this sort of loophole that a \nfailure to pass this amendment provides, we will be right where we have \nbeen for the last 25 years.\n  Yes, it is possible we all might get together and in this Congress, \neven though the parties that control the Congress and the White House \nare different, we might finally reach a balanced budget for the year \n2002. But what about the year 2003, or 2005, or 2010? What is the \nsafeguard the American people deserve, to guarantee that in those years \nthe same atmosphere that will bring about a balanced budget maybe in 1 \nyear, will continue? I think the only safeguard will be an amendment to \nthe Constitution.\n  The last issue is why now? I think the crisis we confront today is \none of the strongest arguments that we could have for balancing the \nbudget. But the crises that fiscally will afflict this country in \nanother 15 or 20 years are an even stronger argument for this amendment \nat this time. As we know, projections with respect to a variety of \nFederal spending programs, particularly the Federal entitlement \nprograms, suggest that as the baby boom generation members age and \nultimately become consumers of entitlements rather than providers of \nrevenue to the Federal Government, such programs as Medicare and \nretirement programs will begin to run even greater costs than they do \nat this time. What we need to do is get our fiscal house in order today \nso that when those greater demands on the Federal Government begin to \noccur, we have the resources necessary to ensure they are honored. A \nconstitutional amendment that prohibits us from running the deficits \nthat are reflected in this stack of budgets before me will assist us in \ngetting our fiscal house in order.\n  In summary, the average family in my State of Michigan has interests \nrates that are unnecessarily high due to the deficits we have run and \ndue to the borrowing of the Federal Government. Because of that, the \naverage family in my State does not have as much to spend on its \npriorities as it deserves.\n  That family's parents should have more income to spend on their \nchildren and their priorities and send less dollars to Washington and \nless dollars on interest payments than they do at this time. We need a \nbalanced budget to help that working family in Michigan.\n  America's long-term security also is at stake. America deserves to \nhave fiscal integrity so that as we move forward into the 21st century, \nthis debt does not bind us down, this debt does not undermine our \neconomic security, this debt does not hold America back as we try to \ncompete in the global economy, this ever-more competitive global \neconomy, in the years ahead.\n  For all these reasons, I think action is required now. I think a \nbalanced budget is a necessity, and I think the only way to achieve it \nis with an amendment to the Constitution that not only brings about a \nbalanced budget in the year 2002, but assures we will continue \nbalancing the budget into the next century and into the future of our \nNation.\n  For those reasons, Madam President, I support the balanced budget \namendment. I look forward to continuing this debate as we move forward \ninto the next few weeks and hope that by the time we reach a final vote \non this issue, two-thirds of our colleagues will join together to \nfinally change the direction here in Washington, in America and, most \nimportantly, end the unbroken series of Federal deficit represented by \nthis stack of budgets standing next to me.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/05/senate-section/article/S994-4", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1015-S1016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO PATRICK ORMSBY\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I rise today to pay a special tribute \nto a young man, a member of my staff, who was taken from us before his \ntime by cancer last week: Pat Ormsby of Spokane, WA. Pat taught me and \neveryone he touched a most important lesson--how to live life to the \nfullest with courage, and how to die with dignity.\n  Pat came to my office just a few years ago, but he was no stranger to \nNorthwest politics. For 10 years he served on the staff of former \nSpeaker Tom Foley. A schoolteacher, Pat started in Mr. Foley's office \nas a constituent caseworker and eventually moved to the Nation's \nCapital to become his adviser for agriculture issues.\n  His reputation was one of someone who was hardworking, down to earth, \nnever caught in the insider beltway thinking. He was always remembering \nto do what was right for the people he knew so well--the people of \nSpokane and eastern Washington.\n  Two years ago, Pat wanted to return home to Washington State to raise \nhis family. As it happened, we crossed paths at an opportune time: he \nwas job-hunting just when I was looking for an eastern Washington \ndirector. Pat fit the bill perfectly, and I could not have asked for a \nbetter hire.\n  For the past 2 years, Pat ran my Spokane office. He worked diligently \nfor the people: he was always there to take cases and advise my D.C. \nstaff on issues like agriculture and business that so intimately \naffected the lives of the people around him. He was known across the \ncountryside, and everyone to a person, loved him.\n  Pat was the guy we counted on. Quiet. Unassuming. But always honest, \nforthright, and clear. His advice on the farm bill, taxes, even welfare \nreform was always on target, because Pat always knew we worked for the \npeople--and we were there to serve them first.\n  He was rare in political circles. He brought a certain generosity and \ngood humor to the job that is not seen too often in politics any more. \nHe loved it, he worked tirelessly, he loved being in the thick of \nthings, but he never let it go to his head. And though he was a \ncommitted Democrat, he took pains to avoid bringing any partisan edge \nto his work. He never forgot who he was--a dad and husband first, a \npublic servant, and a devoted community member.\n  Last spring Pat shared with us that he and his wife Janet were \nexpecting a second child in November, as his first son, Miles, was just \nturning 3. A happier man, you could not find.\n  But July of this year brought tough news. Pat was diagnosed with \nliver cancer. The news of his illness was tough on all of us who knew \nhim. There was universal disbelief. Everyone I talked to wanted to \nhelp, to change the course of his illness, to do something.\n  Inevitably, these conversations would bring out a funny story about \nPat, about his tireless work on some project like housing, or commodity \nprograms, or taking extra time to help a constituent who was upset and \nfeeling frustrated with a bureaucracy. And the more I heard from \npeople, the more clear it became just how special a person Pat was.\n  Despite chemotherapy and exhaustive treatment, Pat determinedly came \nto the office each day, after taking time to go to church and put his \nfaith in God. He continued to be the one to encourage all of us, and to \nlet us know he was going to be all right no matter what happened.\n  Recently it became clear his battle was coming to an end. Pat in his \nquiet way prepared all of us. He maintained what I can only call a \nrelentless optimism. He reminded us of his deep faith, and said his \ngreatest joy was seeing his new son, Paul, come into the world at the \nend of September. He even had the audacity to apologize when it became \nclear he could no longer work, but quickly added that he didn't mind \nbecause he never liked the commute. Somehow, amazingly, he always \nemphasized the positives.\n  He took care of his family and prepared for their future. Again, with \ngreat humor, he reminded us it was actually a blessing that he had time \nto do everything necessary to chart a path for them. He took the time \nto tell each of us who knew him that it was OK, not an end, just a new \nbeginning for him.\n\n[[Page S1016]]\n\n  A week and a half ago in Spokane, friends, family, and coworkers \ngathered together to honor Pat. Mayor Jack Geraghty declared it Pat \nOrmsby Appreciation Day in Spokane. We gathered with Pat to share \nfeelings and stories about him and his endless contributions. Pat again \nthanked us all and said his goodbyes.\n  Last Thursday, we lost Pat. Our staff came together and shared a \nquiet moment. It was hard to believe he was gone, and it still is. He \nhad become such an important part of our lives, as an example of a true \npublic servant and family man--who always put others before himself and \ngave something of his life to so many.\n  It is not fair that children so young should be denied their father, \nor Janet her husband. But the steps he took to prepare near the end, \nand the way he lived his life, will be there to show how much he loved \nthem. And because of the example he set, those children will carry \nsomething of their father with them always.\n  We are grateful we knew him, and we are especially grateful to his \nfamily for sharing him. We are comforted now only in knowing that a bit \nof Pat lives on in each of us who knew him: his courage, his common \nsense, and his pride in community, State, and country. Pat, in his \nshort life, did what each of us should--gave much more than he \nreceived. We will miss him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/05/senate-section/article/S1015-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BREAST CANCER SCREENING GUIDELINES RESOLUTION\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, last night the Senate voted on a \nresolution proposed by the Presiding Officer, Senator Snowe of Maine, \nregarding the urgent need for breast cancer research funding. I was \nunable to be here to cast a vote for that bill because I was at home \nattending a funeral of my staff member, but I wish the Record to \nreflect that I would have voted ``aye'' on the resolution by Senator \nSnowe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I would like to thank my friends, \nSenators Snowe and Mikulski, for offering their resolution in support \nof regular mammograms for women over 40. While I certainly respect the \nNational Cancer Institute and its work, I, too, am very concerned about \ntheir recent conclusion that standard mammography guidelines for women \nages 40 to 49 are unnecessary.\n  At a time when there is still so much we do not know about breast \ncancer, I believe it is particularly important that we take the best \nscience available and advise women based on its conclusions. More and \nmore, we are learning that preventive care is the best way to catch \nbreast cancer in time to save a woman's life. With that knowledge, we \nfought hard for Medicare coverage of mammography screening, and now \nPresident Clinton is proposing we expand that coverage.\n  We all know that mammographies save not only lives, but Federal \ndollars as well. The cost of annual mammographies is far less than the \ncost of mastectomies, radiation, or other treatments. M. President, I \nbelieve we are headed in the right direction with these policies, and \nstepping back from encouraging annual check ups is not sending a \nconsistent message to women. Instead, we should be making the same \ncommitment to women between the ages of 40 and 50 as we have to those \nwho are older. Evidence shows that this is the age when the risk of \nbreast cancer increases for many women--and continues to climb in later \nyears.\n  According to the American Cancer Society, the incidence of breast \ncancer in the United States has leveled off in recent years. That is \nvery good news. Even still, in my home State an estimated 3,500 women \nwill learn that they have breast cancer this year. An estimated 850 \nwill die from this disease in the same year. And, breast cancer is the \nNo. 1 cancer killer among women ages 15 to 54. Like many here, I have \nseen the devastation breast cancer leaves in its path and the children \nit has left motherless. It is heartbreaking to think that with earlier \ndetection they may not have lost their lives. I think we can all agree \nthat--as with any other cancer--if we believe we can prevent women from \nsuffering from this disease, we must do everything in our power to do \nso.\n  The American Cancer Society also tells us that in the last decade, \nthe average breast lump size--the first indicator of cancer in most \ncases--has decreased substantially. In 1991, the average size of \ndetected tumors was down to 2.1 centimeters--that is about the size of \na nickel. What this tells us is that potentially malignant tumors are \nbeing found in earlier and earlier stages of development. Consequently, \nwomen have the opportunity to start treatment earlier, and have a \nhigher chance of survival or avoiding drastic options like \nmastectomies. Mortality rates for Caucasian women have leveled off and \neven started dropping in recent years. Unfortunately, however, the \nstatistics for women of color are not as good, but at least we know \nscreening helps--now we have to make sure that these women have access \nto screening.\n  I do not believe that anyone in this Chamber would deem regular \nmammographies for a woman over 40 as frivolous. On the contrary, I \nbelieve the Members of this body, including myself, now understand \nbetter than ever the importance of regular screening for many forms of \ncancer. I am not a doctor, nor do I pretend to know more than the \nparticipants of the NCI's breast cancer screening consensus panel. \nHowever, I do know enough to understand the value of preventive \nscreening for breast cancer. And, I also know that we have been \nfighting an uphill battle to get women--or men, for that matter--into \ntheir doctors' offices to have annual check ups. Therefore, I am very \nconcerned about the consequence of continued confusion over \nrecommendations for how often a woman should have a mammography and \nmixed signals from leading officials. I look forward to the results of \nthe American Cancer Society's review of the data used by the consensus \npanel.\n  In the meantime, I support Senator Snowe and Mikulski's efforts to \nsend a strong, clear signal to women that until we have conclusive \nevidence to the contrary, we know there is a benefit to regular \nscreening. Along with my colleagues, I encourage all women over 40 to \nfollow the American Cancer Society's recommendation of mammographies \nevery 1 to 2 years. Again, I thank my friends from Maine and Maryland \nfor their work on this issue and their dedication to women's health.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/05/senate-section/article/S1016-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MEASURE REFERRED\n\n  The Committee on Environment and Public Works was discharged from \nfurther consideration of the following measure which was referred to \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs:\n\n       S. 203.

A bill to amend title XI of the Social Security Act to \nprovide an incentive for the reporting of inaccurate Medicare claims \nfor payment, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     the Medicare Whistleblower Act\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to be introducing legislation \ntoday which will significantly reduce fraud and abuse by providers in \nthe Medicare program. The Medicare Whistleblower Act of 1997 will \nprovide strong incentives for Medicare beneficiaries to identify \nprovider fraud in the Medicare system.\n  As I travel around my home State of Arizona, seniors keep telling me \nabout the fraudulent and negligent billings which are rampant \nthroughout the Medicare Program. Over and over again, they tell me \nabout their personal experiences with fraud and overbillings in the \nMedicare system. Many of the seniors say that their Medicare bills \nfrequently include charges for medical services which they never \nreceived, double billings for a specific treatment, or charges which \nare disproportionate and severely marked up. Usually, most of these \nseniors have no idea what Medicare is being billed on their behalf and \nthey have no way to obtain a detailed explanation from the Medicare \nproviders.\n  These personal stories from senior citizens are confirmed by analyses \nand detailed studies. According to the General Accounting Office, fraud \nand abuse in our Nation's health care system costs taxpayers as much as \n$100 billion each year. Medicare fraud alone costs about $17 billion \nper year which is about 10 percent of the program's costs.\n  This is quite disconcerting, especially in light of the financial \nproblems facing our Medicare system. Currently, the Medicare system is \nexpected to run out of funds in the year 2001.\n  A fundamental problem with the Medicare system is that most \nbeneficiaries are not concerned with the costs of the program because \nthe Government is responsible for them. One of my constituents shared \nwith me an experience he had when his provider double-billed Medicare \nfor his treatment and the provider told him not to be concerned about \nit because, ``Medicare is paying the bill.'' This is an outrage and we \ncannot allow this flagrant abuse of taxpayers dollars to continue. \nRemember, when Medicare overpays, we all overpay, and costs to \nbeneficiaries and the taxpayers spiral while the financial \nsustainability of the program is violated.\n  My bill, the Medicare Whistleblower Act addresses this fundamental \nproblem in the Medicare Program. This legislation strengthens the \nprocedures for detecting and identifying fraud and waste in the \nMedicare system. This bill provides beneficiaries with incentives for \ncarefully scrutinizing their bills and actively pursuing corrections \nwhen they believe there has been an inappropriate or unjustified charge \nmade to the Medicare Program. The beneficiaries would be \nfinancially rewarded if they detect negligent or fraudulent charges in \ntheir Medicare bill.\n\n  I recognize that provider fraud is not the sole source of waste and \nabuse in the Medicare system, and I wholeheartedly support other \ninitiatives which address beneficiary fraud. However, studies indicate \nthat provider fraud is most prevalent and the greatest concern for the \nsystem, making initiatives such as this one which specifically target \nprovider fraud very important.\n  The Medicare Whistleblower Act will give beneficiaries the right to \nrequest and receive a written itemized copy of their medical bill from \ntheir Medicare health care provider. This itemized bill should be \nprovided to the beneficiary within 30 days of the provider's receipt of \ntheir request. Once the beneficiary receives the itemized bill they \nwould have 90 days to report any inappropriate billings to Medicare. \nThe Medicare intermediaries and carriers would then have to review the \nbills and determine whether an inappropriate payment has been made and \nwhat amount should be reimbursed to the Medicare system.\n  If the Secretary of Health and Human Services confirms that the \ncharges were either negligent or fraudulent, the beneficiary would \nreceive an award equal to 1 percent of the overpayment reimbursed up to \n$10,000. The financial awards given to the beneficiaries would not \nincrease costs to the Federal Government since they would be paid \ndirectly from the overpayment. In cases of fraud, the rewards would be \npaid directly by the fraudulent provider as a penalty, and would \ntherefore not even reduce the amount of the overpayment reimbursed to \nthe Federal Treasury.\n  Several important safeguards have been built into this legislation. \nFirst, the Secretary of Health and Human Services would be required to \nestablish appropriate procedures to ensure that the incentive system is \nnot abused by overzealous beneficiaries. Second, an incentive payment \nwould be awarded only to the extent that the Health Care Financing \nAdministration HCFA is able to recover the overpayment from the \nprovider. Finally, there would be no incentive payment if HCFA can \ndemonstrate that it had identified the overpayment prior to receiving \nthe beneficiary's complaint.\n  Some may argue that seniors and other beneficiaries should not \nreceive financial rewards for fighting fraud--that it should be their \ncivic responsibility. While I may agree with this contention, I also \nrecognize that these seniors would not be able to detect and report \nfraud or abuse without having access to the itemized bills that this \nlegislation provides. Besides, I do not see anything wrong with \nproviding beneficiaries with a financial incentive for fighting waste. \nAfter all, we currently pay Federal employees for suggestions which \nresult in savings for the taxpayers, and we pay private citizens for \nidentifying fraud by defense contractors.\n  It is imperative that we put an end to the rampant abuse and fraud in \nthe Medicare system. This bill would contribute significantly to this \neffort.\n  Mr. President, I believe that a very effective approach for detecting \nand fighting fraud is to provide individuals with a personal financial \ninterest in the process. By passing this legislation, Congress would be \nempowering over 36 million Medicare beneficiaries to protect their \nprogram from fraud, waste, and abuse. I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing letters of support from the Seniors Coalition and the \nNational Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare be included \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    National Committee to Preserve\n\n\n                                 Social Security and Medicare,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 27, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the 5.5 million members \n     and supporters of the national Committee to Preserve Social \n     Security and Medicare, we offer our endorsement of the \n     Medicare Whistleblower Act of 1997, legislation to strengthen \n     procedures for identifying fraud and waste in the Medicare \n     program.\n       A major effort to prevent fraud and abuse is essential and \n     appropriate--particularly at a time when Congress is \n     considering ways to ensure the solvency of the Medicare \n     program for current and future beneficiaries. It is essential \n     that we enlist the cooperation of the public, beneficiaries, \n     providers and carriers to curb fraud and waste in the \n     Medicare program and ensure that Medicare funds go toward \n     patient care. As you know, major and increasingly complex \n     patterns of fraud and abuse have infiltrated many health \n     sectors.\n       Your legislation will strengthen the role of beneficiaries \n     in detecting and reporting fraud and waste. Of particular \n     importance are the provisions ensuring that beneficiaries be \n     provided, upon request, copies of itemized bills submitted on \n     their behalf. Beneficiaries must have accurate information \n     about bills submitted on their behalf in order to \n     meaningfully participate in this\n\n[[Page S1019]]\n\n     program. It is also important for the Secretary to establish \n     procedures to prevent abuse or over-use of the reporting \n     system.\n       Seniors thank you for your help in combating this growing \n     problem.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Martha A. McSteen,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                        The Seniors Coalition,\n\n                                    Fairfax, VA, January 30, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The Seniors Coalition, representing \n     2.4 million senior citizens nationwise, is pleased to support \n     the legislation you have recently introduced to reduce waste \n     and fraud in the Medicare system. Our members report to us \n     the same kinds of experiences as your constituents do to you, \n     and we are certain that your legislation will help.\n       However, I must note that while these are desirable \n     reforms, they do not correct the basic flaws in the Medicare \n     program, and it is these flaws which make Medicare ultimately \n     unsustainable.\n       By separating those who receive benefits from those who \n     pay, Medicare encourages overuse, waste, fraud, abuse, and \n     cheating. Passage of legislation such as yours, which creates \n     some incentives to discover fraud and abuse, can never \n     substitute for the self-policing systems of true free \n     markets, where every patient has an incentive to find the \n     least expensive, most cost-effective treatment, and to \n     monitor for double-billing, mistakes, and fraud in a way no \n     artificial system can ever re-create.\n       The Seniors Coalition is happy to support your efforts, but \n     we urge you to undertake a thorough and long-overdue \n     revamping of the entire program, before its internal \n     contradictions bring it crashing down on the heads of seniors \n     who deserve better treatment.\n       Please let us know what we can do to help you with your \n     efforts.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Thair Phillips,\n                                          Chief Executive Officer.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 265. A bill to provide off-budget treatment for the highway trust \nfund; to the Committee on the Budget and the Committee on Government \nAffairs, jointly, pursuant to the order of August 4, 1977, with \ninstructions that if one committee reports, the other committee have 30 \ndays to report or be discharged.\n\n\n             THE HIGHWAY TRUST FUND PROTECTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have just come from my office where I had \na number of meetings. I met with a group of lawyers this morning. They \nwere talking about issues that are going to come before the Congress \nthat are important to them. But in the course of the conversation, I \ntalked to them about the days when I was an attorney and practiced law.\n  One of the things that has been brought to my mind as a result of my \nmeeting with those lawyers today is how important it is to protect your \nclient's assets. If you had a case for a client, any money that came in \nthat was that client's property, you had to put that money in a trust \naccount. None of that money in that trust account could be used to make \na house payment or make a car payment of yours. Those moneys could only \nbe used for the benefit of your client. If a lawyer violated the trust \nthat he or she had with his client, you could lose your license to \npractice law. You could, in fact, be prosecuted criminally and go to \njail.\n\n  It seems around here that we handle people's trust accounts, the \ntaxpayers' trust accounts in a very cavalier fashion. Today I want to \ntalk about one of those trust funds. I want to talk about the highway \ntrust fund. It is coincidental that I am here introducing legislation \nafter having met in my office just a short time ago with Nevada's head \nof the department of transportation, a man by the name of Tom Stephens. \nHe was back here with other Nevadans to tell me the problems that the \nState of Nevada has. I am a member of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee and we will have to address the problems of this entire \ncountry when we reauthorize the highway transportation bill this year. \nThe people from Nevada were telling me about the problems we have in \nNevada. They are significant. We are the most rapidly growing State in \nthe Union. We have traffic jams where we never had them before, \nespecially in the southern part of the State. He proceeded to tell me \nabout five projects that will cost about $1 billion--extension of \nHighway 95, I-15 to the California border, in the Reno-Carson City area \nwe have to get the freeway completed between Carson City and Reno, and \na number of other very difficult projects that cost a lot of money. He \nwas looking to me for guidance and direction as to how some of these \nvery difficult projects could be directed--how moneys in the bill could \nbe directed toward the State of Nevada.\n  There is no question, Mr. President, that this is going to be a busy \nlegislative year. As I have indicated, one of the things we will work \non is the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, what we \ncall ISTEA, reauthorization of the highway bill. This legislation plays \nan integral role in the financing of our Nation's transportation \ninfrastructure. It is a bill that will receive bipartisan support, I \nhope, for a number of reasons. Most recognize the need to invest in our \ntransportation infrastructure. It is that way all over the country.\n  The Presiding Officer of this body today is from a very sparsely \npopulated State, but it is a big State and covers a lot of area. I have \ndriven much of the State of Wyoming. The State of Wyoming has, like \nNevada but in a more exaggerated sense, a very small population base. \nHowever, the people of Wyoming travel these long distances and they \nwant to travel these distances on good roads. Not only do the people \nthat live in Wyoming need those good roads, but the State of Wyoming is \nsurrounded by States that people are trying to get to. Wyoming is a \nbridge State. Thousands and thousands of people come to Wyoming every \nyear to go to Yellowstone National Park. Should the people of Wyoming \nalone be responsible for those roads? Well, the answer is no, we have a \nFederal policy that helps the State of Wyoming in the road \nconstruction. You have demand in the State of Wyoming that cannot be \nmet by the State of Wyoming. Your transportation director, I am sure, \nwill come and visit the Presiding Officer, just like my State of Nevada \nhead of transportation came and visited me, to talk about particular \nspecific problems that you have in the State of Wyoming which are \ncompounded by the bad weather that you have there.\n  I am sure a lot of people do not know that this money we collect in \nthe highway trust fund is not used for highway construction. What is it \nused for? It is used to mask the Federal deficit to the tune of about \n$20 billion. All of us agree that we need to invest in our highway \ntransportation system. We all agree that there is a need to provide a \nsafe, efficient, and modern transportation infrastructure, and most \nagree that too little is being spent on this important investment. The \nbiggest reason, though, we are spending too little on this investment \nis we are not spending the money we have in trust to spend. Just like \nthe example I gave earlier where I, as an attorney, would take my \nclient's money, just as we as a Federal Government take our client's \nmoney, the taxpayer, every time a gallon of gas is purchased, we take \napproximately 19 cents. Most of that money is required by law to be \nspent on the infrastructure of this country and it is not. That is what \nis wrong. Finances that should go to the highway construction is being \nuse for other purposes. The money collected is not being used, I \nrepeat, for its intended purpose. It is a perversion of the whole \nnotion of how a trust fund should operate.\n  There have been earlier attempts to end this misspending by taking \nthe transportation trust fund moneys off budget. In the House it has \nbeen successful. I am going to initiate an effort here in the Senate \ntoo to do likewise. They have not only gotten it out of committee in \nthe House, they passed it on the floor. I support these efforts that \nthey have initiated in the House because I believe we need to protect \nthe integrity of these trust funds. I believe we should attempt to get \nthese funds off budget and we should do it now.\n  That is why I am introducing this bill, the Highway Trust Fund \nProtection Act of 1997. It is very straightforward. It is a short bill. \nBy taking the highway trust fund off budget we will be fulfilling our \ncommitment to the taxpayer. We will be spending the revenues on the \nspecific activities identified as the purpose of these trust funds. Mr. \nPresident, the trust fund is financed by sales taxes on tires, trucks, \nbuses, trailers, as well as truck usage taxes. But about 90 percent of \nthe trust fund revenue comes from excise taxes\n\n[[Page S1020]]\n\non motor fuels. As I have indicated earlier, the majority of the motor \nfuel revenue dedicated to the trust fund is derived from 18.4 cents per \ngallon tax on gasoline. Of this, 14 cents is dedicated directly to the \nhighway trust fund. Of the remaining 4.5 cents, 4.3 cents go to deficit \nreduction and one-tenth of 1 percent goes to the leaky underground \nstorage fund.\n\n  Mr. President, there are many arguments for taking these trust funds \noff budget. I will talk about a few. First of all, it represents a \ncontract with the people of this country. We pass legislation that \ntells someone when they buy a gallon of gasoline, part of that money is \ngoing to go into a trust fund to improve the roads--the roads in \nWyoming, the roads in Nevada, and all over this country. If the highway \ntrust funds are not going to be used for their stated purpose, we \nshould eliminate the tax, or part of it.\n  According to the Federal Highway Administration there are significant \ninfrastructure needs not being met. We do not need to go to the Highway \nAdministration. We know by our own individual experiences in our \nindividual States that it is important we spend more money on this \nconstruction. The trust fund inclusion in the unified budget subjects \nour outlays to the budget process. As a result, they are liable to \nlegislative spending limitations. These limits are not based on \nanalysis of national transportation spending need. Not once in the 5 \nyears since ISTEA was enacted have Federal highway programs been funded \nat their authorized levels; this, despite the fact that the Department \nof Transportation has identified billions of dollars in need.\n  Remember, Mr. President, we have approximately $20 billion in excess \nfunds not being spent and going into our infrastructure needs. The \nbalances we run in the transit highway accounts makes no sense. This \nmoney should and could be invested in our Nation's highway system. It \nis estimated that to maintain--not improve, just maintain--our current \nhighway system would cost over $200 billion. Taking the highway trust \nfunds off budget will have limited effect on the deficit. The highway \ntrust fund is user fee supported. The highway trust fund is deficit \nproof and has never contributed a single penny to the budget deficit. \nThe highway trust fund supports long-term capital investments that \nproduce economic benefits, which in turn generate increased revenue for \nthe Federal Government.\n  This bill is about protecting the integrity of the highway trust \nfund. All taxpayers have an interest in this. We are told when we pay \ntaxes at the pump that this money goes toward maintaining and improving \nour roads. I wish that were so. It is a myth. It is a myth of the \nhighway trust fund. My legislation provides truth and budgeting and \nwould simply do away with this myth.\n  It is unfair that we take a trust fund and use it for purposes other \nthan for which the trust fund moneys were dedicated. I ask all of my \ncolleagues to follow the example of the other body, the House of \nRepresentatives, and join me in supporting this legislation, which \nwould take these moneys off budget and would allow us to spend the \nmoney that is so badly needed for highway construction in the United \nStates.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROTH:\n  S. 266. A bill to establish the Government 2000 Commission to \nincrease the efficiency and effectiveness of the Government, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                   the government 2000 commission act\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill which would \nestablish a bipartisan Government 2000 Commission, charged with \ndeveloping a comprehensive legislative proposal to reorganize, \nconsolidate, and streamline Federal departments, agencies, and \nactivities.\n   Mr. President, this Commission is very similar to the one that was \nincluded in S. 929 in the 104th Congress which was reported out of the \nSenate Governmental Affairs Committee under my chairmanship.\n  To make clear our objectives, this legislation includes specific \ngoals for reducing costs and improving the performance.\n  These goals include: a 35-percent reduction in the costs of \nadministration, a tenfold increase in the timeliness of service \ndelivery, a compound annual improvement in productivity of 6 percent, \nand customer service levels comparable to the private sector.\n  The Commission's reorganization plan must include no more than 10 \nCabinet Departments--a reduction from 14--and a substantial reduction \nin the number of agencies and subdepartmental bureaus, offices, \ndivisions, and other program operating units to eliminate duplication \nand fragmentation. It is also required to achieve a reduction in the \nlayers of organizational hierarchy and a substantial reduction in the \ntotal number of midlevel supervisory, administrative, and political \npositions.\n  The Commission is charged with considering the consolidation of \nprogram service delivery functions into operating units that are \nindependent of individual executive departments, to maximize service \ncoordination, and whether the heads of such program operating units \nshould be nonpolitical, noncareer appointments hired for a fixed-term \nunder an employment contract with specific, measurable program \nperformance goals, to maximize accountability.\n  There will be nine Commission members: Two each appointed by the \nPresident, the Speaker of the House, and the Senate majority leader, \nand one each by the House and Senate minority leaders. The Chairman \nshall be appointed by agreement of the President, the Speaker, and the \nSenate majority leader. The Commission is authorized an appropriation \nof $5 million for fiscal year 1998.\n  The Commission shall report its recommendations in a single \nlegislative package by June 1, 1998. The act provides for fast-track \nconsideration of this legislation. In the Senate, there is no time \nlimit on debate, and only germane amendments will be order. In the \nHouse, there will be 10 hours of general debate followed by 20 hours of \ndebate on all amendments.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 267. A bill to provide for the imposition of administrative fees \nfor medicare overpayment collection, and to require automated \nprepayment screening of Medicare claims, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n             The Medicare Overpayment Reduction Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation which \naddresses a very serious problem in the Medicare system--Medicare \noverpayments. Medicare overpayments are costing the Medicare trust \nfunds billions of dollars each year.\n  This bill imposes an administrative fee on providers who submit \ninaccurate Medicare claims and are overpaid by the Health Care \nFinancing Administration [HCFA]. The purpose of the fee is to \ndiscourage overpayments and to offset the costs which HCFA incurs while \nrecovering overpayments.\n  In addition, this bill requires HCFA to screen claims for accuracy, \npaying particular attention to procedures and services which have high \nrates of overbillings and inaccurate billings.\n  Under Medicare part A, hospitals and providers are prepaid annually \nby HCFA for expected Medicare expenditures. Currently, many hospitals \ngrossly overestimate their Medicare funding needs and use the \noverpayment to subsidize services delivered at their facility which are \nnot Medicare related. This is an abuse which must be stopped. This \nlegislation will impose an administrative fee if a hospital \noverestimates its Medicare needs by more than 30 percent and does not \nrepay the overpayment to HCFA within 30 days.\n  Unlike hospitals, doctors must submit claims for payment to Medicare \npart B after they provide services to beneficiaries. However, these \nclaims sometimes are submitted for services that were never provided or \nthat are incorrectly coded. The fee which this bill would impose will \ndiscourage physicians from submitting false or misleading claims and \nwill help HCFA cover the costs incurred while recovering overpayments \nto providers.\n  Most importantly, prepayment screening will help eliminate \noverpayments in the first place. The technology for prescreening is \navailable and already used extensively in the private sector. I believe \nthat it is imperative that we start using prescreening\n\n[[Page S1021]]\n\nto improve Medicare payment accuracy.\n  As my colleagues know, the Medicare system is in serious financial \ncondition and will be bankrupt in 2001 if we do not make necessary \nreforms. We have an obligation to take every possible step to protect \nthe Medicare trust funds and preserve them for current beneficiaries \nand future generations.\n  I recognize that overpayments are not the only financial problem with \nMedicare, but they are a significant problem within the system. GAO \nreported that over $4.1 billion was overpaid from the trust funds in \n1995. Had this legislation been in place, I believe that we could have \nprevented a large portion of these overpayments if not prevented we \ncould have at least imposed the administrative fee and recouped a \nsignificant amount.\n  This bill is not the cure for what ails our Medicare system, but it \nis a step in the right direction. Overpayments are costly and \ncontribute to the Medicare solvency problem. This legislation will help \nstop them.\n  I ask unanimous consent a letter of support from the National \nCommittee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare be included in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                    National Committee To Preserve\n\n\n                                 Social Security and Medicare,\n\n                                 Washington, DC; January 23, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n      U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The national Committee to Preserve \n     Social Security and Medicare, on behalf of our 5.5 million \n     members and supporters, endorses the ``Medicare Overpayment \n     Reduction Act.'' This important legislation will improve the \n     Medicare program by encouraging greater care in claim \n     submission and reducing the incentive to overbill the \n     Medicare program.\n       The ``Medicare Overpayment Reduction Act'' addresses the \n     significant problem of waste and abuse in the Medicare \n     program by restoring to the Medicare program expenditures \n     that were the result of overpayments to providers. The bill \n     imposes a one percent administration fee on overpayments not \n     returned within 30 days by Medicare providers. By encouraging \n     a careful review of Medicare claims submissions by providers, \n     this legislation is an important step toward preserving the \n     Medicare program for current and future beneficiaries.\n       Thank you, Senator McCain, for your outstanding work on \n     behalf of older Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Martha A. McSteen,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Frist):\n  S. 268. A bill to regulate flights over national parks, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n               THE NATIONAL PARKS OVERFLIGHTS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \npromote safety and quiet in our national parks. I want to thank Senator \nFrist for joining me as an original cosponsor of this bill.\n  Under this legislation, the Secretary of the Interior would develop \nrecommendations which may include flight-free zones, curfews, and other \nflight restrictions for aircraft operating over certain national parks. \nThe Federal Aviation Administrator would then develop a plan, based \nupon these recommendations, to promote quiet and safety in our parks. \nUnder the bill, the entire process would be completed within months \nafter enactment of this legislation.\n  To ensure that we take immediate action in those parks experiencing \nthe greatest threats to their natural resources from aircraft noise, \nthis bill requires the Secretary of the Interior to recommend a \nproposal for prioritizing the implementation of appropriate flight \nrestrictions at certain parks. The bill also requires the Secretary and \nthe Administrator to work together on recommendations that propose \nmethods to encourage the use of quiet aircraft in our parks, unless \nsuch proposals are not needed to meet the goals of protecting quiet and \npromoting safety.\n  This bill promotes safety in our national parks by allowing the FAA \nAdministrator, in consultation with the Secretary, to set minimum \naltitudes for overflights in certain parks and to prohibit flights \nbelow those minimum altitudes where necessary to meet safety goals. The \nbill makes safety the paramount concern for the Administrator in \ndeveloping an overflight plan for a national park. Under the bill, the \nAdministrator may revise the Secretary of the Interior's \nrecommendations to ensure public health and safety goals are met.\n  Mr. President, this bill is intended to begin a dialog on how we can \nbest promote safety and quiet in our national parks. I am sure that \nthis legislation can be refined to better meet its essential goals and \nI am eager to start that process.\n  I also want to make clear that I fully appreciate that air tourism \nprovides a legitimate way for visitors to see national parks and also \nprovides an important opportunity for disabled persons to view certain \nparks. I want to ensure that this legislation provides a balanced and \nfair approach to solving safety and noise problems in our national \nparks.\n  I believe this bill takes a crucial first step toward restoring and \npreserving a vital resource within many national parks--natural quiet. \nThe natural ambient sound conditions found in a park, or natural quiet, \nas it is commonly called, is precisely what many Americans seek to \nexperience when they visit some of our most treasured national parks. \nNatural quiet is as crucial an element of the natural beauty and \nsplendor of certain parks as those resources that we visually observe \nand appreciate.\n\n  I also believe that this bill provides important safety protections. \nAs the air tour industry in many parks continues to grow, safety \nconcerns also increase. By addressing safety now, before tragic \naccidents occur, we can assure the public that we have taken every \nprecaution to protect visitors in our parks.\n  Ten years ago, legislation I authored to promote safety and provide \nfor the substantial restoration of natural quiet in the Grand Canyon \nwas signed into law. This year, the Federal Aviation Administration \n[FAA] issued a final rule which modifies and expands flight-free zones \nin the canyon. The final rule is scheduled to go into effect on May 1, \n1997. But lawsuits threaten to further delay implementation of \nadditional measures to meet the goals of the 1987 law.\n  Moreover, the final rule does not contain incentives for operators to \nconvert to quiet aircraft, although the FAA recognizes that moving to \nquiet aircraft technology offers the most promising approach to \nproviding for the substantial restoration of natural quiet in the \nCanyon. Rather, a notice of proposed rulemaking was issued outlining a \nproposal for mandating conversion to quiet aircraft. This proposed \nrulemaking must now undergo public comment and agency review of those \ncomments before it becomes final. In the meantime, natural quiet still \nhas not been restored at the Grand Canyon.\n  There are many lessons to be learned from our efforts to restore \nnatural quiet in the Grand Canyon. The Grand Canyon experience teaches \nus that we cannot afford to wait until natural quiet has been lost \nbefore we take steps to protect and preserve that resource. Simply put, \nwe have found that it is very difficult to undo what has already been \ndone. Thus, wherever possible, we must strive to prevent the impairment \nof natural resources in our national parks. To that end, this bill sets \nup a process for achieving balanced and fair approach to resolving \nnoise concerns in other national parks before any problems get out of \nhand in those parks, too.\n  In addition, as a result of the Grand Canyon experience, we have \nlearned some very valuable lessons about what we can and must do to \nensure safety in the air above our national parks. Providing for public \nhealth and safety in our national parks must always be a foremost \nconcern in our minds when developing any park overflight plan.\n  Finally, I expect the administration, in exercising its authority \nunder this bill, to meet with interested groups and affected \ncommunities, including local chambers of commerce. These groups should \nbe involved in the process before implementing any flight restrictions \nin order to ensure that proposed actions are appropriate and necessary \nand that all important issues have been thoroughly considered and \naddressed.\n  Again, Mr. President, this bill is intended to begin an open dialog \non how we can best achieve our safety and natural quiet goals. Many \nparks throughout America are now being threatened\n\n[[Page S1022]]\n\nby the same kind of air pollution problems and noise pollution problems \nthat we had over the Grand Canyon. I believe we can begin to work on \nways in which we can protect and preserve one of the most precious \nnatural resources within many of our national parks--natural quiet. At \nthe same time, the bill seeks to ensure that public health and safety \nis not compromised as a result of increasing park overflights. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in this effort to reach an important balance \nand preserve our natural heritage while we provide for the safe and \ncontinued enjoyment of our parks.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM:\n  S. 269. A bill to provide that the Secretary of the Senate and the \nClerk of the House of Representatives shall include an estimate of \nFederal retirement benefits for each Member of Congress in their \nsemiannual reports, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules \nand Administration.\n\n\n                The Congressional Pension Disclosure Act\n\n   Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce S. 269 \nwhich would require the Secretary of the Senate and the Clerk of the \nHouse of Representatives to disclose information relating to the \npensions of Members of Congress. This legislation would require these \nofficers to include in their semiannual reports to Congress detailed \ninformation relating to the Members pensions. The semiannual reports \nwould then be available to the public for inspection.\n  The reports would include the individual pension contributions of \nMembers; an estimate of annuities which they would receive based on the \nearliest possible date they would be eligible to receive annuity \npayments by reason of retirement; and any other information necessary \nto enable the public to accurately compute the Federal retirement \nbenefits of each Member based on various assumptions of years of \nservice and age of separation from service by reason of retirement.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to afford citizens their rightful \nopportunity to learn how public funds are being utilized. The taxpayers \nare not only entitled to know the various forms of compensation their \nelected officials are being paid, they are also entitled to make \ndecisions about the reasonableness of such compensation.\n  My bill, S. 269, would make this information conveniently available \nto the public. I believe that this bill would eliminate the present \nshroud of secrecy which has surrounded the congressional pension system \nand give the public better access to information regarding their \nrepresentatives in Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 271. A bill to require the Secretary of Commerce to ensure that at \nleast an equivalent level of service will be supplied to the public and \naffected agencies before closing National Weather Service field \nstations; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n    the national weather service office closure criteria act of 1997\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nto create additional office closure certification criteria for National \nWeather Service offices located in geographical areas of concern \ndesignated by the National Research Council. The amendment is designed \nto guarantee that weather services will be fully maintained in these \nareas after the National Weather Service completes its modernization \nplan.\n  My bill adds a new paragraph to section 706(e) of the Weather Service \nModernization Act of 1992. This section deals with ``special \ncircumstances'' under which the Secretary may not close or relocate a \nNWS field office unless he meets certain specified certification \ncriteria in addition to the standard certification criteria that apply \nto all field offices.\n  This legislation would create another special circumstance category \nfor offices that serve parts of the country identified as ``areas of \ngeographic concern'' in the National Research Council's June 1995, \nreport on the modernization program. The NRC identified 32 such areas \nof concern across the country, including Caribou, ME, Williston, ND, \nBaton Rouge, LA, and Kalispell, MT, in which a National Weather Service \nfield office has been proposed for closure under the modernization plan \nand the people who live in the area have expressed serious concerns \nabout the impacts of it.\n  My bill would prohibit the Secretary from closing or relocating these \noffices unless he first evaluates the effect of a closing or relocation \non all weather information and services provided to local users; and, \nsecond, he includes in the standard certification required under \nsection 706(b), a determination that at least an equivalent level of \nweather services will be provided in the future.\n  This amendment provides an additional but very important layer of \nscrutiny to NWS plans to close field offices in areas of the country--a \nnumber of which are sparsely populated and rural--specified in the NRC \nreport. It provides an extra safeguard for these communities to ensure \nthat they will continue to receive at least the same level of weather \ninformation and services that they currently receive. Without adequate \nsafeguards, the rural communities described in the amendment will face \ngreater threats to public safety, infrastructure, private property, \nagricultural production, and the economy generally when a local weather \noffice closes.\n  As experience shows, the rural field offices, in particular, play a \nspecial role in gathering weather information from diverse and \ndisparate locales across a large region, and in disseminating this \ninformation, along with standard NWS forecasts and flood warnings, to \nall citizens of the region. Field offices located outside these service \nareas may not be able to devote the same level of comprehensive, real-\ntime attention to weather events affecting these areas. Given the \nimportance of accurate and timely weather information to rural areas \nsubject to severe weather conditions, we cannot let the quality of \nweather services for these areas diminish. My legislation will help to \nprevent that from happening.\n  Mr. President, this is good-government legislation. It helps to \nensure that an essential Federal agency makes very well-informed and \nprudent decisions, and it enhances the protection of our citizens' \nlives and property.\n  I introduced this legislation as an amendment to the NOAA \nreauthorization bill in the Commerce Committee last year. The amendment \nwas adopted unanimously, but unfortunately the full Senate did not have \nan opportunity to consider the bill before adjournment. I intend to \nresume my efforts on this issue at the earliest opportunity in the new \nCongress. I hope other Senators will join me in cosponsoring this bill \nand in working toward its enactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 272. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \ndefense contractors a credit against income tax for 20 percent of the \ndefense conversion employee retraining expenses paid or incurred by the \ncontractors; to the Committee on Finance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 273. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax incentives relating to the closure, realignment, or downsizing of \nmilitary installations; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               DEFENSE CONVERSION TAX CREDIT LEGISLATION\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I am introducing two bills today to \nassist workers who have lost their jobs as a result of closure or \ncutbacks at defense installations or the loss of defense contracts by \nprivate industry. The first bill extends the existing targeted jobs tax \ncredit to employers who hire individuals who have lost their jobs at a \nFederal military installation through a closing, realignment or \nreduction in force. The credit equals 40 percent of the first $6,000 in \nwages paid to each newly hired worker. The second bill I am introducing \nprovides defense contractors with an income tax credit for 20 percent \nof costs incurred in retraining employees for nondefense-related jobs.\n  Since 1988, the Department of Defense has undertaken four base \nrealignment and closure [BRAC] rounds--in 1988, 1991, 1993, and 1995. \nIn total the BRAC process has authorized the closing of 261 military \nfacilities, including 98 major defense installations where 300 or more \ncivilian and/or military jobs were eliminated. Many base closings and \nrealignments under the BRAC\n\n[[Page S1023]]\n\nprocess are still in progress and their full impact has not yet been \nfelt. In addition, reductions in force continue to be the order of the \nday at the Pentagon. In December, the Navy announced plans to reduce \ncivilian employment by 11,000 positions at 240 facilities.\n  The economic impact of defense downsizing on the affected individuals \nand surrounding communities can be devastating. In my own State of \nMaine, the closure of Loring Air Force Base in 1994 resulted in the \nloss of nearly 20 percent of the jobs in Aroostook County, affecting \n3,000 military personnel, 900 civilians and an additional 6,000 private \nsector jobs which were dependent on the air base. The annual loss of \nincome to Maine's economy from the Loring closure totaled more than \n$370 million.\n  At the other end of the State, Kittery-Portsmouth Naval Shipyard has \nseen its workforce cut from 8,600 employees in 1989, when the Berlin \nwall fell, to 3,600 today with another reduction of 454 Navy civilian \njobs planned for 1997. And Bath Iron Works, Maine's largest defense \ncontractor, has seen its employment level drop from a high of 12,000 in \n1990 to 7,500 today. Smaller defense contractors in Maine have \nexperienced similar job losses.\n  Mr. President, defense downsizing and economic conversion can be an \nexcruciatingly slow and painful process for those households and \ncommunities in Maine and across the country who are going through it. I \nfeel strongly that our obligation to the military and civilian workers \nwho, after all, helped win the cold war, does not end with adoption of \nthe BRAC recommendations. Successful defense conversion is a long-term \nprocess requiring a multi-pronged strategy that must include \ncoordinated Government assistance to affected communities, workers, and \nbusinesses.\n  The two tax credit proposals I am introducing today form an essential \npart of that strategy. They will encourage the private sector to hire \nworkers whose jobs have been lost from Federal defense facilities and \nwill encourage defense contractors to retrain workers for employment in \nnondefense areas. I urge my Senate colleagues to join me in supporting \nthese important legislative initiatives.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 274. A bill to establish a Northern Border States-Canada Trade \nCouncil, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 THE NORTHERN BORDER STATES COUNCIL ACT\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nthat would establish a Northern Border States Council on United States-\nCanada Trade.\n  The purpose of this Council is to oversee cross-border trade with our \nNation's largest trading partner--an action that I believe is long \noverdue. The Council will serve as an early warning system to alert \nState and Federal trade officials to problems in cross-border traffic \nand trade. The Council will enable the United States to more \neffectively administer trade policy with Canada by applying the wealth \nof insight, knowledge and expertise that resides in our northern border \nStates on this critical policy issue.\n  Within the U.S. Government we already have the Department of Commerce \nand a U.S. Trade Representative. But the fact is that both are Federal \nentities, responsible for our larger, national U.S. trade interests. \nToo often, such entities fail to give full consideration to the \ninterests of the 12 northern States that share a border with Canada, \nthe longest demilitarized border between 2 nations anywhere in the \nworld. The Northern Border States Council will provide State trade \nofficials a mechanism to share information about cross-border traffic \nand trade. The Council will then advise the Congress, the President, \nthe U.S. Trade Representative, the Secretary of Commerce, and other \nFederal and State trade officials on United States.-Canada trade \npolicies, practices, and problems.\n  Canada is America's largest and most important trading partner. \nCanada is by far the top purchaser of U.S. export goods and services, \nas it is the largest source of U.S. imports. With an economy one-tenth \nthe size of our own, Canada's economic health depends on maintaining \nclose trade ties with the United States. While Canada accounts for \nabout one-fifth of U.S. exports and imports, the United States is the \nsource of two-thirds of Canada's imports and provides the market for \nfully three-quarters of all of Canada's exports.\n  The United States and Canada have the largest bilateral trade \nrelationship in the world, a relationship that is remarkable not only \nfor its strength and general health, but also for the intensity of the \ntrade and border problems that do frequently develop. Over the last \ndecade, Canada and the United States have signed two major trade \nagreements--the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement in 1989, and \nthe North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993. Notwithstanding these \ntrade accords, numerous disagreements have caused trade negotiators to \nshuttle back and forth between Washington and Ottawa. Most of the more \nwell-known trade disputes with Canada have involved agricultural \ncommodities such as durum wheat, peanut butter, dairy products, and \npoultry products, and these disputes have impacted more than just the \n12 northern border States.\n  Each and every day, however, an enormous quantity of trade and \ntraffic crosses the United States-Canada border. There are literally \nthousands of businesses, large and small, that rely on this cross-\nborder traffic and trade for their livelihood.\n  My own State of Maine has had a long-running dispute with Canada over \nthat nation's unfair policies in support of its potato industry. \nSpecifically, Canada protects its domestic potato growers from United \nStates competition through a system of nontariff trade barriers, such \nas setting container size limitations and a prohibition on bulk imports \nfrom the United States. This bulk import prohibition effectively blocks \nUnited States potato imports into Canada. At the same time, Canada \nartificially enhances the competitiveness of its product through \ndomestic subsidies for potato growers.\n  Another trade dispute with Canada, specifically with the province of \nNew Brunswick, served as the inspiration for this legislation. In July \n1993, Canadian federal customs officials began stopping Canadians \nreturning from Maine and collecting from them the 11-percent New \nBrunswick Provincial Sales Tax [PST] on goods purchased in Maine. \nCanadian Customs Officers had already been collecting the Canadian \nfederal sales tax all across the United States-Canada border. The \ncollection of the New Brunswick PST was specifically targeted against \ngoods purchased in Maine--not on goods purchased in any of the other \nprovinces bordering New Brunswick.\n  After months of imploring the U.S. Trade Representative to do \nsomething about the imposition of the unfairly administered tax, \nAmbassador Kantor agreed that the New Brunswick PST was a violation of \nNAFTA, and that the United States would include the PST issue in the \nNAFTA dispute settlement process. But despite this explicit assurance, \nthe issue was not, in fact, brought before NAFTA's dispute settlement \nprocess, prompting Congress last year to include an amendment I offered \nto immigration reform legislation calling for the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative to take this action without further delay.\n  Throughout the early months of the PST dispute, we in the State of \nMaine had enormous difficulty convincing our Federal trade officials \nthat the PST was in fact an international trade dispute that warranted \ntheir attention and action. We had no way of knowing whether problems \nsimilar to the PST dispute existed elsewhere along the United States-\nCanada border, or whether it was a more localized problem. If a body \nlike the Northern Border State Trade Council had existed when the \ncollection of the PST began, it could have immediately started \ninvestigating the issue to determine its impact and make \nrecommendations on how to deal with it.\n  In short, the Northern Border States Council will serve as the eyes \nand ears of our States that share a border with Canada, and are most \nvulnerable to fluctuations in cross-border trade and traffic. The \nCouncil will be a tool for Federal and State trade officials to use in \nmonitoring their cross-border trade. It will help ensure that national \ntrade policy regarding America's largest trading partner will be \ndeveloped and\n\n[[Page S1024]]\n\nimplemented with an eye towards the unique opportunities and burdens \npresent to the northern border States.\n  The Northern Border States Council will be an advisory body, not a \nregulatory one. Its fundamental purpose will be to determine the nature \nand cause of cross-border trade issues or disputes, and to recommend \nhow to resolve them.\n  The duties and responsibilities of the Council will include, but not \nbe limited to, providing advice and policy recommendations on such \nmatters as taxation and the regulation of cross-border wholesale and \nretail trade in goods and services; taxation, regulation and \nsubsidization of food, agricultural, energy, and forest-products \ncommodities; and the potential for Federal and State/provincial laws \nand regulations, including customs and immigration regulations, to act \nas nontariff barriers to trade.\n  As an advisory body, the Council will review and comment on all \nFederal and/or State reports, studies, and practices concerning United \nStates-Canada trade, with particular emphasis on all reports from the \ndispute settlement panels established under NAFTA. These Council \nreviews will be conducted upon the request of the United States Trade \nRepresentative, the Secretary of Commerce, a Member of Congress from \nany Council State, or the Governor of a Council State.\n  If the Council determines that the origin of a cross-border trade \ndispute resides with Canada, the Council would determine, to the best \nof its ability, if the source of the dispute is the Canadian Federal \nGovernment or a Canadian provincial government.\n  The goal of this legislation is not to create another Federal trade \nbureaucracy. The Council will be made up of individuals nominated by \nthe Governors and approved by the Secretary of Commerce. Each northern \nborder State will have two members on the Council. The Council members \nwill be unpaid, and serve a 2-year term.\n  The Northern Border States Council on United States-Canada Trade will \nnot solve all of our trade problems with Canada. But it will ensure \nthat the voices and views of our northern border States are heard in \nWashington by our Federal trade officials. For too long their voices \nwere ignored, and the northern border States have had to suffer severe \neconomic consequences at times because of it. This legislation will \nbring our States into their rightful position as full partners in \nissues that affect cross-border trade and traffic with our country's \nlargest trading partner.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor tax-exempt financing of private sector highway infrastructure \nconstruction; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              the highway infrastructure privatization act\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation which \nwill allow the private sector to take a more active role in building \nand operating our Nation's highway infrastructure. The Highway \nInfrastructure Privatization Act will allow the private sector to gain \naccess to tax-exempt bond financing for a limited number of highway \nprojects. I am pleased that my distinguished colleagues, Senators \nWarner, Moynihan, and Bond, have agreed to join me in this effort.\n  One needs only to venture a few blocks from here to see the terrible \ncondition of many of the Nation's roads and bridges. Regrettably, the \nUnited States faces a significant shortfall in funding for our highway \nand bridge infrastructure needs.\n  The investment need comes at a time when we in Congress are \ndesperately looking for ways to reduce spending to balance the budget. \nState governments face similar budget pressures. It is incumbent upon \nus to look at new and innovative ways to make the most of limited \nresources to address significant needs.\n  In the United States, highway and bridge infrastructure is the \nresponsibility of the Government. Governments build, own, and operate \npublic highways, roads, and bridges. In many other countries, however, \nthe private sector, and private capital, construct and operate \nimportant facilities. These countries have found that increasing the \nprivate sector's role in major highway transportation projects offers \nopportunities for construction cost savings and more efficient \noperation. They also open the door for new construction techniques and \ntechnologies.\n  To help meet the Nation's infrastructure needs, we must take \nadvantage of private sector resources by opening up avenues for the \nprivate sector to take the lead in designing, constructing, financing, \nand operating highway facilities.\n  A substantial barrier to private sector participation in the \nprovision of highway infrastructure is the cost of capital. Under \ncurrent Federal tax law, highways built by Government can be financed \nusing tax-exempt debt, but those built by the private sector, or those \nwith substantial private sector participation, cannot. As a result, \npublic/private partnerships in the provision of highway facilities are \nunlikely to materialize, despite the potential efficiencies in design, \nconstruction, and operation offered by such arrangements.\n\n  To increase the amount of private sector participation in the \nprovision of highway infrastructure, the Tax Code's bias against \nprivate sector participation must be addressed.\n  The Highway Infrastructure Privatization Act creates a pilot program \naimed at encouraging the private sector to help meet the transportation \ninfrastructure needs for the 21st century. It makes tax-exempt \nfinancing available for a total of 15 highway privatization projects. \nThe total face value of bonds that can be issued under this program is \nlimited to $25 billion.\n  The 15 projects authorized under the program will be selected by the \nSecretary of Transportation, in consultation with the Secretary of the \nTreasury. To qualify under this program, projects selected must: serve \nthe general public; be on publicly owned rights-of-way; revert to \npublic ownership; and, come from a State's 20-year transportation plan. \nThese criteria ensure that the projects selected meet a State or \nlocality's broad transportation goals.\n  A revenue estimate for this legislation has not yet been completed, \nhowever we anticipate that the bill will not result in a revenue loss \nfor the Federal Government. The projects that are candidates to \nparticipate in this pilot program are ones that are likely to be funded \nby tax-exempt bonds issued by State and local governments. Therefore, \nthe bill should not result in an increase in the amount of tax-exempt \nbonds that will be issued. Furthermore, it is possible, depending on \nthe efficiencies resulting from substantial private sector \nparticipation, that the bill actually would result in fewer bonds being \nissued and therefore would provide a revenue increase for the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The bonds issued under this pilot program will be subject to the \nrules and regulations governing private activity bonds. Moreover, the \nbonds issued under the program will not count against a State's tax-\nexempt volume cap.\n  This legislation has been endorsed by Project America, a coalition \ndedicated to improving our Nation's infrastructure, and the Public \nSecurities Association.\n  I hope that this bill can be one in a series of new approaches to \nmeeting our substantial transportation infrastructure needs and will be \none of the approaches that will help us find more efficient methods to \ndesign and to build the Nation's transportation infrastructure.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me as cosponsors of this important \ninitiative.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COCHRAN (for himself, Mr. Coverdell, and Mr. Helms):\n  S. 277. A bill to amend the Agricultural Adjustment Act to restore \nthe effectiveness of certain provisions regulating Federal milk \nmarketing orders; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n               FEDERAL MILK MARKETING ORDERS LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nto reauthorize seasonal base plans for Federal milk marketing orders.\n  This program encourages dairy farmers to stabilize their milk \nproduction seasonally. This results in more stable production in the \nfall and winter, when there is an economic disincentive for dairy \nfarmers to produce milk, and thereby ensures stable milk prices to \nconsumers.\n  Mr. President, this is a matter of fairness. Seasonal base plans were \ninstituted under the Agricultural Act of 1933. Currently, seasonal base \nplans are included in five Federal milk marketing orders that affect \nproducers in 25 States. Without extension of this authority \nexpeditiously, dairy producers\n\n[[Page S1026]]\n\nin those five orders who adjusted their production last fall will \nreceive lower average prices while those who made no adjustments will \nreceive higher average prices.\n  This is not a new issue to my colleagues. In fact, during \nconsideration of the fiscal year 1997 Agriculture Appropriations Act, \nthe Senate approved the extension of seasonal base plan authority until \nthe year 2002. The 1996 farm bill requires the Secretary of Agriculture \nto submit a reform plan for Federal milk marketing orders by 1999 and \nthis bill reauthorizes the base excess plans until 1999. This will \nensure that the market environment the Secretary was directed to reform \nexists until he has a chance to submit his plan.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAMM (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. \n        Coverdell):\n  S. 278. A bill to guarantee the right of all active military \npersonnel, merchant mariners, and their dependents to vote in Federal, \nState, and local elections; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n\n\n                 the military voting rights act of 1997\n\n Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this bill would guarantee that \nactive duty military personnel and their dependents have the right to \nvote in Federal, State, and local elections.\n  On December 19, 1996, Texas Rural Legal Aid [TLRA] filed suit against \nVal Verde County, TX, alleging that 800 military absentee ballots were \nimproperly counted in local races. The challenge argues that the \nUniformed and Overseas Absentee Voting Act was not intended to allow \nvoting in State and local elections.\n  The Military Voting Rights Act of 1997 amends the Uniformed and \nOverseas Absentee Voting Act to make explicit the right of active duty \nmilitary personnel and their dependents to vote in all Federal, State, \nand local elections. This change is consistent with the way the law has \nhistorically been interpreted by State election officials.\n  In addition, the Military Voting Rights Act of 1997 amends the \nSoldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940 to extend additional \nvoting rights protections to our Nation's military forces. This section \nguarantees that extended absences incurred as a result of service to \nthe Nation do not result in the loss of residency for voting purposes.\n  The assertion of TLRA that our soldiers can lose the right to vote in \nState and local elections by virtue of service-connected absences is \nabsurd and must not be allowed to go unanswered. The Military Voting \nRights Act of 1997 makes it clear that those who protect our freedom \nshould not be denied the right to exercise freedoms they protect.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 278\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Military Voting Rights Act \n     of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. GUARANTEE OF RESIDENCY.\n\n       Article VII of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act \n     of 1940 (50 U.S.C. 700 et seq.) is amended by adding at the \n     end the following:\n       ``Sec. 704.

Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senate,\n      Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: On behalf of the nearly 400,000 members \n     of the Retired Officers Association, of which 33,000 members \n     plus their families reside in Texas, I want to express our \n     strong support for the ``Military Voting Rights Act of \n     1997.'' It's a travesty that a taxpayer-funded group like the \n     Texas Rural Legal Aid (TRLA) would represent individuals in \n     an action to deny military members the right to vote by \n     absentee ballot in Val Verde County, Texas.\n       Although TRLA has now withdrawn from the suit and deferred \n     to a private attorney, the case remains a threat to the \n     voting rights of active duty personnel and their families. \n     Should the view enunciated by TRLA prevail, military \n     personnel who were absent because of exigencies of the \n     service would be denied a fundamental right to vote. Many of \n     these individuals, who are daily placed in ``harms way'' in \n     areas like Bosnia, would rightfully question why they should \n     be treated like second class citizens and be subjected to \n     different registration procedures than individuals who \n     register to vote by any other means under state law.\n       The current practice that enables an absentee voter to \n     submit a Federal Post Card Application has long-standing \n     roots and should not be altered to require supplementary \n     information and to specifically discriminate against \n     servicemembers. Therefore, we strongly support your effort to \n     preclude unfair sanctions from being imposed on members of \n     the uniformed services and will do our utmost to generate \n     strong grassroots support for the enactment of the ``Military \n     Voting Rights Act of 1997.''\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Paul W.

Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: On behalf of The American Legion, I \n     want to note our appreciation and express our support for The \n     Military Voting Rights Act of 1997 which, I understand, will \n     soon go to the floor of the United States Senate.\n       One of the most important responsibilities for the people \n     of a free nation is exercising their franchise. One of the \n     most precious rights we have as Americans is access to the \n     ballot box. That right and that responsibility is as \n     important to our nation's active duty military as it is to \n     the rest of the population.\n       Anyone who has served the nation in its military knows that \n     every right enjoyed and exercised by the average American is, \n     of necessity, not inherent in military service. The human \n     body is a remarkable thing. When one of the senses is \n     diminished, others increase to compensate. The loss of sight \n     may well lead to an acute sense of hearing. This concept \n     could be applied to military service. Forfeiting the comforts \n     of home and family, of occupational pursuits and the \n     protection of our borders, the opportunity to vote becomes a \n     more cherished right, a more heightened responsibility.\n       Those whose lives are on the line daily will someday return \n     to their homes. They will return to a government that shapes \n     their community and effects the lives of all those within. It \n     follows then that those on active duty in a foreign country \n     should be accorded every opportunity help structure that \n     government locally, across the state, and at the federal \n     level.\n       To you and other supporters of The Military Voting Rights \n     Act of 1997 goes the gratitude of our Organization. I believe \n     it accurate to say that the young men and women who protect \n     our nation and its interests through military service have \n     the full support of our nation's people and its government. \n     And they should have every chance to exercise their franchise \n     in support of it.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                      Joseph E. Caouctte, Jr.,\n\n                                                Chairman, National\n     Americanism Commission.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          National Association for\n\n\n                                           Uniformed Services,\n\n                                Springfield, VA, February 5, 1997.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: The National Association for Uniformed \n     Services thanks you for your action to ensure active duty \n     personnel and their family members have the right to vote in \n     federal, state, and local elections.\n\n[[Page S1027]]\n\n       We support strongly your ``Military Voting Rights Act of \n     1997'' which amends the ``Unformed and Overseas Absentee \n     Voting Act''. Your bill will make more explicit the right of \n     active duty personnel and their family members to vote in \n     federal, state, and local elections with absentee ballots as \n     the ``Soldier's and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940'' has \n     historically been interpreted by state election officials.\n       Any assertion that military personnel, who are serving \n     their country, can lose their right to vote in state and \n     local elections because of their service-connected absences \n     is outrageous! All the brave men and women of the armed \n     forces serving throughout the world are grateful for your \n     prompt, decisive action to preserve their Constitutional \n     right to vote.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              J.C.

Phil Gramm,\n     Senate Russell Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: The Air Force Association strongly \n     endorses your sponsorship of ``The Military Voting Rights Act \n     of 1997.'' The right of active duty military personnel and \n     their dependents to vote in all federal, state and local \n     elections needs to again be reemphasized to state and local \n     election officials. Recent problems in Texas have again \n     reminded us that the right to vote must be fought for time \n     and time again. Your legislation, once enacted, will help to \n     correct this inequity.\n       We pledge our support to assist you by seeking additional \n     cosponsors, to inform our members nationwide of your effort \n     and to help in any appropriate way.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Doyle E.

A bill to amend the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to \nallow employees to take school involvement leave to participate in the \nschool activities of their children or to participate in literacy \ntraining, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n                    the time for schools act of 1997\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, 4 years ago today, thanks to the hard \nwork of Senator Dodd, we passed the Family and Medical Leave Act. It \nwas one of the first things I did as a newly elected Senator. And I am \nproud of its success. In fact, it is probably the single most effective \nlaw passed by Congress this decade.\n  Now I want to expand the scope of FMLA to apply to participation in \nour schools. The Time for Schools Act of 1997 will allow parents 24 \nhours per year to participate in activities in their child's school.\n  As the mother of two children--one a teenager in high school--I know \nhow difficult and how important it is to participate in their \neducation. I have been lucky to have had the opportunity to be involved \nin their lives. But many parents do not have the time it takes to do \nthose little things that will assure their child's success in school.\n  By expanding the uses of one of the most successful laws in years, I \nwant to give parents something they don't have enough of--time.\n  When I tour schools in my home State of Washington, I often hear \nyoung people say, ``Adults don't seem to care about me.'' We know \nthat's not true, but we need to show them that adults do care. And one \nof the best places to start is to reaffirm the importance of their \neducation by taking steps to help their families get more involved in \nschools.\n  These days we have many dual-income families and single parents \nstruggling to work to make ends meet. All of these families know how \nimportant it is to be involved in their children's learning.\n  However, a recent study, Parents as School Partners research \ninitiative, sponsored by the National Council of Jewish Women's Center \nfor the Child, found that a basic lack of time was one of the main \nbarriers to more parental involvement at schools.\n  Educational studies have shown that family involvement is more \nimportant to student success than family income or education. In fact, \nthings parents control, such as limiting excess television watching and \nproviding a variety of reading materials in the home, account for \nalmost all the differences --nearly 90 percent--in average student \nachievement across States.\n  All sectors of our communities want more time for young people. \nStudents, teachers, parents and businesses feel something must be done \nto improve family involvement. In fact, 89 percent of company \nexecutives identified the biggest obstacle to school reform as the lack \nof parental involvement.\n  And, a 1996 postelection poll commissioned by the national PTA and \nother organizations found that 86 percent of people favor legislation \nthat would allow workers unpaid leave to attend parent-teacher \nconferences, or to take other actions to improve learning for their \nchildren.\n  A commitment to our children is a commitment to the future. I want to \nmake sure all young people receive the attention they need to succeed.\n  My legislation will allow parents time to: First, attend a parent/\nteacher conference; second, interview a new school for their child; and \nthird, participate in family literacy training.\n  Just last week, I talked to a woman from Bellevue who has an 11-year-\nold special needs daughter in school. Both she and her husband work \nduring the day, but he cannot get away for school activities. She told \nme my legislation would allow her husband to attend school conferences \nand participate in their child's education for the first time.\n  I look at the Family and Medical Leave Act--which has helped one in \nsix American employees take time to deal with serious family health \nproblems, and which 90 percent of businesses had little or no cost \nimplementing--and I see success. People in my State have been able to \ndeal with urgent family needs, without having to give up their jobs.\n  My bill expands the uses of Family and Medical Leave to another \nurgent need families face--the need to help their children learn.\n  Now we need to grant employees the same peace of mind about \npreventing problems in school that can lead to bigger problems for \ntheir children later on. The time is right for the Time for Schools \nAct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/05/senate-section/article/S1018-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 70\n\n  At the request of Mrs. Boxer, the name of the Senator from Illinois \n[Ms. Moseley-Braun] was added as a cosponsor of S. 70, a bill to apply \nthe same quality and safety standards to domestically manufactured \nhandguns that are currently applied to imported handguns.\n\n\n                                 S. 183\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dodd, the names of the Senator from Minnesota \n[Mr. Wellstone], the Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Akaka], and the Senator \nfrom Washington [Mrs. Murray] were added as cosponsors of S. 183, a \nbill to amend the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to apply the Act \nto a greater percentage of the United States workforce, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 212\n\n  At the request of Mr. Wellstone, the name of the Senator from \nMassachusetts [Mr. Kerry] was added as a cosponsor of S. 212, a bill to \nincrease the maximum Federal Pell Grant award in order to allow more \nAmerican students to afford higher education, and to express the Sense \nof the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/05/senate-section/article/S1027-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1027-S1034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 5--RELATIVE TO THE NORTH ATLANTIC TREATY \n                                OF 1949\n\n  Mr. ROTH (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Lugar, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. \nHagel, Mr. McCain, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Enzi, and Ms. Moseley-Braun) \nsubmitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                             S.

The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy \n     of this concurrent resolution to the President.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, one of the greatest foreign policy \nopportunities and challenges before the 105th Congress is the \nconsolidation of a wider, peaceful, and democratic Europe.\n  The inclusion of the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe in \nthe core institutions of the transatlantic community has been a \ncornerstone of American foreign policy for the last 50 years.\n  Its attainment remains both a strategic and moral imperative for the \nUnited States.\n  A key step toward this end is the inclusion of democracies from \nCentral and Eastern Europe as full members in the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization [NATO].\n  This is a step that has been endorsed by the U.S. Congress. It is a \nstep that has been endorsed by the American people.\n  It's a step that must be taken.\n  I was glad to hear the President emphasize last night in his State of \nthe Union Address that the first task of our foreign policy is to build \nan undivided, democratic Europe.\n  He is right to emphasize that a wider NATO and stable partnership \nbetween the alliance and Russia are cornerstones to this vision.\n  As we look to the 21st century, and the uncertainties that still \nthreaten our vital interests and those of our allies--as we see the \nneed to maintain an organization that is dedicated to safeguarding \nfreedoms, promoting democracy, and supporting the rule of law--we \nrealize that NATO is critical to our future.\n  It is not enough to win the cold war; we must now ensure the peace. \nThis is NATO's commission * * * a commission the alliance must continue \nto carry out.\n  Now more than ever, NATO has the opportunity to fulfill the role for \nwhich it was originally intended.\n  Those who know the history of the alliance understand the historic \nsignificance of this moment. With the cold war behind us, NATO is now \nin the position to consolidate a wider democratic Europe--the very \nreason for which the alliance was born.\n  We must welcome this.\n  Enlarging and strengthening the alliance is a catalyst for increased \nsecurity, productive communication, enhanced cooperation, and common \nobjectives.\n  An alliance that is outward-looking and inclusive provides a \nframework for peace that possesses infinite capabilities.\n  For these reasons, the North Atlantic Council recently issued an \nhistoric communique that offers a long-awaited blueprint for building \nthe alliance's relationship with the new democracies of Central and \nEastern Europe.\n  The communique calls for the alliance to advance its original \nobjectives by moving toward the integration of these nations. It \narticulates the North Atlantic Council's intention at its July summit \nmeeting in Madrid, to extend invitations to accession negotiations to \none or more countries which have participated in NATO's intensified \ndialog process.\n  The communique establishes for the alliance the goal of welcoming new \nmembers by the time of NATO's 50th anniversary in 1999.\n  It also announces the North Atlantic Council's objective to reach \nagreement with the Russian Federation on arrangements that will widen \nand deepen their current relationship in order to enhance security and \nstability in the Euro-Atlantic area.\n  Mr. President, NATO enlargement is not a new issue before the \nCongress, but it is among the most important foreign policy issues the \n105th Congress will face.\n  The timeline established by the North Atlantic Council is both worthy \nand challenging.\n  NATO's 50th anniversary will be in April of 1999. To ensure the \naccession of new members into the alliance by that date, 16 parliaments \nor legislatures will have to ratify accession treaties.\n  Considering the important role the United States will have to play in \nensuring success in this process, it is incumbent upon the 105th \nCongress to lead the ratification process.\n  Toward this end, I call upon my colleagues to endorse the goals and \ntimetable established by the North Atlantic Council through a \nresolution sponsored by Senators Lieberman, Lugar, Mikulski, Hagel, \nMcCain, Cochran, and myself.\n  I encourage my colleagues to approach this resolution with an eye \ntoward the July summit in Madrid.\n  The principal theme of this summit will be enlargement, and this \nresolution expresses the ``sense of Congress that the extension of \nmembership in NATO to the democracies of Central and Eastern Europe is \nessential to the consolidation of enduring peace and stability in \nEurope.''\n  The resolution we introduce today also reviews congressional support \nfor NATO enlargement--as well as the support of the North Atlantic \nAssembly which represents over 200 legislators from more than 40 \npolitical parties around the world.\n  Most importantly, this resolution declares that Congress regards the \npolitical independence and territorial integrity of emerging \ndemocracies in Central and Eastern Europe as vital to European peace \nand security and, thus, to the interests of the United States.\n  Our resolution calls upon the alliance, during the Madrid summit, to \nextend invitations to accession negotiations to Poland, the Czech \nRepublic, Hungary, and Slovenia.\n\n[[Page S1029]]\n\n  It endorses the pledge of the North Atlantic Council that the \nalliance will remain open to the accession of further members in \naccordance with article 10 of the Washington Treaty.\n  It also endorses the alliance's decision to seek a charter with \nRussia that reflects the common interest that Russia and the alliance \nhave in reinforcing enduring peace and stability in Europe.\n  Finally, this resolution reserves the Senate's right of advise and \nconsent over international treaties. It pledges that the Senate will \nseriously and responsibly review the outcomes of accession negotiations \nbetween the North Atlantic Council and prospective NATO members.\n  Passage of this resolution prior to the Madrid summit meeting in July \nwould reiterate and reaffirm both at home and abroad the strong \nbipartisan support behind NATO enlargement in the United States.\n  This would strengthen the President's position within the alliance on \nthe issue of enlargement as he prepares for the July summit in Madrid.\n  And, it would further reinforce the groundwork that has been laid for \nNATO enlargement, demonstrating that the 105th Congress is ready and \nwilling to aggressively address this important issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, to send a strong and \nunmistakable message to our friends and allies, and to ensure that the \nNATO's half century of success carries well into the future.\n  I would also like to submit for the Record some important documents \nconcerning the support for NATO enlargement I am finding in my home \nState of Delaware.\n  On 19 December 1996, the Wilmington Town Council passed a resolution \nintroduced by Council Member Bartowski endorsing Poland's membership in \nNATO. I ask unanimous consent that this resolution be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the resolution was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the Republic of Poland is a free, democratic and \n     independent nation with a long and proud history, whose sons \n     and daughters have played significant roles in the history of \n     Wilmington; and\n       Whereas, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is \n     dedicated to the preservation of the freedom and security of \n     its member nations and there is now a plan for enlargement of \n     NATO to proceed in 1997 and 1998; and\n       Whereas, the Republic of Poland has expressed its desire to \n     share in both the benefits and obligations of NATO in \n     pursuing the development, growth and promotion of democratic \n     institutions and ensuring free market economic development \n     and Poland may be invited to NATO membership, if criteria are \n     met, as early as Spring, 1997; and\n       Whereas, Poland recognizes its responsibilities as a \n     democratic nation and wishes to exercise such \n     responsibilities in concert with members of NATO; and\n       Whereas, the Republic of Poland desires to become part of \n     NATO's efforts to prevent the extremes of nationalism; and\n       Whereas, it has been observed that ``whenever Europe and \n     the United States go separate ways, they pay a terrible \n     price'' and the security of the United States is dependent \n     upon the stability of Central Europe, of which Poland is a \n     vital part.\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Council of the City of Wilmington, \n     Delaware, That:\n       1. This Council respectfully urges the President of the \n     United States and the Congress of the United States to \n     continue their support of the Republic of Poland's entry into \n     the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and to support the \n     establishment during 1997 and 1998 of a timetable for such \n     entry, partly in order that NATO may be cohesive, effective, \n     credible and display a sense of co-responsibility for the \n     security and stability of the whole of Europe.\n       2. The City Clerk is hereby directed to forward duly \n     authenticated copies of this resolution to the President of \n     the United States; the Presiding Officer of both branches of \n     the United States Congress; the members thereof from the \n     State of Delaware, including Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr. of \n     the Senate Foreign Relations Committee; Robert Hunter, the \n     U.S. Permanent Representative to NATO; Marek Lesniewski-Laas, \n     the Honorary Consul of the Republic of Poland; and former \n     Wilmington Mayor John E. Babiarz.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this resolution, as well as the one that we \nare introducing in the Senate today, reflect the recognition, that by \nany measure, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has been a \nresounding success.\n  It has kept the peace, reinforced geo-political relationships, and \nprovided the foundation upon which we were able to bring the cold war \nto a peaceful end.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the North Atlantic \nCouncil Communique be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Ministerial Meeting of the North Atlantic Council, December 10, 1996--\n                            Final Communique\n\n       1. As we look ahead, the new NATO is taking shape, \n     reflecting the fundamental changes in the security \n     environment in Europe and the enduring vitality of the \n     transatlantic partnership which underpins our endeavours. The \n     broad vision of this new NATO and its role in the development \n     of a new European security architecture was set out at the \n     1994 Brussels Summit and further defined at our last meeting \n     in Berlin. The Alliance's adaptation and reform is well \n     underway. We will take this process forward today.\n       The Alliance is resolved to preserve its political and \n     military strength, ensuring its ability to carry out the full \n     range of its missions--as IFOR and its planned successor SFOR \n     in Bosnia and Herzegovina clearly show. We have issued a \n     separate statement in this regard. The Alliance will continue \n     to strengthen European security by maintaining its capability \n     for collective defence, admitting new members, expanding and \n     strengthening cooperative relationships with all Partners, \n     including building a strong security partnership with Russia \n     and a distinctive relationship with Ukraine, and realising \n     the European Security and Defence Identity within the \n     Alliance.\n       The evolution of the Alliance takes place in the context of \n     our aim to help build a truly cooperative European security \n     structure. We welcome as a contribution the important \n     decisions taken at the recent OSCE Summit in Lisbon and the \n     decision by the States Parties to the CFE Treaty to begin \n     negotiations in early 1997 with a view towards adapting the \n     Treaty to the changing security environment in Europe.\n       2. Against this background, we have decided to recommend to \n     our Heads of State and Government to convene a Summit meeting \n     in Madrid on 8/9 July 1997 to set the course for the Alliance \n     as it moves towards the 21st century, consolidating Euro-\n     Atlantic security. To achieve this aim, major decisions will \n     have to be taken by the time of the Summit concerning NATO's \n     internal adaptation, the opening of the Alliance and its \n     ability to carry out all its new roles and missions. The \n     agenda for our Summit will include:\n       Agreeing a new command structure, which enables all Allies \n     to participate fully, and further advancing the \n     implementation of the Combined Joint Task Force (CJTF) \n     concept, in order to enhance the Alliance's ability to carry \n     out the full range of its missions, while preserving the \n     capability for collective defence, based on a \n     strong transatlantic partnership;\n       Finalizing, to the satisfaction of all Allies, all the \n     necessary arrangements for the European Security and Defense \n     Identity (ESDI) within NATO, which will allow for the \n     preparation and conduct of WEU-led operations with the \n     participation of all European Allies if they were so to \n     choose;\n       Inviting one or more of the countries which have expressed \n     interest in joining the Alliance to begin accession \n     negotiations;\n       Pledging that the Alliance will remain open to the \n     accession of further members and will remain ready to pursue \n     consultations with nations seeking NATO membership, as it has \n     done in the past;\n       Strengthening cooperative relations with all our Partners \n     including through an enhanced Partnership for Peace (PfP) and \n     the initiative to establish an Atlantic Partnership Council;\n       Intensifying and consolidating relations with Russia beyond \n     the Partnership for Peace by aiming at reaching an agreement \n     at the earliest possible date on the development of a strong, \n     stable and enduring security partnership;\n       Further developing an enhanced relationship with Ukraine;\n       Enhancing our Mediterranean dialogue;\n       Further developing our ability to carry out new roles and \n     missions relating to conflict prevention and crisis \n     management; and\n       Further enhancing our political and defense efforts against \n     the proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons \n     and their delivery means.\n       3. We warmly welcome the decision of the Government of \n     Spain, endorsed by the Spanish Parliament on 14 November \n     1996, to take the necessary steps to participate in the \n     Alliance's new structure. Spain's participation will further \n     strengthen the cohesion and military effectiveness of the \n     Alliance, as it takes on new roles and missions, reinforce \n     the transatlantic link and help develop ESDI within the \n     Alliance.\n       4. Stability and security in the whole Euro-Atlantic area \n     are our primary goal. We want to help build cooperative \n     European security structures which extend to countries \n     throughout the whole of Europe without excluding anyone or \n     creating dividing lines. Recent decisions at the OSCE Summit \n     meeting in Lisbon on European security cooperation and the \n     decision to adapt the CFE Treaty to the new European security \n     environment establish a cooperative foundation for our common \n     security. The Alliance, for its part, has developed a broad \n     pattern of intensive cooperation with North Atlantic \n     Cooperation Council (NACC) and PfP Partner\n\n[[Page S1030]]\n\n     countries and with other international organizations and is \n     thereby contributing to security and stability in the Euro-\n     Atlantic area. With the same aim, we are now working towards \n     opening the Alliance to new members; developing ever-\n     closer and deeper cooperative ties with all Partner \n     countries who so wish; building a strong, stable and \n     enduring security partnership with Russia; strengthening \n     our relationship with Ukraine; and enhancing our \n     Mediterranean dialogue.\n       5. We reaffirm that the nuclear forces of the Allies \n     continue to play a unique and essential role in the \n     Alliance's strategy of war prevention. New members, who will \n     be full members of the Alliance in all respects, will be \n     expected to support the concept of deterrence and the \n     essential role nuclear weapons play in the Alliance's \n     strategy. Enlarging the Alliance will not require a change in \n     NATO's current nuclear posture and therefore, NATO countries \n     have no intention, no plan, and no reason to deploy nuclear \n     weapons on the territory of new members nor any need to \n     change any aspect of NATO's nuclear posture or nuclear \n     policy--and we do not foresee any future need to do so.\n       6. A number of countries have long-standing aspirations to \n     become full members of our Alliance and have undertaken \n     intensive and wide-ranging preparations and reforms with this \n     aim in mind. We are now in a position to recommend to our \n     Heads of State and Government to invite at next year's Summit \n     meeting one or more countries which have participated in the \n     intensified dialogue process, to start accession negotiations \n     with the Alliance. Our goal is to welcome the new member(s) \n     by the time of NATO's 50th anniversary in 1999. We pledge \n     that the Alliance will remain open to the accession of \n     further members in accordance with Article 10 of the \n     Washington Treaty. We will remain ready to pursue \n     consultations with nations seeking NATO membership, as we \n     have done in the past.\n       We are satisfied with the intensified, individual dialogue \n     which the Alliance has been conducting throughout this year \n     with interested Partners. This dialogue has improved their \n     understanding of specific and practical details of how the \n     Alliance works. It has provided the Alliance in turn with a \n     better understanding of where these countries stand in their \n     internal development as well as in the resolution of any \n     external issues with neighbouring countries. We have tasked \n     the Council in Permanent Session to prepare comprehensive \n     recommendations for decisions to be taken by the Summit on \n     which country or countries to invite to begin accession \n     negotiations. The process should include:\n       An intensified dialogue with interested Partner countries \n     including in a ``16+1'' format, as appropriate;\n       Analysis, on the basis of further political guidance to be \n     elaborated by the Council in Permanent Session, of the \n     relevant factors associated with the admission of potential \n     new members;\n       Preparation of recommendations on the adaptation of \n     Alliance structures necessary to integrate new members into \n     the Alliance;\n       Preparation of a plan for conducting the accession talks \n     with one or more new members.\n       7. We look forward to tomorrow's meeting of the NACC, which \n     will mark its fifth anniversary. The NACC has provided us \n     over the years with a valued opportunity to consult regularly \n     with our Partners on political and security issues. Through \n     NACC and Partnership for Peace, we have achieved the \n     development of common approaches to European security and \n     brought the NACC countries closer together in a spirit of \n     cooperation and a common commitment to European security. We \n     are committed to ensuring that the NACC goals of enhancing \n     transparency and confidence in security matters among member \n     states remain central to future cooperation. In order to \n     derive maximum benefit from our NACC meetings, we want to \n     move towards further deepening our political dialogue and \n     giving it more focus.\n       8. We are pleased with the dynamic development of \n     Partnership for Peace and the role it plays in building \n     European security cooperation. The Partnership for Peace will \n     continue as a permanent element of the Alliance's cooperative \n     effort to contribute to the development of a more stable \n     European security area and, with those Partners seeking to \n     join NATO, will also facilitate their preparations to meet \n     the responsibilities of membership in the Alliance. \n     Substantial progress has been achieved in enhancing the scope \n     and substance of our Partnership cooperation, in particular \n     the growing range of exercises, the broadening and deepening \n     of the PfP Planning and Review Process, the intensification \n     of work on civil-military relations, and civil emergency \n     planning and disaster relief. In the current IFOR operation, \n     in which 13 Partner countries are cooperating with Alliance \n     armed forces, the Partnership for Peace has proved its value \n     with regard both to political commitment to joint crisis \n     management and to military interoperability.\n       We want to develop on the basis of transparency ever-closer \n     and deeper cooperative ties open to all Partner countries by \n     making the Partnership more operational; strengthening its \n     political consultation element, taking full account of the \n     respective activities of the OSCE and the relevant European \n     institutions such as the WEU and the EU; and involving \n     Partners more in operations planning and Partnership \n     decision-making. To this end, the Alliance has set up a \n     Senior Level Group to develop by the time of the Summit \n     meeting a clearly strengthened and thus more attractive \n     Partnership for Peace. We have received an interim report on \n     the ongoing work and agree that work should begin without \n     delay to implement its recommendations. These include:\n       Enhancing the political dimension of the Partnership \n     through increasing opportunities for political consultations;\n       Expanding the agreed fields of military missions within PfP \n     to the full range of the Alliance's new missions, as \n     appropriate, including Peace Support operations over and \n     above previously agreed areas;\n       Broadening the NATO/PfP exercise programme in accordance \n     with the expanded scope of the Partnership;\n       Enabling Partner countries to participate in the planning \n     and execution of PfP activities (exercises and operations);\n       Involving Partners more substantively and actively in PfP-\n     related parts of the regular peacetime work of NATO's \n     Military Authorities;\n       Affording the appropriate opportunity to Partners who join \n     future NATO-led PfP operations to contribute to the provision \n     of political guidance for oversight over such operations, \n     drawing on the experience gained in Operation Joint \n     Endeavour;\n       Examining, together with Partners, the possible modalities \n     for the elaboration of a political-military framework for PfP \n     operations, building on the current work of the Political-\n     Military Steering Committee;\n       Enhancing Partner participation in decision-making for PfP \n     programmes issues;\n       Increasing regional cooperation within the Partnership \n     provided it remains open to all Partners and remains an \n     integral part of the overall PfP;\n       Expanding the Planning and Review Process; and\n       As soon as the Brussels Agreement on the Status of Missions \n     and Representatives of Third States to NATO comes into force, \n     offering Partners the opportunity to establish diplomatic \n     missions with NATO.\n       We have asked the Council in Permanent Session to ensure \n     implementation of these recommendations without delay and to \n     continue the work on the enhancement of Partnership for Peace \n     and also to review its common funding and resource \n     implications, with a view to providing a further report by \n     the SLG with recommendations for decisions at the time of the \n     Spring Ministerial meeting.\n       9. With the rapid growth of our activities under both NACC \n     and PfP, we have identified a need for greater coherence in \n     our cooperation in a framework which will establish with \n     Partners a more meaningful and productive cooperative and \n     consultative process, building on the elements of NACC and \n     PfP which we and our Partners deem most valuable. To this \n     end, we have agreed to work with Partners on the initiative \n     to establish an Atlantic Partnership Council (APC) as a \n     single new cooperative mechanism, which would form a \n     framework for enhanced efforts in both practical cooperation \n     under PfP and an expanded political dimension of Partnership. \n     We have accordingly tasked the Council in Permanent Session \n     to draw up the modalities for such a council, in close \n     coordination with Partners, by the time of our next meeting.\n       10. We affirm our support for the political and economic \n     reform process in the Russian Federation. We welcome the \n     landmark Presidential elections in Russia. * * *\n       A broad process of integration and cooperation is underway \n     in Europe; Russia is a part of it through its membership in \n     the OSCE and the Council of Europe and its relationship with \n     NATO as well as the European Union and the WEU. The pattern \n     of consultations anchored by our regular ``16 +1'' \n     discussions, provide a firm foundation on which to build. We \n     welcome Russia's participation in Partnership for Peace and \n     encourage it to take full advantage of the opportunities \n     which the Partnership offers.\n       We value the close and effective cooperation between Russia \n     and NATO in IFOR. This cooperation demonstrates that NATO and \n     Russia can collaborate effectively in the construction of \n     cooperative security structures in Europe. We appreciate and \n     welcome Russia's readiness to contribute to a follow-on \n     operation to consolidate peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We \n     look forward to continuing the experience of working closely \n     together, which we believe will have a lasting, positive \n     impact on our relationship.\n       Today, we reiterate our commitment to a strong, stable, and \n     enduring security partnership between NATO and Russia. This \n     partnership demonstrates that European security has entered a \n     fundamentally new, more promising era. It constitutes an \n     important element of the developing European cooperative \n     security architecture to which Russia has an essential \n     contribution to make. It will further enhance stability and \n     security in the Euro-Atlantic area. By the time of the \n     Summit, we aim to reach agreement with the Russian Federation \n     on arrangements that can deepen and widen the scope of our \n     current relationship and provide a framework for its future \n     development. We want to ensure that NATO and Russia have a \n     strong, flexible means to consult and cooperate as part of \n     our evolving relationship. Agreement might be expressed in a \n     document or could take the form of a Charter, which could \n     encompass:\n       The shared principles that will form the basis of our \n     relationship;\n       A broad set of areas of practical cooperation in particular \n     in the political, military,\n\n[[Page S1031]]\n\n     economic, environmental, scientific, peacekeeping, armaments, \n     non-proliferation, arms control and civil emergency planning \n     fields;\n       Mechanisms for regular and ad hoc consultations; and\n       Mechanisms for military liaison and cooperation.\n       We therefore task the Council in Permanent Session to \n     develop further guidance on these matters on the basis of \n     which the Secretary General could explore with Russia the \n     possibility of such agreement.\n       11. We continue to support Ukraine as it develops as a \n     democratic nation and a market economy. The maintenance of \n     Ukraine's independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty \n     is a crucial factor for stability and security in Europe.\n       Ukraine's development of a strong, enduring relationship \n     with NATO is an important aspect of the emerging European \n     security architecture. We greatly value the active \n     participation of Ukraine in the Partnership for Peace and \n     look forward to next year's exercise near Lviv. We also \n     value Ukraine's cooperation with European institutions \n     such as the EU and the WEU. Ukraine has made an important \n     contribution to IFOR and UNTAES, and we welcome its \n     commitment to contribute to a follow-on operation to \n     consolidate peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n       We welcome the continued development of our broad \n     cooperation beyond PfP. We note with satisfaction the recent \n     meeting between the Alliance and Ukraine on issues related to \n     the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. We welcome \n     the progress made towards establishing a NATO information \n     office in Kyiv, and look forward to its opening in the near \n     future. We welcome Ukraine's active interest in further \n     enhancing its relations with the Alliance. We are committed \n     to the development in coming months, through high level and \n     other consultations, of a distinctive and effective NATO-\n     Ukraine relationship, which could be formalised, possibly by \n     the time of the Summit, building on the document on enhanced \n     NATO-Ukraine relations agreed in September 1995, and taking \n     into account recent Ukrainian proposals.\n       12. We support the Middle East peace process, and urge all \n     participants to remain firmly committed to it.\n       We reaffirm our conviction that security in Europe is \n     closely linked with security and stability in the \n     Mediterranean, and that the Mediterranean dimension is \n     consequently one of the various components of the European \n     security architecture. In this regard, as part of the \n     adaptation of the Alliance, we will work towards enhancing \n     our relations with non-NATO Mediterranean countries through \n     our dialogue.\n       The dialogue complements other international efforts, such \n     as those undertaken by the Barcelona process, the OSCE and \n     the WEU without creating any division of labour. We welcome \n     the report of the Council in Permanent Session on the \n     progress of and recommendations for future steps to develop \n     the dialogue with Mediterranean countries through political \n     dialogue and other activities agreed by the Alliance. Egypt, \n     Israel, Jordan, Mauritania, Morocco and Tunisia have \n     reiterated their interest in the development of our \n     relations. We have decided to enhance our Mediterranean \n     dialogue in a progressive way and have tasked the Council in \n     Permanent Session to report at our next meeting on the \n     implementation of the activities foreseen in the report as \n     well as on the scope for further development.\n       13. We are carrying forward the process of the Alliance's \n     internal adaptation, with the fundamental objectives of \n     ensuring the Alliance's military effectiveness, maintaining \n     the transatlantic link, and developing the ESDI within NATO. \n     In keeping with the decisions taken by NATO Heads of State \n     and Government at the 1994 Summit Meeting and by the \n     Ministerial meetings in June this year in Berlin and Brussels \n     and with a view to preparing for the Summit next year, our \n     primary focus has been on three closely linked issues: the \n     development of a new command structure for the Alliance; the \n     implementation of the CJTF concept; and the development of \n     the ESDI within NATO.\n       14. We welcome the progress made in the development of the \n     future command structure, noting that two structural \n     alternatives have been selected by the Military Committee for \n     future assessment and subsequent political consideration and \n     agree the proposed way ahead. We urge the Council in \n     Permanent Session and the Military Committee to complete the \n     work as quickly as possible. Once approved, this new command \n     structure will help ensure the Alliance's military \n     effectiveness so that it is able, in the changing security \n     environment facing Europe, to perform its traditional mission \n     of collective defense and through flexible and agreed \n     procedures to undertake new roles in changing circumstances \n     and to provide for increased participation by Partner \n     countries. It will constitute a renovated, single \n     multinational command structure, reflecting the strategic \n     situation in Europe and enabling all Allies to participate \n     fully.\n       15. We welcome the progress made towards realizing the CJTF \n     concept, on the basis of the Overall Politico-Military \n     Framework approved by us last June. We direct the Council in \n     Permanent Session and the NATO Military Authorities to pursue \n     vigorously their work on this concept, bearing in mind its \n     importance for future Alliance operations, including the \n     possible involvement of development of ESDI.\n       16. We are pleased with the progress made in developing the \n     appropriate arrangements for ESDI within NATO, as decided at \n     the Brussels Summit and at our meeting last June in Berlin. \n     The newly created Policy Coordination Group has contributed \n     significantly to this process.\n       17. We note in particular the steps taken towards \n     implementing the concept of separable but not separate \n     capabilities:\n       The decisions of the Council in Permanent Session on \n     political guidance concerning the elaboration of European \n     command arrangements within NATO able to prepare and conduct \n     WEU-led operations;\n       The decisions of the Council in Permanent Session regarding \n     the arrangements for identifying NATO capabilities and assets \n     which might be made available to the WEU for a WEU-led \n     operation;\n       The progress to date on arrangements for the release, \n     monitoring and return or recall of Alliance assets and \n     capabilities;\n       The decision of the Council in Permanent Session with \n     respect to modalities of cooperation with the WEU;\n       The progress on work regarding planning and conducting \n     exercising for WEU-led operations, following receipt of \n     illustrative profiles for WEU missions.\n       18. We have directed the Council in Permanent Session  to \n     submit to the Spring 1997 Ministerial meetings a report on \n     the adaptation of Alliance structures and procedures \n     related to the future command structure, on the \n     implementation of the CJTF concept, and on further \n     progress with recommendations for decisions in the \n     development of ESDI within the Alliance.\n       19. We welcome the close and intensifying cooperation \n     between NATO and the WEU. At their meeting in Ostend on 19 \n     November 1996, WEU Ministers agreed that it would be valuable \n     for WEU to become actively involved in the Alliance's defense \n     planning process and expressed their readiness to \n     participate. Early agreement is now being sought in the WEU \n     on the participation of all European Allies in WEU-led \n     operations using NATO assets and capabilities, as well as in \n     planning and preparing for such operations. This would be a \n     key contribution to the development of ESDI within the \n     Alliance. We have tasked the Council in Permanent Session to \n     develop the NATO-WEU relationship further in order to ensure \n     effective cooperation in preparing for possible WEU-led \n     operations.\n       20. We are pleased with the successful outcome of the OSCE \n     Summit in Lisbon and, in particular, the adoption of a \n     declaration on security as a result of work on a Common and \n     Comprehensive Security Model for the 21st Century. The Lisbon \n     Summit has created a security framework in which all European \n     states can participate on an equal footing. The Security \n     Model adopted in Lisbon is a comprehensive expression of the \n     endeavour to strengthen security and stability. It \n     complements the mutually reinforcing efforts of NATO and \n     other European and transatlantic institutions and \n     organisations. We attach great importance to the role of the \n     OSCE as a primary instrument in preventive diplomacy, \n     conflict prevention, post-conflict rehabilitation and \n     regional security cooperation, as well as to the enhancement \n     of its operational capabilities to carry out these tasks. We \n     believe the OSCE, as the only pan-European security \n     organisation, has an essential role to play in European peace \n     and stability. We are committed to supporting its \n     comprehensive approach to security. The principles and \n     commitments on which the OSCE is built provide the standards \n     for the development of a comprehensive and cooperative \n     European security structure.\n       We commend the OSCE for its essential contribution to the \n     implementation of civil aspects of the Peace Agreement for \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina, particularly in supervising the \n     preparation and conduct of the elections, in promoting and \n     monitoring human rights and in overseeing the implementation \n     of agreed confidence--and security--building measures and \n     sub-regional arms control agreements. The OSCE thereby \n     demonstrates its central role in contributing to regional \n     stability and security.\n       We are pleased with the support given by IFOR to the OSCE \n     in carrying out its tasks. The cooperation between OSCE and \n     IFOR is a good example of our concept of mutually reinforcing \n     organisations. The practical assistance given by NATO to the \n     OSCE in helping to establish measures to verify the \n     confidence-building and arms control agreements of the \n     Dayton Accords testifies to a growing cooperation between \n     NATO and the OSCE. We reiterate our readiness to further \n     develop the cooperation between the two organizations.\n       The democratic and economic development, independence, \n     sovereignty and territorial integrity of all states are \n     essential factors for stability and security in the Euro-\n     Atlantic area. We commend the OSCE for its mediation efforts \n     in a number of regional conflicts through its various \n     missions, and recognize the valuable work of the High \n     Commissioner on National Minorities. We support the efforts \n     of the Minsk Group to achieve a political settlement of the \n     conflict in and around Nagorno-Karabakh.\n       The OSCE acquis in the field of disarmament, arms control, \n     and confidence- and security-building measures continues to \n     contribute significantly to political and military stability. \n     We consider the full implementation, the further development, \n     and if necessary, the adaptation of these measures to be \n     indispensable elements in our effort to further enhance the \n     European security architecture. We welcome the recent \n     adoption by the Forum for Security Cooperation of the\n\n[[Page S1032]]\n\n     Framework for Arms Control and its Future Agenda.\n       21. The CFE Treaty is a fundamental cornerstone of security \n     and stability for all in the Euro-Atlantic area. We are \n     committed to maintain and strengthen it. Consistent with our \n     broader goal of enhancing political cooperation and military \n     stability in a Europe without dividing lines, we welcome the \n     decision of the 30 States Parties to the CFE Treaty on 1 \n     December 1996 in Lisbon to launch negotiations to adapt the \n     Treaty to the changing security environment in Europe. We \n     look forward to beginning negotiations in the Joint \n     Consultative Group in Vienna in January 1997 on the basis of \n     the scope and parameters (Terms of Reference) document agreed \n     on Lisbon.\n       Our common goal is to enhance security for all States \n     Parties, irrespective of whether they belong to an alliance, \n     and preserve their right to choose and change their security \n     arrangements. Within the broader political context of \n     enhanced security for all, this process should strengthen the \n     cooperative pattern of relationships between States Parties, \n     based on mutual confidence, transparency, stability and \n     predictability. Committed, like the other States Parties, to \n     adapting the Treaty by developing mechanisms which will \n     enhance the Treaty's viability and effectiveness, we will \n     pursue steps to review the Treaty's group structure, to adapt \n     the Treaty system of limitations and to enhance its \n     verification and information provisions. To that end, the \n     members of the Alliance will develop and table proposals for \n     the negotiations in Vienna.\n       We reaffirm our support for the CFR Flank Agreement, \n     reached at this year's Review Conference in Vienna. We urge \n     all States Parties who have not yet done so to approve this \n     Agreement before the end of the extended provisions \n     application period efforts directed at resolving outstanding \n     implementation issues.\n       The members of the Alliance reaffirm the commitment made at \n     Lisbon to exercise restraint during the period of \n     negotiations as foreseen in the document in relation to the \n     current postures and capabilities of their conventional armed \n     forces--in particular, with respect to their levels of forces \n     and deployments--in the Treaty's area of application. As \n     decided in Lisbon, this commitment is without prejudice to \n     the outcome of the negotiations, or to voluntary decisions by \n     the individual States Parties to reduce their force levels or \n     deployments, or to their legitimate security interests. We \n     believe that the CFE Treaty must continue to play a key role \n     in ensuring military stability into the 21st century, and are \n     committed to adapting it expeditiously in order to take \n     account of new security challenges.\n       22. We emphasize the importance of the START Treaties for \n     international stability and security. We note with \n     satisfaction the progress made by the United States and the \n     Russian Federation in the implementation of START I. We urge \n     the Russian Federation to follow the United States in \n     ratifying the START II Treaty.\n       We welcome the successful conclusion and signing by the \n     great majority of UN members of the Comprehensive Test Ban \n     Treaty, and we urge all other nations to sign this important \n     international arms control agreement. We look forward to the \n     early start of negotiations on a Fissile Material Cut-Off \n     Treaty.\n       We are pleased that the Chemical Weapons Convention will \n     soon enter into force and we look forward to its early \n     implementation. We welcome the fact that States Parties to \n     the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention have at the \n     Fourth Review Conference in Geneva in December 1996 again \n     solemnly declared their recognition that effective \n     verification could reinforce the Convention.\n       Recognizing the heightened concern of the international \n     community of the suffering and casualties caused by anti-\n     personnel mines, we support the vigorous pursuit of an \n     effective, legally binding international agreement to ban the \n     use, stockpiling, production and transfer of antipersonnel \n     mines and, as an important step to this end, support the \n     early ratification of the Treaty on Open Skies by those \n     states which have not already ratified.\n       23. Proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical \n     weapons and their delivery means continue to be a matter of \n     serious concern to us. Progress in expanding and intensifying \n     NATO's political and defense efforts against proliferation, \n     as directed by NATO Heads of State and Government in January \n     1994, is an integral part of NATO's adaptation to the new \n     security environment. These efforts also contribute to NATO's \n     ability to conduct new roles and missions. We remain \n     committed to preventing proliferation in the first place, or, \n     if it occurs, to reversing it through diplomatic means. \n     The Alliance is improving its capabilities to address the \n     risks posed by proliferation. We welcome further \n     consultations and cooperation with Partner countries to \n     address the common security risks posed by proliferation. \n     We note with satisfaction the report of the Alliance's \n     Joint Committee on Proliferation on the activities of the \n     Senior Political-Military Group on Proliferation and the \n     Senior Defence Group on Proliferation and direct them to \n     continue their vital efforts.\n       We attach particular importance to a solid preparation of \n     the first preparatory committee of the strengthened review \n     process of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), \n     scheduled for April 1997. This process will significantly \n     contribute to the further strengthening of the NPT, which is \n     the cornerstone of the global non-proliferation system.\n       24. We reaffirm our commitment to the Alliance's common-\n     funded programmes.\n       We note with appreciation the progress made in moving \n     existing resources to the highest priority programmes, such \n     as Partnership for Peace and the support of enhanced \n     information activities in Moscow and Kyiv. We have directed \n     the Council in Permanent Session to keep under review the \n     allocation of resources in order to ensure their optimal use. \n     We have also directed the Council in Permanent Session to \n     identify the implications of adaptation for NATO's common-\n     funded budgets and to make appropriate recommendations for \n     dealing with these.\n       25. We continue to support all efforts to combat terrorism, \n     which constitutes a serious threat to peace, security and \n     stability.\n       26. The Spring 1997 meeting of the North Atlantic Council \n     in Ministerial Session will be held in Sintra, Portugal, on \n     29 May.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nDelaware, not, of course, simply for yielding, but for his continuing \nleadership on this vital question of whether or not NATO will be \nenlarged.\n  Mr. President, this is one of those moments in history when we are \npresented with an extraordinary opportunity to do something that will \nshape the course of the coming decades. So often so much happens in our \nprofessional lives, our personal lives, that it is hard to distinguish \nbetween the important and the very important. This, in my opinion, is a \nvery important resolution, beginning as it does the consideration by \nthe 105th session of Congress of the critical question of whether the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization will extend memberships beyond its \ncurrent role.\n  This resolution reaffirms the shared commitment expressed repeatedly \nby strong bipartisan majorities in the Congress to the continued \nviability of our transatlantic alliance and to its irreplaceable \ncontribution to peace and stability in Europe, and therefore to the \nvital strategic and economic and moral interests of our own country.\n  Mr. President, we are at a moment which, while the details may \ndiffer, is not unlike the time after the Second World War when \nenlightened leaders of both parties in this country, learning the \nlessons of their departure from the field of international relations \nafter the First World War, came together and supported the \nreconstruction of post-World War II Europe, building not just the \nstrength of those countries, the economic might that followed, but \nbuilding therein great democracies that have become once again our best \nfriends and allies.\n  We are at such a moment after another war, the cold war, has ended. \nThe question is whether we will see forward boldly and honorably to \nunderstand that whether or not we will accept the nations that lived \nunder Soviet domination into the community now of free nations will \nhave a substantial effect on our security and our economic strength and \nour moral vitality for decades to come.\n  For unless we close our eyes to history, we must recognize that we \nare vitally interested in what goes on in Europe. We are connected. Our \npasts and our futures are linked economically, politically, culturally, \nand militarily. Those ties did not break away with the fall of the \nBerlin Wall. Indeed, they will become more complex and more compelling \nand more productive over time. Over time, NATO has proved itself the \nmost enduring guarantee that we and our allies in Europe are brought \ntogether in peace and freedom, not in tyranny and war.\n  NATO remains today the world's single most effective partnership of \nlike-minded countries, sharing the burdens of international security \nand preserving the conditions in which open societies and free markets \nflourish.\n  Enlarging NATO means enlarging the transatlantic sphere of peace and \nstability, of peace and prosperity. It means honoring our promise made \nrepeatedly throughout the cold war that we would be there when that \ncherished moment arrived to support the new independent nations of \nCentral and Eastern Europe in their struggle for democracy and a better \nlife. It means helping to ensure that those countries will continue \ntheir democratic development and take their place peacefully in the \nexpanding community of freedom. And it means expanding the family of\n\n[[Page S1033]]\n\nnations that will share with us Americans the burden of protecting the \nstability and peace of the world and expanding the family of free \npeoples of the world.\n  Mr. President, this resolution expresses, in very strong and very \nclear language, our conviction across party lines that NATO enlargement \nis the best way to ensure a peaceful, stable, free future in Europe. It \nalso makes clear that we must work with Russia, which is inherently \nand, of course, part of the European community and critical to the \nfuture stability of Europe. We must work with Russia to reach common \nground on European security.\n  Proceeding steadfastly with our plans to enlarge NATO, I think, will \nmake that task easier. For where we leave doubt, there will be further \ndoubts created. Where we are uncertain, there are those who will take \nadvantage of our uncertainty.\n  The fact is that NATO is today and has always been a defensive \nalliance. It poses no threat to its neighbors. Instead, it offers the \nconfidence of secure borders and stable relationships. And by making it \nclear that the NATO enlargement process is ongoing and open to other \ncountries as they qualify, it alleviates the threat of future conflict \nbetween competing blocs. NATO does not seek to target nations for \nexclusion. It seeks to engage nations on the high ground of democracy \nand free market economics and to become partners with them.\n  Mr. President, this week there is a remarkable statement of opinion \nin Newsweek magazine, the February 10, 1997, issue, written by Andre \nKozyrev, former Foreign Minister of Russia. The title is ``NATO Is Not \nOur Enemy.'' I will read briefly from the article.\n\n       The Russian people [former foreign minister Kozyrev says] \n     must be told the truth. And the truth is, NATO is not the \n     enemy. Indeed, fighting the West's proposal to admit \n     Central European countries to NATO is self-defeating [for \n     Russia], because Russia has no means of stopping it. The \n     vital Commonwealth of Independent States alliance would \n     surely fall on hard times if it is burdened with \n     opposition to NATO. What member-nation [of the CIS] would \n     remain part of such a group, when the NATO seal of \n     approval often brings investment, advancement and economic \n     enhancement? As foreign minister, [Kozyrev writes] I found \n     that every Eastern European leader who wanted NATO \n     membership saw it primarily as an economic move, not a \n     military one. Opposing that will weaken our [that is to \n     say the Russian] economic position in Central Europe.\n       The West must recognize this as a domestic-policy crisis, \n     [which is to say a domestic policy crisis in Russia] resist \n     capitulation to the old guard and deal with it in a balanced \n     fashion. An entirely new generation of leaders in our country \n     [Russia] is waiting for this policy shift. To accomplish it, \n     NATO's member-nations must take very difficult and \n     challenging steps. The practical way for Russia to transform \n     NATO is to cooperate with the alliance--and vice versa.\n\n  End of quote from Mr. Kozyrev's remarkable and, I think, very \npowerful statement.\n  Mr. President, NATO enlargement is moving forward thanks to the \nleadership of President Clinton, the support of a strong bipartisan \ngroup here in Congress, the very effective advocacy of NATO Secretary \nSolana, and so many others around the world.\n  We in Congress can play a very important part in this remarkable \nhistorical achievement. This resolution which Senator Roth has brought \nbefore the Senate today, and which I am proud to cosponsor with him, \nwill provide the President with the support to work with our allies to \ncreate the mechanisms by which new members will be welcomed into the \nalliance and the broad-based bipartisan support with which to go \nforward to develop a strong NATO-Russia security relationship.\n  As its 50th anniversary approaches, the Atlantic alliance remains at \nthe core of America's global strength and at the core of global peace \nand security. The reach of this alliance should now be extended to \nthose whose histories and policies justify it, just as America's own \nstrategic interests and moral imperatives require it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of expanding \nthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization to help ensure stability in \nCentral and Eastern Europe. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of \nthis resolution to encourage the NATO expansion process and to put the \n105th Congress on record in support of bringing Poland, Hungary, the \nCzech Republic, and Slovenia into the alliance.\n  I believe restructuring Europe's post-cold-war security architecture \nand securing lasting peace and stability throughout the continent \nconstitute one of the great foreign policy challenges of our time. From \ntwo world wars to the former Yugoslavia, history has shown that \nEurope's security problems eventually become America's. Time and again, \nwe have found ourselves confronted with only two options: Choosing to \nlead and help shape events in Europe, or waiting for events to overtake \nus as they certainly will.\n  Americans are well-served when America chooses to lead.\n  For half a century, the NATO alliance has been the foundation of \nEuropean security. It has been the most meaningful multinational \nsecurity framework in history. NATO will continue to be that foundation \nfor the next half century--but only if America helps lead the alliance \nto adapt to the new reality in Europe after the end of the cold war.\n  The new reality is that the nations of Central and Eastern Europe are \nfree from oppression and many yearn to align themselves with the West.\n  The new reality is that instability in the lands one author called \n``Between East and West'' has replaced invasion from the East as the \nmost likely threat to our allies and to our own interests in Europe.\n  The new reality is that America, Russia, and Europe will all benefit \nif the nations of Central and Eastern Europe are anchored in the \npeaceful security that NATO can offer.\n  I am convinced that we must move swiftly to expand the NATO alliance \nand to rethink our commitment to European security. More than 7 years \nafter the Berlin Wall fell, NATO has yet to take in new members.\n  Congress has consistently supported NATO expansion and has enacted \nlegislation to prepare the nations of Central and Eastern Europe for \nmembership in the alliance. The resolution we are introducing today is \ndesigned to push ahead once again. It encourages the President to move \nquickly. It endorses the idea of embracing new members by the \nalliance's 50-year anniversary in 1999. It makes plain our belief that \nour alliance must reach out to work with Russia as friends rather than \nantagonists. And it names Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and \nSlovenia as nations whose membership would contribute to the alliance's \nsecurity.\n  Those of us who support NATO expansion must be prepared to make the \ncase that it serves America's long-term security interests. This is a \ndebate that must reach far beyond the Halls of Congress. NATO \nexpansion, when it does occur, will require the consent of the Senate. \nAnd that will require the support of the American people.\n  It is time for this debate to begin.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues in \nintroducing this resolution in support of NATO enlargement.\n  I support NATO enlargement because it will make Europe more stable \nand secure. It means that the new democracies of Central and Eastern \nEurope will share the burden of European security. It will mean that \nfuture generations of Americans might not have to fight and die for \nEurope.\n  America has fought and won three wars in Europe:\n  World War I, when an assassination in Yugoslavia led to years of \nbloodshed\n  World War II, the bloodiest war in history--when thousands of young \nAmericans left factories and farms to fight on the battlefields of \nEurope\n  And the cold war--when Soviet expansionism forced us to prepare to \ndefend Western Europe--and when the captive nations of Eastern Europe \nwere forced behind the Iron Curtain.\n  If NATO doesn't enlarge--the Iron Curtain returns--and the unnatural \ndivision of Europe into two parts will live on longer than the Soviet \nEmpire did.\n  As a Polish American, I know that the Polish people did not choose to \nlive behind the Iron Curtain. They were forced there by the Yalta \nAgreement, by Potsdam, and because they and the Baltic States and the \nother captive nations were sold out by the free world.\n  But my support for this resolution is based on the future--not the \npast. I support this resolution because NATO enlargement will mean a \nfuture in which the newly free and democratic\n\n[[Page S1034]]\n\ncountries will take their rightful place as members of Europe.\n  NATO played an important in part in securing this freedom. It has \nbeen the most successful defensive alliance in history. It is an \nalliance that helped us win the cold war. It deterred war between the \nsuper powers, and it helped prevent confrontations between member \nstates.\n  But if NATO is to survive, it must adapt to meet the needs of the \npost-cold-war-World--or it will become irrelevant.\n  NATO has evolved since we created it in 1949. We have enlarged NATO \non three different occasions. Each new member strengthened NATO and \nincreased security in Europe.\n  Today, we are facing very different threats to security and stability \nin Europe. We have hot spots caused by ethnic and regional tensions. We \nhave civil wars--as in Bosnia. And we have international crime, drugs, \nand terrorism. NATO must change and expand to meet these new threats.\n  The countries of Central and Eastern Europe want to help us address \nthese new threats. How many times has the Senate discussed burden \nsharing in Europe? How often have we complained that European countries \nwere not willing to pay their fair share for their own defense?\n  Now we have countries that are asking to share the burden. They are \nasking to pledge their troops and equipment for the common defense. \nThey are asking to share the burden of peacekeeping--in fact they are \ndoing it right now in Bosnia where thousands of troops from Poland, \nHungary, the Czech Republic, the Baltics, Ukraine, and others are \nhelping to secure the peace.\n  These countries are not asking for a handout. They are not asking for \nour protection. They are asking to be full partners in the new Europe. \nBy transforming their countries into free market democracies, they have \nearned this right.\n  Mr. President, NATO is moving toward enlargement.

Mr. President, today, my friend Pat Moynihan and I are \nsubmitting a sense-of-the-Senate resolution regarding the accuracy of \nthe Consumer Price Index. Last week the Finance Committee kicked off \nour first hearings of the 105th Congress with a very distinguished \npanel of experts in the field of economics and Dr. Alan Greenspan, \nChairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.\n  Mr. President, probably the most significant issue that faces \nCongress this year is the accuracy of the Consumer Price Index, and I \nbelieve that Congress and the President need to seriously address the \neconomic ramifications of an accurate CPI.\n  One of the roles in government is to protect American families from \ninflation. In doing so, it is important that we are able to precisely \nmeasure inflation.\n  I cannot emphasize too greatly--that is what these discussions are \nall about--the accurate measurement of inflation. If the index is too \nhigh, it overcompensates retirees and others and undertaxes many \ntaxpayers. If it is too low, it undercompensates retirees and overtaxes \nthe taxpayer. What we want in fairness to all is as accurate an index \nas possible.\n  Obviously, this is a very sensitive issue, affecting retirees and \ntaxpayers directly as well as wage earners and others.\n  In the spring of 1995, the Senate Finance Committee appointed a blue \nribbon commission, headed by Dr. Michael Boskin, to study the \nmethodology used to compute our current measure of inflation, the CPI. \nThe panel also included leading experts in the field of price indexes, \nthey include:\n  Dr. Dale Jorgenson, Harvard University; Dr. Ellen Dulberger, IBM \nPersonal Computer Company; Dr. Zvi Griliches, Harvard University; and \nDr. Robert Gordon, Northwestern University.\n  In their interim report, released in September 1995, the Boskin \nCommission concluded that the upward bias using changes in the Consumer \nPrice Index to estimate changes in the true cost of living is about 1 \npercentage point per year.\n  Dr. Boskin and the other four commission members have now completed \ntheir final report and have concluded that this critical government \nstatistic is not as accurate as possible. Since this report suggests \nthat the Consumer Price Index has an annual upward bias of about 1.1 \npercent, clearly this is a significant finding and should be taken \nseriously.\n  Dr. Boskin and his colleagues have also suggested to the Finance \nCommittee that a new measure of the true cost of living may be needed.\n  Inaccurate government statistics--particularly one as important as \nthe CPI--are unacceptable. Steps should be taken to change the \nprocedures so that the measure of the CPI is as accurate as possible.\n  I want to stress that any action we take on this report must be \nbroadly and deeply bipartisan.\n  We must also have the full cooperation of and leadership by the \nClinton administration. I hope the President will not miss an \nopportunity to address this issue in his fiscal year 1998 budget he \nsubmits to the Congress this week. Clearly this reform will not be \nsuccessful without the President's leadership.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, might I first take the opportunity to \ncongratulate the chairman for this initiative. It is characteristic of \nhis leadership of the Finance Committee, which is bipartisan whenever \nthat is possible, which is factual, which seeks evidence and answers.\n  This sense-of-the-Senate resolution recognizes the mounting evidence \nthat, contrary to the intent of the Congress and the President, Federal \ntax provisions, Social Security benefits, and other Federal program \nbenefits are being overadjusted for inflation.\n  The resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that:\n\n       * * * all cost-of-living adjustments required by statute \n     should accurately reflect the best available estimate of \n     changes in the cost of living.\n\n  In its final report issued on December 4, 1996, the Advisory \nCommission to Study the Consumer Price Index--the Boskin Commission \nconcluded that:\n\n       While the CPI is the best measure currently available it is \n     not a true cost of living index. . ..\n\n  The Boskin Commission concluded that the CPI overstates the cost of \nliving in the United States by 1.1 percentage points.\n\n[[Page S1035]]\n\n  The Commission's findings are very much in line with the prevailing \nprofessional judgment of economists as to the size of the upward bias \nin the CPI. In October 1994, in a memorandum to the President entitled \n``Big Choices'', then-OMB Director Alice Rivlin stated that the ``CPI \nmay be overstated by 0.4 percent to 1.5 percent.'' And in testimony at \na joint hearing of the Senate and House Budget Committees in January \n1995--and reinforced in testimony last week before the Senate Committee \non Finance--Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the \nFederal Reserve System, estimated the range of plausible values at 0.5 \nto 1.5 percentage points.\n  The standard objection to correcting the Consumer Price Index has \nbeen, to cite one such statement, ``The right way to adjust the CPI is \nto allow the experts at the BLS to continue doing their jobs and keep \npolitics out of it.''\n  We now have the definitive response from Alan Greenspan, Chairman of \nthe Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. In testimony last \nweek before the Finance Committee, he reported that the Federal Reserve \nBoard had made its own study of this issue and had come to roughly the \nsame conclusions as those of the Boskin Commission. He recommended a \ntwo-track procedure. First, let the BLS improve the CPI by as much as \ncan be done and as quickly as it can be done. And second, establish an \nindependent national commission to correct for the remaining upward \nbias. He then said:\n\n       There has been considerable objection that such a second \n     track procedure would be a political fix. To the contrary, \n     assuming zero for the remaining bias is the political fix. On \n     this issue, we should let evidence, not politics, drive \n     policy.\n\n  To say again, to do nothing in the face of overwhelming evidence \nwould be a political decision. Wrong-headed and shortsighted, with \nlarge long-term implications\n  And to do nothing until we have a more precise estimate of the bias--\nas if estimating changes in the cost of living is equivalent to \nmeasuring atomic weights--recalls the wise admonition of Lord John \nMaynard Keynes who said:\n\n       It is better to be approximately right than precisely \n     wrong.\n\n  There is some history here.\n  It happens that this Senator's association with the statistical \nsystem in the executive branch began over three decades ago. I was \nAssistant Secretary of Labor for Policy and Planning in the \nadministration of President John F. Kennedy. This was a new position in \nwhich I was nominally responsible for, inter alia, the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics. I say nominally out of respect for the independence of that \nvenerable institution, which as I noted earlier long predated the \nDepartment of Labor itself. The then-Commissioner of the BLS, Ewan \nClague, could not have been more friendly and supportive. And so were \nthe statisticians, who undertook to teach me to the extent I was \nteachable. They even shared professional confidences. And so it was \nthat I came to have some familiarity with the field.\n\n  Upon our arrival in Washington with the new administration in 1961, \nwe had waiting for us a report on price indexes from a committee led by \nGeorge J. Stigler, who later won a Nobel Prize in economics. The \ncommittee noted that:\n\n       If a poll were taken of professional economists and \n     statisticians, in all probability they would designate (and \n     by a wide majority) the failure of the price indexes to take \n     full account of quality changes as the most important defect \n     in these indexes. And by almost as large a majority, they \n     would believe that this failure introduces a systematic \n     upward bias in the price indexes--that quality changes have \n     on average been quality improvements.\n\n  Through indexation of Federal tax brackets, Social Security, and \nother Federal programs, Congress and the President have undertaken to \nprotect taxpayers and beneficiaries from the erosion of purchasing \npower due to inflation.\n  Based on over 35 years of mounting evidence, it is clear that the \ncurrent formulas for indexation overstate the true cost of living. Over \n12 years the upward bias increases outlays and reduces revenues, for \nprograms tied to the CPI, by a cumulative $1.07 trillion.\n  The actuaries of the Social Security system estimate that a 1.1 \npercentage point correction would eliminate about two-thirds of the \nlong-run deficit in the Social Security Program. The trust fund \nexhaustion date would be extended by more than 20 years, from 2029 to \n2052.\n  Somewhat more than one-half of the 1.1 percentage bias can be \neliminated rather quickly if the BLS would develop a cost-of-living \nindex [COLI] and factor into their calculations research on quality \nimprovements. Members of the Boskin Commission think it can be done \nwithin a year. Over time, some of the remainder of the bias could be \nreduced by further research on measuring quality improvements. Any \nresidual can be dealt with by an independent national commission, as \nsuggested by the Boskin Commission and by Federal Reserve Chairman \nGreenspan.\n  The computational procedures that would be used by BLS for a new cost \nof living index [COLI] are now used by the Bureau of Economic Analysis \n[BEA] in the calculations of GDP and its components--consumption, \ninvestment, and so on. BEA uses a Personal Consumption Expenditures \n[PCE] deflator to estimate changes in real consumption. For the 12 \nmonths ended November 1996, the CPI increased by 3.3 percent. Yet over \nroughly the same period, the PCE deflator increased by only 2.5 \npercent. BEA's use, in the PCE deflator, of more up-to-date consumption \npatterns and of adjustments for quality, lowers the reported inflation \nrate by 0.8 of a percentage point relative to the CPI. And this is \nconsistent with what you would get if BLS developed a COLI with \nadjustments for quality improvements; that is, it is close to the 1.1 \npercentage point estimate of the bias.\n  I hope we will have broad support for this resolution on both sides \nof the aisle, and that we will do the Republic some good today. Mr. \nPresident, thank you for your courtesy. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from New York for \nhis continuing leadership in this matter. I would like to underscore \ntwo things that he said.\n  One is that all we seek to do is to make the measurement of inflation \nas accurate as possible. That is just good government.\n  Second, we are anxious to have the support of our colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle and we will be sending a letter to our colleagues, \nsigned by the two of us, urging them to join us in this good government \nventure.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Good government venture.\n  Mr. ROTH. I thank very much the distinguished Senator for his able \nleadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/05/senate-section/article/S1034-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1035-S1036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      committee on armed services\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, last Thursday, I joined my \ncolleague from Arizona, the new Chairman of the Senate Commerce \nCommittee--Senator McCain, the ranking member of the full committee, \nSenator Hollings, and the ranking member of the Aviation Subcommittee, \nSenator Ford, in sponsoring the Airport and Airway Trust Fund Taxes \nShort Term Reinstatement Act. This legislation will extend the existing \nsystem of aviation excise taxes through September 29, 1997, and give \nthe Internal Revenue Service authority to transfer previously collected \naviation excise taxes into the airport and airway trust fund.\n  The airport and airway trust fund is funded by a 10-percent passenger \nticket tax; a 6.25-percent cargo waybill tax; a $6 per person \ninternational departure tax; and certain general aviation fuel taxes. \nIn 1997, this fund is expected to provide 62 percent of the Federal \nAviation Administration's [FAA] fiscal year 1997 budget. More \nspecifically, the trust fund is expected to provide $5.3 billion of the \nFAA's $8.6 billion total fiscal year 1997 budget. Of this $5.3 billion, \n$3.6 billion will provide 100 percent of the resources necessary to \nfund the FAA's capital programs, while $1.7 billion will provide 34 \npercent of the fiscal year 1997 budget for FAA operations. But this \nfund, so critical to the operation and improvements of our aviation \nsystem, is no longer being funded.\n  When the authority to collect the aviation excise taxes lapsed on \nDecember 31, 1996, officials from both the General Accounting Office \n[GAO] and the FAA predicted that the $4.35 billion in uncommitted \nbalances in the fund at that time would be available to fund the FAA's \ncapital programs through June 30, 1997. By July 1, 1997, however, they \npredicted that the trust fund would become insolvent. Accordingly, if \nCongress did not reinstate the taxes, it was predicted that the Office \nof Management and Budget [OMB] would have to reduce the FAA's capital \naccounts, which are totally funded out of the trust fund --including \nboth the facilities and equipment [F] account and Airport Improvement \nProgram, to account for the $1 billion shortfall between the trust \nfund's fiscal year 1997 expected contribution of $5.3 billion and the \nactual contribution of $4.35 billion.\n  According to the FAA, this reduction in the facilities and equipment \naccount could force the FAA to issue stop work orders on all major F \ncontracts, which include upgrades of the current air traffic control \nsystem throughout the country. The Airport Improvement Program would \nsuffer an even greater impact. Under the original projections, if the \naviation taxes were not reinstated, funding for the Airport Improvement \nProgram would have to be reduced by as much as $300 million in fiscal \nyear 1997. Existing funding agreements under the AIP would be \nmaintained, but no new, discretionary funding would be provided for \nhigh-priority safety and security projects, capacity projects, and \nimportant noise mitigation programs.\n  Quite simply, this is unacceptable. If delays in the implementation \nof safety and security initiatives, as well as construction of capacity \nenhancement projects, are caused by lack of funds, then we in Congress \nwill be responsible for weakening the safest aviation system in the \nworld.\n  From a Washington State perspective, fiscal year 1997 funding for \nnoise mitigation is particularly important. Seattle-Tacoma \nInternational Airport has been a national leader in noise mitigation \nprograms and was the first to implement a local housing insulation \nprogram to reduce the impact on houses near the airport. The current \nprogram, which is partially funded through the AIP's discretionary \nnoise mitigation grants, is scheduled to run through the year 2003.\n  Under these original projections, it was clear that reinstating the \ntaxes as quickly as possible was the appropriate action for Congress to \ntake to ensure that the U.S. aviation system continues to be the best \nsystem in the world.\n  Last Wednesday afternoon, however, this situation became more dire \nwhen the Treasury Department announced that because of an accounting \nerror, the airport and airway trust fund could be insolvent as early as \nMarch or April.\n  Let me explain the events, as I understand them, which led to \naccounting Error made at by the Treasury Department. Each airline \ndeposits the ticket taxes it collects to the IRS every 2 weeks. Under \nthe look-back provisions of the IRS safe harbor rule, however, an \nairline can base the amount of that payment on the amount of excise \ntaxes it collected in a 2-week period from the second preceding quarter \nbefore the current quarter. In other words, in making a 2-week tax \npayment in the third quarter of the year, an airline can deposit the \namount it collected in a 2-week period during the first quarter of that \nyear. If the taxes it deposits are less than what the airline actually \ntook in during the third quarter, the airline can make up that \nunderpayment when it files its quarterly return. The quarterly return \ndate is approximately 2 months after the close of the quarter.\n  The 10 percent ticket tax was in place during the fourth quarter of \n1996. The airlines' semimonthly tax payments for that quarter, however, \nwere based on the second quarter of 1996, during which time no excise \ntaxes were collected. The airlines, in essence, did not remit any \nexcise taxes during the fourth quarter of 1996, even though they were \ncollecting these taxes from passengers at that time. The airlines will \nhave to make up for these tax underpayments by the time they file their \nfourth quarter returns, which are due on February 28, 1997. These \ntaxes, however, will not be deposited into the aviation trust fund, \nsince the general-fund-to-trust-fund transfer authority expired along \nwith the aviation excise taxes on December 31, 1996.\n  It appears that the Treasury Department did not account for the \ncomplex\n\n[[Page S1037]]\n\naccounting procedures, and assumed that the trust fund would be \ncredited with $1.5 billion more than it can be unless Congress \nreinstates the authority for the IRS to transfer the fourth quarter \nexcise taxes to the trust fund. The FAA now expects to run out of money \nfor its capital programs, and possibly its operations, much sooner than \noriginally anticipated.\n  Mr. President, with Wednesday's Treasury Department announcement that \nthe trust fund could be insolvent by March, I believe it is clear that \nthe Senate's first and overriding priority must be to immediately \nreinstate the excise tax and transfer authority. While our system \ncontinues to be the safest aviation system in the world, Congress owes \nit to the American people to consider this legislation as quickly as \npossible to ensure aviation safety, security, and capital investment \nare not jeopardized in any manner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/05/senate-section/article/S1036-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1037]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO EZE BURTS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

He also helped plan security for the \nhighly successful 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles, before assuming \nthe helm of the port later that same year.\n  During Mr. Burts' tenure, the Port of Los Angeles has become one of \nthe Nation's top trade centers, generating billions of dollars in \nrevenue and creating thousands of jobs. During this period of amazing \ngrowth, the port's operating revenue has doubled and the total cargo \nvolume has increased by more than one-third. In fact, the Los Angeles \nCustoms District is the largest in the Nation, and the port has become \na major gateway for our Nation's Pacific rim trade. Mr. President, to \nput into perspective Mr. Burts' responsibility over the years, the Port \nof Los Angeles accounts for more than 1 million jobs nationwide, \nincluding 1 out of every 27 jobs in southern California.\n  Mr. Burts has also been at the forefront of the Alameda corridor \nproject, an enterprise which is very important to my State, and indeed \nto the entire country. When the Alameda corridor is completed, goods \nwill be quickly shipped from the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach to \nrail yards in downtown Los Angeles, and from there to points throughout \nthe country. Eze Burts has been a key supporter of the Alameda corridor \nsince its inception.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to announce that Mr. Burts will continue \nto be a leader in the southern California community, as he prepares to \nbecome the new president of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce. I wish \nMr. Burts and his family well as he takes on this new challenge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/05/senate-section/article/S1037-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1037-S1038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. WILLIAM J. PERRY\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and to \npay respect to Dr. William Perry for his distinguished service as the \n19th Secretary of Defense. From his confirmation by the U.S. Senate on \nMarch 5, 1993, until his retirement on January 24, 1997, Dr. Perry has \nsuccessfully faced many challenges as he has advised the President and \nthe Congress through the difficult and ever-changing post-cold war era. \nClearly, he was the right man at the right time.\n  Bill Perry brought to the Office of the Secretary of Defense a deep \nintellect, sound judgment, and a patient but effective leadership \nstyle. It is no surprise to me, and I am sure to others that know Bill \nPerry, how quickly he endeared himself to our men and women in uniform. \nHis genuine concern for our service members has been the hallmark of \nhis tenure as Secretary of Defense. Indeed, his initiatives in the area \nof quality-of-life have truly made a difference, and will serve as a \nfitting legacy of his exemplary service.\n  I have known Bill Perry for many years. I have had the opportunity to \nwork with him during his service in both the Government and the private \nsector. As he returns once again to the private sector, I look forward \nto continuing our relationship and I wish him and his family all the \nbest.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the eloquent remarks that Dr. Perry gave \nduring his farewell ceremony be printed in the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n       Farewell Address by William J. Perry, Secretary of Defense\n\n     I shall be telling this with a sigh.\n     Somewhere ages and ages hence.\n     Two roads diverged in a wood, and I--\n     I took the one less traveled by.\n     And that has made all the difference.\n                                                   --Robert Frost.\n\n       Four years ago, America faced a choice; a choice between \n     two roads that diverged. One road led to isolation and \n     apathy, the other road, to engagement and action. This \n     century has taught us that the road of isolation and apathy \n     leads to instability and war.\n       President Clinton chose the road of engagement and action. \n     He strove to bridge the Cold War chasms; to reduce its \n     nuclear legacy; to reach out to former adversaries, to \n     prevent the conditions for conflict, and to create the \n     conditions for peace. And that, as Robert Frost has said, has \n     made all the difference.\n       It has made all the difference in Europe, where, by \n     establishing the Partnership for Peace we have replaced an \n     Iron Curtain which divided the nations of Europe with a \n     circle of security which brings them together.\n       It has made all the difference in our own hemisphere, where \n     all nations, save one, have chosen democracy, and by \n     establishing the Defense Ministerial of Americas we have \n     forged new links of trust and cooperation.\n       It has made all the difference in the Asia Pacific, where \n     by establishing a Framework Agreement we froze the North \n     Korean nuclear program and prevented a nuclear arms race; and \n     where, by strengthening the Security Agreement with Japan, we \n     have ensured America's security presence--the oxygen that \n     fuels the region's prosperity.\n       Choosing the right road has made all the difference around \n     the world. By executing the Nunn-Lugar program, we have \n     dismantled 4,000 nuclear weapons that once targeted America's \n     cities. Today, the threat of nuclear holocaust no longer \n     hangs like a dark cloud over the heads of our children.\n       Four years ago, the Department of Defense faced a choice. \n     One road was well-traveled and easy to follow, but it would \n     have allowed our forces to atrophy as we completed the post-\n     Cold War draw down. The other road was less traveled by, \n     twisting and bumpy with hard choices--hard choices to ensure \n     that we had strong capable military forces ready to respond \n     in a world of new dangers.\n       Twice before in this century when faced with that same \n     choice, we chose the well-traveled road of neglect. And we \n     paid the price--in Korea with Task Force Smith, and after \n     Vietnam with a Hollow Army. This time we chose the road less-\n     traveled by--the road of readiness. We established training \n     as our highest priority. Training designed to make the \n     scrimmage tougher than the game. We established the iron \n     logic that quality of life for our forces meant quality \n     people in our forces. We reformed our acquisition system to \n     give our quality people the most effective technology. \n     Technology that enables them to dominate the battlefield; \n     to win quickly, decisively, and with minimum losses. And \n     that has made all the difference.\n       It made all the difference wherever we sent our forces to \n     prevent, deter, or defeat aggression. In Haiti, where we \n     restored democracy. In the Arabian Gulf, where we contained a \n     brutal dictator. In the Korean Peninsula, where we stood firm \n     with an ally. In Bosnia, where we have stopped the killing \n     and brought to a war-ravaged people the blessings of peace. \n     The readiness road ensured the success of each of these \n     missions. Readiness made all the difference.\n       Four years ago, I faced a personal choice between a well-\n     traveled road to a quieter life, centered around family and \n     friends; and a less-traveled road that led to turmoil, \n     tension, and tough decisions. But it also led to an \n     opportunity to serve our nation, to support the troops I \n     cared for, and to achieve the dreams I cherished.\n       I thought long and hard upon that choice and took counsel \n     from sage friends. I questioned my wisdom, my patience and my \n     ability to endure. But the courage to meet the test came from \n     the advice of a tough sergeant major: ``Take care of the \n     troops,'' he said, ``and they will take care of you.''\n       I have followed that advice, and that, for me, has made all \n     the difference.\n       It made all the difference every time I advised the \n     President on when and how to use military force. It made all \n     the difference when I negotiated with ministerial colleagues, \n     when I met with Presidents and Kings. It made all the \n     difference when I decided on force levels, mission goals and \n     rules of engagement every time we put our troops in harm's \n     way. It made all the difference when I met with soldiers, \n     sailors, airmen and marines, in distant lands, on domestic \n     bases, on training fields, ships at sea, in cargo\n\n[[Page S1038]]\n\n     planes, or fighter jets. It made all the difference when I \n     shared Thanksgiving meals with them in Haiti, in Macedonia, \n     in Bosnia.\n       That advice--``Take care of the troops, and they will take \n     care of you''--has made all the difference as I learned from \n     my mistakes, as I took pride in my achievements.\n       Today I say farewell to the President who honored me by \n     asking me to serve as Secretary. I say farewell to my \n     colleagues in the administration who worked with me to \n     achieve common goals. I say farewell to my friends in the \n     media, and in the Congress, and to the wonderful friends I \n     have made in the embassies.\n       And I say farewell to our military leaders who have served \n     our country so brilliantly. They have prepared our forces for \n     war, but they are dedicated to peace. Elie Wiesel has said, \n     ``Peace is not God's gift to mankind. It is our gift to each \n     other.'' And for the last four years peace is the gift we \n     have given the American people.\n       But the hardest farewell to say is to the troops who have \n     served me and whom I have served. Words cannot adequately \n     describe my pride in you. So my farewell to you is a simple \n     benediction:\n\n     May the Lord bless you and keep you.\n     May the Lord cause His face to shine upon you,\n     and give you peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/05/senate-section/article/S1037-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE 4TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nrecognition of the 4-year anniversary of the Family and Medical Leave \nAct. Approved by the Senate on January 29, 1993, this important \nlegislation was the first bill of the 103d Congress signed into law by \nnewly elected President Clinton.\n  Prior to the enactment of the family medical leave law, families \nalready confronting the hardships caused by a seriously ill relative \nhad an additional burden to bear: a fear of losing their jobs should \nthey choose to stay home to care for a loved one. For workers striving \nto meet the competing demands of home and office, there was no \nconsistent standard of protection.\n  The Family Medical Leave Act provides that basic standard of job \nsecurity to more than 67 million American workers; guaranteeing \nemployees up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a newborn child or \nnewly adopted child or to care for an immediate family member with a \nserious health condition. In addition, the law enables workers to take \nmedical leave when they themselves are unable to work because of a \nserious health condition--without fear of being fired or losing their \nhealth insurance.\n  After 4 years of successfully helping American families strike a \nbalance between work and family, it is difficult to believe that it was \nnecessary to struggle for many years and overcome two vetoes by \nPresident Bush in order to enact this fundamental protection for \nworking Americans. Since its enactment, this law has enabled \napproximately 12 million men and women to take time off from work to \nmeet the care-giving needs of their families.\n  While opponents of the Family Medical Leave Act raised concerns about \nthe law's effect on business, their fears have been proven ungrounded \nby the congressionally charged Bipartisan Commission on Leave. The \nCommission on Leave, made up of business and labor leaders, \nrepresentatives of women and families, and members of Congress, \nprovided an initial assessment of the family medical leave law in April \n1996. The Commission found that while the law has had a significant \nimpact on employers' leave policies and practices, increasing the \nreasons for which employees can take leave, this impact has come with \nminimal administrative activities and almost no costs. In fact, a \nnumber of employers have reported a positive impact on business \nperformance because of Family Medical Leave Act policies.\n  Mr. President, as a strong supporter and original cosponsor of this \nsignificant measure, I am especially pleased with the success of the \nfamily medical leave law. Because of this law, millions of Americans, \nwho otherwise may have been forced to choose between the demands of \nhome and workplace, have been able to meet both their personal and \nprofessional obligations. As fundamental as the Fair Labor Standards \nAct, the Social Security Act and the Occupational Safety and Health \nAct, this law reaffirms the Democratic commitment to ensuring a measure \nof job protection to all hard-working Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/05/senate-section/article/S1038-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO W. PROCTOR JONES\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nSenate institution, Proctor Jones. His hard work and exceptional \nservice have left a lasting mark on the Senate, and he will be sorely \nmissed.\n  I have known and worked with Proctor Jones since I began my service \nin the Senate. After having served with one of the giants of the \nSenate--Senator Richard Russell--Proctor Jones has gone on to become a \ngiant in his own right. His vast knowledge of appropriations has made \nhim an invaluable asset to the committee. Since he began in 1960, his \nonly time away from the Senate came in 1966, when he left Senator \nRussell's staff to serve in the Marine Corps. Apart from this brief \nhiatus, Proctor has been a part of the day-to-day operations of the \nSenate, and it will not be the same without him.\n  A native of Twin City, GA, Proctor came to work as Senator Russell's \nright-hand-man immediately after graduation from the University of \nGeorgia. As he rose through the ranks on the Hill, Proctor found time \nto further his education at the George Washington University. In \nessence, he never stopped being a student, particularly of the Senate \nand its appropriations process.\n  In 1971, when he joined the Committee on Appropriations, Proctor \nquickly became a part of the staff leadership. Under every Democratic \nchairman since 1973, he has been the staff director for the \nSubcommittee on Energy and Water Development and, under Chairmen \nMcClellan and Stennis, Proctor was deputy staff director of the full \ncommittee. Serving under some of the most distinguished chairmen of \nthis venerable committee--Senators Russell, Ellender, McClellan, \nMagnuson, Stennis, Byrd, and Hatfield--Proctor distinguished himself as \na genius of compromise and an expert on the budget.\n  While the Senate has changed and evolved during Proctor's long \ntenure, he never lost his fervor for his job. Tireless is an adjective \noften used to describe public servants, but Proctor epitomizes this \ndescription. His seemingly endless supply of energy and love for the \nSenate made him a constant presence even at the latest of the late-\nnight sessions. This veteran of the Senate has been intimately involved \nwith the annual appropriations bills, as well as handling innumerable \ncontinuing resolutions, supplemental appropriations, and rescissions \nbills, and other measures relating to the appropriations process. Those \nof us who devote time to the task of appropriation know how grueling it \ncan be. Through it all, Proctor Jones devoted himself completely, using \nhis vast expertise in the service of his country.\n  In addition to his Senate work, Proctor is an active member of his \nchurch and community. He is also the proud father of two daughters, \nHeather and Lisa. It is my pleasure to speak today in tribute to \nProctor Jones, and I wish him every happiness in his \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/05/senate-section/article/S1038-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1038-S1039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SENATE QUARTERLY MAIL COSTS\n\n Mr. WARNER.

WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the \nmemory of a fine young person from Minnesota, Amy Nicolle Johnson.\n  Amy Johnson grew up at her family's home on Lake Sarah and attended \nthe Rockford public schools from kindergarten through her senior year \nof high school. At age 17, Amy died in a car accident early one morning \non her way to the school she loved.\n  An excellent student, talented athlete, and student leader, Amy was \nextensively involved in diverse activities throughout the year. A \ntypical school year began for Amy with a class schedule that included \nband and choir in addition to the traditional academic subjects.\n  Her 6-year commitment to band was most demanding in the autumn with \nextra practices for the flag corps of the marching band and many \nevenings devoted to playing the trumpet with the pep band. She also \nplayed volley ball for 5 years, 3 of which were spent on the varsity \nteam.\n  Gymnastics marked the beginning of the winter season for her. \nCompeting on all four events for all of her 5 years and a varsity team \nmember for 4, Amy's involvement in this sport exemplified the pride, \nperseverance, and commitment that she applied to every facet of her \nlife.\n  She enjoyed singing with the choir and participated in choral duets \nand the stage--jazz--band for several years in district and State \ncompetitions. Her musical talent and enjoyment of the dramatic arts led \nAmy to participate in musicals and plays.\n  The spring brought Amy outdoors, where she played second base with \nthe varsity softball team for 4 years. Even though the school year \nwould come to an end each spring, the softball season continued into \nthe summer. From the tee ball leagues in second grade to the State \nsoftball fast pitch tournament in 1995, Amy spent many hours of her \nsummer vacation on the field.\n  The past two summers she began saving money for college working at \nLen Busch Roses and the Hennepin County Baker Park Reserve on Lake \nIndependence.\n  Throughout all of the season's activities, Amy was a leader inside \nand outside of the classroom. She was an honors student and a member of \nthe National Honor Society, as well as the secretary of her senior, \njunior, and freshman class. She was the cocaptain of the gymnastic and \nsoftball teams and was recognized in all three sports as an all-\nconference athlete. In her senior year she was chosen Homecoming Queen.\n  Most of Amy's friends and teachers will remember her shining smile \nthat simply defined her presence. It is her family's hope that this \nremarkable young woman's spirit will be perpetuated through a \nscholarship that was established in her memory.\n  Amy valued respect, compassion, honesty, integrity, and \nresponsibility. She made a sincere effort to live up to those values \ndaily and she made a positive difference in the lives of all those she \nencountered.\n  Mr. President, it is an honor for me to pay tribute to the memory of \nthis remarkable young woman, Amy Johnson, who touched the lives of so \nmany during her brief life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/05/senate-section/article/S1039-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1039-S1040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIP REPORT--THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, HONG KONG, TAIWAN, AND \n                                 NEPAL\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, from November 11 through \nNovember 26, 1996, I traveled to the People's Republic of China, \nTaiwan, Hong Kong, and Nepal for discussions with senior leaders in \neach of these places. I have today transmitted my report on this trip \nto the chairman and ranking minority member of the Committee on Foreign \nRelations. I hope my colleagues find it of interest.\n  I ask that the report be printed in the Record.\n  The report follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 5, 1997.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,\n     Chairman.\n     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Helms and Senator Biden:\n       Attached please find a report on my travel to China, Hong \n     Kong, Taiwan, and Nepal from November 11 through 26, 1996. \n     During the China portion of the trip and parts of the Hong \n     Kong and Taiwan portions, I joined Senators Daschle, Dorgan, \n     Glenn, Kempthorne, and Leahy. Travel costs were at my \n     personal expense.\n       In China, I discussed with the Chinese leadership the need \n     to develop a long-term strategic framework for our \n     relationship based on our many mutual interests, tensions in \n     the triangular U.S.-China-Taiwan relationship, a variety of \n     U.S.-China trade issues, nonproliferation and other security \n     concerns, and human rights and legal development in China.\n       In Hong Kong, the itinerary included meetings with British, \n     Chinese, and Hong Kong officials and members of the business \n     community to assess the prospects for Hong Kong's reversion \n     to Chinese rule in July 1997.\n       In meetings with the Taiwanese leadership in Taipei, I \n     discussed Taiwan's role in the U.S.-China relationship and \n     how to get dialogue across the Taiwan Strait back on track.\n       In Nepal, I examined the progress made by this fledgling \n     democracy in consolidating its democratic institutions, and \n     looked at ways the United States can be most effective in \n     helping promote Nepal's economic development. I met with His \n     Majesty King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah, Prime Minister Sher \n     Bahadur Deuba, and Foreign Minister Prakash Chandra Lohani, \n     as well as members of the various parties in the parliament.\n       I am grateful to Ambassador James Sasser and his staff in \n     Beijing, Consul General Richard Boucher and his staff in Hong \n     Kong, American Institute in Taiwan Director Darryl Johnson \n     and his staff in Taipei, and Ambassador Sandy Vogelgesang and \n     her staff in Kathmandu. Their cooperation and assistance \n     helped make this trip as productive as it was. I would \n     particularly like to thank Foreign Service Officers Darcy \n     Zotter, Robert Forden, Michael Meserve, Gina Sullivan, Paul \n     Daley, and Peter Bodde, and AIT staffer Andrew Wilson, for \n     their assistance. I am also grateful to the staff of the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations for their help.\n\n[[Page S1040]]\n\n       I hope you find this report useful.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Dianne Feinstein,\n     United States Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/05/senate-section/article/S1039-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1040-S1044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSenator Dianne Feinstein: Trip Report--the People's Republic of China, \n           Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Nepal, November 11-26, 1996\n\n       Following my visit to China in August 1995, I was \n     encouraged by Ambassador Liu Shuqing, President of the \n     Chinese People's Institute for Foreign Affairs, to organize \n     additional delegations of Senators to travel to China to meet \n     with senior leaders and discuss a range of issues affecting \n     the U.S.-China relationship. The first of these delegations, \n     consisting of Senator Sam Nunn, Senator John Glenn, and \n     myself traveled to China in January 1996.\n       From November 11-17, 1996, I joined Senator Tom Daschle's \n     delegation traveling to Beijing, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. I \n     subsequently returned to Hong Kong for additional meetings \n     from November 17-20, and then traveled to Nepal from November \n     20-26. My husband, Mr. Richard C. Blum, and I traveled at \n     personal expense. We were accompanied throughout by a member \n     of my staff, Mr. Daniel Shapiro, whose expenses were \n     underwritten by the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n                                 CHINA\n\n       The issues we discussed with the Chinese leadership \n     included:\n       The prospects for a more stable and productive U.S-China \n     relationship in the wake of Secretary of State Christopher's \n     visit to China and the meeting between Presidents Clinton and \n     Jiang in Manila;\n       The prospects for reduced tensions between Taiwan and \n     China, and the role of Taiwan in the U.S.-China relationship;\n       The July 1997 reversion of Hong Kong to Chinese \n     sovereignty, and the U.S. interests at stake in a stable \n     transition for Hong Kong;\n       The lack of progress in resolving a number of outstanding \n     trade disputes between the United States and China;\n       The human rights situation in China, with emphasis on Tibet \n     and the status of leading dissidents who have been detained \n     or imprisoned;\n       Regional security issues, including North Korea and South \n     Asia, and the prospects for enhanced military-to-military \n     dialogue and cooperation between the United States and China; \n     and\n       The recent progress made on U.S. nonproliferation concerns, \n     and the need for continued progress in this area.\n       On the evening of Thursday, November 14, I met with \n     President Jiang Zemin privately at the Great Hall of the \n     People. We were then joined by Senators Tom Daschle, Byron \n     Dorgan, John Glenn, Dirk Kempthorne, and Patrick Leahy for a \n     one hour meeting, followed by a two and a half hour dinner, \n     also in the Great Hall of the People.\n       During the rest of our visit, we conducted meetings and \n     working meals with:\n       Vice Chairman of the Central Military Committee and \n     Minister of National Defense Chi Haotian;\n       Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Li Zhaoxing; and\n       President of the Chinese People's Institute of Foreign \n     Affairs Liu Shuqing.\n       Because I arrived before the Daschle delegation and \n     remained in Beijing after their departure, I conducted \n     separate meetings with:\n       Director of the Office of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs of \n     the State Council Lu Ping;\n       Executive Director of the Association of Relations Across \n     the Taiwan Straits Tang Shubei; and\n       Executive Vice Premier Zhu Rongji.\n       In addition to the above meetings, we received briefings \n     from the staff of the United States Embassy in Beijing, \n     including Ambassador James Sasser. We also conducted meetings \n     with representatives of American companies doing business in \n     China to learn about the current climate for U.S. firms in \n     China and how it is affected by developments in the political \n     and trade relationship between the United States and China.\n     Overview of the U.S.-China Relationship\n       Our discussions with Chinese leaders indicated a fair \n     degree of optimism about prospects for an improved \n     environment in the U.S.-China relationship in 1997, tempered \n     by caution with respect to a number of issues of concern to \n     China. The Chinese seem to view the reelection of President \n     Clinton as an opportunity for the U.S.-China relationship to \n     progress without being hampered by the vagaries of American \n     politics to the degree it was in 1996. In November, they were \n     optimistic about Secretary's Christopher's upcoming visit and \n     the Jiang-Clinton meeting in Manila. They are also encouraged \n     by the planned visit of Vice President Gore in early 1997 and \n     the subsequent exchange of Presidential visits. The Chinese \n     see these developments as important steps toward establishing \n     the consistent high-level dialogue that the U.S.-China \n     relationship needs to make progress on issues of common \n     interest and areas of disagreement. In the words of President \n     Jiang, ``the sky is clearer now.''\n       At the same time, there are several reasons to believe that \n     progress in the relationship in 1997 will be incremental, \n     rather than dramatic. First, the 15th Communist Party \n     Congress, when Chinese leadership positions will be decided \n     for the next five years is scheduled for September 1997. In \n     the run-up to this Congress, many Chinese leaders will feel \n     pressure to display their nationalist credentials, and this \n     may take the form of challenging the United States, or at \n     least demonstrating minimum flexibility, on any number of \n     issues. Second, the transition of Hong Kong, which takes \n     place on July 1, 1997, will be watched closely by the United \n     States and the world. If it leads to confrontations between \n     the Chinese authorities and Hong Kong democracy activists, or \n     if U.S. interests are put at risk, it could be the source of \n     considerable tension in U.S.-China relations. Finally, a \n     significant number of bilateral issues can continue to plague \n     efforts to normalize U.S.-China relations, including trade \n     disputes, nonproliferation concerns, human rights, and, most \n     importantly, Taiwan.\n     Taiwan\n       Taiwan remains the issue with the greatest potential to \n     seriously disrupt and inflame efforts to stabilize the U.S.-\n     China relationship. The Chinese blame Lee Teng-hui for the \n     absence of cross-strait dialogue. They believe he is actively \n     casting doubt on the one-China policy, and doing so because \n     he believes he has U.S. and Japanese support. They insist \n     that for an atmosphere conducive to dialogue to resume, Lee \n     must take concrete actions: recognize the indivisibility of \n     China's territory and sovereignty; and stop seeking to expand \n     Taiwan's diplomatic presence, especially with countries who \n     have relations with China and at the United Nations. They do \n     not insist that Taiwan recognize the sovereignty of the PRC \n     government.\n       China is eager to develop the so-called ``three links'' \n     with Taiwan: direct air travel, shipping, and postal service. \n     They believe Taiwan's reluctance to open them on China's \n     terms (such as not flying a Taiwanese flag in Chinese ports) \n     is a sign that Lee Teng-hui is trying to widen the divisions \n     between the mainland and Taiwan. They also cite Lee's recent \n     efforts to discourage and restrict Taiwanese investment in \n     China. On the other hand, Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese \n     rule may begin to initiate the three links, as Taiwan will \n     continue to interact with Hong Kong much as it has in the \n     past. There is some sense that if the Hong Kong transition \n     goes smoothly, it could ease the way for eventual \n     reunification between Taiwan and China on the ``one country, \n     two systems'' model.\n       It is impossible to overstate the depth of Chinese feelings \n     on Taiwan's role in the U.S.-China relationship. President \n     Jiang told me clearly and directly, that the main thing he \n     needs in order to pursue improved U.S.-China relations is for \n     the Taiwan issue to remain quiet. If it is handled well, \n     everything is possible. If it is not handled well, it could \n     cause a shock to U.S.-China relations. Tang Shubei, Executive \n     Director of the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan \n     Straits, specifically mentioned two potential pitfalls: if \n     Lee Teng-hui is granted a transit visa to the United States \n     on his way to Panama in September, and uses the Panama Canal \n     hand-over ceremony to meet with President Clinton; and if \n     U.S. arms sales to Taiwan are not seen to be declining over \n     time, and avoiding offensive weapons systems, such as landing \n     craft. During my lengthy discussion with Tang Shubei, he gave \n     a comprehensive and precise presentation of China's views on \n     Taiwan, expressing a resolute firmness that I had not seen \n     before.\n     Trade Issues\n       Perhaps in a manifestation of pre-Party Congress stiffening \n     of views, the Chinese seemed particularly stubborn on a \n     number of the trade issues affecting U.S.-China relations. I \n     had a long discussion with Executive Vice Premier on the \n     subject of TCK wheat. China refuses to import virtually any \n     U.S. wheat at the moment, on the grounds that all U.S. wheat \n     is potentially infected with TCK by the rail cars used to \n     transport wheat around the United States. While the Chinese \n     view on TCK is, according to U.S. specialists, not backed up \n     by sound science, they maintain that China will not resume \n     U.S. wheat imports unless Chinese inspectors are allowed to \n     examine the wheat when it is loaded onto ships. This wheat \n     dispute is responsible for a significant decline in U.S. \n     agricultural exports to China.\n       China's position on its application to join the WTO has \n     changed little in recent months. Beijing continues to believe \n     that it should be admitted to the WTO as a developing \n     country, and that it should try to make the necessary changes \n     to its economy over time. There has been little or no \n     response to the ``road-map'' provided by USTR to the Chinese \n     in early 1996.\n       It seems clear to me that if there is not progress on these \n     trade issues, and on the expanding U.S.-China trade \n     imbalance, trade will become a major political problem in the \n     relationship, and could lead us down the road toward a \n     serious confrontation. While the Chinese seem to recognize \n     this potential, they continue to insist that they can do \n     nothing about the trade imbalance because it is caused \n     primarily by foreign-owned ventures that export out of China, \n     and by goods exported via Hong Kong. They say that neither \n     category should be counted against Chinese export totals, \n     resulting in a huge disparity between the trade figures cited \n     by the two sides (the U.S. figure: $35 billion imbalance; \n     China's figure: $8.6 billion).\n       Most importantly, the one area of flexibility I saw was in \n     Zhu Rongji's willingness to set up a joint working group \n     between U.S. and Chinese trade specialists, to come up with a \n     common method of calculating the trade balance, especially \n     after Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty. This working\n\n[[Page S1041]]\n\n     group could offer a course of action that would be positive \n     and move both sides toward a resolution of this impasse.\n     Hong Kong\n       China seems to genuinely want to see a smooth transition \n     take place in Hong Kong, and they repeatedly voice their \n     commitment to allowing the ``one country, two systems'' \n     approach to take hold. They stress their intention to let the \n     government of Hong Kong be the final arbiter of Hong Kong \n     affairs. This standard, freely volunteered by Beijing, seems \n     to be the appropriate way to judge how the transition goes.\n       The decision to appoint a provisional Legco and the method \n     of appointment of the first chief executive have led to some \n     concern over China's true intentions. Again, the measure by \n     which to judge these events is the degree to which China \n     allows the Hong Kong government to make decisions on such \n     issues as allowing a commemoration of the June 4 incidents in \n     Tiananmen Square, press freedoms, and so on. In addition, it \n     will be important to observe whether China keeps its \n     commitment to move the selection of future Hong Kong \n     governments in the direction of universal elections over the \n     next ten years.\n       In my meeting with Lu Ping, Director of the Office of Hong \n     Kong and Macao Affairs for the State Council, who is \n     overseeing the transition, I asked specifically if China \n     would allow peaceful dissent, such as commemorations of the \n     June 4 incidents, after July 1, 1997. Mr. Lu, who was made \n     aware of the questions I would be asking prior to the \n     meeting, was unequivocal in his response: such protests would \n     certainly be permitted as long as they are consistent with \n     Hong Kong law. The test will be whether China tries to \n     imposes changes on Hong Kong law that would limit freedoms.\n       U.S. interests in Hong Kong, such as continued ship visits \n     and the operation of the U.S. Consulate General do appear to \n     be on the Chinese radar screen and resolvable through \n     negotiations. (Later Chinese Ambassador to the United State \n     Li Daoyu reported to me that military ship visits for R \n     will be permitted to continue.)\n     Military and Security Issues\n       Interestingly, the greatest degree of cooperation appeared \n     to be in the areas of the relationship relating to military \n     cooperation and security issues. For example, while the \n     Chinese are critical of U.S. arms sales to Taiwan as a \n     proliferation matter, they do seem receptive to further \n     dialogue about nuclear proliferation. In recent months, China \n     has committed not to provide equipment to unsafeguarded \n     nuclear facilities, and it has decided against selling \n     nuclear reactors to Iran. Currently, China is considering the \n     sale of a uranium enrichment facility to Iran, but the \n     prospect of implementing the 1985 U.S.-China peaceful nuclear \n     energy agreement is a strong incentive for them to cancel \n     the Iran sale.\n       On North Korea, the Chinese believe Kim Jong-Il is in \n     charge and that the food shortages are not as severe as have \n     been stated in the West. China believes the United States' \n     efforts to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula are useful, and \n     they sound like they are willing to be supportive of the \n     advancement of this process. On South Asia, there appears to \n     be a slowly growing recognition that China's own security \n     interests are at stake in preserving stability between India \n     and Pakistan, and reducing the likelihood of a nuclear \n     confrontation.\n       The one area of major concern to China is the revised U.S. \n     security agreement with Japan. Defense Minister Chi Haotian \n     and Vice Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing both raised this issue, \n     citing the history of Japanese aggression against China as \n     the source of China's nervousness. They seemed to accept our \n     assurances that the U.S. presence in Japan and throughout \n     Asia is intended to reduce tensions, ensure stability, and \n     make unlikely the military adventurism that China seems to \n     fear from Japan. Their basic trust was evident in the Defense \n     Minister's expressed desire to broaden and deepen military \n     exchanges and dialogue--including ship visits--between the \n     United States and China. Nevertheless, they are suspicious of \n     Japanese intentions. In my view, this could become an area \n     for serious concern if not handled carefully.\n\n\n                              Human Rights\n\n       Our discussions on human rights did not bear a great deal \n     of fruit. China continues to see U.S. criticism of its human \n     rights record, and particularly the six-year-old effort to \n     pass a resolution condemning China at the U.N. Human Rights \n     Convention, as interference in its internal affairs. We \n     raised the case of Nawang Choepel, a Tibetan who was arrested \n     for recording Tibetan music under a Fulbright scholarship. \n     However, we got little response, and subsequent to our visit, \n     he was sentenced to 18 years in prison for spying, with the \n     goal of splitting Tibet from China. His case is one of a \n     number of indicators that China has significantly racheted up \n     the pressure in Tibet, and that human rights abuses there \n     have increased.\n       And yet, progress toward implementation of the rule of law \n     continues, slowly but surely, including the preparation of a \n     number of new laws limiting police powers and restricting the \n     use of administrative detention. More progress like this \n     remains the best long-term hope for significant improvement \n     of the human rights situation in China.\n       During my meeting with President Jiang, I proposed to him a \n     joint working group on human rights, whose members would be \n     appointed by the two Presidents. The group would conduct \n     research and fact-finding in order to chart the evolution of \n     human rights in both China and the United States in the last \n     20 to 30 years. The group would also make recommendations on \n     areas still in need of improvement, presenting their findings \n     in reports to both Presidents. President Jiang said he would \n     consider this proposal, which I believe could help break the \n     deadlock we currently have with the Chinese over human rights \n     and provide a methodology for discussion.\n\n\n                                 TAIWAN\n\n       The issues we discussed with Taiwanese leaders included: \n     the prospects for a resumption of the Cross-Straits Dialogue \n     with China; the U.S.-China relationship and its implications \n     for Taiwan, including Taiwan's security; Taiwan's efforts to \n     expand its international role, or its ``pragmatic \n     diplomacy''; Taiwan's democratic progress; and lobbying \n     efforts in Washington on behalf of Taiwan.\n       I joined with Senators Daschle, Dorgan, Glenn, and Leahy \n     for meetings with:\n       President Lee Teng-hui; Vice President/Premier Lien Chan; \n     and Foreign Minister John Chang, who also hosted the \n     delegation for dinner.\n       Separately from Senator Daschle's delegation, I had several \n     additional meetings, including: a visit with Dr. Koo Chen-fu, \n     Chairman of the Straits Exchange Foundation, in his home; a \n     private meeting with Foreign Minister John Chang; a \n     breakfast with Chang King-yuh, Chairman of the Mainland \n     Affairs Council, and Dr. Koo Chen-fu; a meeting with \n     Chiling Tong, Director of the California Office of Trade \n     and Investment; and a luncheon hosted by the American \n     Chamber of Commerce in Taipei.\n\n\n                       The Cross-Straits Dialogue\n\n       Taiwanese leaders feel that, with respect to prospects for \n     restarting the Cross-Straits Dialogue, the ball is in China's \n     court. They accuse China's leaders of claiming to place no \n     conditions on resumption of a dialogue, while in fact \n     demanding an important concession in advance: Taiwan's \n     agreement to China's interpretation of the One China policy. \n     The PRC's demand that Taiwan acknowledge that the sovereignty \n     and territory of China are indivisible is interpreted by the \n     Taiwanese leaders as denying the existence of the Republic of \n     China on Taiwan.\n       According to Foreign Minister John Chang, the Taiwanese \n     leadership would rather acknowledge the existence of One \n     China, but say that it is currently divided, and that it has \n     two governments--the People's Republic of China government in \n     Beijing, and the Republic of China government in Taipei. \n     Foreign Minister Chang says that Beijing's version of the One \n     China policy would require Taiwan to accept the communist \n     system of government, which the people of Taiwan would never \n     accept. He said that such a move would actually increase pro-\n     independence sentiment in Taiwan, which his government says \n     it opposes.\n       But it is sometimes difficult to distinguish Minister \n     Chang's description of Taiwan's version of the One China \n     policy from a Two Chinas policy, which he says his government \n     rejects. He speaks of two co-equal Chinese governments, the \n     PRC and the ROC, each with its own sovereignty and conducting \n     its own international affairs. Reunification is mentioned as \n     a lofty, but currently unrealistic goal, and one that can \n     never happen without the collapse of the PRC government in \n     Beijing. In our meeting with President Lee, he suggested that \n     One China is not the current reality, but rather a future \n     goal. It is certainly possible that such a policy causes \n     confusion in Beijing about Taiwan's true intentions.\n       The Taiwanese leadership blames the PRC for its breaking \n     off the Cross-Straits Dialogue following the promising talks \n     between Koo Chen-fu of Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation \n     and Wang Daohan of China's Association for Relations Across \n     the Taiwan Straits in May 1995. In so doing, Taiwanese \n     leaders draw no explicit connection between Lee Teng-hui's \n     visit to Cornell University and the Chinese decision. \n     Nevertheless, the Taiwanese leadership does seem to have \n     internalized the need to proceed cautiously and avoid \n     provocative actions to which the Chinese leadership will feel \n     forced to respond. President Lee maintains that he is eager \n     to meet with President Jiang Zemin, but expects that any \n     movement will be impossible before the 15th Communist Party \n     Congress takes place in the fall of 1997.\n       At the same time, there are signs that President Lee is \n     encouraging a loosening of ties with the mainland. Taiwanese \n     interests have $30 billion worth of foreign investment in \n     China, and two-way trade across the strait stands at $20 \n     billion annually. In recent months, President Lee has \n     admonished the business community ``not to put all its eggs \n     in one basket'' and to diversify its markets for exports and \n     investment. There is even talk of more formal restrictions on \n     large investment projects in China. It is not clear whether \n     this trend is a sign of a weakening of Lee Teng-hui's \n     commitment to reunification, or an indication that he feels \n     that the deepening of economic ties across the strait will \n     decrease Taiwan's bargaining power over political issues. \n     Either way, it is a source of concern to the business \n     community and reunification advocates on both sides of the \n     strait.\n       A similar question could be posed about Lee's reticence to \n     agree to the three direct\n\n[[Page S1042]]\n\n     links (air, shipping, and postal) that China is eager to \n     establish. The shipping link is ostensibly stalled over which \n     flag the ships will fly in which ports. But these questions \n     will essentially become moot after the transition of Hong \n     Kong to Chinese rule. At that point, Taiwanese ships sailing \n     to Hong Kong will be conducting a direct link with China. \n     There is some debate on this point within the Taiwanese \n     leadership--Minister Chang denied that direct links would be \n     established via Hong Kong, which Dr. Koo suggested that Hong \n     Kong's transition could provide an opening to formalize such \n     links. Whatever reluctance the Taiwanese leadership may have \n     about establishing such links, there seems little doubt that \n     they will need to do so eventually. Taiwan's business \n     community strongly favors the links. But beyond that, \n     considering China's increasingly important role in Asia's \n     economy, the Taiwanese leadership's stated desire to develop \n     Taiwan into an Asian-Pacific Regional Operations Center for \n     business, finance, media, entertainment, and other sectors \n     seems hopelessly unrealistic unless companies that base \n     themselves in Taiwan can interact directly with China.\n       I was particularly impressed by my discussions with Dr. Koo \n     Chen-fu. He appears to have a keen understanding of the \n     constraints under which the Chinese leadership is operating, \n     and is apparently thinking creatively about ways to break the \n     impasse. In contrast to some of his colleagues, who seem \n     content to restate Taiwan's position and explain why China is \n     to blame for the talks not restarting, Dr. Koo takes a \n     nuanced approach to the problem and is probing for solutions. \n     Taiwan would benefit from his ability to influence their \n     internal policy debates.\n\n\n                           Taiwan's Security\n\n       The Taiwanese leaders we met all expressed their extreme \n     gratitude for the U.S. decision to deploy two aircraft \n     carriers near the Taiwan Strait during the March 1996 Chinese \n     missile tests and military exercises in the Strait. They also \n     expressed appreciation for U.S. arms sales to Taiwan which, \n     according to the Taiwan Relations Act, are supposed to ensure \n     Taiwan's ability to defend itself. The United States, they \n     said, has lived up to its commitments in the Taiwan Relations \n     Act.\n       Premier Lien Chan and Foreign Minister John Chang, however, \n     emphasized that China's purchase of Russian Su-27s and the \n     presence of Russian military advisers in China underlined the \n     need for Taiwan to begin to take delivery of the 150 F-16s \n     from the United States in 1997. Taiwan has also purchased 70 \n     Mirages from France. These two purchases, they feel, will \n     combine to bolster Taiwan's air defense capabilities.\n       In addition, Taiwanese leaders clearly understand the \n     impact of diplomatic events on their security. Therefore, Lee \n     Teng-hui himself said plainly that he is very supportive of a \n     healthy U.S.-China relationship, including regular dialogue \n     at the highest levels. While Foreign Minister Chang said that \n     he would not want the U.S.-China relationship to improve at \n     the expense of Taiwan, there is clear recognition among \n     Taiwanese leaders that there security is enhanced, rather \n     than threatened by improved relations between the United \n     States and China.\n\n\n                     Taiwan's International Efforts\n\n       Although fully aware of Beijing's objections, Taiwanese \n     leaders plan to continue their efforts to forge international \n     ties through what they call ``pragmatic diplomacy.'' In an \n     effort to expand Taiwan's ``breathing space,'' Lee Teng-hui \n     will continue to conduct what he considers to be private \n     visits abroad, and Taiwan will seek to maintain its \n     diplomatic ties with those countries who recognize it and to \n     gain entry into the United Nations. Taiwan is also placing a \n     high priority on its application to the World Trade \n     Organization, which it wants considered on its own merits, \n     with no connection to China's application. Both of these \n     pursuits could present serious problems should the United \n     States once again become entangled.\n       In light of South Africa's decision to sever its ties with \n     Taiwan and establish diplomatic relations with Beijing, \n     Taiwanese officials are increasingly concerned that they may \n     be slipping in their competition with Beijing for \n     international recognition. Besides believing that Taiwan, as \n     the world's 14th largest trading nation, is entitled to the \n     aspects of a sovereign nation (such as diplomatic relations), \n     they believe that surrendering this position would only \n     increase sentiment for independence in Taiwan. Lee's ruling \n     Kuomintang Party estimates that the pro-independence \n     Democratic People's Party would win the next elections if \n     Taiwanese voters perceived their government to be abandoning \n     its sovereignty.\n       Lee and his advisers say they understand Beijing's \n     sensitivities on this issue, but they claim to be surprised \n     by China's reaction to Lee's visit to the United States. He \n     does not see Taiwan's international efforts as posing any \n     threat to China's view of the One China policy. Nevertheless, \n     for the past year and a half, Lee has somewhat moderated his \n     own personal role in Taiwan's international efforts. Whether \n     he continues to eschew an overt challenge to China's concerns \n     will help determine whether or not there is a repeat of the \n     cross-straits crisis of 1995-96.\n\n\n                               Democracy\n\n       Taiwan's leaders are justifiably proud of the progress of \n     Taiwanese democracy in the March 1996 elections. Lee \n     pointedly rejects the concept of ``Asian values'' championed \n     by Singapore's Lee Kwan Yew and others, which suggests that \n     Asian societies are not conducive to democracy. Lee Teng-hui \n     and his colleagues say they have learned from this experience \n     to be responsive to the electorate, and hence, they feel \n     justified in their international efforts. But they also \n     recognize the need to maintain stability: Lee estimates that \n     Taiwan needs 30 years of stability to consolidate its \n     democratic institutions. This realization could inject a note \n     of caution into their relationship with China.\n\n\n                            Lobbying Efforts\n\n       During our discussion with Premier Lien Chan, he made an \n     unsolicited assertion that the Taiwanese government does not \n     spend any money on lobbying efforts in Washington. He said \n     that some individuals and groups--and when prodded, agreed \n     that such groups could include the ruling KMT Party--might \n     lobby in Washington for causes that coincide with the \n     policies of the Taiwanese government, such as Taiwan's \n     efforts to gain entry into the United Nations. He asserted in \n     no uncertain terms that any firm or individual that claims to \n     be lobbying on behalf of the government of Taiwan is \n     misrepresenting itself. However, he did concede that in the \n     final analysis, the positions adopted by lobbying \n     organizations (and whether or not they coincide with \n     Taiwanese policies) are more important than the actual source \n     of funding of that lobbying activity.\n\n\n                               HONG KONG\n\n       The issues we discussed with Hong Kong leaders included the \n     appointment of a new Chief Executive; the induction of a \n     Provisional Legislative Council; the prospects for the \n     maintenance of Hong Kong's freedoms and civil liberties after \n     the transition to Chinese rule; Hong Kong's economic outlook \n     after the transition; and what role the United States should \n     play as the transition moves forward.\n       On the evening of Friday, November 15, I joined Senator \n     Daschle's delegation for a dinner hosted by U.S. Consul \n     General Richard Boucher at his home. In attendance were a \n     cross-section of members of the Hong Kong community, \n     representing a variety of political and other views, \n     including Democratic Party leader Martin Lee and Preparatory \n     Committee Member Nellie Fong. During the rest of our stay, I \n     conducted meetings and working meals with Chief Executive-\n     Designate Tung Chee-hwa (C.H. Tung); Members of the American \n     Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong (with Senator Daschle's \n     delegation); Governor Chris Patten (with Senator Daschle's \n     delegation); Members of the Better Hong Kong Foundation, \n     including Henry Cheng, Edgar Cheng, and Leonie Kie; U.S. \n     Consul General Richard Boucher; William Overholt, Managing \n     Director of Banker's Trust and a leading Hong Kong watcher \n     and author; Nellie Fong, Member of the Preparatory Committee \n     and Executive Director of the Better Hong Kong Foundation.\n       I also attended the opening dinner of the World Economic \n     Forum 1996 Europe/Asia Economic Summit, at which Chief \n     Secretary Anson Chan was the keynote speaker. On Tuesday, \n     November 19, I participated in a panel discussion on Hong \n     Kong's future at a session of the World Economic Summit, at \n     which C.H. Tung was the main speaker and I responded to his \n     remarks.\n\n\n                    Selection of the Chief Executive\n\n       We arrived in Hong Kong the day that C.H. Tung won a \n     majority of votes from the Preparatory Committee in the first \n     round of voting for Chief Executive, catapulting him to \n     victory in the final round of voting three weeks later. The \n     general assessment of Mr. Tung is positive: he is considered \n     to be intelligent, fair-minded, and concerned about the best \n     interests of Hong Kong. Gov. Chris Patten, is highly \n     complimentary of Mr. Tung's abilities. But there is obvious \n     concern in some quarters --voiced by Gov. Patten, Martin Lee, \n     and others--about the degree of independence from Beijing he \n     will be able to demonstrate in his governance.\n       In his public statements, Mr. Tung has been attentive to \n     the concerns expressed by various members of the Hong Kong \n     community. He explains that he intends to consult widely and \n     deeply among Hong Kong's citizenry, and that he intends to be \n     protective of Hong Kong's interests when dealing with \n     Beijing. At the same time, he makes clear that Hong Kong's \n     relationship with China is about to become much closer, and \n     that this change is not something to dread; indeed, it can \n     bring significant mutual benefit.\n       My own view of Mr. Tung, whom I know reasonably well, is \n     that he is unquestionably qualified for the post of Chief \n     Executive, having shown impressive administrative skills as a \n     shipping magnate, and having been a leading promoter of Hong \n     Kong. I am hopeful that he will display the right instincts \n     about how to maintain a significant degree of autonomy for \n     Hong Kong while managing what will inevitably be a closer \n     relationship with Beijing. His challenge will be to reassure \n     the people of Hong Kong that he can and will stand up for \n     Hong Kong's interests when challenged, and do so in such a \n     way that the Beijing authorities will respect. His excellent \n     reputation in both Hong Kong and Beijing is a crucial asset \n     as he sets out to achieve this challenging balancing act.\n     The Provisional Legco\n       Beijing's decision to follow through on its decision to \n     establish a provisional legislature (Legco) and abolish the \n     existing Legco on July 1, 1997 is unfortunate. While the \n     Provisional Legco grows out of China's (accurate) sense that \n     the British changed the rules in Hong Kong after the signing \n     of the\n\n[[Page S1043]]\n\n     1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration, its ultimate impact will \n     be difficult to judge until we know what comes after it.\n       Some hold out hope that China may reverse itself and decide \n     not to disband the elected Legco after all, but as the \n     Chinese say, ``the rice is cooked'' on that decision. Indeed, \n     the Provisional Legco has already begun meeting. However, \n     Beijing, and its supporters in Hong Kong, insist that the \n     Provisional Legco will be replaced by a popularly elected \n     Legco within one year of the handover.\n       If the Provisional Legco is replaced within a year by a \n     genuinely elected body, and if it restrains itself during its \n     tenure from dismantling many of the basic freedoms enjoyed in \n     Hong Kong, the current battle over the Provisional Legco will \n     in retrospect look excessive. But if the Provisional Legco \n     enacts far-reaching changes in Hong Kong law, or if its \n     tenure is arbitrarily extended, or if the elections for its \n     successor are rigged to produce a pro-Beijing result, the \n     Provisional Legco will have proved to be a harbinger of a \n     serious deterioration of the autonomy of Hong Kong. Above \n     all, neither the Provisional Legco nor its successors can be \n     allowed to be forced to take orders from Beijing.\n       The appointment of the Provisional Legco poses a \n     significant risk of confrontation during the days surrounding \n     the transition. Martin Lee and other legislators from the \n     Democratic Party and its allies have raised the possibility \n     of refusing to vacate the Legco building on July 1. If they \n     were removed by force, or a conflict erupted, it would cast a \n     pall over the entire transition and set an ominous tone for \n     what would follow. It is imperative that the Democratic Party \n     and the authorities in Beijing engage in a dialogue now to \n     find areas where they can agree to work together amid their \n     broader disagreements, and to avoid a confrontation after \n     July 1.\n     Overall Freedoms\n       The mood in Hong Kong is mixed. Few people that we talked \n     to predicted a disaster after July 1, but among some \n     observers, there was undeniable anxiety about certain aspects \n     of the transition.\n       Among members of the Preparatory Committee, like Nellie \n     Fong, there is considerable optimism. She argues that China \n     will find it very much in its own interests to avoid imposing \n     a harsh new order on Hong Kong. She predicts that after a few \n     fairly minor adjustments, Hong Kong will emerge from the \n     transition with its autonomy very much intact.\n       Others are less sure. Governor Patten described the anxiety \n     of many at China's threatened revisions of the Hong Kong Bill \n     of Rights; at China's unwillingness to apply international \n     covenants on human rights to Hong Kong; and at the statements \n     of Foreign Minister Qian Qichen that commemorations of the \n     Tiananmen Square tragedy will not be allowed. At a time when \n     virtually all leading dissidents in China are in prison, \n     these indications have caused considerable nervousness in \n     Hong Kong.\n     Economic Outlook\n       Notwithstanding the mixed views about Hong Kong's political \n     future, there is significantly more unanimity about its \n     economic future. With few exceptions, our interlocutors \n     expect Hong Kong's flourishing economy to continue its solid \n     performance after the transition.\n       As Governor Patten points out, Hong Kong continues to post \n     solid economic growth figures of 6-8 percent year after year, \n     while unemployment is at 2.5 percent and inflation is under 5 \n     percent. There have been no tidal waves of emigration, and \n     none are expected. Since 1992, the Hang Seng index has more \n     than tripled in value.\n       Surveys conducted by the American Chamber of Commerce and \n     others consistently show that business confidence remains \n     well in excess of 90 percent. A negligible number of \n     businesses have left Hong Kong, while new ones arrive \n     every month. For many, the knowledge that Hong Kong will \n     remain after the transition the gateway to the vast \n     Chinese market that it has always been is all the \n     encouragement they need. But there is also a fairly \n     relaxed attitude about the approach to business that China \n     will take. While there are concerns about attempts by the \n     Chinese authorities to restrict the free flow of economic \n     information or stifle the press, for the short term at \n     least, Hong Kong's economic prospects appear very \n     positive.\n     The U.S. Role\n       The United States has clear interests in the continuation \n     of Hong Kong's prosperity and autonomy. We need to regularly \n     make clear to the Chinese authorities that we would oppose \n     any attempt to significantly roll back the freedoms enjoyed \n     by the people of Hong Kong, whether through the repeal of the \n     Bill of Rights, or a crackdown on free expression in the \n     press. We should express these views forcefully but \n     carefully. A combination of public statements and private \n     communications with both Chinese and Hong Kong officials is \n     most likely to be effective. At all times, we should \n     highlight China's own commitments to allow Hong Kong to \n     govern itself with a ``high degree of autonomy'' and use that \n     as the standard by which to judge Chinese actions.\n       Besides our commitment to Hong Kong's autonomy, we must \n     also be vigilant about protecting our economic and strategic \n     interests in Hong Kong. But vigilant need not mean \n     confrontational. Through dialogue and negotiations, we can \n     remind China about our need to maintain a fully functioning \n     Consulate General in Hong Kong; the importance of being able \n     to base our regional law enforcement operations in Hong Kong; \n     the significance of allowing continued ship visits; and the \n     importance to U.S. businesses of Hong Kong continuing to \n     allow business to be conducted on a level playing field, \n     without corruption and with a free flow of information. If we \n     are firm about these interests without causing a \n     confrontation before it is necessary, we are likely to be \n     successful in protecting them.\n     Nepal\n       The issues I discussed with Nepalese officials included: \n     the stability of Nepal's government and its still fledgling \n     democracy; prospects for Nepal's economic development and \n     role of foreign aid in that development; Nepal's contribution \n     to international problems such as peacekeeping, arms control, \n     narcotics, terrorism, and refugees; regional issues, \n     including Nepal's relationships with its key neighbors, India \n     and China; and the need and prospects for the development of \n     Nepal's hydropower industry.\n       I had the opportunity to meet with virtually all the \n     leading figures in Nepal, including His Majesty King Birendra \n     Bir Bikram Shah; Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba; Foreign \n     Minister Prakash Chandra Lohani; Members of the Nepali \n     Congress Party, the ruling party in the parliament; Members \n     of the United Marxist/Leninist, or Communist party, the \n     largest party in the parliament; Members of the Federation of \n     Nepali Chambers of Commerce and Industry; and Minister of \n     Water Resources Pashupati Rana.\n       I met many additional leading Nepali citizens at dinners \n     hosted by U.S. Ambassador Sandy Vogelgesang and our host, Mr. \n     Prabhakar Rana, a leading industrialist. I also traveled \n     extensively through the country, getting a sense of living \n     conditions, and observing aid projects run by the U.S. \n     government and others. In particular, I focused on projects \n     financed by my husband's American Himalayan Foundation, \n     including a Tibetan refugee center. At the conclusion of the \n     trip, I had the opportunity to discuss with Ambassador \n     Vogelgesang and the Prime Minister's wife, Ms. Arzu Deuba, \n     plans for establishing a public-private partnership to fund a \n     women-to-women nutrition program for Nepali pre-school \n     children.\n       In addition, Dan Shapiro of my staff conducted separate \n     meetings with the U.N. High Commission for Refugees \n     representative in Nepal, Erkki Heinonen, and Anil Chitrakar \n     of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature for \n     a discussion of the environmental impact of new large \n     hydropower dams. He also attended several sessions of a \n     conference on export and investment opportunities for U.S. \n     firms in the renewable energy sector in Nepal. The conference \n     was sponsored in part by the U.S.-Nepal Chamber of Commerce.\n     Political Stability and Democracy\n       Nepal has only been a democracy since 1991, but already it \n     has developed a lively political culture. Nepalis are engaged \n     in the political process and conduct an active dialogue with \n     their political leaders. In meetings with leaders of the two \n     largest parties in the parliament, the Nepali Congress Party \n     and the United Marxist-Leninist Party, it became clear that \n     there is widespread support for maintaining the multiparty \n     democracy that has been established.\n       There is a surprising degree of consensus across the \n     political spectrum about what the nation's overall priorities \n     and needs are. When asked to identify Nepal's priority \n     economic sectors, both parties came back with an identical \n     list--agriculture, hydro-power, and tourism. The Communists \n     seem to be communist in name only--their economic agenda \n     seems to differ little from that of the Congress party, \n     calling for somewhat slower privatization of state-owned \n     industries and placing greater emphasis on maintaining the \n     social safety net. But the differences are of degree, rather \n     than kind.\n       Unfortunately, near-consensus on national priorities has \n     not translated into the kind of progress one would have hoped \n     for, on account of particularly bitter political infighting. \n     The Congress party suffers deep divisions based largely on \n     personal rivalries, with former leader G.P. Koirala rumored \n     to be planning a challenge to Prime Minister Sher Bahadur \n     Deuba. Its struggles with its coalition partners has forced \n     it to expand the government to include over 40 ministers just \n     to remain in power.\n       The Communists, while more united internally, are waiting \n     in the wings for a coalition crisis that they can exploit and \n     possibly regain power. Former Prime Minister and party leader \n     Manmohan Adhikary was quite open on this point. Last fall, \n     the Communist party nearly brought the government down by \n     threatening to oppose a key hydro-power treaty with India--\n     even though it was negotiated when the Communist party was in \n     power--before ultimately deciding to support it. While all \n     sides often talk about consensus and cooperation, it is clear \n     that their actions are often dictated by short-term political \n     calculations.\n       If both groups were to put aside their political rivalries \n     and emphasize the large degree of agreement in their \n     positions, they would easily be able to work together on a \n     common agenda for the benefit of Nepal. Unfortunately, that \n     does not seem likely at the\n\n[[Page S1044]]\n\n     present time. Corruption continues to plague the government \n     as well. Nevertheless, Nepalis are rightfully proud of the \n     democracy they have established and, apparently, \n     consolidated.\n     Aid and Development\n       Nepal is one of the poorest countries in the world. \n     Especially as one travels outside of Kathmandu, the poverty \n     is visually evident and jarring. In part, the political \n     stalemate caused by inter- and intra-party rivalries has \n     stalled economic liberalization efforts that would begin to \n     alleviate some of the economic difficulties. But Nepal's lack \n     of natural resources, poor infrastructure, and high birth \n     rate will all make raising the standard of living in Nepal \n     extremely difficult.\n       Nepal does have the benefit of a well-educated and \n     sophisticated private sector, as exemplified by our \n     discussion with members of the Federation of Nepali Chambers \n     of Commerce and Industry (FNCCI). They have actively promoted \n     economic reform, working closely with the government on the \n     privatization of public industries and on efforts to attract \n     foreign investment, particularly in high-value products in \n     Nepal's agricultural sector. In addition, FNCCI has worked \n     hard to advance reform of the administration of Nepal's tax \n     system, which they described as arbitrary and corrupt.\n       FNCCI has also been deeply involved in Nepal's economic \n     diplomacy. Because of their expertise, FNCCI members \n     participated in negotiations with India on trade and transit \n     agreements, and a new air transport agreement. FNCCI has also \n     reached out to its counterparts in China and in other South \n     Asian countries through the SAARC Business Council.\n       U.S. assistance is making a significant difference in the \n     lives of many Nepalis, although cuts are beginning to reduce \n     its impact. In Fiscal Year 1997, the USAID program budget is \n     $26 million. While that number is not expected to drop \n     precipitously in the near future, USAID staff is being \n     reduced, with the current 10 direct hires being reduced to \n     5 in 1998. The three main areas of USAID's program are \n     promotion of high value-added agricultural production; \n     empowerment of women; and health, population, and family \n     planning programs. Family planning programs are \n     particularly important because the standard of living in \n     families that have spaced their pregnancies is \n     significantly higher than those who have not.\n     Nepal's International Role\n       Nepal has emerged as responsible international citizen, \n     making important contributions to a number of transnational \n     problems. Despite pressure from its neighbor, India, Nepal \n     stood by its support of arms control agreements generally \n     when it supported the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty at the \n     United Nations in September. Nepal has also been very \n     cooperative with U.S. anti-narcotics efforts. As a transit \n     point for heroin from the Golden Triangle and Afghanistan, \n     Nepal has worked with a DEA attache in New Delhi to set up a \n     drug enforcement unit in the local police force. Trained by \n     U.S. and British specialists, this unit has improved Nepal's \n     customs procedures and has increased the number of drug \n     seizures at the Kathmandu airport.\n       Nepal has been an enthusiastic participant in international \n     peacekeeping missions, sending its troops to Haiti and \n     Africa, among other destinations. U.S. diplomats also report \n     that Nepal has been extremely cooperative in counterterrorism \n     efforts. They attribute much of Nepal's cooperative attitude \n     on these international problems to the consolidation of \n     Nepali democracy. Another manifestation is that Nepal enjoys \n     the best human rights record in South Asia.\n       Nepal has also handled two difficult refugee situations \n     very sensitively--those from Bhutan and those from Tibet. \n     There are currently 91,000 Bhutanese refugees living in camps \n     administered by UNHCR in eastern Nepal, at a cost of $4.5 \n     million a year. They first arrived in the early 1990s. After \n     many years of stalemate, the Nepali and Bhutanese governments \n     are hesitantly beginning talks--possibly with European \n     mediation--on possibly resettling some of these refugees back \n     to their homes in Bhutan. But for a solution to this problem \n     to be reached, India will have to commit to helping \n     facilitate it because these refugees would have to transit \n     through India, and some may even choose to settle there.\n       Approximately 2,000 Tibetan refugees pass through Nepal \n     each year as a way station on the way to Dharmsala, India. \n     Nepal has set up transit centers for these refugees to help \n     them make the journey, even though it causes sensitivity in \n     China. Nepal prefers to do this quietly, precisely to avoid \n     upsetting the Chinese, and the government does not permit \n     anti-Chinese activity on Nepali soil. A U.S. earmark of \n     $200,000 a year goes to assist this Tibetan refugee community \n     through the Tibetan Welfare Organization. UNHCR also monitors \n     the well-being of these refugees, and tries to keep track of \n     any abuses. The week we were there, a group of refugees had \n     been beaten up by some Nepali youths. UNHCR and the U.S. \n     Embassy were urging the Nepali government to ensure that \n     action was taken against the perpetrators.\n     Relations with India and China\n       Foreign Minister Lohani was pleased about the state of \n     Nepali-Indian relations, especially since Indian Prime \n     Minister Deve Gowda came to power. He cited recent \n     breakthroughs in the area of trade, transit and border \n     issues, and the generally less paternalistic attitude adopted \n     by the Deve Gowda government toward India's smaller \n     neighbors.\n       But probably the most important achievement is the Mahakali \n     Treaty on water resources. The treaty establishes Nepal's \n     right to be treated as India's equal on water resource \n     issues. It also established the framework of for private \n     sales of electric power from Nepal to India at competitive \n     prices. With Nepal's major market being India, this framework \n     agreement was absolutely essential for any large-scale \n     private investments in electric power generation.\n       Despite Nepal's continued assistance to Tibetan refugees, \n     Foreign Minister Lohani was pleased to report that his recent \n     visit to China had gone very well, and relations with China \n     are as good as they have been in recent memory. He cited the \n     strong positions the Chinese had expressed on Taiwan and \n     Tibet. Nepal is faced with a constant balancing act, situated \n     as it is between two large and powerful neighbors who can \n     exert strong pressures on Nepal if and when they choose. But \n     by adopting essentially a ``good neighbor'' policy, Nepal is \n     able to keep tensions in these two relationships to a \n     minimum.\n     Hydro-Power\n       There is widespread agreement in Nepal that hydro-power is \n     the nation's number one natural resource. With great volumes \n     of water (225 billion cubic meters annually nationwide) \n     flowing down steep slopes in four major river basins \n     (Mahakali, Karnali, Gandaki, and Koshi), if the full \n     potential of Nepal's hydro-power can be harnessed, it could \n     have a dramatic impact on the nation's economy. The numbers \n     are staggering: hydro-power projects in Nepal today generate \n     250 megawatts, while demand is under 300 megawatts. As Nepal \n     develops, its demand will rise; projections are that demand \n     will reach 1,640 MW by 2015. But if the over 60 feasible \n     sites for hydro-power projects are developed, Nepal could \n     produce on the order of 44,000 MW, a vast surplus that can be \n     exported to Nepal's energy-hungry neighbors, India and China. \n     Northern India is the brightest (and closest) potential \n     market. Already its energy demand exceeds supply by some \n     9,000 MW, and that deficit is projected to rise to 20,800 MW \n     by 2010.\n       The prospect of taking advantage of these conditions was \n     made brighter by the conclusion of the Mahakali treaty with \n     India last October. This treaty will allow the private sales \n     of electric power from Nepal to India. Essentially, both \n     countries would benefit from this arrangement--Nepal could \n     export its primary product to a vast market in northern India \n     that is desperately in need of increased electric power. \n     Foreign Minister Lohani sounded an optimistic note, \n     indicating that there could be substantial progress in \n     construction of the dams in the next year, in hopes that they \n     could come on line fairly soon thereafter. Clearly, American \n     companies should be able to play a leading role in developing \n     this vast resource.\n       Not surprisingly, politics were responsible for delays on \n     other hydro-power projects. Prime Minister Deuba indicated \n     that he supported signing a letter of intent with Enron for \n     two hydro-electric projects on the Arun and Karnali rivers, \n     now that India had indicated it had no objection to this \n     arrangement, provided that Indian companies were also \n     included in the consortium. However, the final decision rests \n     with the Minister of Water Resources, Pashupati Rana, to whom \n     the Prime Minister felt indebted for supporting his \n     government in a no-confidence vote last spring.\n       Various American environmental organizations have raised \n     objections to some of the large hydro-power projects that \n     have been proposed, both because of the change in the river's \n     flow and because of the damage done by the construction of a \n     road to facilitate construction of the dam. But Nepali \n     environmentalists tend to take a different view. Their \n     concern is that Nepal's vast forests are being destroyed as \n     most Nepalis rely on wood as their main source of energy. For \n     them, this is the real environmental disaster, and the \n     successful development of hydro-power, which could supply \n     most regions of the country with electricity, would help \n     preserve the forests. For Nepali environmentalists, the focus \n     is on seeing the hydro-power projects done right, so as not \n     to squander this vast resource, while mitigating the \n     environmental impact of the dams as much as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/05/senate-section/article/S1040-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1044-S1045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--NOMINATION OF RODNEY SLATER\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Madam President, today I introduced legislation, \nalong with Senator Phil Gramm, called the Military Voting Rights Act of \n1997. The bill that was introduced today makes absolutely clear in the \nlaw what is already law, because there is nothing against it in the \nlaw, and that is that our military personnel have the right to vote at \ntheir home base in Federal, State, and local elections.\n  The law does not say anything against that, but because it does not, \nthere has been a challenge in my home State of Texas to 800 military \nvotes that were, of course, in State and local elections, which are \nallowed by Texas law.\n  It is very clear that a person who serves in our military should have \nthe right to vote and the right to citizenship in the State and the \nlocalities that he or she chooses to have as their home base. Yet, that \nright is being challenged. Some 800 military absentee ballots, 150 of \nwhich were from overseas, were challenged saying that these people who \nare serving our country and who are putting their lives on the line to \nprotect our right to vote nevertheless should not have the full voting \nrights. In fact, the plaintiff sent questionnaires that were in the \nform of depositions to all of these 800 people who voted, and one woman \nin Bosnia got a questionnaire to be filled out to determine if she has \nthe right to vote in the State and local elections. We are trying to \nput a stop to that. We are trying to say very clearly in the Military \nVoting Rights Act of 1997 that no person will ever be able to be \nchallenged for their full citizenship rights because they have chosen \nto serve our country, which job, by its very nature, requires moving \naround the country and outside of the country wherever they are \nrequired to go to fulfill the job.\n  I want to commend our State representative in Texas, Jerry Madden, \nwho is just as incensed as all of us are, for taking the initiative. He \nis working on a bill now to make it easier for the military personnel \nin our State to vote because he, like I, appreciates the fact that \nthese people who have been at a base in Texas have chosen to call Texas \nhome, and he wants to make sure that they can vote in the very easiest \nway. Perhaps, in fact, we might learn from some of the things that he \nis doing. He wants to be able to let them have access to Internet \nvoting. He wants to give them some extra leeway in time to vote so that \ntheir ballots will have time to get to the State of their residence \nfrom a place like Bosnia, or perhaps in Saudi Arabia, or anywhere else \nin the world where they might be deployed.\n  I think that it is very important that the sense of the Senate be \nknown here. In fact, 58 Members of the Senate signed a letter to the \nAttorney General, Janet Reno, asking her to intervene in this case to \nmake sure that our military rights are being protected. All of us who \nsigned that letter are very concerned about the ramifications of this \nbill. We are concerned that if these people are able to prevail in this \ncase, to say that the military does not have the right to have full \ncitizenship in a State to be able to vote in a State or local election, \nthat perhaps other rights might be challenged. If a person can't have \nthe full rights of the State in which he or she resides and calls home \nbase, then what other laws might not apply? Marriage laws? Could you \nnot get a divorce if you were in the military and you don't have the \nright to belong in a State? How far are you going to take this?\n  The fact is there is no question on the merits that the people who \nare choosing to serve our country and whose job, by its nature, \nrequires that they move every 2 years, or even more frequently, that \nthey should be able to join the home State of their choosing. Frankly, \nI am proud when the military personnel who serve on Texas bases love \nour State enough to want to call it home, and we want them to return \nbecause we know that the people who lay their lives on the line to make \nsure that the United States is free are the kind of citizens we want in \nour State. We want them to know they are welcome. We want them to know \nthey are welcome anywhere else they choose to call home because we \nappreciate what they do for our country.\n  So I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this bill. I know that we will \nhave a number of cosponsors, and I think we will pass this bill quite \neasily, because, as I said, 58 Members are incensed enough to ask the \nAttorney General to intervene. In fact, I hope the Attorney General \nwill do her duty to represent the Federal employees that are needing \nhelp right now so that their rights will be protected--not only the 800 \nwho are being challenged, but all of those that might be affected if \nthis case is allowed to prevail.\n\n[[Page S1046]]\n\n  We cannot sit back and let one of our military personnel be robbed of \ntheir right of citizenship, especially as they are the ones who are \nstanding there to make sure that every American who is registered to \nvote has that right to do it free and clear.\n  I stood here on the first day of our session and talked about the \nwonderful people of Serbia who were standing in the streets for days on \nend so that their vote would be counted. And because those people \npeacefully demonstrated, they eventually prevailed. Those elections \nthat were held, for which their vote had not been counted, have been \ndeclared effective, and the local elections are being declared \nvictorious for those who stood in the streets for their right to make \ntheir vote counted. How could we as a country, who stood with those \nwonderful people silently protesting so that their vote would be \ncounted, as the greatest nation on Earth, the democracy that is the \nbeacon for the world, say that our military personnel are going to be \nsecond class citizens because, yes, they can vote in Federal elections \nbut, no, they can't have the full rights in the State they choose to \ncall home?\n  This is a major Federal issue. I hope that it is one that we can \ndispatch very promptly and say clearly in the law there is no question, \nand there isn't a question because there is no law against this anyway \nbut we want to set it in the positive. Our military personnel will have \nthe full right to vote in the State in which they choose to call home \nwhen they are based there, and forevermore. And I hope they will choose \nto call Texas home, and I hope they will return to Texas because those \nare just the kinds of citizens that we want.\n  So I appreciate very much that we have this bill, that we have so \nmany sponsors for it, and that we have so many that are interested in \nthis issue. We will not let this issue die. We will protect the rights \nof our military, and we will make sure that they know how much they are \nappreciated.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/05/senate-section/article/S1045-5", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE LIFE OF PAMELA HARRIMAN\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, it is with sadness that I note the \npassing of a unique public servant, our Ambassador to France, Pamela \nHarriman. Perhaps President Clinton said it best this morning: Pamela \nHarriman represented the best of America's immigrant tradition. She was \nsomeone who enjoyed the opportunities this country offered but gave \nback so much more in return.\n  Pamela Harriman's legacy will be remembered both in this Capitol \nBuilding and in capitals across the world. As a private citizen in the \n1970's and 1980's, Pamela Harriman plunged into the rough-and-tumble of \nAmerican politics.\n  The early 1980's were a difficult time for the people in my party. An \nincumbent Democratic President had lost the White House and Democrats \nhad lost control of the Senate. But Pamela Harriman helped breathe life \ninto an ailing Democratic Party when she formed ``Democrats for the \n`80s,'' helping to bring my party's communications operations into the \nmodern age when she gave crucial support for the Harriman Center at the \nDemocratic National Committee Building.\n  She also was a host to numerous functions at her elegant Georgetown \nhome, asking nothing but a passionate commitment to public service and \nDemocratic values from those she assisted.\n  As most of our colleagues know, politics in Washington can be a \ncontact sport. Pamela Harriman played the game well. She played with \ngreat dignity, elegance, and style. She did not become involved in \npolitics for personal enrichment or to gain social position; she \nalready had both. She chose to share the fruits of her hard work and \ngood fortune with a generation of Americans who were eager to serve \ntheir country in Washington.\n  Hers will be a lasting legacy for all Americans who believe in the \nnobility of public service and think that politics today does not have \nto be mean, petty, or destructive.\n  Late in her life, Pamela Harriman brought her tremendous skills and \nability to the world stage when President Clinton asked her to be \nAmbassador to France. Some critics suggested she did not have the \nexperience to handle such a sensitive post. She proved them wrong. She \nbegan her assignment in Paris in 1993 with the respect of President \nClinton and those who knew her well in the United States. She quickly \nearned the respect of the people of France and other European \ncountries.\n  Her keen understanding of Washington ways and the experiences of her \nearly life in Europe allowed her to skillfully navigate disputes over \ntrade, CIA activities, Bosnia, the Middle East, and NATO. Her \ndiplomatic acumen protected America's interests without alienating \npowerful and important allies all through the world.\n  The French Government's unique recognition of her contributions was \nall the more evident when they made her a commander of the Legion of \nHonor's Order of Arts and Letters, their country's highest cultural \naward. No doubt she will be missed in France and across Europe almost \nas much as she will be missed in America, her adopted home.\n  So this is a sad day for me and many others in this country and \nacross the world whose lives were touched by a very special woman. I am \nconfident that the examples she so graciously established will live on \nwith us and future generations of public servants. For that we should \nbe joyful.\n  Thank you, Ambassador Pamela Harriman.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/05/senate-section/article/S1046-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "05", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 11 A.M.
