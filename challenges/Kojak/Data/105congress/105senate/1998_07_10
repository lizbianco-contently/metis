Under the previous order, the \nForeign Relations Committee is discharged from Senate Concurrent \nResolution 107, and the Senate will now proceed to its consideration, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 107) affirming the \n     United States commitments to Taiwan.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is about to vote on \nS. Con. Res. 107, introduced by Senator Torricelli, myself and many \nothers earlier this week. This resolution was necessary to address the \nuncertainty created by President Clinton's remarks in Shanghai on his \nrecent trip to China.\n  Our resolution reaffirms our commitments to Taiwan as spelled out in \nthe 1979 Taiwan Relations Act. That act is the law of the land. \nSuccessive Presidents have reached bilateral agreements with the \nPeople's Republic of China, but they have never been submitted to the \nSenate for ratification. They are not binding on the United States. The \nTaiwan Relations Act is.\n  It is unfortunate the President chose to lay out a new course on \nTaiwan--unfortunately it was done in Shanghai, unfortunately it was \ndone without any consultation with Congress, and unfortunately it was \ndone without consultation with the democratic government of Taiwan.\n  It is also unfortunate the President did not apparently even seek to \nget China's leaders to renounce the use of force against Taiwan. \nInstead, he said exactly what Beijing wanted to hear.\n  One likely effect of the President's statements is to strengthen the \nvoices in Taiwan seeking full independence. While seeking to please \nBeijing, he has strengthened those in Taiwan who argue the United \nStates cannot be trusted as an ally.\n  President Clinton's statements have emboldened Beijing in its efforts \nto intimidate Taiwan. A Chinese official told Taiwan to ``face \nreality.'' The\n\n[[Page S7916]]\n\nWashington Post reports today the Beijing plans ``to use the remarks as \na lever to force Taiwan into political talks on reunification.''\n  The article also reports that the remarks ``underscore the important \nrole the United States has played in forcing Taiwan to the bargaining \ntable.''\n  Chinese officials understand what Clinton officials deny: The \nPresident's remarks were a major victory for Beijing and major blow to \ndemocratic Taiwan.\n  Passage of this resolution sends a powerful signal that the Senate is \nnot accepting President Clinton's new policy. It is a strong statement \ncoming so soon after his return to the United States.\n  But passage of this resolution will not be the end of our efforts to \ntry to understand the administration's new policy on Taiwan. \nAdministration spokesmen have said they have not changed policy, when \nthe opposite is obvious.\n  We will explore whether the administration stands by its 1994 Taiwan \nPolicy Review. That review pledged to upgrade relations with Taiwan. \nThat review pledged to support Taiwan's participation in certain \ninternational organizations. Is this still administration policy?\n  We also will try to determine whether the administration still \nadheres to the ``Six Assurances'' made to the Senate in 1982: No date \nfor ending arms sales to Taiwan; no prior consultations with Beijing on \narms sales to Taiwan; no U.S. mediation role between Taipei and \nBeijing; no agreement to alter the Taiwan Relations Act; no change in \nthe United States position regarding Taiwan's sovereignty; and no \npressure on Taiwan to enter into negotiations with Beijing.\n  We will ask the administration if they still adhere to these \nassurances given to the Senate after the Third Communique was reached \nin 1982.\n  This resolution is an important step and a timely step. But it is not \nthe end of repairing the damage from the President's statements in \nChina.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, as the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nEast Asian and Pacific Affairs, I rise this morning in support of the \nresolution on Taiwan.\n  My expectations for the recent summit meeting in the PRC were, \nfrankly, not high. Summit meetings such as the one in Beijing rarely \nprovide the atmosphere for momentous policy breakthroughs. Rather, they \nare an important opportunity for leaders to exchange views and to \ndiscuss further avenues of bilateral cooperation. This summit then, \nviewed from that standpoint, met expectations.\n  And I must say, that I was encouraged by the willingness of the PRC \nto broadcast both the Clinton-Jiang press conference and the \nPresident's speech from Beijing Daxue in Beijing. Clearly, that \ndecision was an important step in the PRC's continuing--albeit slow--\nprogress toward further openness.\n  But Mr. President, I was disturbed by the President's pronouncements \non Taiwan and the ``three noes.'' The PRC-Taiwan-US relationship is a \nvery complex one. While it certainly can be argued that the President's \nstatement was simply a restatement of actual U.S. policy on Taiwan, in \na culture, on both sides of the Taiwan Straits, where nuances are \neverything, I believe that the statement sent the worst possible \nsignals to both sides.\n  First, the statement was the first time that a President of the \nUnited States has publicly adopted the PRC policy of the ``three \nnoes.'' While--as the President's national security adviser pointed out \nto me in a meeting yesterday--it is true that both he and Secretary \nAlbright have made similar statements in the past, and it is true that \nin many ways the statement was simply a restatement of implicit U.S. \npolicies, the fact that the pronouncement came directly from the \nPresident gives it a special gravity in Chinese eyes.\n  Second, it occurred while the President was still in the PRC, during \nthe first visit of an American President since 1989, and more ominously \nfor the Taiwanese, in Shanghai, the site of what they regard as the \ninfamous Shanghai Communique.\n  Third, to me the statement bore all the markings of a quid pro quo. \nAny outside observer looking at the give-and-take of the summit would \nsee that the PRC gave the U.S. four unprecedented opportunities for the \nPresident to make live statements on Chinese TV and radio. What did the \nPRC get in return in what for both sides is always supposed to be a \nzero-sum game, they might ask? Well, aside from the reception in \nTiananmen Square, the only other concession to the PRC I can find is \nthe Taiwan statement.\n  And let there be no doubt, Mr. President, the statement was a useful \nconcession to the PRC. Beijing officials have stated that they intend \nto use the President's remarks as a lever to force Taiwan into \npolitical talks on reunification. The Foreign Ministry stated yesterday \nthat Clinton's statement has ``positive implications for the resolution \nof the Taiwan question.'' Tang Shubei, the Vice President of the PRC's \nAssociation for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS) with whom I \nhave discussed the Taiwan issue on several occasions, has said that the \nremarks helped the PRC: ``This has provided favorable conditions for \nthe development of cross-strait relations.''\n  It seems to me that the President could have simply said, when asked, \n``There has been no change in the policy of the United States on the \nTaiwan question'' or ``The United States' position on the Taiwan \nquestion remains the same'' or words to that effect. Instead, he made a \nconscious decision to explicitly adopt the PRC's ``three noes'' policy. \nSuch a decision was hardly accidental, and so I must ask why that \ndecision was made. And in the total absence of any other rational \nexplanation from the White House, I and others can only conclude that \nthe statement was some sort of quid pro quo.\n  Fourth, and most disturbing to me, the President explicitly stated \nthat the United States will not under any circumstances support the \nindependence of Taiwan. While it could be said that this policy is \nimplicit in the fact that the United States supports the ``one China'' \npolicy and does not support ``two Chinas'' or ``one China one Taiwan,'' \nit is the first time in my knowledge that it has been publicly \nenunciated in this manner. In addition, it seems to me to completely \nrule out a bid for independence even if the PRC uses force to reunify \nwith Taiwan--a course of action it has pointedly refused to rule out.\n  So Mr. President, I think it only proper under these unfortunate \ncircumstances that the Congress make clear its position on the status \nof Taiwan. For that reason, I support the resolution and urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is acting \nwith swift resolve in passing this important resolution reaffirming our \ncommitments and support to the people and government of Taiwan. This is \nan important statement, which I hope gives some sense of reassurance to \nour friends in Taiwan that the United States will not turn its back on \nthe right of any people to choose the path of democracy and freedom. \nAnd that we will not waiver in our support simply for political \nexpediency.\n  Yesterday before the Senate Finance Committee, I asked our Secretary \nof State Madeleine Albright about the President's statements in China. \nWell, to no real surprise, the Secretary had to pretend that there has \nbeen no policy change on Taiwan since official relations were \nterminated with Taiwan in 1979. Mr. President, this is an indefensible \nline; the Administration clearly agreed to China's position on the \nThree No's''; possibly as early as when when President Jiang was here \nin Washington, D.C. last October, but most certainly reiterated by \nPresident Clinton himself while in China last month. Make no mistake \nabout it, this is a policy change--and a dangerous one at that.\n  The Washington Post this morning has reported that the People's \nRepublic of China is already using President Clinton's statements for \nleverage to bring Taiwan to the bargaining table. While this \nAdministration claims it would never force Taiwan to negotiate with \nBeijing, it has done so by slowly taking away all its negotiating cards \nin the middle of the night and without consultation. I ask unanimous \nconsent that this article appear in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks.\n\n[[Page S7917]]\n\n  Mr. President, the United States is the greatest example for what \ndemocracy can accomplish; we are the greatest advocate for democracy \nand freedom in the history of mankind. But for some strange reason, the \nPresident of the United States chose to publicly handcuff the ability \nof the 21 million people in Taiwan to pursue the right of democracy. \nWill this deter others from summoning the courage to pursue the path of \nfreedom? I hope not, but if the example is there that the United States \nwill not support the quest; than I think it is remains more than a \npossibility.\n  Indeed, this a dark day for democracy and freedom. While I am pleased \nthat the Senate is making this important statement, I fear that the \ndamage has been done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 10, 1998]\n\n    China Tells Taiwan to ``Face Reality'' Reunification Talks Urged\n\n                           (By John Pomfret)\n\n       Beijing, July 9--China urged Taiwan today to ``face \n     reality'' and agree to talks on eventual reunification with \n     China following comments by President Clinton that the United \n     States will not support an independent Taiwan.\n       Taiwan, meanwhile, announced it had agreed to a visit by a \n     senior Beijing negotiator to prepare for resumption of high-\n     level dialogue between the two rivals, separated by the 100-\n     mile-wide Taiwan Strait.\n       The developments indicate that after a three-year freeze, \n     talks could begin as early as this fall between the two \n     sides. They also underscore the important role the United \n     States has played in forcing Taiwan to the bargaining table. \n     Clinton's statement, during his recent nine-day trip to \n     China, was taken as a significant defeat in Taiwan even \n     though U.S. officials contended it was simply a reiteration \n     of U.S. policy.\n       Clinton's June 30 remarks in Shanghai made clear the United \n     States would not support any formal independence bid by the \n     island of 21 million people, or a policy backing ``one China, \n     one Taiwan,'' or ``two Chinas.'' Clinton also said the United \n     States will oppose any Taiwanese bid to join international \n     bodies that accept only sovereign states as members.\n       Although the policy was first enunciated in October, \n     Clinton himself had never said it publicly before. Thus, it \n     was taken as a major defeat in Taiwan, which relies on the \n     United States for most of its political support and weapons. \n     In Washington, Clinton's statement has drawn some criticism. \n     On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) \n     called Clinton's remarks counterproductive, and he threatened \n     unspecified congressional action.\n       The Beijing government, which views Taiwan as a renegade \n     Chinese province, has said it is satisfied with Clinton's \n     remarks, even though it had tried to have Clinton commit them \n     to writing. Chinese officials have said they plan to use the \n     remarks as a lever to force Taiwan into political talks on \n     reunification. Taiwanese officials say they want to limit any \n     new talks to specific issues, such as immigration, cross-\n     border crime, fishing rights and protection of investments. \n     China rejects this limited approach and insists a broader \n     discussion of reunification is necessary for improved ties.\n       Taiwan and China ostensibly have been separated since 1895, \n     when Japan occupied the island following its victory over \n     Imperial China in the Sino-Japanese War. In 1949, Nationalist \n     Chinese leader Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan from the \n     mainland after his forces lost a civil war to Chinese \n     Communist forces led by Mao Zedong. Since then, the two sides \n     have moved further away from each other--in both economic and \n     political development.\n       In Beijing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Tang Guoqiang said \n     Clinton's statement has ``positive implications for the \n     resolution of the Taiwan question,'' and he added: ``We hope \n     that Taiwan authorities will get a clear understanding of the \n     situation, face reality and place importance on the national \n     interest.\n       ``Similarly, the official China Daily quoted one of \n     Beijing's top negotiators with Taiwan as saying that \n     Clinton's remarks had helped China. ``This has provided \n     favorable conditions for the development of cross-strait \n     relations,'' said Tang Shubei, vice president of the \n     Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait. ``But \n     cross-strait issues will ultimately be solved by the Chinese \n     people.''Meanwhile, that group's Taiwanese counterpart, the \n     semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation, informed the \n     Chinese association that its deputy secretary general, Li \n     Yafei, could visit Taiwan July 24-31. Li's visit is to be \n     followed by a reciprocal trip to China by the leader of the \n     Taiwan foundation, Koo Chen-fu. In June, Beijing invited Koo \n     to visit China sometime in September or October, and Koo said \n     later he plans to go in mid-September.\n       In 1993, Koo and Chinese association leader Wang Daohan met \n     in Singapore in a landmark gathering that signaled warming \n     ties between the old rivals. But after two years of improving \n     relations, the ties collapsed in 1995 when Taiwanese \n     President Lee Teng-hui obtained a visa to visit the United \n     States for the 25th reunion of his Cornell University class.\n       China launched a series of military exercises off the \n     Taiwanese coast in 1995 and 1996, lobbing cruise missiles \n     into the area. In 1996, the United States dispatched two \n     aircraft carrier battle groups to the region as a warning to \n     China not to contemplate a military solution.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \nthe Majority Leader's resolution on Taiwan. This resolution will \nreassure the people of Taiwan that the United States will stand by its \npledges, particularly those included in the Taiwan Relations Act of \n1979.\n  It is unfortunate to say the least, Mr. President, that it has become \nnecessary to pass this resolution. But President Clinton's statements \nwhile in the People's Republic of China make it imperative that we \nreiterate and reaffirm our commitment to Taiwan's democratic \nprinciples, to its right to maintain a viable, sufficient self-defense \ncapability, and to a future for Taiwan that is determined by peaceful, \ndemocratic means.\n  President Clinton's unwise and damaging statements during his visit \nto communist China have thrown in doubt our commitment to Taiwan. The \nPresident's three noes''--no independence for Taiwan, no recognition \nfor a separate Taiwanese government, and no support for Taiwan's \nmembership in international organizations--cast doubt on America's \nwillingness to stand by its commitments and raise the prospect of \nfuture conflict in South Asia.\n  Were the President's statements allowed to stand, they would \nconstitute an abandonment of Taiwan to its fate at the hands of a \ncommunist regime that has shown itself willing to slaughter its own \npeople and resort to force and intimidation whenever useful.\n  This is unacceptable, Mr. President, and we must not let it stand. As \nthe world's first free nation, and as the leader of the free world, we \nhave a responsibility to stand up for nations like Taiwan which have \nmoved toward democracy and free markets. We owe it to the people of \nTaiwan to renew our commitment to their democratic institutions and to \ntheir right to determine their own future on a democratic basis.\n  It also is important to note, Mr. President, that the People's \nRepublic of China has engaged in shows of force and attempted military \nintimidation toward Taiwan over the course of several decades. Only two \nyears ago, in 1996, the United States found it necessary to send \naircraft carriers to the area to let the Chinese communist government \nknow that we would respond should they take military action against \nTaiwan.\n  By explicitly stating that the United States would not support the \nTaiwanese people's right to determine their own future in a democratic \nmanner, President Clinton sent a strong signal to the communist \ngovernment in Beijing that we might stand idly by while it took control \nof Taiwan by force.\n  Mr. President, it was precisely this kind of miscalculation that \nprecipitated the war in Korea, a war in which American troops ended up \nfacing the Chinese army and in which thousands of brave American \nsoldiers lost their lives. It is imperative, in my view, that Congress \nact swiftly and surely to see to it that history does not repeat \nitself.\n  The United States stands by the people of Taiwan in their \ndetermination to protect themselves and their democratic principles \nfrom any forceful reintegration into China. We must make our stance \nclear for the people of Taiwan, for the cause of freedom, and for the \ncause of peace.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong support of Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 107, a resolution affirming the United States' \ncontinued commitment to Taiwan.\n  During his recent visit to China, the President undermined long-\nstanding U.S. policy regarding Taiwan. President Clinton said,\n\n       I had a chance to reiterate our Taiwan policy, which is \n     that we don't support independent for Taiwan, or two Chinas, \n     or one Taiwan-one China. And we don't believe that Taiwan \n     should be a member of any organization for which statehood is \n     a requirement.\n\n  The President's statement, in fact, represents a long standing \ndeparture from U.S. policy. This statement represents an abandonment of \na balanced policy that has allowed the United States to conduct \nimportant relations with both sides of the Taiwan Strait.\n\n[[Page S7918]]\n\n  The United States has not taken, and should not take, a policy \nposition on the outcome of the dispute between China and Taiwan. \nNeither should we endorse or oppose Taiwan's independence or \nreunification. However, we must continue to insist that any eventual \nresolution of this dispute must come through peaceful means and with \nthe approval of the people of Taiwan. The President's remarks are not \nconsistent with that goal.\n  Let us not forget that May 1998 marked the second anniversary of the \nfirst fully democratic Presidential election in the 5,000-year history \nof the Chinese people. That election occurred on the island of Taiwan. \nTaiwan has evolved into a modern, democratic society, a major economic \npower, and an active partner in world affairs. Taiwan's continued \nachievement should deepen the longstanding friendship between our two \ndemocracies. Should the President disregard that responsibility, the \nCongress must fill that void.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of S. \nCon. Res. 107. This resolution is intended to repair the damage done by \nPresident Clinton's ill-considered comments on Taiwan during the recent \nU.S.-China summit. The Senate needs to make a clear statement in \nsupport of Taiwan. A failure to do so would be a greater disservice to \nthe people of Taiwan and the credibility of the United States in East \nAsia.\n  Mr. President, let us be clear, the President's statements undercut \nTaiwan in a way that past U.S. policy explicitly avoided. The \nAdministration has tried to portray the President's regurgitation of \nBeijing's ``three noes'' as merely a restatement of U.S. policy. If \nthis was merely a restatement of U.S. policy, however, why did the \nPresident have to make the comments at all?\n  Far from being a restatement of U.S. policy, Bill Clinton's remarks \nwere the first by a U.S. president formally opposing Taiwanese \nindependence. In addition, the President's stated opposition to \nTaiwan's membership in international organizations directly undercuts \nTaiwan's efforts to share abroad its vision for a democratic, unified \nChina. It is Taiwan's vision of China's future--a future of democratic \npluralism and civil liberty--that the Administration should be \nsupporting, not legitimizing the Chinese Communist Party with CNN \nsummitry.\n  As hard as the Administration might try to sanitize the President's \ncomments, his statements already are being used by Beijing to pressure \nTaiwan on reunification. This morning's Washington Post reports that \nBeijing is telling Taiwan to ``face reality'' after the President's \nstatement and agree to talks on reunification. One of Beijing's top \nnegotiators with Taiwan said that the President's remarks strengthened \nChina's hand and ``* * * provided favorable conditions for the \ndevelopment of cross-strait relations.''\n  This Administration seems to have forgotten that China has conducted \nmissile exercises off of Taiwan's major ports in two of the last four \nyears. ``Favorable conditions'' for China mean one thing: more latitude \nfrom the United States to intimidate Taiwan. The Chinese military \ncontinues to acquire weapons systems to facilitate an invasion of the \nisland, yet the Administration tries to distance itself from American \nobligations in the Taiwan Relations Act to help Taiwan ``maintain a \nsufficient self-defense capability.'' Incredibly, the Administration \nparroted the ``three noes'' policy for Beijing without even obtaining \nassurances from China that it will not use force to reunify with \nTaiwan.\n  Adopting Beijing's formulation on Taiwan was an ill-advised move by \nthe President that has the potential of doing great harm to the 21 \nmillion Taiwanese who have built a vibrant democracy and free market. \nThe Administration's position on Taiwan is not reassuring our \ndemocratic allies in East Asia.\n  It is time for this Administration to choose which side it will \nsupport in the continuing struggle for civil liberty and democratic \nreform in East Asia. Blind engagement with Beijing's oppressive regime \nis not the way to ensure that democracy is preserved on Taiwan or \nadvanced in China. It is time for the United States to stand again for \nfreedom in East Asia and around the world.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Con. Res. 107\n\n       Whereas at no time since the establishment of the People's \n     Republic of China on October 1, 1949, has Taiwan been under \n     the control of the People's Republic of China;\n       Whereas the United States began its long, peaceful, \n     friendly relationship with Taiwan in 1949;\n       Whereas since the enactment of the Taiwan Relations Act in \n     1979, the policy of the United States has been based on the \n     expectation that the future relationship between the People's \n     Republic of China and Taiwan would be determined by peaceful \n     means;\n       Whereas in March 1996, the People's Republic of China held \n     provocative military maneuvers, including missile launch \n     exercises in the Taiwan Strait, in an attempt to intimidate \n     the people of Taiwan during their historic, free and \n     democratic presidential election;\n       Whereas officials of the People's Republic of China refuse \n     to renounce the use of force against democratic Taiwan;\n       Whereas Taiwan has achieved significant political and \n     economic strength as one of the world's premier democracies \n     and as the nineteenth largest economy in the world;\n\n[[Page S7919]]\n\n       Whereas Taiwan is the seventh largest trading partner of \n     the United States and imports more than twice as much \n     annually from the United States as does the People's Republic \n     of China; and\n       Whereas no treaties exist between the People's Republic of \n     China and Taiwan that determine the future status of Taiwan: \n     Now therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) affirms its longstanding commitment to Taiwan and the \n     people of Taiwan in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act \n     (Public Law 96-8);\n       (2) affirms its expectation, consistent with the Taiwan \n     Relations Act, that the future of Taiwan will be determined \n     by peaceful means, and considers any effort to determine the \n     future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means a threat to the \n     peace and security of the Western Pacific and of grave \n     concern to the United States;\n       (3) affirms its commitment, consistent with the Taiwan \n     Relations Act, to make available to Taiwan such defense \n     articles and defense services in such quantities as may be \n     necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-\n     defense capability;\n       (4) affirms its commitment, consistent with the Taiwan \n     Relations Act, that only the President and Congress shall \n     determine the nature and quantity of defense articles and \n     services for Taiwan based solely upon their judgment of the \n     needs of Taiwan; and\n       (5) urges the President of the United States to seek a \n     public renunciation by the People's Republic of China of any \n     use of force, or threat to use force, against democratic \n     Taiwan.\n\n  The title was amended so as to read: ``Affirming U.S. Commitments \nUnder the Taiwan Relations Act''.\n  Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to speak about capital gains and \nthe way that we look at the estimates that come from a reduction in \ntaxes such as capital gains.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced legislation to reduce the capital \ngains tax to 14 percent and to provide indexing of the capital gains \ntax from that point out. This legislation builds on last year's tax \nbill which moved the capital gains rate down from 28 percent to 20 \npercent.\n  I rise today to commend both the Senate majority leader and the \nSpeaker of the House for their recent calls for a reduction in the top \ncapital gains rate to 15 percent. Both of our leaders have indicated \nthey are introducing legislation to cut the rate. This could be \naccomplished as early as this year. Again, I commend them for their \nleadership.\n  I also wish to express my support for a provision in the IRS reform \nbill that returns the holding period for long-term capital gains \ntreatment to 12 months. Last year, the administration unwisely insisted \non extending this out to 18 months. This added complexity to the code \nand represented another attempt by Government to micromanage investment \ndecisions.\n  There is a great deal of interest in the tax treatment of capital \ngains due to mounting evidence that capital gains tax rate reductions \nnot only benefit taxpayers and the economy but also increase revenues.\n  Last month, the Joint Tax Committee released new estimates of the \nrevenue resulting in the 1997 reduction of the top capital gains rate \nfrom 28 percent to 20 percent. The Joint Tax Committee apparently \nunderestimated the revenue gain in 1998 by $13 billion and in 1999 by \n$12 billion. In fact, the latest estimates are that over the first 5 \nyears revenue could be as much as $58 billion greater than previously \nforecast.\n  Now, this does not surprise me. In fact, there are a number of us in \nCongress who have been making this very point for years. The capital \ngains tax rate cut will increase revenue, not reduce it. There are two \nprincipal reasons for this increase in revenue. First, there is the \nshort-term incentive to sell more capital assets; second is the long-\nterm progrowth benefit from a capital-friendly tax policy.\n  The capital gains tax is largely a voluntary tax. The tax is only \npaid if the investor chooses to sell the asset.\n  If taxes are high, an investor can hold on to the asset for years. \nBut when taxes are low, investors will often decide to sell the assets \nand ``realize'' the capital gain.\n  History confirms this pattern. In 1978, when the capital gains tax \nrate was reduced from 40 percent to 28 percent, capital realizations \nincreased by 50 percent, and tax receipts increased.\n  In 1981, Congress and President Reagan further reduced the capital \ngains tax rate to 20 percent. Once again, capital gain realizations \nincreased dramatically and by 1983 were again up by 50 percent.\n  By contrast, tax revenues actually dropped for a number of years \nfollowing the capital gains tax rate hike in 1986.\n  Mr. President, last year, when Congress proposed to cut the capital \ngains tax rate from 28 percent to 20 percent, the Joint Tax Committee \nsubmitted its revenue estimate.\n  The Joint Tax Committee forecast a 10-year revenue loss from the rate \ncut of $21 billion.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that the Joint Tax Committee and \nCongressional Budget Office estimates dramatically underestimated both \nthe strength of the economy and the positive response to the tax rate \ncut.\n  The Joint Tax Committee now concedes that there will be a significant \nrevenue gain from capital gains realizations.\n  In my view, a review of the last twenty years of capital gains tax \nrates and the associated revenues suggests that the model used by the \nJoint Tax Committee and the Congressional Budget Office to estimate \ncapital gains revenues is flawed.\n  The Congressional Budget Office argues that government revenue \nestimates adequately account for behavioral changes that occur as a \nresult of tax changes.\n  Despite this claim, it would appear that when tax rates are lowered \nthe revenue estimating model significantly exaggerates the revenue \nlosses.\n  In fact, in no single year after a rate cut has there ever been a \nloss of revenue.\n  Conversely, when tax rates are increased, the model significantly \nexaggerates the level of revenue gains.\n  Not only do the Congressional models fail to accurately measure the \nresponse of taxpayers to changes in tax rates, they exclude an estimate \nof the impact of tax changes on economic performance.\n  Congress is largely in the dark when it comes to any estimates of the \neconomic benefit of tax rate reductions.\n  It is logical to assume that a lower tax rate on capital lowers the \ncost of capital. This clearly benefits the economy. As a consequence \nthe Federal Government will realize greater income, payroll, and excise \ntaxes. In addition, State and local tax revenues will also rise.\n  Admittedly, all of this is difficult to measure. However, I would \nlike to see some attempt made to include these factors in revenue \nmodels.\n  At a minimum they should always be appended to the official revenue \nestimates. This would give Congress a more complete picture of the \nimpact of tax changes on revenues.\n  Mr. President, I will note that a recent addition to the rules of the \nHouse permits the Joint Committee on Taxation to append dynamic \nestimates to tax legislation when requested to do so by the Chairman of \nthe Ways and Means Committee.\n  This dynamic estimate is to reflect the anticipated macroeconomic \neffects\n\n[[Page S7920]]\n\nof tax legislation, and is to be used solely for informational \npurposes.\n  It is time for Congress to build on this process. Dynamic estimates \nshould be routinely requested in both the House and Senate.\n  Congress should also make greater use of the work of a multitude of \neconomists. I would note for example that in 1997 the Joint Economic \nCommittee published a study by two Florida State University economics \nprofessors; James Gwartney and Randall Holcombe that argued that the \noptimal capital gains rate is 15 percent or less.\n  These economists predicted accurately prior to last year's rate cut \nthat a reduction in the rate would increase revenues.\n  While improvements in the revenue estimating process are certainly \ndesirable, the fact remains that estimates are just ``estimates'', and \nCongress should recognize that those estimates will often turn out to \nbe way off the mark.\n  That is why Congress should place greater emphasis on the impact that \nchanges in the taxation will have on the private economy, and less \nemphasis on projections of government revenue.\n  Economic growth, job creation, and international competitiveness \nshould be our focus.\n  Mr. President, when it comes to capital gains taxes I suggest that \nCongress spend less time gazing into the crystal ball of revenue \nforecasting, and more time focusing on the real world impact of taxes \non capital formation, job creation, and economic growth.\n  I think it will then be abundantly clear that we should continue to \nreduce the tax on capital to 14 percent. This will continue the good \nwork that we began last year.\n  Mr. President, the U.S. level of tax on capital has been among the \nhighest in the world, I am dedicated to seeing that it becomes one of \nthe lowest in the world.\n  A low rate of tax will encourage capital investment, economic growth \nand job creation.\n  This is no time for the United States to sit on its lead; we must \ncontinue to ensure that America is the premier location in the world to \ndo business.\n  A low capital gains tax will help our economy, but it will also help \nAmerica's families by reducing their tax burden.\n  I look forward to working with Majority Leader Lott and with Speaker \nGingrich as we continue to cut the rate of taxation on capital gains.\n  I yield the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there has been some discussion in the \npress of late concerning a ruling in Federal District Court of the \nSouthern District of New York involving a business coalition in \nManhattan called the Grand Central Partnership. In this case, Archie v. \nGrand Central Partnership, Inc. (1998 WL 122589, 1998 U.S. Dist. Lexis \n3599, S.D.N.Y. 1998), the judge agreed with the plaintiffs who had \nbrought suit against the partnership demanding to be paid at minimum \nwage rates pursuant to the provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act \nand the New York State Minimum Wage Act. The language of the decision \nreads as follows:\n\n       Despite the attractive nature of the defendants' program in \n     serving the needs of the homeless, the question of whether \n     such a program should be exempted from the minimum wage laws \n     is a policy decision either Congress or the Executive Branch \n     should make. . . . The Court, however, cannot grant an \n     exemption where one does not exist in law.\n\n  Setting aside any personal bias, the judge ruled solely on the basis \nof law.\n  In Bartlett v. New York State Board of Law Examiners (970 F. Supp. \n1094, S.D.N.Y. 1997), this same judge ruled in favor of one Marilyn \nBartlett, an applicant with a learning disability similar to dyslexia, \nwho sought admission to the State bar. The Board of Law Examiners had \ndenied Bartlett's special accommodation--in this case, an extension of \ntime limitations in which to take the bar examination. The judge found \nthat the Americans With Disabilities Act clearly required the board to \nprovide the accommodation. Again, this decision was made--as it ought \nto have been made--on the basis of law. Nothing more.\n  The district court judge in both of these matters was the Honorable \nSonia Sotomayor of the Southern District of New York, who now seeks \nconfirmation from this body for appointment to the Second Circuit of \nthe United States Court of Appeals.\n  May I take just a moment to thank the distinguished chairman, Senator \nHatch, and ranking member, Senator Leahy, and the members of the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  With confirmation earlier this year of Robert Sack, Chester Straub, \nand Rosemary Pooler, the judicial emergency in the Second Circuit \ndeclared by Chief Judge Ralph K. Winter on March 23 will soon be over.\n  It will be over, Mr. President, when Judge Sotomayor is confirmed by \nthe Senate. She has been reported by the Judiciary Committee.\n  A little over one year ago, President Clinton nominated Judge \nSotomayor to fill a vacancy on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. The \nCommittee on the Judiciary held a hearing on September 30, 1997 and she \nwas reported out by a vote of 16 to 2 on March 5 of this year.\n  Seven years ago, in March 1991, it was my honor to recommend Sonia \nSotomayor to serve on the Southern District Court of New York. \nPresident Bush placed her name in nomination shortly thereafter and she \nwas sworn in on October 2, 1992.\n  The distinguished members of the Committee on the Judiciary were \nsurely impressed with the background and accomplishments of this \nextraordinary woman. Sonia Sotomayor was raised in the projects of the \nSouth Bronx. Her father, Juan Luis, worked in a tool and die factory \nwhile her mother, Celina, worked as a nurse. Through discipline and \nhard work she was graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University \nin 1976, receiving the university's highest distinction, the M. Taylor \nPyne Honor Prize. She went on to graduate from Yale Law School in 1979 \nwhere she served as editor of the Yale Law Journal.\n  After law school, Ms. Sotomayor joined the New York County District \nAttorney's office. After more than five years there she moved to the \nfirm of Pavia & Harcourt, attaining the position of partner. She is a \nformer member of the New York City Campaign Finance Board and the New \nYork State Mortgage Agency. All of these achievements are detailed in \nMs. Sotomayor's resume which I ask, without objection, be incorporated \ninto my remarks.\n  Her service on the Southern District Court has been exemplary. In \n5\\1/2\\ years, having presided over 500 cases, she has been overturned \nonly six times. Her decisions are scholarly, well-researched, and well-\nreasoned. She has presided over cases of enormous complexity with skill \nand confidence.\n  My colleagues will likely recall that it was Judge Sotomayor who put \nan end to the baseball strike in 1995. Her ruling in Silverman v. Major \nLeague Baseball Player Relations Committee, Inc., 880 F. Supp. 246 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1995) was upheld by the very court she now seeks to join.\n  During the course of her confirmation hearing before the Judiciary \nCommittee, some questions were introduced regarding Judge Sotomayor's \nposition on mandatory sentencing and Federal sentencing guidelines. As \nof October 1997, in the 217 criminal cases over which she presided, she \ndeparted downward a total of 58 times. Forty-four of those departures \nwere at the Government's specific request, because of the defendant's \nsubstantial assistance. Excluding such departures, the Judge has \ndeparted downward in only 6.5 percent of her criminal cases. The judge \nhas upwardly departed in 6 of her 217 criminal cases, an average of 2.7 \npercent.\n  A recent New York Law Journal article reports on the 1996 sentencing \npractices of Federal district judges. Comparing Judge Sotomayor's \nsentencing record to these statistics, it is apparent that Judge \nSotomayor is more conservative in sentencing than many of her \ncolleagues on the Federal bench.\n\n[[Page S7921]]\n\nHer 6.5 percent downward departure rate is below the national average \nof 10.3 percent, and well below the Second Circuit average of 15.2 \npercent. Her upward departure rate of 2.7 percent is three times the \nnational average of 0.9 percent.\n  Mr. President, we have before us a candidate who embodies all of the \nfinest qualities we could possibly ask for in a Federal judge. She is \nbrilliant, principled and thoughtful. I can see no reason to prolong \nthe process that will lead to her confirmation any further. Surely the \ntime has come for us to act.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BREAUX addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/10/senate-section/article/S7920-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7921-S7922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   MEDICARE COMMISSION FIELD HEARINGS\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I take this time on the floor to inform my \ncolleagues, and others who may have an interest in the fact, that the \nMedicare Commission will be having a field hearing on Monday coming \noutside of Washington in Minneapolis, MN.\n  As always, it is the intention of myself as chairman of the Medicare \nCommission, along with my colleague from the House, Bill Thomas, and \nall of the commission members, that we need to get as much information \nfrom outside of Washington about the Medicare problem as we possibly \ncan.\n  This effort in bringing the commission to the city of Minneapolis, \nMN, on Monday for a rather very, very full agenda of activities in \nMinneapolis relating to Medicare is to give all of us an opportunity to \ngather information, which will be extremely important in helping us \nmake the very difficult but extremely important recommendations that we \nare required by Congress to make to the President, and also to the \nCongress by March 1st of this coming year.\n  Our hearing will consist of a site visit in the morning where \ncommissioners will choose from one of four sites, three of which will \nhave the direct interaction with Medicare beneficiaries. I would like \nto cover some of the sites that we will be visiting so people will know \nexactly what this commission is going to be doing.\n  We will have a chance to visit the Wilder Senior Services Clinic, \nwhich is a Minnesota Senior Health Options Clinic, which is really a \ndemonstration program now being run by the Minnesota Department of \nHuman Services. It serves seniors who find themselves in the unique \nposition of being eligible for Medicare, and also being eligible for \nMedicaid at the same time. These people are so-called dual \nbeneficiaries who can get their health coverage from two separate \nprograms. And how this particular operation is handling it is something \nthat I think we can benefit from seeing.\n  The second site visit that we are going to take the commission to is \na Fairview University Medicare Center, the Mayo Clinic, the world \nfamous medical institution in Minneapolis, where our commissioners will \nhave the opportunity to really tour an integrated care clinical site \nand observe telemedicine demonstrations with the Mayo Clinic in a rural \nfacility outside of the city, and also a visit with providers and \nbeneficiaries and also administrators.\n  Third, the commissioners will be able to also visit Medtronic, which \ndevelops and manufacturers medical devices to treat cardiovascular and \nneurological disorders.\n  The idea is to tour these facilities to look at the impact that new \ntechnology, of which the United States is a world leader in producing, \nhas on the future of Medicare.\n  Clearly, as we are able to produce more sophisticated equipment \nfacilities to treat health care beneficiaries in this country, it is \ngoing to have a direct effect on the Medicare Program, and hopefully \nfor the better.\n  The final site visit opportunity we will be taking is the United \nHealth Care Research Center, an Institute for Health Care Quality, \nwhere we will tour their facilities and learn about how United Health \nCare gathers and analyzes patient data to evaluate medical outcomes and \ncost-effectiveness as a treatment.\n  It is very important that we study how various forms of health care \naffect outcomes, both from a health standpoint, as well as from a cost \nstandpoint.\n  Then, beginning at noon at the Minneapolis Convention Center, our \ncommissioners will then hear from people who will make presentations to \nour committee in the form of three panels.\n  The first panel we will hear from is the Buyers Health Care Action \nGroup, which is interestingly a coalition of 27 large, Twin-Cities-\nbased self-insured employers--companies like 3M, General Mills, and \nHoneywell.\n  This panel hopefully will give the commission an opportunity to hear \nfrom private companies regarding how they purchase health care for \ntheir employees and what the result has been for their employees, as \nwell as what the results have been for their companies.\n  The second panel will be a panel of managed care plans to talk about \ntheir experience in the managed care market in Minneapolis, which has \nhad managed care around longer than most places in the country.\n  With the debate on Medicare both in the Congress and in the public in \ngeneral I think it is important that we look at some of them and try to \nunderstand better how they are working in providing quality health care \nand reduced costs for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  The third and last panel we will hear from is current and future \nbeneficiaries on information that they need and use in making health \ncare decisions. It is really important with the new proposal coming out \nof the Health Care Financing Authority, HCFA, coming October 1st. \nMedicare is not going to be like it used to be. People who are Medicare \nbeneficiaries are going to get some choice options. They are going to \nhave different decisions to make about whether they want to go into \nmanaged care.\n  It is very important for seniors and their families to understand \nthat grandma, grandpa, mom, dad, and others are going to have to make \nsome different decisions about their health care. While this can be a \nlittle bit frightening, I think we should look upon it as a real \nopportunity to give them more choice and ultimately better services \nthan they currently get under Medicare.\n  We can be very proud of what Medicare has done. Medicare is not that \ngreat a plan in the 1990s. It doesn't provide eyeglass coverage; it \ndoesn't provide prescription drugs; it doesn't provide long-term health \ncare. Most beneficiaries think it is a wonderful program, and, indeed, \nit is. But it is not nearly as good as most health plans in the country \ntoday that are private plans which provide generally a lot more \nbenefits to the beneficiaries than Medicare does.\n  So we are going to be looking at how people get their information and \nwhat information they need in order to make these choices.\n  The rest of the afternoon is going to be devoted to public interest, \nto really have the commission sit and listen to Mr. and Mrs. America \nand tell us what they would like to see in Medicare for the future.\n  We have 2 hours set aside for audience participation. We call this \nsession a ``Call for Solutions'' where we have invited ordinary \ncitizens from the Minnesota region and area to submit their ideas and \nrecommendations for improving Medicare.\n  In addition to the field hearing that we will be having in \nMinneapolis, we will also be continuing to explore other ways to get \ninput from the public. We don't have to visit every city and every \nState and every county in America to hear from America. In this \ncentury, as we move to the 21st century, we are going to be making use \nof teleconferencing, video conferencing. Commission meetings that we \nhave had so far have been covered in full by C-SPAN. We have a national \nweb site. We have had 13 commission and task force meetings since March \n6th, all of which have been open to the public for their information.\n  I think we have a very ambitious schedule, as I have just outlined, \nfor the Monday field hearings in Minneapolis.\n  I urge my colleagues to continue to be mindful of what we are \nattempting to do. If they have suggestions, we are open to receiving \nthose suggestions. Hopefully, we will have their participation as we \ndraft recommendations for the full Congress and for the President,\n\n[[Page S7922]]\n\nso we can make the reforms necessary to preserve, protect, and even, \nindeed, improve Medicare for future generations.\n\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and make a point of order \na quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/10/senate-section/article/S7921-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7922-S7923]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             VERBAL LITTER\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, much has been said about the so-called \n``lost art'' of writing. The ubiquity of telephones and, more recently, \nelectronic mail, or ``cyber-chat,'' as well as the acceptability of \nalternative presentations in lieu of written essays in schools, can all \nbe cited as contributors to the growing inability of many people to \ncompose and edit well-organized and effective written documents. E-\nmail, which is daily becoming more and more common, a common method for \ncommunicating, is an easy, instant way to get a message out, but the \nvery quickness of the transmit inhibits the kind of thoughtful \nconsideration of the message and care in editing that are the hallmarks \nof good letters and great literature.\n  Someone has said that letters are our personal ambassadors. We \npoliticians need to be very much aware of that. Letters are our \npersonal ambassadors. And the trend toward relying more and more \nexclusively on e-mail means that the future's historical archives will \nbecome littered with broken sentence fragments, incomplete thoughts, \nand embarrassingly ignorant spelling. Think about it. Mr. President, \ncan you imagine the Federalist essays by Jay, Madison, and Hamilton--\ncan you imagine those Federalist essays, had they been typed in such a \nstream-of-consciousness manner and then spewed across the fiber optic \nweb the way some messages are nowadays?\n  I am sure that Hamilton, Madison, and Jay, the authors of the \nFederalist Papers, did not speak as cogently and fluidly as they wrote. \nPerhaps nobody does, or very few persons do. But they were no slouches \nat the speaker's rostrum. I doubt that they would have been very good \non television. I have thought about that a good many times, and \nwondered how Daniel Webster or Henry Clay or John C. Calhoun would have \ncome across on television. How would they do on 20-second sound bites? \nThey would do as poorly as Robert C. Byrd, I would anticipate.\n  As Francis Bacon observed, ``Reading maketh a full man; conference a \nready man; and writing an exact man.'' Think about that also. That is \nvery true. ``Reading maketh a full man; conference a ready man; and \nwriting an exact man.'' And so we write more exactly than we speak.\n  These Founding Fathers were certainly well read and they were good \nwriters and, therefore, very knowledgeable and exact, precise, weighing \nevery word.\n  When we speak of infrastructure, such as reservoirs and dams, we talk \nabout the Army engineers. When we seek their recommendations about a \nparticular dam or reservoir, they will give us advice, and it will \nreflect the B-C ratio, the benefit-cost ratio. Anything that is \nrecommended by the Army engineers would have to have at least $1 in \nbenefits for every $1 in costs. That is the benefit-cost ratio.\n  Therefore, in speaking of the Founding Fathers, which is a term that \nneeds to be examined--``Founding Fathers''--and especially those who \nwrote the Federalist essays, I think in terms of the benefit-cost \nratio. They made every word count. Every word carried its full weight. \nIt had a proper place in the construction of the essay. It wasn't used \nlightly. It was used thoughtfully. So there was the B-C ratio.\n  Well, that is just a little idea of mine. But these men were \nknowledgeable, they were exact, and their writing was enhanced by their \nthoughtfulness, and, in turn, their speaking ability was enhanced by \ntheir writing, especially in the case of Daniel Webster.\n  When Webster made a speech, when he spoke on January 26 and January \n27, 1830, in his debate with Hayne--schoolboys all across the Nation, \nit used to be, were required to memorize some of Webster's speeches. I \ndon't guess they are required to memorize those speeches anymore. As a \nmatter of fact, memorization is not looked upon as being very \nbeneficial or helpful in some schools, I suppose. Times have changed.\n  But Webster was a good writer, and he memorized the speeches, many of \nthem. Then he took them home, took them to his boarding house near the \nCapitol Building, and kept them for a few days, edited them, changed \nthem, for the purposes of publication. Therefore, they were not exactly \nthe speeches that we schoolboys memorized, they were not the exact \nspeeches that Webster gave before the Senate. They were improved upon, \njust as we edit our own speeches. But we don't take them home. We don't \ntake them to our boarding houses and keep them out several days. We \nedit them the same day. Many Senators probably have their staffs edit \ntheir remarks. But Webster, in doing so, had in mind exactly what Bacon \nreferred to: ``Writing maketh an exact man.''\n  I said that the term ``Founding Fathers'' needed a little \nexamination. Who were the Founding Fathers? Were they the signers of \nthe Declaration of Independence? Were they the Framers of the \nConstitution? Were they the Framers of the first American Constitution, \nthe Constitution under the Articles of Confederation? Were they the \nsigners of the second Constitution, the Constitution of 1787?\n  In those days, women did not participate in the conventions--but \nwould the Founding Fathers also not include those individuals who met \nin the various State conventions to ratify the Constitution? Would they \nnot include the writers of the Declaration of Independence? Would they \nnot include the Members of the Congress under the Articles of \nConfederation? They surely debated much that went into the second \nConstitution. Would they not include the legislatures of the States \nthat then existed?\n  So when we talk about the Founding Fathers, many people associate \nthat term only with the framers of the second American Constitution. \nAnd certainly the framers were Founding Fathers, but not all the \nFounding Fathers, I am saying, not all the Founding Fathers were \nframers of the Constitution. So there is a little difference. It isn't \na serious matter by any means, and I am not taking issue with anyone, \nbut I have thought about that term.\n\n  It is hard to imagine that their spoken words could possibly be \nundercut by any of the all too common fillers that plague common \nconversation today, those ``ums'' and ``uhs'' and ``likes,'' and \nespecially that inanity of inanities, ``you know.'' That is the most \nuseless phrase. That is pure deadwood. It doesn't carry its weight in a \nspeech, ``you know.''\n  Any time one turns on a television--which I don't do very often; \nperhaps that is why I have a lot of old ideas--he will hear a string of \n``you knows'' from the anchormen and women, ``you know.''\n  What does it mean, ``you know''? What do I know? You know? That is \ntaking advantage of the other person when you say, ``You know.'' ``You \nknow.'' How silly, how useless a phrase. That certainly would not carry \nits weight under the B-C ratio--the benefit-cost ratio--that inanity of \ninanities; that inanity of inanities, ``you know.''\n  Oh, how I hate that pernicious phrase, ``you know.'' This is simply a \nfiller. The tongue is operating in overdrive and the brain is somewhat \nbehind the tongue, ``you know.''\n  We are told by Plutarch that--well, I am providing a rather good \nexample of what Plutarch was saying. He said that Alcibiades was the \ngreatest orator of his time.\n  Plutarch wrote that Demosthenes said that Alcibiades was the greatest \nspeaker of his time and that when he came to a place in his oration and \nwas having difficulty remembering the exact word, he paused--he \npaused--he simply paused until the right word came. He did not fill the \ngap with ``you knows'' or ``ahs,'' ``uhs,'' or ``ums,'' and so on. He \nsimply waited until the right word came.\n  Try it sometime. Record your own remarks. See if you are using that\n\n[[Page S7923]]\n\nphrase. Our remarks are awash in ``you knows.'' And they are uttered \nall around us by people who are unaware of how they are filling the \ntime between words when the mind is still struggling to complete the \nthought. They are filling the time with that inanity of inanities--\n``you know.''\n  Speaking now as a listener, I contend there is almost nothing more \nirritating and distracting than suffering through countless ``you \nknows'' while trying desperately to discern what message the speaker is \nattempting--vainly--to convey.\n  If I were teaching a class, that would be one of the things I would \ncome down very hard on. I know that most people have no idea that their \nspeech is packed chock-full of ``you knows,'' and it just becomes a \nhabit. And if one listens to it very much, he will fall victim to the \nsame bad habit. For the first thing he knows, he will find that his \nremarks are being filled with ``you knows.'' And these are sometimes \nstrung together in staccato multiples: ``you know, you know, you \nknow?'' It is simply filler--meaningless--sound to fill dead air while \nthe speaker's unprepared brain hunts down the sentence's conclusion.\n  Perhaps it is because Americans are such creatures of the television \nage, used to actors, or those who think they are actors, news \nbroadcasters, even politicians, reading seamlessly from scripts, cue \ncards, and teleprompters. We are not used to hearing pauses of any \nlength so we unconsciously try not to allow even a few seconds of \nquietude to fill the air.\n  We have become unused to true public speaking and debate in which \ninformed individuals prepared their minds with facts and arguments, \nlistened to each other, and retorted and rebutted extemporaneously. \nSuch debate demands close attention and even, shockingly, moments of \nsilent, deliberate thought while a rejoinder is mentally composed.\n  I never hear the senior Senator from New York, Mr. Moynihan, using \nthat phrase. I have noticed that he pauses from time to time, but he \ndoes not use the phrase ``you know.'' I think of him as a fine example \nof a teacher at whose feet I would be honored to sit.\n  These small pauses, like the quick closing and opening of the stage \ncurtains between acts, allow the speaker to savor the argument he has \nlaid out, while his opponent prepares a clever and pointed rebuttal. \nFew can do that anymore, even those so-called professional debaters--\nthe talking heads of media and politicians. If the response is quick, \nit is quite likely to be a prepared, canned, one-liner sound bite which \nsells the sender's message regardless of whether or not it is \ncompletely pertinent.\n  It is possible to expunge ``you knows'' from public discourse. I have \nseen it done by conscientious individuals, as I indicated a little \nearlier, but it is no easy task. Like poison ivy, ``you knows'' are \npernicious and persistent. It takes strong medicine to kill back that \nlush growth, and diligent weeding to keep opportunistic tendrils from \ncreeping back into common use. To rid one's speech of ``you know,'' one \nmust first learn to listen to himself or to herself. One must learn to \ntrain himself to recognize that he uses ``you know'' or other \ndistracting filler words. As a test, ask someone to tape you or to \ncount the ``you knows.''\n  Various members of my staff, as and when and if they hear another \nstaff person saying ``you know,'' they point their finger immediately \nat that person. And in that way they help to break the habit. I think \nmany people will be unpleasantly surprised at the results of such a \ntest. Then enlist these same friends to alert you when an unconscious \n``you know'' pops out. They will enjoy that part of the task. And then \nwork at it, work at it, work at it. The more you do, the more you will \nnotice just how often you use such needless and asinine fill-ins. Weed \nthem out of your speech, and you will increase your reputation as a \ngood speaker and a thoughtful person. There is a common saying to the \neffect that ``I would rather be silent and be thought a fool, than to \nopen my mouth and prove it.'' Speech peppered with ``you knows'' has \nmuch the same effect.\n\n  As I have observed already, Alcybides was noted for his practice of \nsimply pausing silently when the chosen word momentarily escaped his \nmind's ability to marshal and bring it safely to his lips. Then, when \nhe could continue, he simply resumed speaking. And he was the finest \norator of his time. Clearly, a moment of silence is preferable to ``you \nknow.'' Think of it: ``Four score and, like, seven years ago, you know, \nour Forefathers, uh, brought forth, you know, upon this continent, you \nknow, a new nation, you know, conceived in, uh, liberty, and, you know, \nyou know, dedicated to the proposition that, uh, uh, like, all men are \ncreated, like, equal.'' With that kind of delivery, President Abraham \nLincoln could not have stoked the nation's determination to see the \nCivil War through to its conclusion. Or let's imagine Martin Luther \nKing: ``I, uh, have a dream, you know.'' Not a very stirring message \nwhen it is lost in the verbal litter.\n  Ridding your speech of such verbal trash may not make an individual a \nleader of nations or of men--that requires great thoughts as well as a \nclear and stirring delivery--but leaving them in can surely blight the \npath to greatness, you know.\n  Mr. President, I have some remarks on another matter, but I see the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts, my friend, my true \nfriend, Senator Kennedy is on the floor. I am going to ask if he wishes \nto speak at this time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator for his typical kindness. I would be \nglad to make my remarks after my good friend from West Virginia. It is \nalways a pleasure to listen to him at any time, but particularly on a \nFriday when I can give full attention to his eloquence.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kennedy. As I have remarked \nbefore, and I shall say again, he is one who would have appropriately \ngraced a seat at the Constitutional Convention in 1787. I can see him \nworking in that audience on the floor and off the floor, arguing \nforcefully and passionately, and advocating his position on a matter \nand doing it well.\n  So I will proceed. I will try to be brief, more so this time than \nother occasions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/10/senate-section/article/S7922-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7923-S7924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  BRIGHT SPOTS BRING HOPE TO EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have recently drawn much attention to the \nresults of the Third International Mathematics and Science Study, \nreleased in February of this year. My visceral, my visceral reaction to \nthe poor scores of high school seniors on the mathematics and science \nportions of this exam was one of great dismay and disbelief. How could \nUnited States students be performing so poorly given the massive \namounts of money invested each year in our nation's education system?\n  My spirits have since been lifted in the past month when hearing \nabout the progress that my own home state of West Virginia is making on \nthe education front. In my years as a United States Senator, my state \nhas been scoffed at more times than I can remember, or want to \nremember. Well, today, I come to the floor to boast a little bit about \nwhat we are accomplishing back in the mountains and foothills of West \nVirginia.\n  For the second time in a row, West Virginia has posted the highest \neducation marks of any state in the ``Quality Counts'' report released \nannually by Education Week magazine. West Virginia has tied only with \nConnecticut for top honors in the study, which grades states on \nstandards and assessments, quality of teaching, school climate, and \nadequacy, equity, and allocation of resources. In achievement, no \ngrades were granted but states were ranked by the percentage of \nstudents who scored at or above the proficient level in mathematics and \nscience on the 1996 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). \nSeven states, including West Virginia, made significant gains in the \npercentage of fourth graders who scored at the proficient level or \nabove on the 1996 mathematics test. What is even more striking about \nthese scores is the fact that West Virginia ranks forty-ninth in per \ncapita income and family income, an economic statistic which is often \ncorrelated with lower student achievement.\n  Earlier this year, West Virginia was recognized as a national model \nin geography education by the National Geographic Society. National \nGeographic\n\n[[Page S7924]]\n\nChairman Gilbert Grosvenor commended the state as ``one of the best \nexamples in the country of putting essential geography into a statewide \nsystem.'' The Fordham Foundation, a private organization committed to \nquality-based reform of elementary and secondary education, conducted a \nrecent study evaluating different geography standards used by states in \nsetting their academic curricula. West Virginia was one of only six \nstates that received honor grades for adopting excellent standards for \ngeography that are clear, specific, comprehensive, and rigorous.\n  Good students and teachers are an integral component of getting ahead \nin education.\n  West Virginia could not have made the progress in education that it \nhas made in the past few years without solid homes, ambitious students, \nand good teachers. The whole process depends, in great measure, on \nquality teachers, since even the most driven and ambitious students can \nfalter at the hands of an unqualified, incompetent teacher. Just \nrecently, Susan Lee Barrett of Nicholas County, WV, was named as the \nWest Virginia Teacher of the Year. Ms. Barrett is a teacher at the \nCherry River Elementary School. She was selected based on her \nleadership in education reform. I hope that many other teachers in West \nVirginia and around the Nation will emulate the ambition and dedication \nto her chosen field that Ms. Barrett has so evidently displayed.\n  I also take great pleasure in learning of the headway West Virginia \nis making as a leader in education. Over the past few months, my office \nhas been inundated with positive news about many West Virginia schools \nand students. These bright spots deserve recognition for their efforts \nand innovation. As Plato wrote in his day, ``Excellent things are \nrare.'' How true that is. Excellence is something that we all can \nrecognize--the Nobel Prize or a play by Shakespeare or Aeschylus or \nEuripides or Sophocles; however, it is not something that most of us \nsee or experience on an everyday basis. For that reason, excellence \nshould be acknowledged and it ought to be rewarded.\n  The Department of Education recently announced the selection of the \n1998 national blue ribbon schools, which are recognized for strong \nleadership, high-quality teaching, up-to-date curriculum, policies, and \npractices. In West Virginia, Weir High School, which is in the northern \npanhandle of West Virginia, and Weir Middle School, both of Weirton, \nWV, were named for this award. Weir High School is unique for its \nactive role in preparing students to meet the demands of today's high-\ntech society. With increased global competition and industry \ndownsizing, Weir High School provides its students with many important \nresources, including a computerized library resource directory, \nInternet accessibility, satellite television access, computer-assisted \ndrafting, laser disc technology, and electronic research. Weir High \nSchool students are making great strides as a result of such \nunprecedented use of technology, and I commend the school and its able \nfaculty for its leadership in that area. When I went to school, we \nnever heard of such things. We not only didn't have access to it, we \nnever even heard of it.\n  In addition to an educational technology focus, Weir High School \nshould be extremely proud of its veteran teaching staff--a staff that \ndemonstrates an unparalleled level of commitment and dedication. That \nis what it requires: dedication and commitment. Among its faculty \nmembers, the school boasts of a Tandy finalist, Ashland Teacher of the \nYear, West Virginia Math Teacher of the Year, West Virginia Biology \nTeacher of the Year--think of that--several Hancock County Teachers of \nthe Year, Who's Who Among American High School Teachers, and West \nVirginia Governor's Honor Academy Favorite Educators.\n  Following in the footsteps of its neighboring high school, Weir \nMiddle School has made great progress in technology, curriculum, \nNational and State test scores, community involvement, student \nenvironment, and meeting State and National education goals for all \nstudents. The school motto, ``An Open Door to New Beginnings,'' is \nobserved and followed daily. Accordingly, Weir Middle School recently \nintroduced a new program, WEIR, We Encourage Individual Responsibility, \nto encompass total staff and student involvement in promoting learning \nand the teaching of standards.\n\n  West Virginia, with stars shining across its educational firmament, \nis home to many other schools producing excellent students. To name a \nfew, Kiley Anne Berry, a sophomore at East Fairmont State College, in \nthe northern portion of the State, is 1 of 20 distinguished students \nselected from across the Nation--not just across West Virginia, but \nacross the Nation--to participate in an international Youth Science \nFestival in Seoul, Korea. Heather Wilson, an eight-year-old from \nJefferson County, in West Virginia's eastern panhandle, was selected \nearlier this year as a National Runner-Up in the Reading is Fundamental \n1998 National Reading Celebration, an annual reading program \nchallenging students to meet or exceed an age-based reading goal. \nSeveral students at Clay County High School of Clay, WV, were \ndistinguished in the ``We the People . . . the Citizen and the \nConstitution'' national finals. More than 250 other West Virginia \nstudents in grades five through eight were honored for their \nexceptional academic talents as part of the Johns Hopkins University \nTalent Search. And the list goes on.\n  I could spend several more minutes, or even hours, talking about \ndistinguished West Virginia students and West Virginia schools, and \neducation in general. I will, however, conclude now. But I urge all \nschools, teachers, and students, nationwide and in my State of West \nVirginia, to follow these pacesetters--pacesetters. Our education \nsystem in the United States is ailing and we need to get back on track. \nThese schools and students that I have talked about today are \nsucceeding, and I encourage others to keep pace and emulate this \nprogress.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the popular \nissue of health care quality. You can't mention health care without \npulling on everyone's heartstrings. While several of the measures in \nboth the House and the Senate have been pitched as being essential to \nenhancing the quality of care Americans receive, I hope that my \ncolleagues will carefully evaluate the impact that any Federal one-\nsize-fits-all mandate would have on our Nation's health care system.\n  Health care is as personal as it gets. More importantly, though, our \ndecisions must not be tainted by simple anecdotes. This is not a one-\nline sound bite issue. Like any Member of this body, I believe that \nAmerica's health care providers are the best in the world, and I \nbelieve that our health care system is the most technologically \nadvanced in the world--the most technologically advanced in the world. \nPerhaps we don't hear that enough. The reason for that could be that \nthis issue is being used by some folks as a political ad campaign, \ndwelling entirely on the negatives and failing to illustrate any \npositives. That is not rational, that is not fair. People are prone to \nbelieve something if they hear it enough, even if it isn't true. \nRepetition doesn't right a wrong, although repetition may lead a person \nto think a wrong is right.\n  While watching this debate unfold, I have seen people wield surveys \nand polls around this body like they were weapons of mass destruction. \nIt stands to reason that if you want to make a bill popular, back it up \nwith a survey or a poll. Why? Because you can always get the answer you \nwant by the way you word the questions.\n  Legislating our Nation's health care system in such a fashion is like \ntrying to cross a chasm in two jumps. It is detrimental to everyone's \nhealth.\n  I will, however, illustrate how unreliable survey and poll results \nhave been in relation to various health care quality provisions. For \ninstance, in May, a Democratic polling firm showed that 86 percent of \nthose questioned supported the Patient Access to Responsible Care Act \nor PARCA bill. In the same month, a Republican poll found that more \nthan 90 percent of those questioned favored\n\n[[Page S7925]]\n\nfederal legislation to guarantee protections such as full information \nabout their conditions and treatment options, a list of benefits and \ncosts, as well as access to specialists.\n  But when folks were asked how they feel about their own health plan, \nan April survey by the Employee Benefit Research Institute showed that \n53 percent of respondents were extremely or very satisfied with their \nhealth plan. And in a November 1997 Kaiser/Harvard survey, 66 percent \nof Americans in managed care plans said they would give their own \nhealth plan a grade of A or B. Such mixed results are more reason to \napproach any debate of federal mandates with the greatest degree of \ncaution.\n  What would the polls show if people were asked about additional \ncosts? What would the polls show if changes could eliminate being able \nto see a doctor at all?\n  I will talk in a minute about the frontier, the rural, aspects of \nthat.\n  Yes, another factor that has produced mixed results is the cost of \neach of these bills. I've seen estimates for a number of pending bills \nthat could raise the price of premiums by at least 2.7 percent all the \nway up to 23 percent. Why aren't the people being polled about that? I \ndon't believe that you can get quality out of any bill that forces \npeople not to purchase insurance. We'd essentially be driving people \naway from coverage, not toward coverage. This is why cost estimates for \nthe different proposals are vital. But with mixed results like this, \nI'm not about to assume that my constituents--who budget their incomes \non a day to day basis--will swallow any additional price increases that \nfederal mandates could create.\n  We are always asked that we not judge a book by its cover. Well, \ndon't judge a bill by its title. The devil is in the details. Or, as we \naccountants like to say, the numbers should make us nervous, or the \nnumbers should show the nightmare.\n  Aside from the morass of misleading information pertaining to this \nissue, I also have serious reservations about any legislation that \nwould dismantle traditional state regulation of the health insurance \nindustry. While serving in the Wyoming State Legislature for 10 years, \nI gained tremendous respect for our state insurance commissioner's \nability to administer quality guidelines that cater to the unique type \nof care found in Wyoming. That is critical. I firmly believe that \ndecisions which impact my constituent's health insurance should \ncontinue to be made in Cheyenne--not Washington.\n  I cannot emphasize how important it is to consider demographics when \ndebating health care. Wyoming has 465,000 residents living within \n97,000 square miles. That is living in a State that is 500 miles on a \nborder. We are one of those square States that couldn't exist if \nsomebody hadn't invented the square. There are 99,000 square miles with \nonly 465,000 residents. The State has an average elevation exceeding \n4,000 feet. We have high altitude and low multitude.\n\n  Most communities have a higher altitude than population. In fact, if \nyou look at one of the Wyoming roadmaps, you will find a list of about \n150 cities. We call them cities out there. If you look at the \npopulation following the name of the city, you will see that half of \nthem have no population at all. They are a place where the ranchers \ncome to pick up their mail. Even the Postmaster doesn't live in the \ntown where the Post Office is. It is a long way between towns. I live \nin the sixth largest town in the State. It is 135 miles to the next \nbiggest town--135 miles. The town I am from has 22,000 people. The \nbiggest city in Wyoming is 50,006. We don't have that much population. \nWe have a lot of miles. It is tough to get to doctors.\n  It's in those conditions that my constituents have to drive up to 125 \nmiles one-way just to receive basic care. Moreover, we have a tough \nenough time enticing doctors to come to Wyoming, let alone keep them \nthere once their residency is finished. Even more troubling is the \nlimited number of facilities for those doctors to practice medicine in \nWyoming. Let me just say that if you don't have doctors, or facilities \nfor them to practice in, you sure don't have quality health care.\n  We have even talked here about an overabundance of doctors in parts \nof the country. In Wyoming, we wish for that affliction.\n  The majority of bills now pending consideration in the House and \nSenate are primarily geared to overhauling managed health care plans. \nIn a rural, under-served state like Wyoming, managed care plans account \nfor a very small percentage of state-wide health plans and services \ncurrently available. This is partly due to the state's small \npopulation. Managed care plans generally profit from high enrollment, \nand as a result, the majority of plans in Wyoming still remain fee-for-\nservice. In terms of legislation, however, this doesn't make a bit of \ndifference. Many fee-for-service insurers in my state also offer \nmanaged care plans elsewhere. Those costs could be distributed across \nthe board. Is it fair for the federal government to force my \nconstituents to pay for a premium hike that's caused by federal \nmandates on managed care? The availability and cost of care for 465,000 \nrural frontier residents may not mean much to some folks, but it sure \nmeans a great deal to me.\n  Is this a problem that can be fixed from Washington? I certainly \ndon't believe so. People from Wyoming understand that life in our state \nis much different than in California or New York. A one-size-fits-all \npolicy doesn't help states like Wyoming, it only excludes them further \nfrom obtaining the type of care they deserve. I encourage my colleagues \nto look at the fine print when considering legislation in the coming \ndays. You just might agree that getting quality out some of these bills \nis like trying to squeeze blood out of a turnip. And we'll want to \nspend some time talking about whose blood!\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of the \nSenate a rather tragic set of circumstances that has taken place in the \nAzores in the last several hours.\n  Some 1,500 minor aftershocks hit the Azores last night after a strong \nearthquake struck the islands, killing 10 people, with very severe \ndamages to the island of Faial in the Portuguese mid-Atlantic \narchipelago. There are many individuals sleeping out in the open, in \nthe parks, and in their cars, to avoid the risk of being caught inside \nof a building if another quake should strike.\n  The impact of that was 5.8 on the Richter scale, which is a very, \nvery sizable earthquake.\n  As I mentioned, there have been some 1,500 aftershocks. And the \nterror and loss that has struck the people in that island and in that \narchipelago is a great human tragedy. Obviously, the people of the \nUnited States want to reach out to all of those islanders and all of \nthe people and families who have lost loved ones and those who are \nsuffering injury.\n  I know that the United States will do what it can in terms of help \nand assistance to the people and to the Portuguese Government, \nparticularly people on those islands, and we will want to give whatever \nhumanitarian help and assistance that we can.\n  This happened a number of years ago. Some 40 years ago I can remember \nthose circumstances, and I think many of us in Massachusetts who are \nfortunate to have families and friends who have families in the Azores \nand from the island of Faial, know that they are suffering greatly \ntoday, and it is appropriate that we take whatever steps, as a country, \nto help and assist them. In the meantime, our thoughts and prayers are \nwith all the people of the Azores.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/10/senate-section/article/S7925-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7925-S7927]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on another item, I want to just take a \nfew moments to bring the Senate and those who are watching up to date \nabout where we are on our battle for debate and discussion on the issue \nof the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  As we have pointed out, that issue, which is of fundamental \nimportance to the American people, is a rather basic and fundamental \nissue. It comes down to this very simple concept--that medical \ndecisions ought to be made by doctors and patients and not by insurance\n\n[[Page S7926]]\n\nagents, and that too often in America today managed care means \nmismanaged care. We have a responsibility to address the abuses that \nare taking place in our health care system.\n  That is what this whole discussion is really all about. Those of us \nwho believe these issues are important have been denied the opportunity \nto address them. Some of us have introduced and supported legislation \nto address these abuses more than 1\\1/2\\ years ago, and, more recently, \nwe have done so with the excellent bill that our leader has provided, \nSenator Daschle. We are in strong support of it. We have been trying to \nget time to debate that issue here on the floor of the U.S. Senate. We \nwere blocked out of consideration in our committees. We were blocked \nout of consideration of even getting legislation on the calendar. We \nhave been blocked out of consideration here on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate, and we have been resolute in our determination that this issue \nwould be debated and discussed and acted on in this session.\n  We have seen, I think, as of yesterday, a list of so-called \nprinciples from our Republican leadership on their version of a \nPatients' Bill of Rights. I will just take a moment or two to reflect \non their particular principles, and the hollowness of their commitment \nto meaningful rights will be clear.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks their complete document, the Republican Health \nCare Principles.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Let me just go through them very quickly. This is on \npage 1.\n  Republicans believe all consumers have the right to: Receive \naccurate, easy-to-understand information about what their health plans \nprovide, including information about out-of-pocket expenses and \ninformation about health care providers.\n  Then, if you read through the pages of their document and go to the \nlast page, it talks about the information that will not be provided; \nthat is, it lists, for example, that insurance plans will not have to \nprovide information on treatment outcomes. They will not have to \nprovide information on patient satisfaction. They will not need to \nreport on the quality of the care they deliver. It seems to me that \nconsumers ought to understand the satisfaction level of patients in a \nparticular HMO. It seems to me that we should also have an opportunity \nto know the outcomes of various treatments in various insurance plans.\n  So, on the one hand, you see on page 1 various information is going \nto be made available. Then you turn around on page 3 and it lists all \nthe things they are not going to provide, including many of the \nessential elements that every consumer group and every patient group \nand every employer understands are essential if patients and consumers \nare going to be able to make informed judgments on their health care.\n  Now, returning to the Republican leadership's list, it goes on to say \nthat consumers should be able to ``hold their health plans accountable \nthrough a fair and expeditious appeals process.'' That sounds good. \nBut, the word that should have been in there is ``independent.'' \nPatients need an independent appeal process. What does ``a fair and \nexpeditious appeals process'' mean? If they had said it will be \n``independent,'' or to an ``external body review for fair and \nexpeditious appeals''--then we would be on our way toward agreement on \nsomething. But, oh, no, this again refuses to be specific or even \nindicative that patients will have fair-minded, independent, outside \nexternal review and accountability.\n\n  Furthermore, the so-called principles say consumers will be permitted \nto ``communicate openly with their doctors about their treatment \noptions.'' That sounds like we are lifting the gag rules, like this \nlist might include lifting the gag rules that still exist in some HMOs. \nBut, the fact is that most HMOs and insurance plans have the ability to \nfire doctors without cause. And they also have the ability to make \nfinancial arrangements with doctors, and those financial arrangements \ncan be adjusted and changed by the HMO, to discourage provision of \nnecessary medical care. So, while it sounds good to say you are \npromoting open communication, unless you are also going to guarantee \nthat doctors can practice medicine unfettered by the insurance \ncompanies' accountants, you are really not doing very much. It might \nsound good, but in fact it is not doing very much. This is really a \nvery, very weak commitment.\n  Then their list goes on. The consumer should:\n\n       Know that their medical care is based on the best \n     scientific information available, not on political \n     considerations.\n\n  Patients need and deserve the best health care treatment. They are \nnot worried about the political considerations. They are worried about \nthe financial considerations--profit considerations of insurance \ncompanies--that drive medical decisions. Do we understand this? Our \nRepublican colleagues do not even commit in their statement that they \nare going to have the decisions involving health care being made by the \ndoctors on the basis of health considerations. All they say is they \nwill have it ``not on political considerations.'' They don't eliminate \nthe clear, fundamental problem driving this debate, which is that \nhealth treatments are being based on the financial considerations of \nthe insurance companies.\n  The Republican leadership's list continues. Consumers should have:\n\n       Access to their medical records and the right to know that \n     their medical information will be used only to provide better \n     health care.\n\n  This would suggest privacy protections. This is very interesting. \nSenator Leahy, our colleague from Vermont, has been a leader in this \nwhole area. He introduced a bill more than a year ago, which I have \ncosponsored, and we can't get the majority to report out a bill in our \ncommittees, either in the Judiciary or in our Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee, or get the Republican leadership to be willing to schedule \nit on the floor. Here they are, talking about all the kinds of \nguarantees in terms of privacy, but they have historically been \nunwilling to address it in a meaningful way.\n  Mr. President, just before the Fourth of July recess Speaker Gingrich \nissued his principles. The Gingrich plan fails in three very important \nareas. First, it refuses to commit the Republican leadership to HMO \nreform that says that medical decisions will be made on the basis of \nmedical concerns rather than insurance company concerns. Second, it \ndoes not guarantee access to specialists. What person in this Chamber \nwould want to have either his wife or child who had been stricken by \ncancer be denied immediate access to an appropriately qualified \noncologist or pediatric surgeon who can provide the best in terms of \ntreatment? The Gingrich proposal simply does not provide the kind of \nguarantee of specialist access which is critically important for \nprotecting consumers.\n  Third, it does not provide the ultimate protection of accountability. \nThis will be an issue we will debate here. I cannot wait to find out \nhow the Senate is going to vote on the issue of accountability. Just \nlast month, the Senate voted by two-thirds that we were going to still \nhold the tobacco industries accountable for their actions. Are we going \nto reverse that with regards to the insurance companies on health care? \nWhy can't our Republican leadership say, at least on that issue, given \nwhere the Senate has voted on tobacco, that we believe that the \ninsurance industries that are dealing with health care also should not \nbe free from liability? Why? Because the Republican leadership is in \nthe pockets of the special interest groups who fear being held \naccountable for their actions. I would like someone to explain the \ninconsistency of this position, given the recent vote on immunity for \ntobacco companies. How can they oppose holding accountable those whose \nabusive actions can result in immediate injury or death? Who is going \nto look out after that? Mr. President, we want to make sure we are \ngoing to have accountability and that it is going to be an essential \nissue we are going to debate.\n  I call this Senate Republican proposal ``Gingrich Lite.'' Gingrich \nLite. They don't even go as far in the Senate as they went in the House \nof Representatives, which was lacking.\n  Finally, the Republican leadership's principles fail to meet the \nfollowing\n\n[[Page S7927]]\n\nvery basic considerations and protections. I am waiting for Republicans \nto describe why they are opposed to any of these protections. I will \njust mention them again very quickly.\n  Patient information--it is interesting, as we list all of these \nprotections in this particular chart, to note where we got these \nrecommendations from.\n  In each and every case of protections that are guaranteed in the \nPatients' Bill of Rights, they have also been recommended either by the \nPresident's recent quality commission, which was a blue-ribbon non-\npartisan group of experts, or they have been in effect for a number of \nyears under Medicare, or they have been recommended by the States' \ninsurance commissioners, which is a bipartisan group, or it has been \nrecommended by the American Association of Health Plans, which is the \nHMO trade association.\n  If you look down at guarantees that are included in our Patients' \nBill of Rights, you will see that they have been recommended or been in \neffect for a number of years. This is a commonsense--commonsense--\nproposal based upon thoughtful consideration of the types of rights \nthat are currently being guaranteed to many, but not all, Americans.\n  Mr. President, we welcomed the opportunity this week to have the \nmeasure before the Senate. It was there very, very briefly, but quickly \ntaken away by the Republican leadership. No debate. No discussion.\n  This issue is a priority for the American people, and, even though we \nhave only 44 days left in this Congress, we are going to be resolute \nand committed to bringing this issue up so that we in this body are \ngoing to be able to debate these matters on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate and vote to provide patients across the country with meaningful \nprotections.\n  There are 44 days left, Mr. President, in order for us to take \naction--44 days left. Today is July 10. There are 44 days left to \ndebate this issue and to take action, and the American people deserve \naction, and they will receive it, because we are strongly committed to \nit. I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                   Republican Health Care Principles\n\n       Republicans will demand that HMOs play by the rules and \n     provide access to patient-centered care. Many consumers fear \n     that their health care plans will not give them access to \n     care when they need it most, that they will be denied the \n     benefits they've paid for and been promised, and that their \n     health plans care more about cost than they do about quality. \n     These are real fears of unacceptable conditions and HMOs must \n     do better.\n       Republicans believe that all consumers have the right to:\n       Receive accurate, east-to-understand information about what \n     their health plans provide, including information about out-\n     of-pocket expenses and information about health care \n     providers;\n       Receive the benefits they have paid for and been promised;\n       Hold their health plans accountable through a fair and \n     expeditious appeals process;\n       Communicate openly with their doctors about their treatment \n     options;\n       Know that their medical care is based on the best \n     scientific information available, not on political \n     considerations; and\n       Access to their medical records and the right to know that \n     their medical information will be used only to provide better \n     health care.\n       Republicans support expanding health care coverage to more \n     Americans by enhancing its affordability. We will not adopt \n     legislation that will make health insurance more costly or \n     drive businesses--especially small businesses--to drop \n     coverage of their employees. While CBO has not completed its \n     analysis of PARCA or the ``Patients Bill of Rights,'' a 1997 \n     Milliman and Roberts study of PARCA found that the \n     legislation would increase health care premiums by an average \n     of 23 percent. To the average family, that's an annual \n     premium hike of $1,220, or more than $100 per month. That \n     study, significantly, did not take into account the \n     additional costs that would be imposed by the liability \n     provisions.\n       Higher health care costs mean more uninsured people. \n     According to a 1997 study by Lewin, for every 1 percent \n     increase in premiums, 400,000 people lose their health \n     insurance coverage. Congress should not pass legislation that \n     would cause hundreds of thousands and perhaps millions of \n     people to become uninsured.\n       Republicans believe in expanding choice. We will not force \n     every American into an HMO. Extensive new federal \n     requirements included in the so-called Patients Bill of \n     Rights will force all health plans to resemble HMOs. \n     Ironically, many of the bills which claim to expand choice \n     actually would limit choice. Rather than expanding regulation \n     and forcing a ``one-size-fits-all'' approach to health care, \n     Congress should focus efforts on reforming the tax rules \n     which limit and in some cases prohibit consumer's choices.\n       Republicans believe that health resources should be used \n     for patient care, not to pay trial lawyers. Medical \n     malpractice laws have led doctors to practice defensive \n     medicine, making health care more costly without improving \n     patient outcomes. Expanding malpractice liability will \n     exacerbate these problems. Moreover, health plans are likely \n     to micromanage clinical decisions in order to protect \n     themselves against costly lawsuits. Congress should not pass \n     legislation on the assumption that people can sue their way \n     to health care quality.\n       Republicans believe the private sector is more capable of \n     keeping pace with the rapid changes of health care. The \n     government is not the best caretaker of health care quality. \n     Republicans agree with leading physicians such as Dr. Bob \n     Waller of the Mayo Clinic, who warned that increased federal \n     regulation of health care quality, by freezing in place \n     standards that will quickly become obsolete, will actually \n     diminish the quality of care that patients receive. Who also \n     agree with the approach taken by the President's own hand-\n     picked Commission on Quality which did not recommend \n     legislation or regulation. Instead, the President's \n     Commission--which he has conveniently disavowed--recommended \n     voluntary implementation of consumer protections.\n       Republicans believe consumers have the right to a health \n     system driven by the best scientific evidence available--not \n     one hamstrung by political considerations. Congress should \n     not practice medicine. Over the past several years, Congress \n     has imposed a number of ``body part'' mandates on health \n     insurance plans. These mandates, though well-intentioned, are \n     often misguided. For example, the Journal of the American \n     Medical Association last year published a study which \n     concluded that maternity length-of-stay requirements do not \n     improve health outcomes for mothers or their babies and may \n     do more harm than good. Congress should not magnify and \n     repeat past errors by imposing new body part mandates on \n     health plans.\n       The federal government should focus on a system which will \n     give providers and physicians more time with patients and \n     less time on paperwork. Bills that impose extensive \n     information disclosure requirements on health plans will \n     force those plans to impose extensive paperwork requirements \n     on providers. Instead of simply filing claims information \n     with insurers--as providers in fee-for-service and PPOs do--\n     doctors will have to supply insurance companies with \n     information about their patients, the care their patients \n     receive, treatment outcomes, and patient satisfaction, among \n     other things. This will require doctors to spend more time \n     filling out forms and less time treating their patients.\n       Republicans will not politicize or simplify an issue as \n     important as health care quality. Many on the other side are \n     willing to jeopardize insurance coverage for millions of \n     Americans for a political ``slam dunk.''

The issues surrounding the quality of our nation's \n     health care deserve to be debated responsibly and cautiously. \n     We will not pass legislation which increases the number of \n     uninsured, makes health care unaffordable, and diminishes \n     rather than enhance health care quality.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts).

Mr. President, in the Washington Post this week there was \nan article entitled ``Sudan's Famine Overwhelms Aid Effort.'' I want to \nread a couple of sentences from this article, because I was struck by \nthe concurrence of what I read about what is happening in Sudan and \nwhat I know is\n\n[[Page S7928]]\n\nhappening in North Dakota and in much of the farm belt.\n\n       As the gate is about to close for the night on the feeding \n     center here, near-lifeless bodies start turning up \n     everywhere. Three have collapsed just outside the reed walls \n     of the compound, human skeletons so thin they look two-\n     dimensional against the ground.\n       Three, then four, then five, then, somehow, eight others \n     have been carried inside and laid among the swarm of gaunt \n     people still strong enough to beckon medical workers who have \n     spent the day ministering to the hundreds gathered outside \n     this place that has food.\n       The workers move from body to body, feeling for a pulse, \n     crumbling high-calorie biscuits into palms, pouring sugar \n     water from gourd to mouth. The impossibly sunken cheeks of a \n     man too weak to hold his head up by himself fall deeper into \n     his face as he slurps. . . .\n       Four months after aid agencies issued warnings of impending \n     famine in southern Sudan--and two months after they marshaled \n     public opinion in the name of heading it off--starvation has \n     arrived regardless. Across a vast region unsettled by civil \n     war and erratic weather, the United Nations now says, 1.2 \n     million people are at risk of death from hunger.\n\n  They are living on the leaves of trees. I heard a fellow who visited \nSudan describe old women climbing trees to forage leaves to eat. When I \nthink that halfway around the world people are dying of starvation, and \npeople are climbing trees to eat leaves on trees, I can t help but \nthink that on the other side of the world that our family farmers who \nproduce food in the most abundant quantity anywhere on the Earth are \nbeing told that their production has no merit, and no value.\n  The price of farm commodities collapses, and family farmers are told, \n``Well, that's the breaks. That is the way things are. You produce it, \nand it should be worth $4.50 or $5 to cover the cost of production, and \nthen you go put it on a truck and drive it to an elevator, and it is \nworth $3. Somehow the market doesn't value it. Your crop doesn't have \nworth, and doesn't have merit.''\n  I think to myself that there is something kind of Byzantine about a \nworld in which that happens. Just detach yourself from the globe for a \nmoment and look at a globe sitting out here with people on this side \nstarving and people on this side who are operating family farms going \nbroke because they are told their food doesn't have value. Gosh.\n  This is not true with military equipment. Military equipment always \nhas value. They ship it all around the world every day in every way, \nand there is plenty of money to finance it. The poorest countries in \nthe world can buy military equipment. The poorest countries in the \nworld can afford apparently the best jet planes, tanks, guns, and \nshells. But when it comes to food, the people who need it are starving, \nand the people who produce it--our family farmers--are told it doesn't \nhave worth and they can go broke.\n  Let me describe what is happening in our part of the world. I might \nsay that I served for almost 10 years on the Hunger Committee in the \nU.S. House of Representatives. I am well familiar with the famine that \noccurred in Ethiopia. I am well familiar with past famines in Sudan and \nother parts of the world where millions have died of starvation. This \nis happening on a planet where, in some parts of the earth we produce \nfood in great abundant quantity and those who produce it are told it \nhas too little value.\n  We have family farmers today who have invested everything, their \nlives, 10, 20, 30 years into running a family farm far out in the \ncountry, with the yard light on at night, raising their family, sending \ntheir kids to school, getting up early to do the chores, working all \nday, doing chores at night, and discover when they check their books \nand records that they are losing money and losing their farms.\n  Here is what happened to the price of wheat in the last couple of \nyears. Wheat prices have fallen 53 percent since the current farm law \nwas passed. Prices have collapsed like a down escalator, and yet some \npeople say, ``Gee, everything is working just fine.'' In fact, I heard \nsome people say the farm program is working just fine. It is not \nworking just fine.\n  The price of wheat is collapsing. On top of this, in our State we \nhave the worst crop disease in a century. This is a crop disease that \nis pervasive. It is called fusarium head blight, commonly called scab. \nFarmers are hit by collapsed prices and crop diseases that are \ndevastating. So we have, it seems to me, a twin failure here on this \nglobe of ours. We have people who don't have anything to eat and are \nstarving and dying in the streets in Sudan. Then we have families who \nare failing in the Farm Belt who have risked everything they have to \nrun a family farm and are told, when they truck that wheat and barley \nthat makes the foodstuffs that can be life-saving to others, that \nsomehow this has no value. At least, they are told its value is so \ndiminished that you can't make a decent living growing this grain.\n  Let me show you what has happened to these family farmers in my \nState. In 1 year, there has been a 98-percent reduction in net income \nfor family farmers. That's right, 98 percent. Go to any neighborhood, \nany street, anyplace in this country and ask anybody how will you \nhandle it, how will you fare, what will your life be like, if somebody \ntakes away 98 percent of your income? This describes a serious economic \nemergency.\n  In my State, these red counties which make up a third of our \ncounties, have been declared disaster counties every single year for 5 \nyears--every year. Not just occasionally, every year. Incidentally, \nNorth Dakota is 10 times the size of Massachusetts in land mass. Those \nfamily farmers are trying to run a farm out here and trying to raise a \ncrop they can plant and harvest. They have discovered that you cannot \ndo it when you have these excessive wet cycles and pervasive crop \ndisease so they don't get much of a crop. Then if they do get a crop, \nthey send it to the market and it is underpriced because the price has \ncollapsed.\n  The reason I make this point is we have family farmers in North \nDakota--and in other parts of the Farm Belt, but especially in North \nDakota--who are suffering terribly. We need to do something about that.\n  Do we need to respond to the Sudan with respect to food aid, \nsubstantially increased quantities of Food for Peace, title II and \ntitle III and others? Yes, we do. It is this country's obligation to do \nthat. We ought to do it. Doing so, however, also obligates us, it seems \nto me, to do something to help those family farmers in our Farm Belt \nwho are losing their hopes and their dreams.\n\n       ``This is the worst plant disease epidemic that the United \n     States has faced with any major crop in this country.'' Brian \n     Steffenson of North Dakota State University said that last \n     week. That is just one part of the price collapse and crop \n     disease that has put us in a devastating situation.\n       Steffenson also said, ``North Dakota's barley industry is \n     hanging on by a thread, even though it is typically the \n     leader in feed and malting barley production in the nation.''\n\n  Farmers not only face disease and low prices, but also have a problem \nof selling into highly concentrated markets. Family farmers are trying \nto figure out how they market their commodity effectively. If they are \nraising beef, four packers control 87 percent. If they raise pork, its \nfour packers that control 60 percent. Four firms control 55 percent of \nbroilers. If they have sheep, four packers control 73 percent of sheep \nslaughter.\n  Grain facilities at our ports are controlled by four firms which have \n59 percent. In flour milling, four firms control 62 percent. In wet \ncorn milling, four firms control 74 percent. You get the picture. One \nfarmer out there against that kind of market power that puts downward \npressure on all these prices.\n  My point is this: We have a responsibility in this Congress to care \nabout economic injury to important industries in this country, and none \nis more important, in my judgment, than family farming. Family farming \nis, and always has been, since Thomas Jefferson so described it as the \nmost important enterprise in this country. Family farming is still \nimportant in this country, and we must make a commitment to deal with \nthe economic injury to people who are out there, threatened with the \nloss of their livelihoods and the loss of their homes and dreams on \ntheir family farms.\n  In the coming week we intend to meet with the President. In the \ncoming weeks we intend to come to the Congress and ask Republicans and \nDemocrats, conservatives and liberals, all of them, to join us to say: \nWe are not only profamily, we are profamily farming, and during times \nof emergencies we want to reach out and help. A country\n\n[[Page S7929]]\n\nthat can provide foreign aid can also provide some farm aid in times of \ntrouble, and we have not had a time of trouble anywhere close to this \nfor many, many decades.\n  Just this morning one of the industry leaders in North Dakota \nindicated that he thinks we are headed towards a period that is about \nas bad as the 1930s on the family farm. We have an obligation to \nrespond. I will ask the cooperation of the majority leader, the \nminority leader, and all people of good will here in this Congress who \ncare, as I do, about the enterprise of family farming and the fortunes \nof those families in rural America. I hope we can pass a piece of \nlegislation in the next several weeks to respond to this emergency.\n  I thank the Senator from Mississippi for his indulgence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished majority leader is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/10/senate-section/article/S7927-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7929-S7930]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have in my hand a copy of that wonderful \ndocument, the Constitution of the United States of America. It begins, \n``We, the people of the United States * * * '' Like Senator Byrd, who \nrefers to it quite often and carries a copy of it in his pocket, I find \nthat when I go back and read it and reread it I always see something \ndifferent, something special, something very treasured. I refer, today, \nto the last phrase of Article 5, which is very clear and unambiguous. \nIt says:\n\n       * * * nor shall private property be taken for public use \n     without just compensation.\n\n  The Constitution is very clear. And yet all across this country, \nprivately owned property, including a lot of farmers' private property, \nand the private property of businessmen and individuals, is being taken \npursuant to government action without just compensation. In many \ninstances for so-called ``good and valid reasons--for example, to \npreserve wetlands or to protect endangered species. Such takings may, \nupon examination, be legitimate, but not if private property is taken \nfrom the property owner in an inappropriate way and without just \ncompensation.\n  This is one of the rights I think we as Americans hold most dear, and \nis so deserving of protection that it is spelled out in our \nConstitution--the right to privately own property and to not have it \ntaken away by government action without just compensation being paid.\n  When I visit with people from all over the world, particularly those \nwho have lived behind the Iron Curtain and in Eastern European \ncountries, one of the things they want, one of the things they feel so \nstrongly about in America, is the ability to own private property, own \nyour own little piece of the world, and to own your own home. Yet, in \nAmerica--in America--we are in danger of losing that right even though \nit is guaranteed in the Constitution.\n  So I filed for cloture last night on S. 2271, and I intend to strike \nand substitute the content of H.R. 1534, which passed the House by an \noverwhelming vote--I think the margin was well over 100--and which has \nbeen amended and passed by the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n  I commend the Judiciary Committee for the work they have done in this \narea under the chairmanship of Senator Hatch and with a lot of other \nSenators being involved, including Senator DeWine from Ohio and I think \nSenator Sessions from Alabama. They produced this very important \nlegislation, which is intended to protect an individual Constitutional \nright, the right to own and keep private property, by guaranteeing \ntimely access to the Federal courts.\n  A primary function of the Congress, I think, is to safeguard rights \nguaranteed by our Constitution. When the Fifth Amendment to the \nConstitution was ratified, our Founding Fathers were confident that the \nright of an individual to own and use private property without \nunreasonable restrictions of that right would be guaranteed. However, \nthe framers of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights could not have \nreasonably foreseen the tremendous changes in our Government structure \nthat have resulted, I believe, in the real impairment of these property \nrights guarantees.\n  The encroachment of Federal Government agencies into matters of \nprivate land management is an issue of escalating cost to taxpayers, \nbusinesses, and private property owners. Such encroachments often \nresult in decreased property values, reduced or terminated business \nactivities, and lost jobs.\n  What value does a piece of property have in Kansas or in Connecticut \nor in Mississippi if you have been told, ``Oh, yes, it is your land. We \nwon't take it. But, by the way, you can't use it in the way you \nintended, for the purpose perhaps that you had bought it; or you can't \ndo something on your land that you have inherited from your \nforefathers?'' You might as well just take it off the face of the \nglobe. What value does it have if you can't use it?\n  The extreme interpretations, in my opinion, of the Endangered Species \nAct and the Clean Water Act by Federal regulatory agencies are \nresulting in a policy of national land use control. Further, the rights \nof individual property owners are imperiled when faced with oppressive \nGovernment regulation without the ability to even fight for those \nrights on equal footing. This must not be allowed to continue \nunchecked.\n  I believe a legislative remedy is now needed to reinstate what should \notherwise be inalienable. At a minimum, an individual property owner \nshould be confident in the knowledge that the Federal court system is \navailable to resolve a dispute over the taking of an individual's \nproperty without just compensation in a fair and timely manner.\n  That timely access to the courts will be assured by the passage of \nthis legislation before the Senate Monday, and the vote will be at 5:45 \np.m. on Monday to allow us even to proceed to consider this bill which \nwill guarantee private property owners access and the opportunity to go \nto the Federal courts.\n  This legislation affects only Federal property rights claims brought \nbefore a Federal court. Despite the contentions of opponents to this \nlegislation, State and local prerogatives and State and local claims--\nthose based on State and local law--are not affected. The mere fact \nthat a property rights constitutional claim may arise from some action \ntaken by a State or local government does not make that claim per se a \nState law claim rather than a Federal claim.\n  The Judiciary Committee has endeavored to strike the proper balance \nwhen weighing any impact on State and local governments caused by this \nlegislation. This legislation will certainly empower property owners--\nthat is what it is intended to do--but I believe it will merely place \nthem in the position they should have been in all along and will place \nthem in a position that balances the need of the governmental entity \nwith the rights of the private property owner.\n  Finally, it should be clear to all that the U.S. district courts in \nparticular (and the Federal court system in general) are the proper \nvenue for the adjudication of Federal constitutional issues such as \nthis Federal right stemming from the Fifth Amendment to the \nConstitution. This legislation does no harm to our well-established \nprinciples of federalism. The Federal courts reviewing these claims \nwill have no power to write permits or to make zoning decisions as do \nlocal governments. The courts do, however, have the responsibility to \nensure that such decisions are constitutional and do not improperly \ninfringe upon the property rights established by the Fifth Amendment.\n  I am confident that this legislation will accomplish its desired \neffect, no more and no less. That effect is to ensure that a private \nproperty owner has his day in Federal court and a fair and timely \nhearing of his cause. This is a bedrock right, and it must be \npreserved.\n  This is not the same private property rights bill that had been \nconsidered earlier by the Congress. It is much narrower. It is \ntargeted, but it gives access to the Federal court system. By taking \nthis step, Congress will make great strides to ensure the preservation \nof this important Constitutional right.\n  I would like to hear any Member of the Senate go to his or her \nconstituents in their respective States and say, ``Private property \nowner, we think your property should be taken for whatever good and \njust cause that might be involved without just compensation, and, oh, \nby the way, you don't even have the right to go to the\n\n[[Page S7930]]\n\nFederal courts and have a determination made if it is constitutional or \nnot.'' Try to defend that.\n  We are going to have a vote. We will see who really believes in \nprivate property rights in America.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the distinguished occupant of the Chair. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak without \ntime limit as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, the distinguished leader's reference to \nthe Constitution provides a transition for me today, and I appreciate \nit.\n  Mr. President, 222 years and 6 days ago, our Founding Fathers issued \nwhat we today regard as America's birth certificate: the Declaration of \nIndependence. We know well the significance of this date which we \ncelebrated, once again, last weekend all across the land and the \nsubsequent events that comprise the remarkable and unique story of our \nfreedom. But sometimes, it seems to me, we have lost sight of the \nsubstance of the document itself, and its continued relevance to our \npolity. So today I would like to revisit this great statement of our \nAmerican ideals to see what guidance it gives us about our current \ncondition.\n  Reread Jefferson's master work and you will see that it was not just \nthe declaration of our independence, but also a declaration of our \ninterdependence, a defining statement of the common conditions and \nvalues, the shared principles and purposes that would unite a diverse \npopulation of English and European pilgrims into a nation.\n  The original Americans did not all come from the same land, but they \nall did agree that there are fundamental truths that are self-evident.\n\n  They did not all hold the same religious tenets, but they did all \nhold an unerring faith that those inalienable rights that Jefferson \nenumerated in the declaration were endowed not by some benign king nor \nby the grace of a new government, but by their Creator.\n  I was moved to reflect, Mr. President, upon the declaration's meaning \nas our latest national birth date passed last Saturday by the recent \ncomments of two prominent contemporary political activists about the \nstate of our values in America in 1998, comments which, when taken \ntogether, I fear show how we have lost some of the unity of our \nfounders' national vision.\n  The first came from Dr. James Dobson, the head of Focus on the \nFamily, who for sometime now has been ringing a national alarm bell \nabout the Nation's declining morality. It was just a few weeks ago that \nDr. Dobson caused a stir by proclaiming to the national press that we \nare in the midst of a civil war over America's future, pitting the \nmoral haves against the moral have-nots.\n  Not long after, Jane Fonda gave a speech on teen pregnancy that \nactually echoed Dr. Dobson's martial proclamation, but from a very \ndifferent perspective. Ms. Fonda attacked the views espoused by Dr. \nDobson and others on abortion and sex education, accusing them of \nignoring children that ``are not white, middle-class Christians'' and \nwarned her audience that our society is in the throes of a ``holy \nwar,'' pitting the forces of tolerance against the forces of \nintolerance.\n  It would be easy to dismiss this apocalyptic talk, this talk that \nseems, in some words, certainly to be intemperate, as just another bout \nof the hyperbole that dominates so much of our political discourse \nthese days if it were not for the accumulation of evidence suggesting \nthat Dr. Dobson and Ms Fonda are each in their own ways on to \nsomething. Maybe, as the stark contrast and conflict of their views and \nthe way in which they express them suggest, the values that have long \nheld us together are coming unglued. Maybe we are on the verge of \nabandoning the declaration's premise of interdependence and sliding \ntoward either individual isolation or open conflict.\n  There is certainly a slew of public opinion polls showing that most \nAmericans are gravely concerned about the condition of our values. \nThere was a Gallup-USA Today survey released in March found that 49 \npercent of Americans believe that we are in the midst of a moral \ncrisis. And another 41 percent said they believe we have major moral \nproblems. What is driving these numbers, the polls suggest, is a \nswelling sense that our moral safety net, the interlaced norms of \nbehavior we depend on to maintain a civil society, has become badly \nfrayed, and that this fraying has contributed to some of our most \npressing social ills, from the recent outbreak of children slaughtering \nchildren, to the ongoing epidemic of children giving birth to children, \nto the general coarsening of conversation, communication in our shared \npublic places.\n\n  Mr. President, then consider, if you will, the vociferous complaints \nof millions of American parents--I certainly hear them in Connecticut--\nwho feel as if they are locked in a competition with the immensely \npowerful, popular culture to raise their own children, a culture which \nmore and more rejects, rather than reflects, the fundamental values we \nAmericans have abided by for generations that have served us so well, a \nculture that glorifies murder, mayhem and drug abuse, promotes \npromiscuity and the latest perversion of the moment, denigrates \nauthority with a numbing regularity, and wallowing in titillation and \nsensationalism and, it seems so often, all things scandalous.\n  Or closer to home, here in Congress, consider what our investigation \nof the 1996 campaign finance scandal revealed. We live in a political \nsystem where the clear intention of laws governing campaigns are \nregularly violated, where we have defined political deviancy down so \nfar that it seems the only relevant standard left is what is \ntechnically legal--which is another way of saying, ``What can we get \naway with in order to raise vast sums of money to run more television \nads, to win more elections?''--and where hustlers cynically compare \ngaining access to the White House to dropping tokens into a subway \nturnstile.\n  Or consider the hostile tone of the debates we often hear in this \nCongress about visceral, values-based issues, particularly such as \nabortion or homosexuality or school prayer. The rancor of these \ndiscussions, which is eagerly amplified by the news media, only \nreinforces the impression that values are something that divides us as \nAmericans today rather than defining us.\n  So there is ample evidence, I think, to suggest that something is \ndeeply wrong with America's moral health today. Nor is it a stretch to \nconclude that Dr. Dobson and Ms. Fonda, together with the legions of \nother culture warriors who have seconded their respective convictions, \nraised some legitimate and consequential questions about what it is \nthat ails us in our capacity to remedy it.\n  Among them are, What has happened to the founding principles that \nundergirded the Declaration and, for that matter, the Constitution and \nhave sustained us for generations? Have we, in some sense, taken \ntolerance too far? Is our commitment to a common moral code on a set of \nfixed points of right and wrong self-evident truths that we declared in \nthe Declaration disintegrating? And if it is, can a house so divided \nagainst its own values stand strong for long?\n  Mr. President, in my remarks today I will try to offer some answers \nthat may add to our understanding of the controversial and complicated \nvalues debate, with the hope I may help to, in some small way, move it \nbeyond the warped groove we seem to be stuck in these days. I do so \nconvinced that America's moral Cassandras are on to something, that our \nNation is in the grip of a crisis of values, that there really is a \nconflict at our core, and that the recent spate of school shootings and \nmurders are a warning sign of even greater trouble ahead.\n\n  But I also do so convinced that we are misdiagnosing this conflict by \nframing it as a civil war, and that those who do, in fact, make it \nharder to overcome the very divisions that they bemoan and we, as a \npeople, must repair if we are to fix what is, indeed, broken in our \nsociety.\n\n[[Page S7931]]\n\n  Let me first try to say a bit more about what I mean by common \nvalues, because I know from experience that these words carry heavy \nbaggage with them today and, as such, are often interpreted differently \nby different people which is, in itself, a symptom of the larger \nproblem we face.\n  The best reference point I can think of is the Declaration of \nIndependence, the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights, which are the \ngreat founding expressions of American values.\n  What are those core principles? Equal opportunity, freedom of \nreligion and expression, particularly individual autonomy, self-rule, \npersonal and civic responsibility, tolerance, and a respect for the \nbasic dignity and underlying pervasive respect for the basic dignity of \nhuman life. All of these are derived, I believe, and can be seen from \nthe documents--the Declaration particularly--all of these are derived \nfrom our faith in God, in our belief in the existence of moral truth \nand a higher law, and all of which, I suggest, are essential to living \nand sustaining a free and democratic society.\n  These Founding Fathers, we know, had their roots in the Judeo-\nChristian ethic, the Declaration's drafters, but the values are not \nexclusive to any one religion. In fact, over the years, they evolved \ninto an American civic religion--principled, purposeful, moral, public, \nand not least of all inclusive--an American civics religion that \ncemented our common bonds as Americans for generations and made real \nthe ideal of e pluribus unum--``one out of many.''\n  But there is a profound tension that I think we have to acknowledge \nin these founding values between rights and freedoms, which we, as \nindividuals, have been endowed, as the document says, by our Creator on \nthe one hand, and in the mutual responsibilities and common obligations \nwe must accept to form a government capable of securing those freedoms \non the other hand--in other words, the coinciding claims of \nindependence and interdependence that Jefferson articulated so \nbrilliantly in the Declaration.\n  And it is in these tensions, I think, that we find the antecedents of \nthe conflict that today engages Dr. Dobson, Ms. Fonda and so many \nothers. It is, at its heart, not a conflict, I think, between warring \ncamps of American citizens so much as a clash of competing fundamental \nAmerican values--independence versus interdependence, the belief in \nmoral truth versus the value of communal tolerance. It seems to me that \nwe are not experiencing a wholesale repudiation of the basic common \nvalues I have described, but rather a shift in our national moral \nequilibrium in which tolerance has emerged as the more popular \nprinciple of the day.\n  A great challenge we face in our time, given this shift, is how to \nsustain tolerance without inviting immorality and how to uphold moral \ntruth without becoming intolerant. This tension is illuminated by the \nresearch that Boston University sociologist Alan Wolfe did for his \nrecent book ``One Nation After All,'' which was based on interviews \nwith 200 middle-class Americans from eight different communities across \nthe country.\n  Wolfe set out to test the conventional wisdom reflected, particularly \nin Dr. Dobson's comments that ``a deep divide existed between upholders \nof traditional cultural and moral values and those attracted to more \nmodern themes of personal or group identity,'' end of quote from Alan \nWolfe. What he found, to the surprise of many, is a high degree of \nagreement across ideological, theological, racial and ethnic lines on a \ncore set of common values, on the basic questions of right and wrong \nthat still bridge our many differences as Americans.\n  But Wolfe also found a correspondingly high degree of reluctance to \ntranslate those privately held values into public expressions that hold \nothers accountable to those shared standards.\n  The common refrain Wolfe heard was that people did not want to appear \nintolerant and did not feel comfortable imposing their morality on \ntheir neighbors.\n  Of course, in some ways this rise in tolerance has made us a much \nbetter country, much truer to our founding ideals of equality and \nopportunity. We have opened a world of new, more equal opportunities \nfor women; for instance, working to eradicate many confining and \nmisguided biases. We have made great progress over the last generation \nin fighting bigotry and discrimination against African-Americans, \nmaking more real for them after a terrible national history of \ninequality and persecution, the equality of opportunity the Declaration \nand Constitution proposed for all Americans.\n  The same is happening with regard to our fellow Americans who are of \nHispanic and Asian descent, or today who follow the faith of Islam, a \ngroup that is growing in number in our country. And we have begun to \nstamp out the prejudice long harbored against homosexuals and accept \nthem as fellow citizens deserving of the same basic rights and respect \nas all other Americans.\n  But the triumph of tolerance in our values in recent decades has also \nhad a less constructive effect. The pendulum has swung so far and has \nbecome so wary of the label ``intolerant'' that I think we are \nincreasingly unwilling, and in some cases incapable, of making moral \njudgments. This is evident in the evolution of public attitudes about \nthe family, where we have gone from earlier times stigmatizing \nadultery, divorce, and particularly out-of-wedlock childbirth, to \nnormalizing these behaviors, with little apparent consideration given \nto the damage these choices can do, particularly to children \nindividually or to our society collectively.\n  It is also evident in too many of our schools, where teachers and \ncurricula avoid mentioning the word ``values'' or won't dare to \ninstruct children in the meaning of right and wrong for fear that is \ntoo controversial or may offend some.\n  It is particularly evident, I fear, in the influential entertainment \nmedia, where executives at multibillion-dollar conglomerates too often \nrefuse to draw any lines that they will not cross to raise their \nratings and revenues. These men and women produce a market to our \nchildren--records that find fun in cop killing, gang rape; even at the \nextreme, pedophilia; video games that reward young players for mowing \ndown innocent people with weapons; homicidal hotrods and television \ntalk shows that degrade the human spirit and delight in the \nexploitation of human misery and perversity.\n  If criticized, the people who run the entertainment business often \nwave the first amendment around as if it were a constitutional hall \npass that excuses their conduct, loathe to admit that the pollution \nthey are dumping into the public square has much less to do with free \nspeech than it has to do with higher profits.\n  The media moguls are surely not the only business leaders who have \nsuspended judgment and let the values of the market, or the inherent \nlack thereof, rule practically unfettered. Much as Alan Wolfe's \nresearch suggests, more and more business leaders seem to be checking \ntheir privately held values, which are strong and deep, at the office \ndoor and, by extension, at least when they are functioning in their \nbusinesses, their sense of social responsibility. As a result, it too \noften seems as if the bottom line is the only line and that raising \nconsumption is a far more important priority than raising healthy \nchildren.\n\n  The purest distillation of this ethos, I think, can be found in the \nnew world of the Internet. Our shared enthusiasm for this exciting and \nimmensely valuable new medium has, unfortunately, been tempered by the \nalmost complete absence of boundaries or rules to guide online conduct. \nThis is not just true of the criminals and the miscreants, the \npornographers, pedophiles, and scam artists who, sadly, are taking \nadvantage of the net's anonymity to do wrong, but also a distressing \nnumber of businesses that should know better. A recent report by the \nFederal Trade Commission on cyberspace privacy showed that many \nnationally recognized companies are using exploitive and manipulative \nmarketing practices online to target web-surfing grade schoolers as \npotential customers. Specifically, an FTC survey of 212 sites aimed at \nkids found that 89 percent collect personally identifiable information \nand fewer than 10 percent provide any form of parental control over \nwhat information can be solicited.\n  Now, one could argue that it is not fair to judge these companies by \ntheir conduct in cyberspace since it is such a new medium. But one \ncould also argue,\n\n[[Page S7932]]\n\nas I would, that the best way to gauge someone's ethics is to judge \ntheir conduct when no one is looking. Well, is anyone looking today in \nAmerica? The founders of our country, the people who drafted the \nDeclaration of Independence and signed it, believed that God was always \nlooking--which is why they showed such deference to what they described \nas the Supreme Judge of the world in the Declaration of Independence \nand why they made religious freedom the first freedom. They knew that \nin this Republic that they were creating, where the power of the state \nwas to be limited, where the state would not be all powerful, that \nfaith in God, in a higher law, would be a necessary and powerfully \nconstructive source of good behavior among the citizenry.\n  Surveys done today consistently show that more than 90 percent of the \nAmerican people say they believe in God. I can't think of another \nquestion we could ask on a poll in this country that would get that \nhigh a response. We exhibit levels of religiosity that are far greater \nthan any country in the world. Yet over the last generation or two we \nhave grown increasingly reluctant to allow that faith to be expressed \nin public, so much so that it seems at times we have banished religious \nvalues and religious institutions from our public policy deliberations \nand construct a discomfort zone for even discussing our faith in public \nsettings, ironically making religion one of the few remaining socially \nacceptable targets of intolerance.\n  If you look at the talk shows on television and see subjects that are \nbeing discussed there which go way over the line, think of how little \nwe see similar discussions of matters of faith. In driving religion \nfrom the public square, we manage to slowly and significantly, I fear, \ndislodge our morality from its religious foundations and thereby have \nlost what I described a few moments ago as our unifying national civic \nreligion.\n  In some ways, the Ten Commandments became just another ``do and \ndon't'' list that people feel free to argue with, negotiate, or ignore \noutright. Without the connection to a higher law, we have made it more \nand more difficult for people to answer the question of why it is wrong \nto steal, cheat, or lie, or settle conflicts with violence, or be \nunfaithful to one's spouse, or to be exploitive with children. We have \noften deprived our public life of what I believe is the best source of \nbetter behavior that the human race has, which is faith in God and a \nsense of personal accountability and responsibility that should go with \nit.\n  The net result of the intertwined trends that I have just described--\nthe triumph of tolerance, the lionization of the market, the breakdown \nin authority, and the loss of public accountability that comes from \nfaith--is that we have succeeded in creating a values vacuum in \nAmerican life today. In this vacuum, where moral certainty fears to \ntread, there are fewer and fewer bright lines and more and more blurs \nof gray. The difficult balance of truth and tolerance, which for most \nof our country has sustained us, has been lost. And we are increasingly \ninclined to ask, ``whose values?'' when a question of morality is \nraised.\n\n  How much does this really matter? Well, according to Harvard's \nMichael Sandel, the dissolution of our public morality, coupled with \nthe lost sense of common purposes, has effectively crippled our \nGovernment's ability to resolve our most complicated issues in \nformulating public policy. Without a common vocabulary of values and \nbasic moral assumptions that should form our policies and our laws, \nSandel suggests that our most important public debates are doomed from \nthe start because we lack even a shared framework for reaching \nagreement.\n  Professor Sandel goes further, arguing in his recent book \n``Democracy's Discontent'' that the breakdown in our common moral code \nhas put the entire American experiment in self-government in jeopardy. \nSandel says that in moving toward a value-neutral polity, we have \nabandoned what our colleague, Pat Moynihan, has so aptly called the \n``central task'' of any society--to inculcate values and develop virtue \nin its citizens, its children. By turning our backs on this mission, we \nhave depleted the public capital necessary for a democratic government \nto function effectively. The consequences? A public philosophy that \nProfessor Sandel says, ``cannot secure the liberty it promises because \nit cannot sustain the kind of political community and civic engagement \nthat liberty requires.''\n  This cause for concern was reaffirmed by an important new report \nreleased last month by the National Commission on Civic Renewal, \nchaired by our former colleague, Sam Nunn, and by former Education \nSecretary Bill Bennett, which found that we are increasingly becoming \n``a Nation of spectators,'' passively disengaged from the duties and \nwork of self-government. The commission examined 22 different trend \nlines, such as voter turnout, newspaper readership, and survey \nmeasurements of public trust, and determined that our civic condition \nhas declined precipitously over the last generation.\n  Now, these indices of our current moral and civic decline become even \nmore rattling when we consider what is filling the values vacuum today \nand what that means for our future. As our traditional values \ntransmitters have shrunk from the task, the omnipresent, powerful \npopular culture has stepped in to assume that vitally important role. \nThat means that the people setting the norms of behavior in this \ncountry and the standards of right and wrong more and more are the \ntelevision producers and syndicators, the movie moguls, the fashion \nadvertisers, the record manufacturers, the software designers, and a \nhost of other players within the electronic media-cultural complex that \ncollectively exert a powerful hold on our consciousness.\n  The work these people and many others are doing too often sends the \nworst kinds of messages. They teach our kids that the proper way to \nresolve a disagreement is with a fist to the face or a bullet to the \nbrain, that sex is a form of recreational activity without \nconsequences, and that parents exist either to be mocked or ignored. \nThese messages are breeding more of the same values vacuum that created \nthem in the first place, communicating to our children that standards \nare fungible and matters of right and wrong are negotiable at best, \nirrelevant at worst.\n  Most entertainment industry leaders deny that they exert this kind of \ninfluence, but the evidence to the contrary is accumulating in such \nabundance that the media conglomerates, I think, are on the verge--\ndangerous verge--of becoming the moral equals of the tobacco industry. \nIndeed, much like the link between cancer and cigarettes, the decidedly \nnegative effects of prolonged exposure to violence on television has \nbeen proven conclusively by an overwhelming body of social science \nresearch, a conclusion embraced by the American people, yet continually \ndisputed in public by producers of violent programming.\n\n  There is also a recent, growing body of research to show a \ncorrelation between heavy viewing of sexual content and kids initiating \nsexual activity before they otherwise would have. A survey done by Time \nmagazine last month showed that 29 percent of teenagers said they \nlearned about sex mainly from television, second only to their friends \nas a source of knowledge, indicating that the small screen has become a \nbig sex educator. Also, many child development experts have voiced \nconcerns that the omnipresence of graphic sexual displays throughout \nthe media and in advertising is helping to sexualize our children at an \nunhealthily early age. It was because of these reports that I sponsored \nlegislation in the fiscal 1998 Labor-HHS appropriations bill directing \nthe National Institute of Child Health and Human Development to \ninitiate a broad-based research initiative on the media's influence on \nchildren's sexual behavior. That is now underway. Hopefully, it will \nprovide us a clearer understanding of the relationship.\n  What the experts tell us has recently been corroborated by an \nabundance of real-life experiences. Earlier this year, in Norfolk, VA, \nfor instance, educators within the local public schools observed that a \ndisturbing number of children who watched Jerry Springer's fight-filled \ntalk show were often choosing to settle their disputes, as they \nexplained, ``like they do it on the Springer Show,'' with punches and \nkicks. One principal in Norfolk was so concerned that she sent home a \nletter with each\n\n[[Page S7933]]\n\nstudent pleading with parents not to let them watch Springer anymore.\n  What can we make of the horrific bullets that children are firing \nwith frightening frequency these days in the cafeterias, hallways, \nclassrooms, and courtyards of America's schools? I am certainly not \nhere to claim that the media is solely to blame for this spate of \nstudent gunfire. To do so would be unfair and would ignore the factual \ncomplexity of each case. Yet, it would be a far greater folly, I think, \nto ignore the pattern emerging that indicates that there is a \nconnection between these violent acts and the culture of violence \nenveloping our children.\n  According to a recent report in the New York Times, which reviewed \nthe most well-publicized cases of student violence over the last 9 \nmonths, as well as a few earlier incidents, we can conclude that each \nof the attackers ``seemed to be obsessed with the violent pop \nculture.'' We know from various press reports that the boys in \nSpringfield, OR; Pearl, MS, and Edinboro, PA, listened regularly to the \nnihilistic, hateful lyrics of shock-rocker Marilyn Manson. We know from \nthe testimony of a teacher from Westside Middle School in Jonesboro, \nAR, that the older of the two shooters there was a devotee of vicious \ngangsta rap music, and that a favorite song of his by the group Bone-\nThugs-n-Harmony plays out an open-field massacre of revenge quite \nsimilar to the plan the 13-year-old and the 11-year-old accomplice \nexecuted in March. And we know in some detail of the fascination a 14-\nyear-old in Moses Lake, WA, who mowed down three students in his \nalgebra class 2 years ago, had with Oliver Stone's ghoulish movie, \n``Natural Born Killers,'' because two friends of his told authorities \nthat the boy had confided to them that it would be ``pretty cool'' and \n``fun'' to go on a killing spree like the movie's lead characters.\n  To truly understand this connection, though, we need to know more. I \nam the first to say that, though I am critical of the entertainment \nmedia. Senator Brownback and I took one step in that direction earlier \nthis week when we convened a discussion forum on Tuesday with several \nleading experts, including writers, social scientists, a district \nattorney, and a clergyman to explore in greater detail the roots of \nthis deeply disturbing trend of student violence. The discussion we had \nproduced a remarkably strong consensus that, in fact, the culture is a \nmajor contributing factor, and the dissolution of the family is clearly \nanother factor. But culture, everyone tells us, is a contributing \nfactor. That is why I am considering legislation that would ask the \nJustice Department to conduct a far-reaching study to examine the \nrelationship between media violence and juvenile crime. It is an issue \nthat has already been deeply politicized and, in some respects, \noversimplified, and before it gets any more so, we need to see what the \nscience can objectively tell us.\n\n  But at the same time, I don't think we have to wait to conclude that \nsomething is deeply wrong in our society when our children are \nslaughtering each other, and that the enormously attractive and \nstimulating images of murder and mayhem so rampant throughout the \nelectronic media are playing some role in this American nightmare.\n  We can and also should talk about easy access to guns too many kids \nenjoy, which is evidenced by a recent study showing that nearly one \nmillion kids brought a firearm to school at least once this past school \nyear, and nearly half of them did so at least six times. And we can and \nshould talk about the need for greater parental involvement and faster \nintervention by counselors and other school personnel when kids show \nsigns they are homicidal or suicidal.\n  But I think we have to also talk honestly about the reality that boys \nin many parts of the country for a long time have had easy access to \nguns, that some have always been spurned by girls, and some have always \nhad emotional problems, some have had reason to be angry with teachers \nor fellow students. Yet, to my knowledge, we have never before in our \nhistory seen a similar series of cases where some of these young men--\nboys really--work out their problems by grabbing guns and massacring \ntheir teachers and classmates. So I think we have to ask, Where do they \nget such an idea? Maybe it is from the contemporary culture.\n  Before this lunacy goes any further, we must ask the entertainment \nindustry, which, notwithstanding my criticisms, really has done so much \ngood by enlightening our minds and touching our hearts, but also \nconfront the harm it can do, the effect the entertainment industry can \nhave of pushing some troubled children, particularly, over the edge, \nthat they hear our pleas to stop raining down so much death and \nmessages of death on our children.\n  Thankfully, we are beginning to hear cause for hope from the \ncorridors of American cultural power, as more and more media executives \nhave been willing to break the silence associated with the values \nvacuum. Both ABC President Bob Iger and former NBC Chairman Grant \nTinker have given speeches at major television conventions this year \ndecrying the Springerization of the airwaves as ``an embarrassment to \nour business,'' in Iger's words, and challenged broadcasters to ``stand \nfor something,'' in Tinker's words.\n  And Disney Chairman Michael Eisner made a forceful statement to the \nAmerican Society of Newspaper Editors this spring in which he candidly \ncriticized those in the industry who ``hide behind the skirts of the \nConstitution'' to justify marketing of ``vile programs'' like Springer. \nThese are permissible under the First Amendment,'' he said, ``but they \nare not desirable if we aspire to call ourselves civilized.'' He then \ncalled on his peers to make the kind of moral judgments that they and \ntoo many of us have been reluctant to consider. ``Edit we must,'' he \nsaid, ``not to stife conflict or conviction, but to eliminate \ndebasement.''\n  Also encouraging is what is happening outside the cultural epicenters \nof New York and Hollywood. In recent months, a political consensus has \nbegun to take shape about the dire state of our moral and civic \ncondition, bringing together disparate voices on the left and the right \nto cry out for renewing fundamental values in our public life.\n  This consensus is expressed eloquently in an important new report, \n``A Call to Civil Society: Why Democracy Needs Moral Truth,'' which was \nissued by a diverse collection of leading academics, theologians, \nsocial activists, civic leaders and politicians, from Harvard's Cornel \nWest to UCLA's James Q. Wilson. This report, which Senator Coats and I \nwere privileged to play a role in shaping, is particularly significant \nbecause it reassets the central premises of the Declaration's claim of \ninterdependence, that there are moral truths that we as a people must \nuphold for our experiment in self-rule to work.\n  This emerging consensus was also evident at the National Fatherhood \nSummit that was held here in Washington last month. This convocation \nwas called to highlight the crisis of father absence we are \nexperiencing in this country, in which the number of children living \nwithout a father of any kind that has quadrupled over the last two \ngenerations, and to mobilize a response. The day-long affair was \nthoroughly bipartisan, with the leaders of both houses of Congress \nserving as honorary co-hosts and Vice President Gore delivering the \nkey-note address, and it produced unanimity about the critical \nimportance of fathers in the raising of children and the need to \nstrengthen the two-parent family.\n  For the left and the right to reach agreement on this front \nrepresents remarkable prograss. A few years ago it was not just \npolitically incorrect but politically dangerous to talk about the \nprimacy of the two-parent family, as Dan Quayle learned, and to \nemphasize the critical role fathers play in the lives of their \nchildren. To do so was considered a knock against single mothers and \nperhaps all women. But the Fatherhood Summit and the Call to Civil \nSociety suggest that we have turned an important corner in the politics \nof the family, and reflect a common understanding that to iterate the \nvalue of involved fathers is not to denigrate the value of single \nmothers who are often some of the greatest heroes in our society today.\n  Perhaps the most telling indicator of how far we have come is the \nrecent statement that Murphy Brown herself made about the subject. \nCandice Bergen, the actress who played the sharp-tongued television \ncharacter, recently declared that Dan Quayle ``was right''\n\n[[Page S7934]]\n\nto talk about the troubling marginalization of fathers in his infamous \nspeech in 1992--although she still holds firm that the former Vice \nPresident was wrong in his specific criticism of Murphy Brown's choice \nto have a child on her own. ``It was a completely logical speech,'' \nBergen said in a newspaper interview. ``Fathers are not indispensible. \nThey are vital to a family.''\n  Which raises an obvious question: If Dan Quayle and Murphy Brown can \nfind common moral ground now, why then do we continue to hear the \nsteady beat of the culture war drums echoing throughout the political \narena?\n  No one can deny here, nor do I think there is any question that these \ndifferences do reflect the broader philosophical schism dividing parts \nof our society, a moral fault line that generally separates--and here \nis how I would describe that fault line--it generally separates the \nchampions of tolerance like Jane Fonda from the defenders of \ntraditional values like James Dobson.\n  But I suspect the values vacuum that overrides all has been \nrepresented to both exaggerate and exacerbate these divisions, making \nthe extent of our moral disagreements appear far greater than Professor \nAlan Wolfe's research, and several other supporting polls, actually \nshow them to be. It seems that the less we express our morality \npublicly, the more trouble we have finding a common vocabulary of \nvalues, which makes it even more difficult for us to discuss civilly \nand constructively those issues that divide us, or to identify those \nprinciples that unite us. This communications breakdown deepens the \ncontempt and suspicion that each side already feels for the other.\n  The news media, I am afraid to say, which itself has been infected by \nthat anything-goes mentality--not always, but often infected by the \nanything-goes mentality pervading the entertainment culture--seems too \noften to fan the flames of controversy. The result is not so much an \nhonest, engaged debate about values, but a culture war echo chamber \nthat only heightens the average citizen's distorted sense that the \ncountry is locked in a mortal moral struggle.\n  The conflict over homosexuality's place, the place of homosexuals in \nour society, I think, offers a contemporary example of this tension \nthat is very real in our lives and in our discussions and debates. \nLet's start with the reality that many Americans continue to believe \nthat homosexuality is immoral and not just because the Bible tells them \nso. In fact, Professor Wolfe's research showed that this is one of the \nfew areas where Americans of all religious inclinations feel so \nstrongly that they are willing to risk the tag of intolerance to \nexpress or hold to their points of view, although most of the people he \ninterviewed tempered their disapproval by making clear that they did \nnot support discrimination against gay men and lesbians. It is unfair, \nwhen you think about Professor Wolfe's research, then, for anyone to \nautomatically conclude that people who express moral reservations or \neven disdain about homosexuality are bigots, or to publicly attack them \nas hateful. These are sincerely held morally based views.\n  Yet the suspicions and concerns of the gay community are \nunderstandable when one considers the Senate's treatment of James \nHormel's nomination as Ambassador to Luxembourg, which is now being \nblocked by multiple holds by Members of this Chamber. If we truly \nbelieve in the claim of equality and the universal principle of \nfairness of the Declaration of Independence, and if we want to talk \nmore broadly about values with true credibility in this Chamber, I \nthink we owe Mr. Hormel a chance to be evaluated by the same standards \nwe have applied to other nominees. We owe him a chance to be judged by \nhis career and competence, not by his sexual orientation. We owe him a \nvote on this floor.\n  If we truly hope to repair the moral breach that separates us and \nprevents us from confronting what most Americans agree is a crisis of \nvalues, I think we have to start by recognizing that the tone of the \ndebate matters as much as the substance. We need to declare a cease-\nfire in the culture wars, to lay down our rhetorical arms, step back \nand look at the person across the PTA meeting room or the abortion \nclinic or the affirmative action rally not as the enemy, but as a \nfellow American, deserving of the same respect and courtesy we all \nexpect for ourselves, who happens to have a different, deeply held \npoint of view. We need to build on the common moral ground staked out \nby the call to civil society and begin to reassert in public life those \nfundamental values that, despite the collateral damage of the culture \nwarring, continue to connect our incredibly diverse populace.\n  I think the largest responsibility, the first responsibility, falls \non those of us who are concerned about the weakening of our common \nvalues and the ramifications for our society. We have to acknowledge \nthat many of our fellow citizens not only feel uncomfortable talking \npublicly about matters of morality, they are also skeptical of those \nwho do. Indeed, one of the great ironies of our time is that many \nAmericans have come to regard morality as a code word for intolerance. \nSo our challenge today is to persuade the skeptics that it is crucial \nfor the future of our country to rediscover those common core \nprinciples that made our democracy possible in the first place--those \ncommon core principles that were described, declared in the Declaration \nof Independence--and to renew their strength. We in Congress have the \nopportunity and the responsibility to support the search for common \nmoral ground.\n  From those of us who have been privileged and honored to be elected \nto lead this country, the American people have a right to know that we \nhear their anxieties about the Nation's moral future, that we are \nstriving to reflect their core values in our work and in our lives. But \nmore than that, we have to recognize that so much of what we aspire to \nin this body, by passing legislation to serve the public interest and \nmake this a better country, will ultimately be for naught if we do not \nfill the values vacuum in American life and rediscover, reclaim the \nhigh ground, the common moral ground.\n  For those reasons, I hope, in the months ahead, to return to the \nSenate floor, this historic Chamber that truly serves as the American \npeople's forum, to speak with my colleagues from across this great \ncountry about different aspects of the values crisis that I have \ndiscussed today and to try to offer some specific ideas about how, \ntogether, we can better secure, ``the Safety and Happiness'' that our \nDeclaration of Independence promises us all.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleagues for their patience. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS.

Mr. President, I hope that the Senate will celebrate \nAmerica's independence by focusing its energy on issues that create \nAmerican jobs, protect American ingenuity, and improve the lives of the \nAmerican people.\n  One such issue that I would like to talk about today is as American \nas fireworks on the 4th of July. This is our nation's patent system. \nPatents are the life's blood of America's industry and economic \nstrength.\n  America's patent system was established in the Constitution itself. \nIt is no coincidence that some of those who framed our government were \ninventors. Both Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Jefferson were avid \ninventors. Indeed,\n\n[[Page S7935]]\n\nJefferson invented a cryptographic system that was used by the United \nStates during World War II.\n  The Founders included in our enduring Constitution as an enumerated \npower of the Congress, the power ``To promote the progress of science \nand useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors \nthe exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries.'' \n(United States Constitution, Article I, Section 8.) This Constitutional \nprovision was carefully drafted to reflect a recognition by the \nFounders that our patent system would have to evolve in order to serve \nits intended purposes.\n  Congress, from its early days, implemented this constitutional \nprerogative. The First Congress, in its second session, passed an ``Act \nto Promote the Progress of Useful Arts.'' President Washington signed \nthat law on April 10, 1790, and the United States Patent Office was \nthereby created.\n  Since that time, Congress has updated the patent laws of this country \nto make sure that the fuel of American genius was well stoked. Indeed, \non an Independence Day more than 150 years ago, on July 4, 1836, \nCongress reorganized the patent system, created the office of \n``Commissioner of Patents'' and reinstated the requirement that patent \napplications be examined. The Act provided that if the Commissioner \ndeemed an invention ``to be sufficiently useful and important, it shall \nbe his duty to issue a patent therefor.''\n  Abraham Lincoln, the only President to be issued a patent, declared \nthat ``patents add the fuel of interest to the fire of genius.'' The \npatent system has continued to evolve over the last century and one-\nhalf as we have adapted to changing times and advances in technology. \nAll the while American innovators have remained at the forefront of \nuseful invention.\n  I, for one, would like to keep American innovators in the lead. Our \njobs and our economic security depend on it. As we enter a new \nmillennium, however, fewer and fewer of America's innovators feel \nconfident that our patent system is keeping pace.\n  According to the Commissioner of the Patent and Trademark Office \n(PTO), in the last fiscal year, the PTO received 237,045 patent \napplications--a 14.9 percent increase over the previous year. Inventors \nare rightly demanding that the PTO conduct quicker and more careful \nsearches. After all, in today's digital world, an innovator cannot \nafford to wait two years for his or her patent application to be \nprocessed. And once that application has been processed, an applicant \nwants to know that the patent will hold up and that the patent holder \nwill not be caught up in litigation for years attempting to defend it.\n  It is for this reason that American inventors of all shapes and \nsizes, large and small, independent inventors and large corporations, \nhave been pleading with Congress to improve our current patent system. \nThey are asking us to help cut the red tape at the PTO, provide our \ninventors with stronger patent applications, reduce the cost of \nresolving patent disputes, and put an end to rules that favor foreign \napplicants over American applicants. What they have been asking us to \ndo is to pass the Omnibus Patent Reform Act of 1997, S. 507.\n  Who wants this bill? American innovators and businesses large and \nsmall.\n  The White House Conference on Small Business Technology Chairs wrote \nto me on May 7, 1998 urging passage of S. 507 because, and I am quoting \nfrom their letter:\n\n       We believe that S. 507, as amended, will lower the \n     litigation costs for small businesses, make it easier to know \n     what areas of technology are open for innovation, and will go \n     a long way towards giving us a more level playing field vis-\n     a-vis our foreign competitors. We wholeheartedly support \n     passage of the bill and appreciate the attention and support \n     you have given to small business.\n\n  The Chief Executives of 48 of America's largest companies wrote the \nSenate Majority Leader, asking him to schedule a vote on the bill \nbefore the Senate adjourns in the fall because ``S. 507 makes several \nmajor improvements in U.S. patent law that will greatly benefit \nAmerican companies and inventors.''\n  So what has been stopping this bill? Well, one of the most outspoken \nopponents of the bill has been the Eagle Forum. The Senate Republican \nleadership should not clip the wings of technology for the benefit of \nthe Eagle Forum. That would be no way to honor America's independence \nand no way to honor America's proud tradition of innovation.\n  Instead, let us celebrate America's independence by helping out the \nmillions of Americans who owe their jobs and prosperity to industries \ncreated by America's innovators and creators. The Senate should take up \nand pass S.507.\n  I inserted into the Congressional Record on June 23, letters of \nsupport from the White House Conference on Small Businesses, the \nNational Association of Women Business Owners, the Small Business \nTechnology Coalition, National Small Business United, the National \nVenture Capital Association, and the 21 Century Patent Coalition.\n  I ask that additional letters of support for S. 507 be included in \nthe Record following the conclusion of my statement. These letters are \nfrom The Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America; the \nPharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, PhRMA; the \nAmerican Automobile Manufacturers Association; the Software Publishers \nAssociation; the Semiconductor Industry Association; the Business \nSoftware Alliance; the American Electronics Association; and the \nInstitute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. and Industry \nCorporation.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Chamber of Commerce of the\n\n\n                                     United States of America,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 24, 1997.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Trent: As you know, this time of year brings a flurry \n     of bills to the fore, each with its own strengths and \n     argument why it deserves floor time prior to adjournment. One \n     bill that clearly merits your consideration for debate is S. \n     507, the Omnibus Patent Act of 1997.\n       In the chamber's view, the Hatch/Leahy bill has \n     successfully bridged the debate between proponents of \n     modernizing the patent system (the Chamber has long supported \n     this) and a relatively small group of independent inventors \n     who feared their patent rights might be abridged. The \n     resulting compromise will help strengthen our competitiveness \n     and create jobs while encouraging the inventiveness that \n     always has been an American hallmark. We urge your support \n     for this important legislation.\n       The House has already passed their corresponding bill. S. \n     507 was reported from the Judiciary Committee earlier this \n     year by a bipartisan vote of 17 to 1. We believe the time is \n     right now to move these needed reforms, adding another solid \n     accomplishment to this session.\n       Thank you again for your support.\n           Sincerely,\n     R. Bruce Josten.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Pharmaceutical Research and\n\n\n                                     Manufacturers of America,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 2, 1998.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     U.S. Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: On behalf of the research-based \n     pharmaceutical industry, we urge you to schedule a vote on S. \n     507, The Omnibus Patent Act of 1997. This bill, which passed \n     out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 22, 1997 by \n     voice-vote, will strengthen U.S. patent law, advance \n     innovation, and increase our global competitiveness.\n       We appreciate your interest in moving legislation that will \n     not result in undue delay in the Senate. We question, \n     however, whether opposition can ultimately be sustained on \n     the Senate floor against S. 507 given its importance to \n     American industry and innovation. Of particular interest to \n     the pharmaceutical industry are provisions that would: \n     Strengthen the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) by making it \n     a government corporation ``with resulting operational and \n     fiscal flexibility;'' restore patent life lost as a result of \n     unusual administrative delays at PTO; and provide for \n     publication of patent applications 18 months after their \n     filing to allow U.S. companies to have access to applications \n     filed in the U.S. by foreign applicants.\n       Our industry, which in 1998 will spend over $20 billion in \n     research and development, depends on strong patent protection \n     to ensure that pharmaceutical companies are able to maximize \n     their efforts to discover new medicines that prevent, cure, \n     and treat disease. S. 507 will foster that and deserves floor \n     consideration soon.\n       Thank you for you attention to this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n         Raymond Gilmartin, Chairman President and CEO, Merck & \n           Co., Inc., PhRMA Chairman; David R.

Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: The American Automobile Manufacturers \n     Association and its members, Chrysler Corporation, Ford Motor \n     Company and General Motors Corporation, urge you to support \n     S. 507, the ``Omnibus Patent Act of 1997,'' co-sponsored by \n     Senators Hatch and Leahy. The House passed patent reform \n     earlier this year, and the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     favorably reported S. 507 by a vote of 17 to 1. The bill has \n     been modified in numerous ways to accommodate the concerns of \n     small inventors, universities, and other interested groups.\n       We believe S. 507 is a fair and balanced bill that will \n     significantly improve the U.S. patent system. Modernization \n     of the Patent and Trademark Office will permit it to offer \n     improved services to patent applicants and owners. The \n     publication provisions will help avoid duplicative research \n     efforts and will accelerate the development of technology by \n     speeding the dissemination of research advances. Those who \n     file only in the U.S. can avoid early publication if they \n     desire, and new provisional royalty rights will ensure that \n     no inventor is deprived of the economic value of his or her \n     invention between the date of publication and patent \n     approval. The bill also provides a safe harbor for domestic \n     users of new manufacturing processes through the provision of \n     prior user-rights. And, an improve patent reexamination \n     process will provide a low-cost, speedy alternative to \n     expensive litigation for determining the validity of any \n     challenged patent.\n       The provisions of S. 507 will substantially improve our \n     nation's patent system. This will serve the interests of \n     inventors and technology users alike. More importantly, it \n     will benefit the entire American public by further \n     encouraging technological advances and the products such \n     advances bring. We urge you to vote for S. 507.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Andrew H. Card, Jr.,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              Software Publishers Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 1998.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: On behalf of the Software Publishers \n     Association (SPA), I am writing to ask you to urge Senate \n     Majority Leader Trent Lott to schedule a floor vote on S. \n     507, the Omnibus Patent Act, early this summer, and call on \n     you to vote to enact its important patent reforms into law.\n       SPA has more than 1,200 member companies, ranging from \n     large well-known companies to hundreds of smaller companies \n     and Internet start-ups, that develop and market software for \n     business, education, entertainment and the Internet. Patents \n     represent an increasingly important means for these companies \n     to protect the intellectual property in their software-\n     related inventions. In fact, a 1997 survey of over 800 \n     software companies found that over 20 percent either owned or \n     had applied for a patent.\n       As the collective voice of one of the fastest growing, most \n     competitive industries in the world, SPA supports S. 507 \n     because it would enact patent reforms that would encourage \n     investment and innovation in the software industry and other \n     industries that will create more high-paying jobs in America. \n     This legislation would make significant improvements in U.S. \n     patent law, including early publication of pending patents, \n     expanded reexamination, and a provisional right to a \n     reasonable royalty.\n       Leading members of SPA long ago came out in favor of S. \n     507, and Eric Ruff, CEO of Utah-based PowerQuest Corp., \n     testified in support of the bill before the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee (his statement is enclosed). In May 1997, the \n     Judiciary Committee favorably reported S. 507 by a vote of 17 \n     to one. S. 507 continues to enjoy strong bipartisan support.\n       In closing, I urge you to support S. 507 without amendments \n     that would undermine its objective--a patent system that \n     produces high quality, carefully and examined patents. The \n     House has already passed a similar bill, but time is running \n     out for the Senate to ensure that these important patent \n     reforms become law this year.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                        Ken Wasch,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Semiconductor Industry\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                      San Jose, CA, July 24, 1997.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Re Omnibus Patent Act of 1997.\n\n       Dear Senator: The Semiconductor Industry Association urges \n     you to support S. 507, the ``Omnibus Patent Act of 1997'', by \n     Senators Orrin Hatch, and Patrick Leahy.\n       The U.S. semiconductor industry employs over 235,000 \n     Americans, including in California. Semiconductors are the \n     enabling technology for the nearly $400 billion U.S. \n     electronics industry, an industry that provides jobs for 2.5 \n     million Americans.\n       The U.S. semiconductor industry invests over 11% of sales \n     on R, $7 billion in 1996 and leads the world in microchip \n     technology. A strong and efficient U.S. patent system is \n     essential for the U.S. to maintain this technology \n     leadership. S. 507 will create a Patent and Trademark Office \n     that is more efficient and responsive to the needs of U.S. \n     investors, mandate the speedy issuance for patents, and \n     reduce lawsuits and legal bills paid by American inventors \n     and companies. American companies will become more \n     competitive by speeding up research and development and \n     brining new products to market faster.\n       S. 507 is a carefully crafted measure that will encourage \n     new inventions and protect American innovators and \n     corporations while at the same time addressing the special \n     concerns of small inventors, small business and universities. \n     S. 507 cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee in May and a \n     similar measure, H.R. 400, already passed the House.\n       Please vote for S 507 when it comes to the Senate floor. If \n     you or your staff would like to discuss this legislation and \n     its importance to the semiconductor industry, please do not \n     hesitate to call.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   George Scalise,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Business Software Alliance,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 29, 1998.\n     Hon.

AEA believes that modernizing the U.S. \n     patent system is critical to sustain the innovation that has \n     resulted in this tremendous job growth and the global \n     competitiveness of U.S. high technology companies.\n       S. 507, which was introduced by Senators Orrin Hatch (R-UT) \n     and Patrick Leahy  (D-VT), contains critical reforms that \n     will protect the interests of American inventors and \n     innovators while preparing the U.S. Patent and Trademark \n     Office (PTO) to meet the needs of our nation's high \n     technology firms as we enter the 21st Century. The reforms \n     contained in S. 507 will increase the value of patents to \n     inventors and companies, slash red tape in the PTO, and make \n     it easier for U.S. inventors and companies to research, \n     develop, and commercialize inventions.\n       AEA urges you to support this critical legislation to \n     further advance American technology and strengthen our \n     nation's global competitiveness. If you or your staff have \n     any questions regarding S. 507 or patent reform, please \n     contact Stephanie Stitzer of AEA at (202) 682-4431.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                William T.

We \n     believe that it is now time to call for a vote on this \n     important legislation before the end of the first session of \n     this Congress.\n       IEEE-USA supports the Omnibus Patent Act of 1997 (S. 507) \n     and its publication provisions. Many important compromises \n     have been made and we are now confident that the bill will \n     strengthen the U.S. patent system. S. 507 takes into account \n     many of our members' concerns regarding the disclosure of \n     their technology prior to receiving patent protection. The \n     Omnibus Patent Act provides inventors with the option of \n     delaying the publication of their application until the \n     patent is awarded--as long as they choose to file solely in \n     the United States.\n       The bill provides our 220,000 U.S. members with a \n     strengthened patent system and arrives as a reasonable \n     balance between inventor protection and public disclosure of \n     technology. We believe that his balance will assist in \n     promoting U.S. innovation and competitiveness,\n       If you or your staff would like to discuss this with us \n     further please contact Scott Grayson in our Washington, D.C. \n     office at (202) 785-0017.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Daniel Fisher,\n\n                                                   Chair, IEEE-USA\n     Intellectual Property Committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/10/senate-section/article/S7934-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, very briefly, I see my colleague from Ohio \nhere, I want to add my voice to those who have spoken in praise of \nSenator Jeffords, the chairman of the committee, his staff, and the \nwonderful job they did in leading this piece of legislation and working \nwith Senator Kennedy as the leading Democrat on our side.\n  What we witnessed today is a wonderful example of how the legislative \nprocess ought to work. It is hard to imagine taking on a piece of \nlegislation that has a 5-year lifespan to it, a higher education bill \nthat affects so many millions of Americans. We did this in one day in \nlarge measure because the committee worked very closely together, Mr. \nPresident. A lot of work went into trying to resolve issues as a \ncommittee. There were a couple we couldn't, so we left those to our \ncolleagues, which is the way it should be here when you can't come to a \nfinal resolution.\n  That shows remarkable leadership on the part of the chairman and the \nranking Democrat, that they can take a bill as complicated and as \ncomprehensive as this, one as long in duration as this and bring it to \nthe floor and, in the space of virtually 12 hours, provide the kind of \nunanimous--it may have been unanimous, I don't know what the vote was \nhere--almost unanimous vote in support of the Higher Education Act for \nour Nation.\n  I want others to know that this is a good example of how we ought to \nwork here. I hope others will heed this example.\n  For Dan Coats, who is not on the floor this evening, our colleague \nfrom Indiana, this will be the last higher education bill he will be \ninvolved in, as he made the decision to leave the U.S. Senate at the \nend of his term. Certainly, there will be other bills between now and \nwhen the session ends. I am certain Senator Coats feels a sense of \npride, as he should, having played a major role in the last higher \neducation bill he will be involved in in the U.S. Senate. I commend him \nfor his efforts.\n  Let me join in commending staff: Mark Powden for his fine work, Susan \nHattan, Scott Giles, Jenny Smulson, Corey Heyman.\n  Senator Kennedy's staff: Marianna Pierce did a wonderful job on the \nDemocratic side working on this and keeping us well informed and trying \nto work out amendments during the committee process and on the floor.\n  Jennifer Kron and Jane Oates did a wonderful job, as did Townsend \nLange from Senator Coats' staff. And you will all understand why I pay \na special tribute to Suzanne Day of my office who does a fabulous job \non these issues, and has for many, many years. She was joined this year \nby a new member of our staff who did a terrific job, Megan Murray, who \nis here with us on the floor this evening. I want to thank her, as \nwell, for the tremendous effort she put into making this a successful \nbill.\n  So, Mr. President, I commend our colleagues, and staff particularly, \nfor really doing a very, very fine job. And in these days of acrimony \nand partisanship and invective behavior, it is wonderful to know there \nare examples of where this institution shines and shows its best. It \ndid so under the leadership of the distinguished Senator from Vermont \nand the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/10/senate-section/article/S7937-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      Executive Messages Referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting one \nwithdrawal and sundry nominations which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/10/senate-section/article/S7937-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7937-S7939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-5934.

A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Michigan; to the Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 72\n\n       Whereas, The Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 (FQPA) as \n     passed by Congress and was signed into law on August 3, 1996, \n     by President Clinton; and\n       Whereas, Among the purposes of the FQPA is to assure that \n     pesticide tolerance decisions and policies are based upon \n     sound science and reliable data; and\n       Whereas, Another purpose of the FQPA is to assure tolerance \n     decisions and policies are formulated in an open and \n     transparent manner; and\n       Whereas, The EPA is required by the FQPA to have reviewed \n     approximately 3,000 of the approximately 9,700 existing \n     tolerances by August 1999 to determine whether these \n     tolerances meet the safety standards established by the FQPA; \n     and\n       Whereas, The implementation of the FQPA could have a \n     profound negative impact on domestic agricultural production \n     and on consumer food prices and availability. With Michigan's \n     diverse agriculture, this impact could be especially severe \n     on our numerous specialty crops; now, therefore be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That we memorialize the Congress of the United \n     States to take the following actions:\n       1. Direct the EPA to initiate immediately appropriate \n     administrative rulemaking to ensure that the policies and \n     standards the agency intends to apply in evaluating pesticide \n     tolerances are subject to thorough public notice and comment \n     prior to final tolerance determinations being made by the \n     agency.\n       2. Direct the EPA to use its authority under the FQPA to \n     provide interested persons the opportunity to produce data \n     needed to evaluate a pesticide tolerance so that the agency \n     can avoid the use of unrealistic default assumptions in \n     making pesticide tolerance decisions.\n       3. Direct the EPA to implement the FQPA in a manner that \n     will not disrupt agricultural production nor have a negative \n     impact on the availability, diversity, and affordability of \n     food.\n       4. Conduct oversight hearings immediately to ensure that \n     actions taken by the EPA are consistent with the FQPA \n     provisions and congressional intent. If the intent of the \n     legislation is not carried out, then Congress should postpone \n     the August 1999 deadline. Following oversight hearings, \n     Congress should, if necessary, take appropriate actions or \n     amend the FQPA to correct problem areas.\n       5. Encourage the Secretary of Agriculture and the United \n     States Department of Agriculture to increase its commitment \n     of manpower and budgetary resources to work with the EPA to \n     gather scientific data. Furthermore, Congress should \n     encourage the United States Department of Agriculture to \n     conduct an economic impact statement on the implementation of \n     the FQPA.\n       6. Clarify the role of Section 18 of the Federal \n     Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act as its provisions \n     relate to the reestablishment of tolerances under the FQPA.; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the members of the \n     Michigan congressional delegation, and the United States \n     Environmental Protection Agency.\n       Adopted by the Senate, March 26, 1998.\n       Adopted by the House of Representatives, June 11, 1998.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/10/senate-section/article/S7939-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. LUGAR, from the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, \n     and Forestry, without amendment:\n       S. 2286.

A bill to establish a commission, in honor of the 150th \nAnniversary of the Seneca Falls Convention, to further protect sites of \nimportance in the historic efforts to secure equal rights for women; to \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                   women's progress commemoration act\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, one hundred and fifty years ago this month, \na remarkable group of women and men came together and wrote the single \nmost important document of the nineteenth-century American women's \nmovement and one of the most important writings of American freedom: \nThe Seneca Falls Declaration of Sentiments and Resolutions. Modeled \nclosely after the Declaration of Independence, this document is a \ndeclaration of women's independence. Radical at the time, it expounded \nsuch ideas as allowing women to vote, to become educated, and to \nparticipate in economic activities.\n  I believe we should take the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the \nSeneca falls convention to celebrate and focus on the rich and \ncourageous history of American women and their struggle for equality. \nWith this in mind, I am introducing the Women's Progress Commemoration \nAct.\n  I am very happy to be joined in introducing this legislation by my \nprimary cosponsor, Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, and the bipartisan \ngroup of 17 other original cosponsors: Senators Moynihan and D'Amato \nfrom New York, Senator Kennedy, Senator Torricelli, Senator Lieberman, \nSenator Daschle, Senator Collins, Senator Landrieu, Senator Reid, \nSenator DeWine, Senator Moseley-Braun, Senator Mikulski, Senator Boxer, \nSenator Snowe, Senator Murray, Senator Feinstein, and Senator \nLautenberg.\n  This legislation will establish a commission to identify sites that \nhave been instrumental in the women's movement and help to ensure their \nhistoric preservation. The history of American women has barely begun \nto be recorded. Consider these facts: (1) less than 5 percent of our \nNation's historic landmarks chronicle women's achievements, (2) right \nhere in the capitol, of the 197 statues exhibited in statuary hall, \nonly seven are of women leaders, (3) according to a recent study, less \nthan 2 percent of even our contemporary history textbooks are dedicated \nto women's contributions.\n  And yet, despite the virtual infancy of efforts to record women's \nhistory, we are doing even less to preserve the places where that \nhistory was made. That is why this bill is so important. If we don't \npreserve our past, we can lose our way into our future and our \nopportunity to teach not only girls and women but all students and \ncitizens.\n  As I stand here today, numerous buildings and structures of deep \nhistorical significance to the American women's movement are in a state \nof disrepair--they have peeling paint, flooded basements, and \nstructural deficiencies.\n  For example, the Sewall-Belmont House, just a block from the Capitol, \nwas and still is the headquarters of the National Women's Party, which \npressed for woman suffrage. This building was also the residency of \nAlice Paul, the legendary founder of this party. This is a prime \nexample of a critical site in American women's history that is in need \nof preservation. Unfortunately, this house is plagued with water \nproblems, deteriorating electrical wiring, and weather-damaged parts of \nthe structure.\n  As we can see, I brought these two photographs, Mr. President, to \nindicate the condition of the Sewall Belmont Home, which I said is \nabout a block from the Capitol and a house that many of my colleagues \nhave visited over the years. This historic house is where some of the \ntreasures of the women's suffrage movement are located and, sadly, as \nyou can see in these pictures, the house is in desperate need of \nrestoration. Even though, I am happy to report that efforts have begun \nby the Senate to save this house, there are many more examples of such \nsites throughout the country that are literally crumbling way.\n  Another example of a site in need of repair is the McClintock House \nin the Women's Rights Historical Park in upstate New York. This is \nwhere the actual Declaration of Sentiments was drafted during the \nSeneca Falls Convention.\n  Another site that the commission could choose would be the Rankin \nRanch in Helena, Montana--the home of the first woman elected to the \nU.S. House of Representatives.\n  Or perhaps the Harriet Tubman home in Auburn, New York, which is \nalready open to the public but still needs financial support.\n  This commission will highlight sites throughout the country, such as \nthese, that deserve to be preserved.\n  In my home State of Connecticut there are some success stories of \nefforts to preserve women's sites such as the Prudence Crandall home, \nthe first school for African-American girls in this country, or the \nhome of Harriet Beecher Stowe, the author of ``Uncle Tom's Cabin.''\n  Even though my State of Connecticut has been progressive about the \npreservation of women's sites, unfortunately, some of these efforts \nwere too late. Sadly, some historic women's sites in Connecticut were \nnot preserved and are relegated to a signpost or a plaque rather than a \nmuseum.\n  Hopefully, 150 years after the birth of the women's movement we can \ncreate more museums and fewer plaques.\n  Let me take a moment to explain very briefly the structure and goals \nof the commission. The commission will have 15 members appointed by the \nmajority and minority leaders of the Senate and the House and by the \nadministration. Members will be selected based on a knowledge of \nwomen's history and historical preservation. Not later than 1 year \nafter the commission's initial meeting it will provide to the Secretary \nof the Interior a list of sites deserving recognition and preservation. \nIt will also recommend actions to rehabilitate those sites. Thirty days \nafter the submission of this report, the commission will cease to \nexist. The commission will not fund preservation but rather highlight \nthe need, and hopefully the publicity will generate funds--whether it \nbe private, public, or nonprofit--that would be used to help in the \npreservation of these sites.\n  I hope that the sites across this Nation that signify important \npoints in women's history or celebrate remarkable women will be \npreserved for the public to come and learn. I hope that school children \nacross our Nation will be making field trips to historic women's sites, \nalong with their trips to the White House, the Capitol, Monticello, and \nthe significant memorials here in this city and across our Nation.\n  Let's make women's contributions to our history known to generations \nyet unborn--their accomplishments an inspiration and their homes and \nworkplaces opportunities where future generations can come and learn.\n  In July of 1848 the Seneca Falls Convention convened to consider the \nsocial conditions and civil rights of women. As I have said, this \nconvention signaled the beginning of an admirable and courageous \nwomen's movement in this Nation. Today, for the 150th anniversary of \nthis historic meeting, let us take the opportunity to preserve and \nteach the contributions of women to our Nation's history to future \ngenerations of Americans.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2285\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The First Lady will be there.\n  I was in Seneca Falls about 1978 and was having a beer with the \ncounty leader, George Souhan, in the Gould Hotel. Looking down at the \nstreet, I just happened to say to him, ``Where was that chapel where \nthe convention met?'' He said, ``It was just down the street.'' I said, \n``Let's go look.'' Down the street we went. What did we find, but a \nlaundromat. The Wesleyan Chapel had become a laundromat on Fall Street \nand a garage behind.\n  We had it declared a national park in 1980. We went around the city, \nthe village, and found the houses of the ladies of Seneca Falls--the \nBloomer girls and Elizabeth Cady Stanton and the like. We went to \nWaterloo, where in the McClintock House the declaration was drafted. \nThat needs repair; the Park Service should do it.\n  It is quite an achievement, but it makes the point that the Senator \nfrom Connecticut has just made that you better look after these \nimportant sites. That was the first original American political idea--\nthat women were equal in civic rights with men. It didn't come\n\n[[Page S7942]]\n\nfrom Europe. It came right from central New York. It had almost \nvanished as a site until we came along.\n  If the Senator wishes to do more, more power to him. I thank my \nfriend from Colorado.\n  Mr. DODD. If my friend from Colorado will yield once again, we \nrealize the benefit of having the presence of our colleague form New \nYork in our midst. Once again he was ahead in so many areas, and this \nis not an exception. As he pointed out, it was almost washed out. We \nare grateful that he stopped for a libation in Seneca Falls on that day \nin 1978.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Bumpers) (by request):\n  S. 2287. A bill to provide for a more competitive electric power \nindustry, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n               comprehensive electricity competition act\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, at the request of the Administration, I \nam today introducing its proposed electric power industry legislation, \nthe ``Comprehensive Electric Competition Act.'' I do so not because I \nagree with all of the provisions of the Administration's legislation: I \ndon't. I do so as a courtesy to the Administration and because I \nstrongly support competition.\n  Mr. President, let me first say that I am a strong proponent of \nincreased competition in the electric power industry. For the past \ncentury our electric utilities--investor-owned, municipally-owned, \ncooperatively-owned--have served this Nation well. Particularly as \ncompared to the rest of the world, we have reasonably-priced, extremely \nreliable and nearly universal electric service. But with some well \nthought-out changes, our electric power industry can do even better. We \nhave seen in a number of other industries--oil, natural gas, trucking \nand airlines, to name but a few--deregulation has greatly benefitted \nconsumers. Market-based competition has reduced prices, increased \nsupply and sparked innovation. There is no reason why increased \ncompetition in the electric power industry would not similarly benefit \nconsumers, the economy and our international competitiveness.\n  I believe that there is a growing consensus that increased \ncompetition in the electric power industry is in the public interest. \nThis is illustrated by the number of States that have already moved \nforward to promote retail competition. According to the Department of \nEnergy, 18 States have already implemented retail competition, either \nthrough State legislation or by State public utility commission \nregulation. One hundred and twenty-one million people--49 percent of \nthe U.S. population--live in these States. Of the remaining States, all \nbut two (Florida and South Dakota) are now actively considering \ncompetition programs. This consensus is also illustrated by the 20 \nbills introduced to date in the Senate and the House of Representatives \nrelating to this issue. Moreover, it is further illustrated by the \nAdministration's decision to propose this legislation.\n  Mr. President, as I see it, the issue isn't: Do we want competition \nin the electric power industry? We do. Instead, the issue is: How do we \nbring about competition without jeopardizing price and reliability or \nfinancially damaging the industry? There is a consensus on the first \nissue; unfortunately, on the latter there is no consensus.\n  At the risk of oversimplification, there are two camps of thought on \nhow to go about the task of promoting competition. On the one hand, \nthere are those who want to see government-managed competition, not \nmarket-based competition. They believe that government should continue \nto regulate all aspects of the industry--just do it differently. \nMoreover, they prefer the Federal government--FERC--be put in charge \nand the States pushed out of the way. On the other hand, there are \nthose who believe that competition should be market-based. They believe \nthat the most effective and efficient regulator of business is the \ndiscipline of the free market--not the discipline of the government \nregulator. I fall into the latter camp. Having seen all too often the \nresults of failed government regulation--wage-and-price controls, oil \nprice and allocation controls, and natural gas wellhead price controls, \nfor example. I believe that for electric competition legislation to \nbenefit consumers it must deregulate, streamline and empower States to \npromote retail competition. We don't need different regulation; we \ndon't need government-managed competition. We need deregulation; we \nneed market-based competition.\n  Turning now to the Administration's proposed legislation, let me \nfirst say that it contains several provisions that are in keeping with \nmy philosophy. For example, it proposes to repeal the Public Utility \nHolding Company Act (``PUHCA''). This language is very similar to \nlegislation Senator D'Amato introduced, S. 621, which has been reported \nby the Banking Committee and awaits action by the Senate. I am a \ncosponsor of S. 621, along with 22 other Senators. If we did nothing \nelse, repeal of PUHCA would significantly promote competition in the \nelectric power industry. This depression-era law, enacted in 1935, has \nlong outlived its usefulness, and today is actually a significant \nimpediment to competition. Repeal would allow both utilities and non-\nutilities to fully compete without fear of becoming tangled in PUHCA's \nregulatory spider web. More competitors mean more competition, and that \nwould benefit consumers and our economy. Moreover, repeal of PUHCA \nwould not diminish Federal and State consumer protections, which would \nremain in full force and effect.\n  Another provision of the Administration's bill that I strongly \nsupport is its prospective repeal of the mandatory purchase requirement \nof the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 (``PURPA''). \nPURPA is one of the few remaining vestiges of President Jimmy Carter's \nill-fated 1978 ``National Energy Plan'' that we have yet to extinguish. \nPURPA requires electric utilities to purchase electricity from others \nwhether or not they need it, and to pay so-called ``full avoided cost'' \nregardless of the actual market value of the power. This law has, and \nwill until it is repealed, cost consumers billions of dollars in above-\nmarket prices for PURPA electricity. As just one example of how this is \nhurting consumers, just the other day the FERC refused to rescind the \nPURPA QF status of a powerplant even though the so-called ``useful'' \nthermal output of the facility is to produce distilled water that, at \ntimes, is just being dumped down the sewer. As a result, electric \nconsumers in Brazos, Texas will pay an extra $890 million for \nelectricity over the life of the PURPA contract--$148 per year for the \naverage family of four living in Brazos. It is also essential that \nPURPA's mandatory purchase requirement be repealed as it is a key \ncontributor to the so-called ``stranded cost'' problem that is plaguing \nindustry restructuring efforts. Clearly, like PUHCA, it is time to \nrepeal this anti-consumer and anti-competitive provision of PURPA.\n\n  While there are provisions such as these in the Administration's \nproposed legislation that I do support, there are many provisions that \nI am very concerned about--some of which raise serious Constitutional \nissues, others of which I just cannot support. For example, the \nAdministration's bill imposes a Federal mandate on States; it imposes a \nnew $3+ billion per year Federal electricity tax on consumers; and it \nhas a 5\\1/2\\ percent ``renewable set-aside'' mandate (that curiously \nignores hydroelectric power as a renewable). Moreover, the \nAdministration's proposed legislation includes numerous provisions that \nvastly expand FERC jurisdiction, largely at the expense of States.\n  I am also troubled by the Administration's proposed legislation \nbecause of what it does not contain. The Administration's transmittal \nletter acknowledges that its legislation does not address several key \nissues. For example, the Administration's legislation does not resolve \nthe competitive status of the Federal utilities--the Tennessee Valley \nAuthority and the Federal power marketing administrations. Nor, does it \naddress the competitive advantage municipal utilities have from tax-\nexempt bonds and access to Federal preference power. Also, it does not \naddress key issues necessary to ensure viability of nuclear power. I do \nnot see how any bill can be considered ``comprehensive'' if it does not \naddress these and other issues.\n  Mr. President, although I have serious reservations about many \nprovisions of the Administration's proposed\n\n[[Page S7943]]\n\nlegislation, I am willing to introduce it in the spirit of moving \nforward and trying to develop a consensus. That will not be an easy or \na quick task. But, it is one that we must undertake if all consumers--\nresidential, commercial and industrial--are to enjoy the benefits of \nincreased competition in the electric power industry. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Administration's transmittal letter, its section-by-\nsection analysis and its proposed legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2287\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

To be eligible for a \n     Renewable Energy Credit, the unit of electricity generated \n     through the use of renewable energy may be sold or may be \n     used by the generator. If both renewable energy and \n     nonrenewable energy are\n\n[[Page S7947]]\n\n     used to generate the electric energy, the Secretary shall \n     issue credits based on the proportion of renewable energy \n     used.

For purposes of this \n     paragraph, the Secretary shall value a Credit at a price that \n     is representative of the price of a Credit in private \n     transactions. In no event shall the Secretary use a price to \n     establish values for purposes of this paragraph that exceeds \n     the cost cap established under subsection (f).\n       ``(e) Sale or Exchange.--A Renewable Energy Credit may be \n     sold or exchanged by the entity to whom issued or by any \n     other entity who acquires the Credit. A Renewable Energy \n     Credit for any year that is not used to satisfy the \n     minimum renewable generation requirement of subsection (a) \n     for that year may be carried forward for use in another \n     year.\n       ``(f) Renewable Energy Credit Cost Cap.--Beginning January \n     1, 2000, the Secretary shall offer Renewable Energy Credits \n     for sale. The Secretary shall charge 1.5 cents for each \n     Renewable Energy Credit sold during calendar year 2000, and \n     on January 1 of each following year, the Secretary shall \n     adjust for inflation, based on the Consumer Price Index, the \n     price charged per Credit for that calendar year. The \n     Secretary shall deposit in the Public Benefits Fund \n     established under section 610 the amount received from a sale \n     under this subsection. That amount shall be used for the same \n     purpose as other amounts in the Public Benefits Fund.\n       ``(g) Enforcement.--The Secretary may being an action in \n     the appropriate United States district court to impose a \n     civil penalty on a retail electric supplier that does not \n     comply with subsection (a).

Subsection 105 c. does not apply to an application for \n     a license to construct or operate a utilization or production \n     facility under section 103 or 104 b. following the date of \n     enactment of this subsection. This Act does not affect the \n     Commission's authority to enforce antitrust conditions \n     included in licenses issued under section 103 or 104 b. \n     before the date of enactment of this subsection.\n\n     SEC. 705. ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS SAVINGS CLAUSE.\n\n       Nothing in this Act alters or affects environmental \n     requirements imposed by Federal or State law, including, but \n     not limited to, the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.); \n     the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et \n     seq.); the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \n     Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601 et \n     seq.); the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et seq.); and \n     the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).\n                                  ____\n\n\n     Section-by-Section Analysis of the Comprehensive Electricity \n                            Competition Act\n\n\n                    TITLE 1--RETAIL ELECTRIC SERVICE\n\n     Section 101. Retail competition\n       This section would amend the Public Utility Regulatory \n     Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) to provide for customer choice \n     through a flexible mandate. This provision would require each \n     distribution utility to permit all of its retail customers to \n     purchase power from the supplier of their choice by January \n     1, 2003, but would permit a State regulatory authority (with \n     respect to a distribution utility for which it has ratemaking \n     authority) or a non-regulated utility to opt out of this \n     retail competition mandate if it finds, on the basis on a \n     public proceeding, that consumers of the utility would be \n     served better by the current monopoly system or an \n     alternative State-crafted retail competition plan. The \n     section also would establish a Federal policy that utilities \n     should be able to recover prudently incurred, legitimate, and \n     verifiable retail stranded costs that cannot be mitigated \n     reasonably, but States would continue to determine recovery \n     of retail stranded costs under State law. This section does \n     not retrocede to States authority over Federal enclaves.\n     Section 102. Authority to impose reciprocity requirements\n       This section would amend PURPA to permit a State that has \n     filed a notice indicating it is implementing retail \n     competition to prohibit a distribution utility that is not \n     under the ratemaking authority of the State and that has not \n     implemented retail competition from selling electricity to \n     the consumers covered by the State's notice. This section \n     also would permit a nonregulated utility that has filed a \n     notice of retail competition to prohibit any other utility \n     that has not implemented retail competition from selling \n     electricity to the consumers covered by the nonregulated \n     utility's notice.\n     Section 103. Consumer information\n       This section would amend PURPA to permit the Secretary of \n     Energy to required all suppliers of electricity to disclose \n     information on price, terms, and conditions of sale; the type \n     of energy resource used to generate the electric energy; and \n     the environmental attributes of the generation, including air \n     emissions characteristics. This requirement would be \n     enforceable by the Federal Trade Commission and by individual \n     States.\n\n\n          TITLE II--FACILITATING STATE AND REGIONAL REGULATION\n\n     Section 201. Clarification of State and Federal authority \n         over retail transmission services\n       Subsection (a) would amend section 201(b) of the Federal \n     Power Act (FPA) to clarify that the FPA does not prevent \n     States from ordering retail competition or imposing \n     conditions, such as a fee, on the receipt of electric energy \n     by an ultimate customer within the State. This section also \n     would clarify that FERC has jurisdiction over rates, terms, \n     and conditions for unbundled retail transmission.\n       Subsection (b)(1) would amend section 206 of the FPA to \n     reinforce FERC authority to require public utilities to \n     provide open access transmission services and permit recovery \n     of stranded costs. This section also would provide \n     retroactive effect to Commission Order No. 888.\n       Subsection (b)(2) would amend section 212(h) of the FPA to \n     clarify FERC authority to order retail transmission service \n     to complete an authorized retail sale.\n       Subsection (b)(3) would make conforming amendments to the \n     FPA.\n       Subsection (c) would amend the FPA to extend FERC's \n     jurisdiction over transmision services to municipal and other \n     publicly-owned utilities, cooperatives, the Tennessee Valley \n     Authority, and the Federal Power Marketing Administrations. \n     With this amendment, FERC would assure that the transmission \n     rates, terms, and conditions of these entities are not unjust \n     or unreasonable, taking into consideration the other \n     responsibilities of these entities, but this amendment would \n     not expand FERC's authority over the power business of these \n     entities. However, FERC could suspend or modify application \n     of FERC's open access transmission rules to the Tennessee \n     Valley Authority, the Federal Power Marketing \n     Administrations, and rural electric cooperatives with \n     outstanding loans from the Rural Utilities Service, and their \n     wholesale requirements customers, if FERC finds that adequate \n     stranded cost recovery mechanisms are not yet available for \n     those entities.\n       It should be noted that with regard to the Federal Power \n     Marketing Administrations and TVA, the Administration \n     considers this subsection as placeholder language pending \n     development of language that more thoroughly addresses the \n     question of the appropriate role of the Federal power \n     marketing agencies in the new competitive market.\n\n[[Page S7952]]\n\n     Section 202. Interstate compacts on regional transmission \n         planing\n       This section would amend the FPA to permit FERC to approve \n     interstate compacts that establish regional transmission \n     planning agencies if the agencies meet certain criteria \n     relating to their governance (e.g., uniform authority from \n     each participating state and a workable governance protocol \n     to avoid regulatory stalemate). This section also would \n     permit FERC to terminate a compact if it is inconsistent with \n     the public interest or if there are other specified reasons.\n     Section 203. Backup authority to impose a charge on an \n         ultimate consumer's receipt of electric energy\n       This section would amend the FPA to reinforce FERC's \n     authority to provide a back-up for the recovery of retail \n     stranded costs and public benefits program if a State, or a \n     utility that has outstanding loans made or guaranteed by the \n     Rural Utilities Service, has filed a retail competition \n     notice and concludes that such charges are appropriate but \n     lacks authority to impose a charge on the consumer's \n     receipt of electric energy.\n     Section 204. Authority to establish and require independent \n         system operation\n       This section would amend section 202 of the FPA by \n     permitting FERC to establish an entity for independent \n     operation and control of interconnected transmission \n     facilities and to require a transmitting utility to \n     relinquish control over operation of its transmission \n     facilities to an independent system operator.\n\n\n                       title iii--public benefits\n\n     Section 301. Public benefits fund\n       This section would amend PURPA by establishing a Public \n     Benefits Fund administered by a Federal-State Joint Board \n     that would disburse matching funds to participating States \n     and tribal governments to carry out programs that support \n     affordable electricity service to low-income customers; \n     implement energy conservation and energy efficiency measures \n     and energy management practices; provide consumer education; \n     and develop emerging electricity generation technologies. \n     Funds for the Federal share would be collected from \n     generators, which, as a condition of interconnection with \n     facilities of any transmitting utility, would pay to the \n     transmitting utility a charge, not to exceed one mill per \n     kilowatt-hour. The transmitting utility then would pay the \n     collected amounts to a fiscal agent for the Fund. States and \n     tribal governments would have the flexibility to decide \n     whether to seek funds and how to allocate funds among public \n     purposes. In addition, a rural safety net would be created if \n     the Secretary of Energy determines, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of Agriculture, that significant adverse economic \n     effects on rural areas have occurred or will occur as a \n     result of electric restructuring.\n     Section 302. Federal renewable portfolio standard\n       This section would amend PURPA to establish a Federal \n     Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) to guarantee that a \n     minimum level of renewable generation is developed in the \n     United States. The RPS would require electricity sellers to \n     have renewable credits based on a percentage of their \n     electricity sales. The seller would receive credits by \n     generating power from non-hydroelectric renewable \n     technologies, such as wind, solar, biomass, or geothermal \n     generation; purchasing credits from renewable generators; or \n     a combination of these. The RPS requirement for 2000-2004 \n     would be set at the current ratio of RPS-eligible generation \n     to retail electricity sales. Between 2005-2009, the Secretary \n     of Energy would determine the required annual percentage, \n     which would be greater than the baseline percentage but less \n     than 5.5%. In 2010-2015, the percentage would be 5.5%. The \n     RPS credits would be subject to a cost cap of 1.5 cents per \n     kilowatt hour.\n     Section 303. Net metering\n       This section would amend PURPA by requiring all retail \n     electric suppliers to make available to consumers ``net \n     metering service,'' through which a consumer would offset \n     purchases of electric energy from the supplier with electric \n     energy generated by the consumer at a small, on-site \n     renewable generating facility and delivered to the \n     distribution system.\n     Section 304. Reform of section 210 of PURPA\n       This section would repeal prospectively the ``must buy'' \n     provision of section 210 of PURPA. Existing contracts would \n     be preserved, and the other provisions of section 210 would \n     continue to apply.\n\n\n        title iv--regulation of mergers and corporate structure\n\n     Section 401. Reform of holding company regulation under PUHCA\n       This section would repeal the Public Utility Holding \n     Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA) and would enact in its place the \n     Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1998. Under this Act, \n     FERC and State commissions would be given greater access to \n     the books and records of holding companies and the affiliates \n     of public utilities within the holding companies.\n     Section 402. Electric company mergers\n       This section would amend section 203(a) of the FPA by \n     conferring on FERC jurisdiction over the merger or \n     consolidation of electricity utility holding companies and \n     generation-only companies. This section also would streamline \n     FERC's review of mergers.\n     Section 403. Remedial measures for market power\n       This section would amend the FPA to authorize FERC, on its \n     own motion or upon complaint, to remedy market power in \n     wholesale markets. This section also would authorize FERC, \n     upon petition from a State, to remedy market power in retail \n     markets if retail competition is being implemented, the State \n     finds market power, and the State has insufficient authority \n     to remedy the market power. In these circumstances, FERC \n     could require generators with market power to submit a plan \n     to mitigate market power, which FERC could approve with or \n     without modification. This section would authorize FERC to \n     order divestiture to the extent necessary to mitigate market \n     power.\n\n\n                     title v--electric reliability\n\n     Section 501. Electric reliability organization and oversight\n       This section would amend the FPA to give FERC authority to \n     register and oversee an electric reliability organization to \n     prescribe and enforce mandatory reliability standards. \n     Membership in the organization would be open to all \n     entities that use the bulk-power system and would be \n     required for all entities critical to system reliability. \n     Until the reliability organization is registered, existing \n     standards established by the North American Electric \n     Reliability Council and regional reliability councils \n     would be mandatory and enforced by the Commission.\n     Section 502. Statutory presumption\n       This section would establish a rebuttable presumption that \n     actions taken to comply with the mandatory reliability \n     standards would be deemed just and reasonable for purposes of \n     the FPA. This section would also establish a rebuttable \n     presumption that the activities of an electric reliability \n     organization and the activities of a member of the \n     organization in pursuit of organization objectives are in \n     compliance with the antitrust laws of the United States.\n\n\n                   title vi--environmental protection\n\n     Section 601. Nitrogen oxides trading program\n       This section would clarify Environmental Protection Agency \n     authority to require a cost-effective interstate trading \n     system for nitrogen oxide pollutant reductions addressing the \n     regional transport contributions needed to attain and \n     maintain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards for \n     ozone.\n\n\n                 title vii--other regulatory provisions\n\n     Section 701. Treatment of nuclear decommissioning costs in \n         bankruptcy\n       This section would amend the Bankruptcy Act to provide that \n     decommissioning costs be a nondischargeable priority claim.\n     Section 702. Study of impacts of competition in electricity \n         markets by the Energy Information Administration\n       This section would amend the Department of Energy \n     Organization Act to direct the Energy Information \n     Administration to collect and publish information on the \n     impacts of wholesale and retail competition.\n     Section 703. Antitrust savings clause\n       This section would provide that nothing in this Act would \n     supersede the operation of the antitrust laws.\n     Section 704. Elimination of antitrust review by the Nuclear \n         Regulatory Commission\n       This section would eliminate Nuclear Regulatory Commission \n     antitrust review of an application for a license to construct \n     or operate a commercial utilization or production facility.\n     Section 705. Environmental law savings clause\n       This section would provide that nothing in this Act would \n     alter environmental requirements of Federal or State law.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      The Secretary of Energy,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 26, 1998.\n     Hon. Albert Gore,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Enclosed is legislation to bring \n     competition and consumer choice to the electricity industry, \n     the ``Comprehensive Electricity Competition Act'' (``CECA''). \n     It is based upon the legislative specifications the \n     Administration provided Congress on March 25, 1998, when we \n     released our Comprehensive Electricity Competition Plan.\n       The basic Federal regulatory framework for the electric \n     power industry was established with the enactment of the \n     Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and Title II of \n     the Federal Power Act. These statutes are premised upon \n     State-regulated monopolies rather than competition. Now, \n     however, economic forces are beginning to forge a new era in \n     the electricity industry, one in which generation prices will \n     be determined primarily by the market rather than by \n     legislation and regulation. Consequently, federal electricity \n     laws need to be updated so that they stimulate, rather than \n     stifle, competition.\n       In this new era of retail competition, consumers will \n     choose their electricity supplier. The Department of Energy \n     estimates that in making these choices, consumers will save \n     at least $20 billion a year on their electricity bills. This \n     translates into direct savings to the typical family of four \n     of $104 per year and additional indirect savings from lower \n     costs of other goods and services of $128 per year. \n     Competition will also spark innovation in the American \n     economy and create new industries, jobs, products, and \n     services, just as\n\n[[Page S7953]]\n\n     telecommunications reform spawned cellular phones and other \n     new technologies.\n       Competition will also benefit the environment. Under retail \n     competition, the market rewards a generator who wrings as \n     much energy as possible from every unit of fuel. More \n     efficient fuel use means lower emissions. In addition, \n     competition provides increased opportunities to sell energy \n     efficiency services and green power. Moreover, CECA's \n     renewable portfolio standard and enhanced public benefit \n     funding will lead to substantial environmental benefits. The \n     Department estimates that CECA will reduce greenhouse gas \n     emissions by 25 to 40 million metric tons by 2010.\n       The following are key provisions of CECA:\n       All electric consumers would be able to choose their \n     electricity supplier by January 1, 2003, but a State may opt \n     out of retail competition if it believes its consumers would \n     be better off under the status quo or an alternative State-\n     crafted retail competition plan.\n       States would be encouraged to allow the recovery of \n     prudently incurred, legitimate, and verifiable retail \n     stranded costs that cannot be reasonably mitigated.\n       All participants in transactions on the transmission grid \n     would comply with mandatory reliability standards. The \n     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) would approve and \n     oversee a private, self-regulating organization that would \n     develop and enforce these standards.\n       FERC would have the authority to require transmitting \n     utilities to turn over operational control of transmission \n     facilities to an independent system operator.\n       The Secretary of Energy would be authorized to require all \n     retail electric suppliers to disclose, in a uniform format, \n     information on prices, terms, and conditions of service; the \n     type of energy resource used to generate the electric energy; \n     and the environmental attributes of the generation (including \n     air emissions characteristics).\n       A Renewable Portfolio Standard would be established to \n     ensure that by 2010 at least 5.5 percent of all electricity \n     sales consist of generation from renewable energy sources.\n       A Public Benefits Fund would be established to provide \n     matching funds of up to $3 billion to States and Indian \n     tribes for low-income assistance, energy-efficiency programs, \n     consumer information, and the development and demonstration \n     of emerging technologies, particularly renewable \n     technologies. A rural safety net would be created if the \n     Secretary of Energy determines, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of Agriculture, that significant adverse economic \n     effects on rural areas have occurred or will occur as a \n     result of electric restructuring.\n       Environmental Protection Agency authority would be \n     clarified to require interstate nitrogen oxides trading to \n     facilitate attainment of the ambient standard for ozone in \n     the United States.\n       Federal electricity law would be modernized to achieve the \n     right balance of competition without market abuse, including \n     repealing outdated laws like the Public Utility Holding \n     Company Act of 1935 and the ``must buy'' provision of the \n     Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 and giving \n     FERC enhanced authority to address market power.\n       CECA promotes healthy changes to the electricity industry. \n     It will result in lower prices, a cleaner environment, and \n     increased innovation.\n       The Administration intends to transmit the proposed \n     legislative changes to the tax code described in the March \n     25, 1998 Comprehensive Electricity Competition Plan to the \n     Congress separately at a later date.\n       The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) requires that \n     all revenue and direct spending legislation meet a pay-as-\n     you-go (PAYGO) requirement. That is, no such bill should \n     result in a net budget cost; and if it does, it could \n     contribute to a sequester if it is not fully offset. The net \n     PAYGO effect of this legislative proposal is currently \n     estimated to be zero.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the presentation of this legislation to the \n     Congress and that it is in accord with the program of the \n     President.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Federico Pena.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER:\n  S. 2288. A bill to provide for the reform and continuing legislative \noversight of the production, procurement, dissemination, and permanent \npublic access of the Government's publications, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n          wendell h. ford government publications act of 1998\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Now, Mr. President, it is my distinct pleasure and honor, \ntogether with the distinguished ranking member of the Rules Committee, \nwhich I am privileged to chair, to submit legislation to the Senate. In \nmy capacity as chairman of the committee, I have taken it upon myself, \nafter consultation with colleagues on the committee, to name this bill \nin honor of our distinguished ranking member, Senator Wendell Ford of \nKentucky, who will be retiring from a very distinguished Senate career \nat the conclusion of this Congress.\n  The bill is entitled the ``Wendell H. Ford Government Publications \nReform Act of 1998.'' If I just might hold this bill up, it is quite \nvoluminous. That size reflects the tireless effort of my distinguished \ncolleague from Kentucky and many others--over a period in excess of a \ndecade--including Senator Stevens, the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, who have worked on this concept. I sort of \npicked it up and continued to work with Senator Ford in the course of \nmy privileged service as chairman.\n\n  Senator Ford has served four terms in the U.S. Senate. During that \ntime he has dedicated himself to many causes, but this has been one \nvery dear to his heart. I think it is a magnificent way of paying a \nrespectful tribute to this Senator.\n  We want to ensure that our Government produces its publications in \nthe most cost-effective manner possible and that to the best of its \nability the Government makes these publications accessible to the \nAmerican public. They pay for them. But over the course of a number of \nyears, like so many institutions' procedures and practices, it has \ngotten sort of tangled up. This prodigious document, hopefully, will be \naccepted by the Senate and accepted by the House and will go a long way \nto put this system back on track.\n  Over the past decade there has been a steady and precipitous \nmigration of printing, publication service procurement, and publication \ndissemination away from the Government Printing Office, which was \nestablished for the very purpose of making these documents available.\n  In part, this migration occurred because of evolutions in technology. \nIn part, this migration occurred because of the identified weakness and \nconstant inability of the Joint Committee on Printing to enforce the \nwork of the agencies and the departments of the executive branch in \ntelling them to procure and disseminate their publications through the \nGPO. In part, this migration occurred because of the open encouragement \nby the current administration--through decisions and through the \nNational Performance Review known as the NPR--for agencies to use \nprinting and dissemination facilities other than the Government \nPrinting Office. And in part, this migration occurred because the GPO \nhas been slow to change and be more responsive to the ever-changing \nagency and Congressional needs, demands, and expectations.\n  When I make reference to agencies and departments of the Government, \nI am talking about all three branches of the Government. We are not \nsingling out any one as being less participatory of the desired result \nin publication and cost effectiveness. We are all in it together. This \nstraightens it out.\n  Despite the best efforts of Senator Ford and a long line of other \nSenators, successive administrations just have not been able to grapple \nand change the process and these problems are with us today.\n  When I became chairman of the Senate Committee on Rules and \nAdministration, Senator Ford urged that together we continue the work \nthat he and others had started. Indeed, Senator Ford and I became \npartners in resolving these issues. We directed our staffs to work \ntogether, to analyze the problems and identify the key solutions to \nbringing successful reform to the Government's printing, publishing, \nand dissemination services.\n  Senator Ford and I held a series of hearings during which we built a \nrecord to support the very bill that we introduce today. This bill \nprimarily has four goals.\n  First, it resolves the conflicts between the branches of Federal \nGovernment--executive, legislative, and judicial--and brings about cost \nsavings in printing and production. It seems to me it eliminates the \nproblems with public access. It is in here in great detail.\n  Secondly, it guarantees the right of the public to access \npublications paid for by the taxpayers. We have to stress, they paid \nfor this, so why shouldn't they have it? It requires that the \nSuperintendent of Government Publications Access Programs--what a \ntitle; I will repeat that--the Superintendent of Government \nPublications Access Programs be notified when an agency creates a new \npublication whether on\n\n[[Page S7954]]\n\npaper or electronically. That major advancement of dissemination in \nelectronics has not been an easy one to deal with in this bill.\n  Third, it promotes public availability of Government information in \nthe electronic age through a Federal publications access program \nrequiring no-fee availability, regardless of format, by requiring \nagencies to provide the same notification to the Superintendent for \nelectronic publications that they are required to provide for printed \npublications, and by requiring the Superintendent to head a study which \nwill recommend to Congress additional legislation which may be needed \nto further safeguard the public's access rights.\n  Finally, the fourth goal is to facilitate the production and public \naccess to Government publications by promoting the efficient and \neconomic production of publications in an effective and equitable \nsystem of dissemination.\n  It was James Madison who established as an essential element of \nAmerica's democracy the principle of an informed citizenry. According \nto scholars, Madison's vision for the success of this Nation rested on \nthe ability of an informed citizenry to participate in the democratic \nprocess and to hold Government accountable for its actions. Democracy \nrequires the free flow of information. Access to the Government's \npublications is fundamental to our free society.\n  Senator Ford and I and other members of the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration, together with our staff, worked diligently and in a \nmost nonpartisan manner to craft this legislation. The legislation is a \nculmination of nearly 18 months of discussion and negotiation. We \nconsulted with the private sector, the printing industry, the \ninformation industry, representatives of the administration, the \njudicial branch, various legislative branch organizations, GPO, and, \nmost importantly, the unions who really safeguard the future of \nemployees throughout the printing system and other systems involved in \nthis. My understanding is, and I think Senator Ford will have similar \ncomments, that they recognize the need for change and have been a very \nconstructive and helpful working partner in achieving this result. This \nbill, we feel, reflects a consensus among these interests and is to my \nmind one of the best examples of bipartisan cooperation in good public \npolicy.\n  At this time, of course, both Senator Ford and I want to recognize \nthe invaluable services of Eric Peterson, staff director of the Joint \nCommittee on Printing, Kennie Gill of Senator Ford's staff, Grayson \nWinterling and Ed Edens of my staff, and the many others who have \nworked on this during the past 18 months. We look forward to receiving \nthe support of our colleagues in passing and enacting this important \nreform legislation in the concluding days of this Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The very distinguished Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Chair for the description.\n  Mr. President, it is a great pleasure for me to join with my \ncolleague, the distinguished chairman of the Rules Committee. He is my \nfriend. He is a gentleman in the best tradition of Virginia. I \nappreciate the honor that he has proposed for me this morning. It will \nbe the first piece of legislation in 24 years that carries my name. I \nhope it doesn't impede the progress, however. I am grateful to the \nSenator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, for his gracious remarks this \nmorning. Hopefully, that tenor will continue through the consideration \nof this legislation by all of our colleagues, because our heart is \nright as it relates to the introduction of this legislation.\n  I hope our minds have put together a piece of legislation that will \nbe lasting. But there is one thing about this institution; once it \nsettles in and you find some problems with it, you always have the \nopportunity to correct those problems. Most of the time, we do not \n``throw the baby out with the bath water''; we take the changes and do \nthem in an appropriate way.\n  So I join my colleague in introducing this legislation today to \nensure one thing, Mr. President--that the American public continues to \nhave access to the Government information. As my friend has said, it \npays to produce. It is the people's access to Government, Government \ninformation, that forms the basis of our system of Government and \nensures that democracy survives.\n  A Kentuckian that was born in Virginia--we claim him in Kentucky, \nhowever--and a statesman, Henry Clay, said:\n\n       Government is a trust, and the officers of the Government \n     are trustees; and both the trust and the trustees are created \n     for the benefit of the people.\n\n  This legislation ensures that the decisions of the trustees of \nGovernment in all 3 branches will continue to be available for the \nbenefit of the people who placed them there.\n  Since 1813, Congress has assured that our decisions have been \navailable to the public through the depository libraries. In 1857, \ndepository libraries began disseminating other Federal information and, \nin 1895, the Superintendent of Public Documents was moved from the \nDepartment of the Interior to the Government Printing Office.\n  Throughout our history, Mr. President, libraries have been the \npermanent repositories of the written history of our development as a \nNation and the gateways to accessing the decision of its leaders. How \nimportant libraries are. You can be self-educated if you could read and \ngo to the libraries and be able to secure information. Books that will \ndo that. For almost 200 years, libraries have been the principal means \nby which citizens have come to learn of the decisions of their \nGovernment. Armed with that knowledge, the American public expresses \nits will through the democratic election process, which is the bedrock \nof our society.\n  For over 100 years, GPO has printed or procured the printing of \nGovernment information and then automatically--and I underscore \n``automatically''--made that information available, at no charge to the \nAmerican people, through the 1,400 depository libraries located across \nthis great land. And that information is maintained permanently by the \nregional depository libraries in order to ensure that future \ngenerations have access to it.\n  What I am trying to do here this afternoon is to say why this bill is \nso important. It has been so important to our past and it will be so \nimportant to our future. In turn, the depository libraries provide \nnumerous access services, at no cost to the Federal Government, to the \npublic who uses them to keep informed of their Government's decisions. \nIn fact, the depository libraries, and numerous other public and \nprivate libraries that work in cooperation with the depositories, are \nthe trustees of Government information for the people. For all of the \ncriticisms of GPO, no one can dispute that a centralized printing and \ndissemination system for Government information has worked to keep the \nAmerican people informed about their Government.\n  Mr. President, it was Thomas Jefferson who said, ``To inform the \nminds of people, and to follow their will, is the chief duty of those \nplaced at their head.'' That is the purpose of this legislation, the \nvery root of the growth of this legislation. We, in a bipartisan \nmanner, a friendly manner, desire to be sure that our citizens are \ninformed, and that is the reason we are introducing this legislation \ntoday--to ensure that the American people are informed of the actions \nof their trustees so they can, in turn, inform us of their will.\n  This constant exchange of Government information and the people's \ninformed will is the cornerstone of our representative democracy, and \nwithout the free flow of information about the actions of their \nGovernment, the people's will cannot be ascertained, and democracy is \njeopardized.\n  While the centralized printing and dissemination system provided \nthrough GPO has served us well over the years, advances in technology, \nand recent Supreme Court rulings regarding separation of powers, have \ntaxed the ability of a central agency to ensure that all Government \ninformation gets into the hands of the American public. So what did we \ndo? We sat down, as we are supposed to do, to work out a way to \ncontinue to strengthen democracy and work the will of the American \npeople's representatives. Some have responded that it is time to \ndecentralize the dissemination of Government information and disjoin \nthe procurement and dissemination functions. I could not disagree more \nstrongly.\n  Instead, it is time to reform the system and bring it into the 21st \ncentury\n\n[[Page S7955]]\n\nso that both Government and the American people, through the depository \nlibrary system, can be served for another 100 years through enhanced \ninformation dissemination and access.\n  Title 44 and the Government Printing Office have not undergone a \nmajor revision in over 30 years. During this time, the Rules Committee \nhas held numerous hearings, as my distinguished friend has said, on \nGovernment printing policies and public access to Government \ninformation. In the past 2 years, the committee has heard from the \ngeneral public, those in the library community, and at GPO, and from \nofficials in the executive and judicial branches, about the challenges \nand also the opportunities facing agencies who must comply with title \n44.\n  Mr. President, at the beginning of the 105th Congress--this \nCongress--I outlined what I believed were the 3 principal issues that \nhad to be addressed by any reform legislation.\n  First, elimination of the constitutional barriers to compliance with \ntitle 44 created by the administrative oversight functions of the Joint \nCommittee on Printing; secondly, the expansion of title 44 to recognize \nthe changes in technology, particularly the explosion of electronic \npublishing and the Internet as a means of disseminating Government \ninformation to the people; third, the need for enforcement--I \nunderscore enforcement--of title 44 to ensure that executive agencies \ncomply with the centralized printing and dissemination requirements \nthat otherwise lead to the creation of fugitive documents. I use that \nword lovingly.\n  The legislation Senator Warner and I are introducing today is \ndesigned to address these 3 issues in a manner that will ensure, in my \nopinion, the continued free flow of information to the public while at \nthe same time recognizing the efficiencies and enhanced opportunity for \ndissemination that technology creates. The legislation reaffirms \ncongressional intent, and 100 years of experience, that a centralized \npublishing production and procurement agency best ensures that the \nAmerican public gets the greatest efficiencies for its tax dollar and \nthe broadest access to Government information. The proposed legislation \nrestructures the Government Printing Office to provide increased \naccountability and efficiencies, while affording the Congress the \nmaximum oversight of the agency's policies and regulations.\n  This legislation removes the disincentives to compliance with title \n44 by eliminating the constitutional problems created by the Joint \nCommittee on Printing. The bill would eliminate the Joint Committee on \nPrinting and download those authorities to the agency, with enhanced \nlegislative oversight--let me underscore that--enhanced legislative \noversight and authority over congressional printing by the Senate \nCommittee on Rules and Administration and the Committee on House \nOversight.\n  Most importantly, the proposed legislation recognizes the changes in \ntechnology and updates title 44 to ensure that as government \ninformation moves from printed material to electronically disseminated \npublications, the American public will continue to be able to access \nthat information, at no charge, through the depository libraries. The \nrole of the depository libraries is ``key'' to the success of \ngovernment's transition from printed material to new technologies. \nAmerica's libraries provide the safety net that guarantees that this \nNation does not become a country of information ``haves'' and ``have \nnots.''\n  Finally, the bill creates enforcement mechanisms that will ensure \nthat agencies comply with title 44 so that the American people continue \nto have access to the decisions of their government, regardless of \nwhether those decisions are printed, posted on the Internet, or \ntransmitted through some yet undiscovered technology.\n  I congratulate my colleague, the distinguished Chairman, and his \ncapable staff for their dedication and diligence in crafting this \nlegislation. No committee is blessed with better staff. We do fuss and \nfume every once in a while, but we always come out at the right place.\n\n  I want to publicly acknowledge the substantial contribution that the \nlibrary community has made to this effort, particularly the American \nLibrary Association and the Inter-Association Working Group on \nGovernment Information Policy, chaired by Mr. Dan P. O'Mahony of Brown \nUniversity.\n  I look forward to hearings on this measure in the Rules Committee and \nencourage my colleagues to cosponsor this measure and pass it into law. \nWe cannot afford to delay; the very survival of democracy rests on our \nactions.\n  I want to also say that those who represent the employees, the \nunions, at the Government Printing Office have been thoroughly involved \nin this decision and just this morning assured me of their enthusiastic \nsupport of this legislation, because they understand that if they don't \ncomply with the needs of the advancement of technology and the desires \nand hopes of the 21st century, they will not last.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to hearings on this measure in the \nRules Committee. I encourage my colleagues to cosponsor this measure \nand to very quickly pass it into law, because I feel we cannot delay. \nWe cannot afford to delay. The very survival of democracy rests on our \nactions here today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, those of us who are privileged to hear the \nremarks of our distinguished colleague from Kentucky might well clearly \ntell in the tenor of his voice and the forcefulness of his remarks the \nsincerity with which he believes in this very important goal.\n  It is my fervent hope that the Senate will act quickly on this \nmeasure.\n  He closed with the comment with regard to unions, which have a very \nimportant role in the past, today, and, indeed, in the future in the \npublication of our documents. It is the credibility which Mr. Ford \nbrings to this institution that enables us to cross that last bridge \nand gain their support.\n  The bottom line is that the men and women who work in this system, \nunion members and all, want to have a more cost-effective, a more \nproductive system, one that is compatible with the rapid movement of \ntechnology all across our land.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I hope that the Senate will turn \nto this legislation at the earliest possible opportunity. The Committee \non Rules and Administration will have a hearing and will promptly issue \na report. At that point, it is my expectation that the distinguished \nmajority leader, in consultation with the Democratic leader, will make \nthe appropriate decisions at the time.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUMPERS:\n  S. 2289. A bill to amend the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, \nrelating to grand jury proceedings, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                     grand jury reform act of 1998\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, recently I introduced S. 2030, the Grand \nJury Due Process Act, to provide witnesses who are subpoenaed by \nfederal grand juries with a right to the presence of counsel in the \ngrand jury room. I am today introducing more comprehensive grand jury \nreform legislation which will remedy several major flaws in the grand \njury system which today undermine the fairness of America's judicial \nsystem.\n  Criminal justice must provide for more than swift and sure \npunishment. It must ensure fairness and due process to the accused as \nwell as to witnesses and victims of crime. In the majority of cases, \nour courts provide a greater measure of justice than any other system \nknown to man. Yet our system remains far from perfect.\n  Of all aspects of America's criminal justice system, the grand jury \nhas become the weakest link in ensuring due process of law. It is \ntelling that most States have discarded grand juries entirely. Yet, the \nFederal Government is constrained by the fifth amendment constitutional \nrequirement for grand juries, so we have to find ways to make the grand \njury system work better.\n  The legislation I am introducing makes five critical grand jury \nreforms:\n  First, it directs the district courts to give basic legal \ninstructions to the grand jurors at the time they begin their work. \nThese instructions will include basic legal principles--the power to \ncall witnesses, the power to investigate, and the power to indict on\n\n[[Page S7956]]\n\nwhatever charges the grand jury deems appropriate. No one would \ndisagree with these basic instructions, but they are not required in \nthe present grand jury system. Instead, grand jurors are told only as \nmuch about the law as the prosecutor chooses to tell them. My bill will \nchange that.\n  Second, this bill gives grand jury witnesses the right to be \naccompanied by counsel in the grand jury room. This section is \nvirtually identical to S. 2030 which I have already introduced. It also \nrequires that a witness subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury be \nadvised of his right to be accompanied by counsel, of the privilege \nagainst self-incrimination and other basic rights when the subpoena is \nissued.\n  Third, this bill strengthens enforcement of the existing rule on \ngrand jury secrecy, which is a matter of first importance to the \nintegrity of the justice system. News reports indicate that grand jury \nsecrecy is now being violated on a regular basis.\n  Fourth, this bill mandates that prosecutors disclose to the grand \njury any substantial evidence they possess which indicates that the \naccused is not, or may not be, guilty. While this may seem elementary \nto most Americans, it is contrary to a Supreme Court decision, United \nStates v. Williams--a very recent decision--which held that the \nprosecutor has no such constitutional obligation.\n  Fifth and finally, this bill entitles a defendant to a transcript of \nthe grand jury testimony of all witnesses who are called against him at \ntrial. This is a matter of basic fairness. Anyone charged with a crime \nshould have a right to know what a witness against him has told the \ngrand jury. Knowing the witness's prior testimony is the essence of the \nright of cross-examination enshrined in the confrontation clause of the \nsixth amendment.\n\n\n                               background\n\n  Grand juries have enormous power and they offer few protections to \nthose who are called as witnesses or who are subject to investigation. \nUnder the fifth amendment to the Constitution, Federal felony \nprosecutions must include indictment by a grand jury. This provision \nwas intended to protect citizens against prosecutions which are without \nmerit or which are politically motivated. The Founding Fathers had \nplenty of experience with prosecutorial misconduct by the English \ncrown. That is the reason they inserted the grand jury into the \nConstitution. The Grand Jury was to be a bulwark against a tyrannical \ngovernment.\n  My own observations of grand juries go back to my years as a small \ntown defense lawyer, but they are reinforced by present day cases and \nnews reports. Too often, I have seen criminal prosecutions which should \nnever have been brought, or witnesses who have been abused by \nprosecutors. Recently, newspapers are filled with stories of secret \ngrand jury testimony--often attributed to prosecution sources--and of \nwitnesses who have been called back to testify a fourth or fifth or \nsixth time before the same grand jury. Many of these witnesses are \nobviously not criminals, at least in a reasonable person's \nunderstanding of the word.\n  To understand today's grand jury system, you must understand history. \nThe grand jury, Mr. President, is one of the common law's most ancient \ninstitutions. Its roots go back even further than Magna Carta. In 1166, \nKing Henry II proclaimed the Assize of Clarendon which required that 12 \n``lawful men'' out of every hundred be sworn to tell whether they knew \nof any crimes committed in their towns. In these early days, grand \njuries operated mostly on the personal knowledge of the grand jurors.\n\n  The grand jury then, like today, only had power to accuse. In those \ndays, trial was by ordeal. The accused either had his hand placed in \nboiling water or was bound and thrown into a lake. If he survived \nwithout injury, this was an acquittal. It was not until the 13th \nCentury that our English forbearers secured the right to a trial by \njury.\n  Trial by ordeal was supposedly abolished long ago, but I wonder \nwhether many of today's grand jury witnesses might dispute this.\n  In English and American history up until the time of the \nConstitution, grand juries were a bulwark of freedom which stood \nbetween oppressive government and the individual. Grand juries often \ndisagreed with English and colonial judges who were in service to the \nCrown. These feuds helped define both the power of the grand jury and \nthe liberties of free people. For example, grand jurors in colonial \nMassachusetts adamantly refused demands by the Crown to indict the \ncolonists who had participated in the Stamp Act riots.\n  Unhappily, the grand jury's role as defender of liberty, has changed \ndramatically for the worse over the years. Too often, the grand jury \nhas become an arm of the executive branch and a rubber stamp for the \nprosecutor. In modern times, the Supreme Court has held that a grand \njury may call witnesses to satisfy the mere suspicion that a crime may \nhave been committed.\n  Grand juries have been judged so superfluous by the states that about \nhalf of them decided long ago to eliminate grand juries and allow \ncriminal charges to be brought directly by prosecutors.\n  The chief judge of the State of New York remarked several years ago \nthat most grand juries would indict ``a ham sandwich'' if the \nprosecutor so requested. A recent Supreme Court decision, United States \nv. Williams, the Court has held that the District Courts have no \nsupervisory power over grand juries, and that grand juries are not even \npart of the judiciary. I disagree strenuously with Justice Scalia's \nconclusions in the Williams case. If grand juries are not accountable \nto the courts, then who are they accountable to?\n\n\n                          Instructions of Law\n\n  Under present Federal law, grand jurors receive no instructions on \nthe law except for whatever the prosecutor may choose to tell them. \nThis bill will provide for the District Court which empanels the grand \njury to give some very basic legal instructions to the jurors before \nthey begin their work. Included among these are the grand jury's duty \nto inquire into criminal offenses that have been committed in the \njurisdiction; the right to call and interrogate witnesses; the right to \nrequest production of documents, including exculpatory evidence; the \nnecessity of finding credible evidence of each element of the crime \nbefore returning an indictment; the right to ask the prosecutor to \ndraft indictments for charges other than those originally presented; \nthe obligations of grand jury secrecy; and such other rights and duties \nas the court deems appropriate.\n  Mr. President, there is no good reason why these instructions should \nnot be given. These rules of law are universally accepted. It makes no \nsense for the grand jury not to be told what its legal powers and \nduties are, and I cannot imagine that this provision would be disputed.\n\n\n                            Right to Counsel\n\n  Mr. President, as I indicated before, the institution of the grand \njury goes back more than 800 years in Anglo-American legal history. but \nit was not until 1963 that the Supreme Court held in Gideon v. \nWainwright that a man may not be sent to prison without having had a \nlawyer at trial. Under Gideon, a person unable to pay for a lawyer must \nhave counsel appointed to represent him, or else the requirement of due \nprocess of law has not been met.\n  In 1964, the Court held in Miranda v. Arizona that criminal \ndefendants must be advised by the police of their right to counsel and \nof the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. These \nrights are basic American freedoms which are the hallmarks of due \nprocess of law. And nobody today would take us back to the old days \nwhen those rules were not in effect.\n  Our ideas of due process have changed for the better over the \ncenturies. One legal tradition which has not changed, however, is the \nlack of counsel before the grand jury. A witness who is not a criminal \ndefendant but who is legally summoned to testify by the grand jury may \nnot have his lawyer in the room. This rule of law is perverse to say \nthe least in that it gives criminals, or accused criminals, more rights \nthan innocent people.\n  A criminal defendant today has greater rights than an ordinary, \nunaccused witness testifying before a grand jury. The Federal Rule of \nCriminal Procedure which prohibits the presence of counsel for a \nwitness is an anachronism, and it will be changed by this bill, as well \nas by S. 2030 which I previously introduced.\n\n\n                          Exculpatory Evidence\n\n  Even with a lawyer for the witness present, the grand jury will \nalways be\n\n[[Page S7957]]\n\na one-sided affair in which only the prosecutor presents evidence. My \nbill will not change that. The prosecutor will naturally present only \nthe evidence most favorable to the government. The Supreme Court has \nheld that a prosecutor has no constitutional obligation to present the \ngrand jury with any exculpatory evidence. This case, United States v. \nWilliams, was a 5-4 decision written by Justice Scalia and as I said, \nin my opinion, it could not be more wrong.\n  If due process of law means anything at all, it means that both sides \nof a case must be heard. How can due process permit the government to \nwithhold evidence which might prevent the indictment from even being \nissued?\n  My bill today reverses United States v. Williams by amending the \nRules of Criminal Procedure to require that prosecutors present the \ngrand jury any substantial evidence which directly negates the guilt of \nthe accused.\n  This bill will not make the grand jury a ``mini-trial'' since the \naccused will not be able to present evidence or to cross-examine. But \nthe Government will be required to tell the grand jury, before it \ndecides to indict, of substantial evidence against guilt. Due process \nof law requires no less. those who are not guilty. It is no answer to \nsay that evidence of innocence can be considered at trial, and the jury \nwill correct mistakes of the grand jury. If the Government has evidence \nwhich--if it were shown to be the grand jury--would lead the grand jury \nnot to indict, the government must share that evidence with those who \nhave power to indict. U.S. v. Williams is a gross misreading of due \nprocess which cries out for correction.\n\n\n                           grand jury secrecy\n\n  Mr. President, the secrecy of grand jury proceedings is a matter of \nfundamental importance which is already clearly required by Rule 6(e) \nof the Federal Rules. Yet the rule is flouted on almost a regular \nbasis. Weekly, if not daily, the newspapers have carried stories about \nthe several Independent Counsels' investigations which begin, ``Sources \nclose to the investigation report  * * *'' Every time the law regarding \ngrand jury secrecy is violated, a fair and impartial trial is \nimpossible.\n  Grand jury secrecy is as ancient as the institution itself. Without \nit, our judicial system would degenerate into a horrific state. An \nindictment is already tantamount to guilt in the opinion of most \npeople. At the same time, the grand jurors must be insulated from \noutside pressure which might influence their decisions to indict or \nnot. Grand jury secrecy is necessary for the protection of both \nwitnesses and grand jurors.\n  The grand jury hears all kinds of testimony--some true, some \nscurrilous. Many things said to the grand jury may be incredibly \ndamaging to people if they are revealed. Since the accused and his \nlawyer are not in the room, there is no safeguard of cross-examination. \nFalse testimony can easily go undiscovered until trial, which is one \nreason grand jury secrecy is so important.\n  If the public learns that a witness has made some horrendous \naccusation, it will be cold comfort that the grand jury later decides \nnot to believe the testimony and not to indict.\n  More than one witness has lost his life when it was learned that he \nhad testified against a leader of organized crime or a murderer. Grand \njury secrecy can literally be a matter of life and death. Its \nimportance to law enforcement and the cause of justice cannot be \noverstated.\n  At the same time, a witness who has testified before a grand jury is \nperfectly free, if he so chooses, to go on television and tell the \nworld what he or she has testified to.\n  Present law places responsibility for enforcing grand jury secrecy on \nthe prosecutor. If a member of the prosecution staff is leaking to the \npress, this is the clearest conflict of interest. Asking any prosecutor \nto investigate his own conduct is an obvious conflict of interest. Yet \nthat is what present law provides.\n  Mr. President, the way to resolve this problem is to place authority \nfor investigating violations of grand jury secrecy on the District \nCourt which empaneled the grand jury in the first place. My bill does \nexactly that by giving the Court power to appoint an investigator or \ncounsel if necessary to determine the source of leaks. It should be the \nexceptional case where such action will be necessary.\n  The existence of the possibility of an independent investigation \nshould be enough to deter any prosecutor from breaching grand jury \nsecrecy.\n  Mr. President, the public's confidence in law enforcement, in the \ncourts, and in the administration of justice for all Americans has \ntaken a beating in recent years. Time and again, we have seen \nmisconduct by police and prosecutors, as well as jury verdicts and \ncourt judgments that seem to defy reason and common sense. This \nCongress has an extraordinary opportunity to restore public confidence \nin the judicial system. Almost every point in this bill is long-\nstanding policy supported by the American Bar Association. I believe \nthe public and the bar will widely support these changes, and I hope my \ncolleagues will move swiftly to enact this bill into law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Thank you.\n  I listened with great interest to my colleague's presentation of his \nbill, and it is quite interesting. You have never ceased in this \ninstitution to take on some of the toughest challenges.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Thank you.\n  Mr. WARNER. I foresee some tough hills to climb within this \nlegislation before it is through. But anyway, you are the man to do it \nif it is to be done. I cannot pass judgment at this time, but having \nbeen a prosecutor and having spent some time myself in this area, it is \nquite interesting.\n  Mr. BUMPERS.

A bill to promote the construction and operation of cruise \nships in the United States; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n                  u.s. flag cruise vessels legislation\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation which \nI believe will help achieve the development of a United States cruise \nvessel industry and generate numerous economic benefits for our country \nthrough the operation of United States-flag cruise vessels between \nAmerican ports.\n  There is little doubt that we should take significant and innovative \naction so that American ports, businesses and workers can share in the \neconomic benefits that can be realized through the operation of cruise \nvessels in the United States domestic trade.\n  Recently, the Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and Merchant \nMarine held an oversight hearing on the need to generate cruise vessel \noperations between American ports. In fact, as a result of the hearing, \nmany of our colleagues, including the Chairman of our Commerce \nCommittee Senator McCain, are committed to moving forward on cruise \nvessel legislation this year so our port economies throughout the \ncountry can begin to benefit through cruise vessel operations.\n  As strongly as I am committed to helping ports in my state of \nLouisiana and throughout our country to attract and benefit from \nincreased cruise vessel operations, I am equally convinced that we will \nnot achieve the full measure of these economic benefits if we simply \nallow foreign flag passenger vessels to operate between America's \nports. Rather, I believe we should be directing our efforts to develop \na large, modern and competitive cruise vessel fleet comprised of \nvessels built in the United States, operated under the United States-\nflag, and crewed by United States citizens. Otherwise, we would simply \nbe allowing foreign companies and foreign workers to receive all the \nprivileges and benefits that come with operating in the United States \ndomestic trade without any of the associated and resultant obligations \nand responsibilities we impose on American companies and American \nworkers.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is intended to reflect the \neconomic realities facing companies seeking to enter the domestic \ncruise trade and the desire of American ports to attract cruise vessels \nas quickly as possible. It will jumpstart the domestic cruise vessel \nindustry by allowing American companies to acquire foreign built cruise \nvessels and operate those ships in the domestic cruise trade under very \nspecific and limited circumstances. These vessels will be documented \nunder the laws of the United States, run with American citizen crews, \nand operated in compliance with all applicable United States laws, \nregulations and tax obligations.\n  My legislation reflects the principles embodied in our Nation's \ncabotage laws while recognizing that a waiver of the Passenger Vessel \nServices Act, under specific terms and conditions, is absolutely \nnecessary to attract United States-flag cruise vessels into our \ndomestic trades.\n  Especially significant is the fact that in order to take advantage of \nthe authority to operate such vessels in the domestic trades, the owner \nmust agree, and my legislation requires, that they will first enter \ninto a contract to build a replacement vessel or vessels in a United \nStates shipyard.\n  I share the desire of Senator McCain and our colleagues to develop \nlegislation that will immediately and dramatically increase domestic \ncruise vessel operations. However, I am convinced that we should not \nlet this present opportunity pass by--we have a legitimate opportunity \nto increase the size of the oceangoing United States-flag cruise vessel \nfleet and to greatly increase the opportunity for American ports to \nattract and benefit from cruise vessel activity. I am aware of at least \none American company ready to take advantage of this legislation, \nacquire two modern, attractive, large cruise vessels and operate them \nunder the United States-flag under the terms and conditions set forth \nin my proposal.\n  I ask all my colleagues to join with me in support of this proposal \nso we can achieve the operation and construction of United States-flag \ncruise vessels.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2290\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to allow foreign-constructed \n     vessels to be documented as vessels of the United States with \n     the right to engage in the domestic coastwise cruise trade in \n     connection with the construction of cruise vessels in the \n     United States.\n\n     SEC. 2. COASTWISE TRANSPORTATION OF PASSENGERS.\n\n       (a) Reflagging.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding section 12106(a)(2) of \n     title 46, United States Code, section 27 of the Merchant \n     Marine Act, 1920 (46 U.S.C. App. 883), the Act of June 19, \n     1886 (46 U.S.C. App. 289), or any other provision of law, the \n     Secretary of Transportation may issue a certificate of \n     documentation with a coastwise endorsement for a cruise \n     vessel not constructed in the United States to a person who \n     enters into a binding contract for construction in the United \n     States of a cruise vessel or vessels with a total combined \n     berth or stateroom capacity equal to at least 75 percent of \n     the total combined berth or stateroom capacity of the cruise \n     vessel or vessels for which the certificate is to be issued \n     under this paragraph.\n       (2) Certificate sunset.--A certificate of documentation \n     issued to a vessel under paragraph (1) shall terminate 2 \n     years after the date on which all vessels constructed under \n     the binding contract have been delivered.\n\n[[Page S7959]]\n\n       (b) Limitations.--\n       (1) No competition with u.s.-built vessels.--A vessel \n     issued a certificate of documentation under subsection (a)(1) \n     may not operate in the coastwise cruise trade on a route \n     served by a cruise vessel built in the United States \n     operating under the authority of section 27 of the Merchant \n     Marine Act, 1920 (46 U.S.C. App. 883), the Act of June 19, \n     1886 (46 U.S.C. App. 289), section 12106(a)(2) of title 46, \n     United States Code, or any other authority of law in effect \n     on or before the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (2) Hawaiian routes prohibited.--A vessel issued a \n     certificate of documentation under subsection (a)(1), or \n     constructed under a binding contract referred to in that \n     subsection, may not operate between or among the islands of \n     Hawaii.\n\n     SEC. 3. CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.\n\n       A vessel issued a certificate of documentation under \n     subsection (a)(1) that meets the standards and conditions for \n     the issuance of a control verification certificate for a \n     cruise vessel documented under the laws of a foreign country \n     embarking passengers in the United States is deemed to be in \n     compliance with section 3309 of title 46, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 4. FOREIGN TRANSFER.\n\n       Notwithstanding section 9(c) of the Shipping Act, 1916 (46 \n     U.S.C. App. 808), a cruise vessel issued a certificate of \n     documentation under subsection (a)(1), or constructed under a \n     binding contract referred to in that subsection, may be \n     placed under foreign registry after its documentation under \n     subsection (a) or its initial documentation (in the case of a \n     vessel so constructed), but the Secretary shall revoke the \n     coastwise endorsement issued for any such vessel when it is \n     placed under foreign registry.\n\n     SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Coastwise cruise trade.--The term ``coastwise cruise \n     trade'' means the transportation of passengers in coastwise \n     trade between points in the United States, either directly or \n     by way of a foreign point, or originating and terminating at \n     the same point in the United States.\n       (2) Cruise vessel.--The term ``cruise vessel'' means a \n     vessel that--\n       (A) is at least 10,000 gross tons as measured under chapter \n     142 of title 46, United States Code; and\n       (B) has berth or stateroom accommodations for at least 275 \n     passengers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAMS:\n  S. 2291. A bill to amend title 17, United States Code, to prevent the \nmisappropriation of collections of information; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n               collections of information antipiracy act\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Collections \nof Information Antipiracy Act.'' This legislation is similar to H.R. \n2652, legislation already passed unanimously by our colleagues in the \nHouse of Representatives on May 19 of this year that is currently \npending before the Judiciary Committee.\n  My legislation presents a much-needed Federal, legislative protection \nfor databases. It is a fair and balanced bill that recognizes the need \nfor database owners to receive adequate legal protection that provides \nthem the incentives necessary to continue investing in database \nproduction.\n  The bill also acknowledges that users must continue to have access to \ntimely and innovative database products and services.\n  America produces and uses some 65 percent of the world's databases.\n  Our database industry spans an enormous range of products and \nservices--from collection of information about antidotes to poisons, to \nvaluable collections of business and financial data, to databases of \nmedical procedures and practice guidelines used to assure reliable and \neffective patient care.\n  These companies have been pioneers in offering innovative and easily \naccessible databases in any number of formats that meet consumer needs.\n  The myriad of databases produced in the United States are used by the \nbusiness community, researchers, educators, government officials, and \ncitizens to gain knowledge and make decisions that affect every aspect \nof our lives.\n  Yet, despite technological innovations, creating and offering \ndatabases in the marketplace is neither cheap nor easy.\n  Not only must database owners expend substantial resources on the \ncollection of data, they must also maintain and distribute these \ninformation products, while continually updating them and responding to \nthe demands of their customers.\n  Many American jobs depend on a healthy, vibrant U.S. database \nindustry. These companies employ thousands of editors, researchers, and \nothers. They invest millions of dollars in hardware and software to \nmanage these large masses of information.\n  Despite the enormous value of these databases to our economy and \nsociety, American database owners are under a dual threat.\n  On the one hand, after a 1991 Supreme Court decision, it is \nincreasingly unclear whether most databases are adequately protected \nfrom piracy by U.S. copyright law.\n  Lower courts since 1991 have handed down several decisions that have \ndiminished the number and types of databases that are protected under \nthe compilation copyright provisions in the 1976 Copyright Act.\n  In addition, these decisions have stated that even if databases as a \nwhole may qualify for this limited copyright protection, the facts \ncontained in them are freely available for the taking and re-use by \nothers--including competing database producers --without authorization \nor compensation.\n  Although database producers do have means other than a new Federal \nlaw to seek protection, none has proven adequate, as is evidenced in \nthe study completed by the U.S. Copyright Office last August.\n  Contract law, for example, binds only the parties to the contract and \nin any case varies from State to State and it also varies from country \nto country.\n  Technological protections are beginning to appear and are slowly \nbeing implemented in the online world, but they offer no protection to \ndatabases that are produced in other formats.\n  Some States have adopted doctrines of misappropriation; however, \nthese legal protections are far from being uniform and offer no solace \nto database producers in States where such legal safeguards are not in \nplace.\n  The European Union has begun implementing a new directive protecting \ndatabases in their own countries, but only those produced in the \nEuropean Union or in countries that offer comparable protections. This \nlaw clearly is designed to disadvantage database owners not located in \nan EU country. Great Britain, Germany, Spain, and most Scandinavian \nnations have already made changes in their own laws to implement the EU \ndirective, and also a European official recently predicted that within \na few years, as many as 35 of our trading partners in Europe and the \nRussian Federation will have similar laws in place.\n\n  Unless the United States passes a law that is comparable to that now \ngoverning Europe, more and more American database owners may feel the \nneed to move some or all of their operations overseas in an effort, to \nthwart potential piracy of their products and services by unscrupulous \ncompetitors or vendors.\n  As I mentioned previously, Mr. President, American database producers \nare anxious to continue producing valuable databases for worldwide use. \nHowever, the technologies present in today's world that allow for easy \ncopying and redistribution of information threaten a producer's ability \nto continue receiving a fair return on the tremendous investments \nrequired to produce quality databases.\n  Coupled with the inadequacy of U.S. law to protect investment in \ndatabases and the threat posed by the EU directive, it is clear to me \nthat Congress--and more importantly, the Senate--must act quickly if we \nare to preserve the American lead in database production and use.\n  The ``Collections of Information Antipiracy Act'' offers a solution \nto the threats faced by American database owners by helping to provide \nthe right to stop harmful practices that affect the marketplace for \nthat database.\n  This legislation uses Congress' powers under the Commerce clause of \nthe Constitution to protect only those databases used in commerce.\n  Protection is limited to those databases whose owners have invested \nsubstantial monetary or other resources in gathering, organizing, or \nmaintaining a collection of information.\n  It contains a definition of what constitutes a protected collection \nthat is broad enough to offer effective protection to the wide range of \nproducts and services that would benefit from a new Federal law.\n  This legislation also contains numerous and important exceptions to \nthe protections granted. For example, it makes clear that databases may \nbe\n\n[[Page S7960]]\n\nused for legitimate purposes of verification and news reporting. It \noffers special exceptions to nonprofit users, such as researchers, \nscientists, and educators. The bill also states clearly that no one is \nprecluded from gathering the same facts contained on one database \nowner's product and creating another database--but again, as long as \nthose facts are not stolen from the original database owner. Finally, \nthe bill recognizes the importance of unfettered public access to \nGovernment databases by specifically denying protection to any database \ncreated by a governmental entity--whether Federal, State, or local--or \nany database that a Government agency seeks to have created and \ndistributed under an exclusive licensing arrangement. Mr. President, \nthe concepts that lie behind the Collections of Information Antipiracy \nAct, and many of its specific provisions, have been debated for more \nthan 2 years now. The House-passed bill now before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee was the subject of two hearings that included witnesses from \nnearly every affected community--both producers and users of databases. \nIndeed, the bill I introduce today is a much-improved version of the \nlegislation first introduced in the House, and many provisions have \nbeen added that strike a fair balance between the needs of database \nproducers for adequate protection and the also requirements that users \nhave fair access to these private-sector products and services. There \nshould be no fear that database producers will exert extraordinary \ncontrol over their products and services. But, this legislation \ncontains not only a special savings clause preserving our antitrust \nlaws, but it also specifies low penalties against any nonprofit user \nwho may run afoul of this new law.

Mr. President, I rise today to make a few remarks on \nthe extraordinary efforts which are currently taking place in my home \nstate of Florida. For over a month now, as I am sure we are all well \naware, devastating wildfires have ravaged Florida, impacting all of our \n67 counties. Since this crisis began, more than 2,000 separate fires to \ndate have been identified and more than 500,000 acres of state and \nfederal land have been burned.\n  While these facts are certainly overwhelming, I think it is important \nthat we take a moment to recognize the heroic campaign which has been \nundertaken to contain these fires. Last week I had the opportunity to \ntour the fire ravaged area of Volusia County, and I met with \nfirefighters and emergency officials on the front line of what has been \na constant battle. I was simply overwhelmed by the determination of \nthese men and women who have undertaken the challenge of extinguishing \nthese fires. These brave individuals are working 16 to 18 hours a day \nin extreme temperatures and the harshest of conditions. Tragically, \nthese fires have consumed over 367 homes and 33 businesses. It is, \nhowever, thanks to the efforts of these individuals that losses have \nremained at this level.\n  These dedicated professionals, who have put their lives on the line \nfighting the wildfires, represent the tremendous support which Florida \nhas received by our fellow Americans. Not since Hurricane Andrew in \n1992 have we seen an outpouring of human kindness and supplies from \naround the country to help Florida fight a natural disaster of this \nmagnitude. It is disasters like this which bring the American people \ntogether and makes our country one giant community. To date, 44 states, \nfrom as far away as California and Alaska, are involved in this effort. \nThrough an outstanding coordinated effort on the part of local, state \nand federal agencies, countless numbers of people are working behind \nthe scenes, including the Red Cross, the Salvation Army and private \ncitizens.\n  I have remained in close contact with state and federal emergency \nofficials, and I am confident all that can be done is being done. What \nFlorida really needs is rain. While the situation still remains quite \nvolatile, the weather patterns do offer some hope and relief to the \ndevastated areas. Over the past few days several rainstorms have \noffered some relief, however much more is still needed to completely \nextinguish the fires. I know all of my colleagues join me in letting \nthe firefighters, emergency officials and residents battling these \nfires know they are in our thoughts and prayers as they continue the \nfight to extinguish these fires.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/10/senate-section/article/S7961-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7961-S7962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HIGHER EDUCATION AMENDMENTS OF 1998\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong \nsupport of legislation passed by the Senate last evening, the Higher \nEducation Amendments of 1998.\n  The Higher Education Act has been of enormous benefit to millions of \nstudents over the past three decades in providing more affordable \naccess to institutions of post-secondary education. Many of these \nstudents simply would not have gone to college or vocational school \nwithout the assistance provided through such programs as Pell Grants, \nstudent loans, and work study.\n  With the increased competition faced by workers in the global \neconomy, the importance of these programs is even greater today, not \nonly for students but also for our nation's economy. The Higher \nEducation Act programs account for 68 percent of all financial aid \navailable to students.\n  The cost of a college education continues to grow far faster than \ninflation, leaving more and more students with a large debt once they \nfinish. Last fall, the College Board released a nationwide survey of \ntuition costs, finding that tuition and fees would rise about 5 percent \nfor the fifth year in a row.\n  In contrast, inflation in the overall economy has been held under \ncontrol during these years, hovering at an average of just over 2 \npercent.\n  As costs have increased, student borrowing has expanded to make up \nthe difference. Student loans now comprise about 60 percent of all \nfinancial aid, whereas in the 1980-81 school year, loans were just over \n40 percent of the total. The average graduate of a four-year college \ntoday will have $14,500 in debt upon entering the working world.\n  Given the increased reliance on borrowing, it is notable that this \nreauthorization legislation will provide for a reduction in interest \nrates on new student loans by approximately 1 percent from current \nrates. This provision will save students hundreds, if not thousands, of \ndollars.\n  Nearly 84 percent of South Dakota students receive financial aid in \nsome form, with an average annual award of $5,400 to students who \nreceive aid at the six public universities. Approximately 16,000 \nstudents in South Dakota receive Pell Grants, accounting for $28 \nmillion in federal assistance.\n  I am pleased that this bill will provide legislative authority to \nincrease the size of the maximum Pell Grant to $5,000. In the 1970s, \nPell Grants covered three-quarters of the costs of attending a four-\nyear public school. Today, these grants cover only one-third of the \ncost. I realize that finding the budget resources to fund this maximum \ngrant fully will be difficult, but Pell Grants are the most effective \nprogram we have for helping low-income students afford post-secondary \neducation.\n  This legislation also continues the essential Federal Family \nEducation Loan (FFEL) program. Although direct lending by the federal \ngovernment has consumed a portion of the overall student loan volume, \nall of the colleges and universities in my state of South Dakota \ncontinue to use the FFEL program and remain satisfied with the services \nthey receive. Accordingly, I have been skeptical of efforts that might \ndestroy the balance that has existed between direct lending and the \nFFEL program. Federal policy should not be changed in ways to either \nfavor direct lending or undermine the financial viability of lending by \nthe private sector.\n  There are some lesser-noticed provisions of this bill of which I am \nparticularly proud. Promoting the availability and affordability of \nchild care has been one of my highest priorities in the Senate. That's \nwhy I am so pleased that legislation I cosponsored earlier this year, \nthe CAMPUS Act, has been incorporated into this bill. CAMPUS stands for \nChild Care Access Means Parents in School. This provision will \nestablish a grant program to assist colleges with\n\n[[Page S7962]]\n\nthe costs of establishing child care centers to provide campus-based \nchild care for low-income parents attending college.\n  The obvious benefit of easy access to child care is that students \nwith young children will have a much greater probability of staying in \nschool and completing their degree. More and more students today are \nnon-traditional students, and the need for campus-based child care is \ngreater than ever before.\n  Additionally, this bill establishes an innovative new program to \noffer student loan forgiveness for those who earn a degree in early \nchildhood education and become full-time child care workers. Child \ncare, unfortunately, is one of the lowest-paying professions that one \ncan find, and this low level of pay is completely incommensurate with \nthe value of those who are caring for young children. Not surprisingly, \nturnover in this field is very high, as workers find better paying jobs \nelsewhere.\n  It is especially tragic when highly-trained graduates, those who have \nearned a degree in early childhood education, are forced to leave the \nchild care profession because they can't pay their student loans. We \nstill need to do all we can to raise wages for child care workers, but \nhelping with student loan repayment is a remarkable step forward. This \nconcept was contained in child care legislation I cosponsored last \nyear, and I am very pleased that it has been included in this bill.\n  Finally, advocates of a more effective welfare system won a \nsignificant victory with the passage of Senator Wellstone's amendment \nto give states the option of counting two years of post-secondary \neducation as a work requirement for purposes of the Temporary \nAssistance to Needy Families program. I was proud to cosponsor this \namendment.\n  I have heard from a number of my constituents that current system has \nhad the unfortunate effect of forcing TANF recipients out of college or \nvocational school and into dead-end, entry-level jobs. It seems obvious \nthat enabling these individuals, which are usually single mothers, to \ncomplete a degree would be far more effective in achieving long-term \nbenefits. Education leads to higher income levels, helping move these \nfamilies out of poverty for good and making them productive taxpayers. \nFederal requirements should not be so rigid and inflexible that states \nare prevented exercising this option. I will press to ensure that this \namendment survives the upcoming conference.\n  Passage of the Higher Education Amendments of 1998 was absolutely \nessential for the continuation and improvement of a system that helps \nkeep post-secondary education within the reach of typical American \nfamilies. I am pleased with the Senate's overwhelming vote in favor of \nthis bill, and I look forward to expeditious consideration of the \nconference report and to sending the bill to President Clinton for his \nsignature.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/10/senate-section/article/S7961-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HIGHER EDUCATION ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I am in strong support of S. \n1882, the Higher Education Act of 1998. Every young person who wishes \nto pursue an education beyond the first 12 years should be able to do \nso. This bill contains important provisions to help students pay for \nthe rapidly rising costs of college. It will benefit millions of \nstudents across the country in their pursuit of a higher education. I \nwill highlight just a few of the provisions in this legislation.\n  First, I support the compromise reached by my colleagues in the Labor \nand Human Resources Committee that provides a low interest repayment \nrate for student loans, while still allowing a rate necessary for the \nuninterrupted flow of loan capital from banks. The Clinton \nAdministration wanted to place the entire loan program under the \njurisdiction of the Department of Education. I am adamantly opposed to \nthis proposal. There is no reason nor justification to have the Federal \ngovernment run a program that is being provided efficiently by the \nprivate sector. In fact, we should be doing more to have the entire \nprogram run by private lenders.\n  Second, I recognize the need for good teachers are more and more \neducators leave the field to pursue other professions. Improving the \nquality of the current and future teaching force calls for the \nimprovement of preparation programs and the enhancement of professional \ndevelopment activities. I support North Carolina Governor Jim Hunt's \nCommission Report, ``What Matters Most: Teaching for America's \nFuture,'' which has a goal to provide 100,000 national accredited \nteachers. This bill provides the means for accomplishing that goal by \nproviding teacher certification.\n  Finally, our nation is facing an alarming increase in violence and \ndrug use on college campuses across the country. I was a co-sponsor of \na bill to require that colleges report instances of rape or assault to \nthe student body. I am pleased that this legislation was accepted as an \namendment to this bill. I also support another provision of S. 1882 \nthat would prevent students convicted of drug use or possession from \nbeing eligible for federal aid unless they complete a rehabilitation \nprogram. Taxpayers shouldn't support the tuition of students who \nrecklessly use illegal drugs.\n  To be competitive in the global economy, America needs to provide its \nstudents with the means to better their education. I believe we must \nprotect programs for higher education. The Higher Education Act makes \ncollege more affordable and improves the academic environment for \nstudents and teachers. The bill is a sound piece of legislation which I \nam pleased to support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/10/senate-section/article/S7962-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7962-S7963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NEED FOR HMO REFORM\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, our health care system is in a \nstate of crisis--a crisis of confidence. Many Americans no longer \nbelieve that their insurance companies can provide them with the access \nto care or quality of service they need.\n  Today I continue our series of stories describing how some managed \ncare plans seem to have put cost saving before life-saving. The \nexperience of Vaughn Dashiell is just one more example of the pressing \nneed for Congress to act now to protect the rights of patients.\n  Vaughn Dashiell lived with his wife, Patricia, and their three \nchildren in Alexandria, Virginia. Vaughn owned and operated his own \nprinting company.\n  On November 20, 1996, Vaughn stayed home sick from work suffering \nfrom a sore throat, dry mouth, and tunnel vision that limited his sight \nto 18 inches. He tried to get an appointment to see a doctor within his \nHMO network, but was told that none were available at his designated \nfacility. Vaughn was able to speak only to the HMO-employed nurse on \nduty over the phone. She could have told Vaughn to go to an emergency \nroom for treatment, but instead, told him to make a regular appointment \nalthough none were available.\n  As Vaughn's symptoms worsened, he called his HMO again requesting \npermission to see a doctor somewhere, or to go to a nearby emergency \nroom. Vaughn was told only to wait and that he would receive a call \nback from a doctor on duty. When the doctor on duty was consulted, he \nagreed that Vaughn should go to an emergency room, but neither made a \ncall himself, nor followed up to see that Vaughn was contacted. That \nnight, Vaughn was not contacted, not by the nurse, the doctor, or any \nother HMO staff regarding his condition and requests for care.\n  The next morning, Patricia found Vaughn incoherent, with his ``eyes \nrolling''. She hurriedly called the HMO, hoping for an answer to \nVaughn's problem. They advised her to call 911.\n  Vaughn arrived at the hospital at 9:18 am in a diabetic coma. His \nblood sugar level was more than twenty times greater than the normal \nlevel. Just over two hours after being rushed to the emergency room, \nVaughn was dead from hyperglycemia. He was only 39 years old.\n  This should not happen in America. Health insurers should not be \nallowed to put profit before patients. Vaughn Dashiell's condition \nwould have been treatable and curable if the health plan had enabled \nhim to get the care he needed. But for an HMO driven by cutting costs, \nthe needs of the patient did not come first. Had this HMO not placed \ntheir patients in the hands of a system weak in oversight and follow-up \nand instead allowed Mr. Dashiell the opportunity to see a doctor when \nhe first felt threatened, he might still be alive today.\n\n[[Page S7963]]\n\n  Mr. President, we must take up and pass meaningful patient \nprotections this year. We have a bill, S. 1890, that would prevent \ntragedies like this from occurring. Under our plan, Vaughn would have \nhad guaranteed access to needed care, especially in the case of an \nemergency. Under our bill, members of HMOs would be able to go to an \nemergency room without seeking their plan's approval if they felt their \nlife was in danger.\n  This is only common sense. It should not be controversial. I will \nappeal once again to the Republican leaders of this body: Please bring \nour Patients' Bill of Rights to the floor for action. The President has \npromised to sign it into law. We are wasting valuable time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/10/senate-section/article/S7962-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7963-S8015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HIGHER EDUCATION AMENDMENTS OF 1998\n\n  The text of the bill (H.R. 6) as passed by the Senate on July 9, \n1998, follows:\n\n       Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 6) entitled ``An Act to extend the authorization of \n     programs under the Higher Education Act of 1965, and for \n     other purposes.'', do pass with the following amendment:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the local community, when properly organized and \n     challenged, is one of the best sources of academic support, \n     motivation toward achievement, and financial resources for \n     aspiring postsecondary students;\n       (2) local communities, working to complement or augment \n     services currently offered by area schools and colleges, can \n     raise the educational expectations and increase the rate of \n     postsecondary attendance of their youth by forming locally-\n     based organizations that provide both academic support \n     (including guidance, counseling, mentoring, tutoring, \n     encouragement, and recognition) and tangible, locally raised, \n     effectively targeted, publicly recognized, financial \n     assistance;\n       (3) proven methods of stimulating these community efforts \n     can be promoted through Federal support for the establishment \n     of regional, State or community program centers to organize \n     and challenge community efforts to develop educational \n     incentives and support for local students; and\n       (4) using Federal funds to leverage private contributions \n     to help students from low-income families attain educational \n     and career goals is an efficient and effective investment of \n     scarce taxpayer-provided resources.\n\n     SEC. 743.

GRANTS TO STATES FOR WORKPLACE AND COMMUNITY \n                   TRANSITION TRAINING FOR INCARCERATED YOUTH \n                   OFFENDERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Over 150,000 youth offenders age 21 and younger are \n     incarcerated in the Nation's jails, juvenile facilities, and \n     prisons.\n       (2) Most youth offenders who are incarcerated have been \n     sentenced as first-time adult felons.\n       (3) Approximately 75 percent of youth offenders are high \n     school dropouts who lack basic literacy and life skills, have \n     little or no job experience, and lack marketable skills.\n       (4) The average incarcerated youth has attended school only \n     through grade 10.\n       (5) Most of these youths can be diverted from a life of \n     crime into productive citizenship with available educational, \n     vocational, work skills, and related service programs.\n       (6) If not involved with educational programs while \n     incarcerated, almost all of these youths will return to a \n     life of crime upon release.\n       (7) The average length of sentence for a youth offender is \n     about 3 years. Time spent in prison provides a unique \n     opportunity for education and training.\n       (8) Even with quality education and training provided \n     during incarceration, a period of intense supervision, \n     support, and counseling is needed upon release to ensure \n     effective reintegration of youth offenders into society.\n       (9) Research consistently shows that the vast majority of \n     incarcerated youths will not return to the public schools to \n     complete their education.\n       (10) There is a need for alternative educational \n     opportunities during incarceration and after release.\n       (b) Definition.--For purposes of this part, the term \n     ``youth offender'' means a male or female offender under the \n     age of 25, who is incarcerated in a State prison, including a \n     prerelease facility.\n       (c) Grant Program.--The Secretary of Education (in this \n     section referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall establish a \n     program in accordance with this section to provide grants to \n     the State correctional education agencies in the States, from \n     allocations for the States under subsection (i), to assist \n     and encourage incarcerated youths to acquire functional \n     literacy, life, and job skills, through the pursuit of a \n     postsecondary education certificate, or an associate of arts \n     or bachelor's degree while in prison, and employment \n     counseling and other related services which start during \n     incarceration and continue through prerelease and while on \n     parole.\n       (d) Application.--To be eligible for a grant under this \n     section, a State correctional education agency shall submit \n     to the Secretary a proposal for a youth offender program \n     that--\n       (1) identifies the scope of the problem, including the \n     number of incarcerated youths in need of postsecondary \n     education and vocational training;\n       (2) lists the accredited public or private educational \n     institution or institutions that will provide postsecondary \n     educational services;\n       (3) lists the cooperating agencies, public and private, or \n     businesses that will provide related services, such as \n     counseling in the areas of career development, substance \n     abuse, health, and parenting skills;\n       (4) describes the evaluation methods and performance \n     measures that the State correctional education agency will \n     employ, which methods and measures--\n       (A) shall be appropriate to meet the goals and objectives \n     of the proposal;

PROTECTION OF STUDENT SPEECH AND ASSOCIATION \n                   RIGHTS.\n\n       (a) Protection of Rights.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     no student attending an institution of higher education on a \n     full- or part-time basis should, on the basis of \n     participation in protected speech or protected association, \n     be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, \n     or be subjected to discrimination or official sanction under \n     any education program, activity, or division of the \n     institution directly or indirectly receiving financial \n     assistance under the Higher Education Act of 1965, whether or \n     not such program, activity, or division is sponsored or \n     officially sanctioned by the institution.\n       (b) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed--\n       (1) to discourage the imposition of an official sanction on \n     a student that has willfully participated in the disruption \n     or attempted disruption of a lecture, class, speech, \n     presentation, or performance made or scheduled to be made \n     under the auspices of the institution of higher education; or\n       (2) to prevent an institution of higher education from \n     taking appropriate and effective action to prevent violations \n     of State liquor laws, to discourage binge drinking and other \n     alcohol abuse, to protect students from sexual harassment \n     including assault and date rape, or to regulate unsanitary or \n     unsafe conditions in any student residence.\n       (c) Definitions.--For the purposes of this section:\n       (1) Official sanction.--The term ``official sanction''--\n       (A) means expulsion, suspension, probation, censure, \n     condemnation, reprimand, or any other disciplinary, coercive, \n     or adverse action taken by an institution of higher education \n     or administrative unit of the institution; and\n       (B) includes an oral or written warning made by an official \n     of an institution of higher education acting in the official \n     capacity of the official.\n       (2) Protected association.--The term ``protected \n     association'' means the joining, assembling, and residing \n     with others that is protected under the first and 14th \n     amendments to the Constitution, or would be protected if the \n     institution of higher education involved were subject to \n     those amendments.\n       (3) Protected speech.--The term ``protected speech'' means \n     speech that is protected under the first and 14th amendments \n     to the Constitution, or would be protected if the institution \n     of higher education involved were subject to those \n     amendments.\n\n     SEC. 798. BINGE DRINKING ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Collegiate Initiative To Reduce Binge Drinking''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Many college president rank alcohol abuse as the number \n     one problem on campus.\n       (2) Alcohol is a factor in the 3 leading causes of death \n     (accidents, homicides, and suicides) for individuals aged 15 \n     through 24.\n       (3) More than any other group, college students tend to \n     consume large numbers of drinks in rapid succession with the \n     intention of becoming drunk.\n       (4) 84 percent of college students report drinking alcohol \n     during the school year, with 44 percent of all college \n     students qualifying as binge drinkers and 19 percent of all \n     college students qualifying as frequent binge drinkers.\n       (5) Alcohol is involved in a large percentage of all campus \n     rapes, violent crimes, student suicides, and fraternity \n     hazing accidents.\n       (6) Heavy alcohol consumption on college campuses can \n     result in drunk driving crashes, hospitalization for alcohol \n     overdoses, trouble with police, injury, missed classes, and \n     academic failure.\n       (7) The secondhand effects of student alcohol consumption \n     range from assault, property damage, and unwanted sexual \n     advances, to interruptions in study or sleep, or having to \n     ``babysit'' another student who drank too much.\n       (8) Campus binge drinking can also lead to the death of our \n     Nation's young and promising students.\n       (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, \n     in an effort to change the culture of alcohol consumption on \n     college campuses, all institutions of higher education should \n     carry out the following:\n       (1) The president of the institution should appoint a task \n     force consisting of school administrators, faculty, students, \n     Greek system representatives, and others to conduct a full \n     examination of student and academic life at the institution. \n     The task force should make recommendations for a broad range \n     of policy and program changes that would serve to reduce \n     alcohol and other drug-related problems. The institution \n     should provide resources to assist the task force in \n     promoting the campus policies and proposed environmental \n     changes that have been identified.\n       (2) The institution should provide maximum opportunities \n     for students to live in an alcohol-free environment and to \n     engage in stimulating, alcohol-free recreational and leisure \n     activities.\n       (3) The institution should enforce a ``zero tolerance'' \n     policy on the illegal consumption of alcohol by students at \n     the institution.\n       (4) The institution should vigorously enforce the \n     institution's code of disciplinary sanctions for those who \n     violate campus alcohol policies. Students with alcohol or \n     other drug-related problems should be referred for \n     appropriate assistance.\n       (5) The institution should adopt a policy of eliminating \n     alcoholic beverage-related sponsorship of on-campus \n     activities. The institution should adopt policies limiting \n     the advertisement and production of alcoholic beverages on \n     campus.\n       (6) The institution should work with the local community, \n     including local businesses, in a ``Town/Gown'' alliance to \n     encourage responsible policies toward alcohol consumption and \n     to address illegal alcohol use by students.\n\n     SEC. 799. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING HIGHER EDUCATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Higher education must be kept affordable for all \n     families as the number of students attending institutions of \n     higher education in the 1995-1996 academic year reached \n     19,400,000 students at all levels.\n       (2) According to the College Board's Annual Survey of \n     Colleges, 1997-1998 undergraduate students at United States \n     colleges will pay on average, approximately 5 percent more \n     for the 1997-1998 academic year in tuition and fees at 4-year \n     institutions of higher education than the students paid for \n     the 1996-1997 academic year, and from 2 to 4 percent more for \n     the 1997-1998 academic year in tuition and fees at 2-year \n     institutions of higher education than the students paid for \n     the 1996-1997 academic year.\n       (3) From academic years 1980-1981 to academic years 1994-\n     1995, tuition at 4-year public colleges and universities \n     increased 234 percent, while median household income rose \n     only 82 percent, and as a result, families now spend nearly \n     twice as much of their income on college tuition as families \n     did in 1980.\n       (4) A college education has become less affordable as \n     undergraduate public school tuition has increased \n     substantially in the years preceding 1998.\n       (5) In the 1997-1998 school year, average undergraduate \n     tuition and fees--\n       (A) for public 4-year institutions of higher education were \n     $3,111, representing a 97 percent increase from the 1988-1989 \n     school year; and\n       (B) for private 4-year institutions of higher education \n     were $13,664, representing an increase of 71 percent from the \n     1988-1989 school year.\n       (6) In the 1996-1997 academic year--\n       (A) over $580,000,000 in Federal Supplemental Educational \n     Opportunity Grants were disbursed to more than 990,000 \n     students;\n       (B) $760,000,000 in Federal funds supported more than \n     700,000 students in the Federal Work-Study Program; and\n       (C) more than 700,000 students borrowed approximately \n     $940,000,000 in Federal Perkins Loans.\n       (7) In the 1996-1997 academic year, Federal loan programs \n     provided over $30,000,000,000 in financial aid to students.\n       (8) Student financial aid in the form of loans is \n     disproportionate to the amount of financial aid received \n     through grants. In 1980, approximately 40 percent of Federal \n     student financial aid was distributed through loans. In the \n     1996-1997 academic year, 60 percent of Federal, State, and \n     institutional student financial aid was distributed through \n     loans.\n       (9) As the proportion of Federal grants continues to \n     decline, students and families will have to consider \n     alternative ways to finance a college education.\n       (10) In the 1970s, Federal Pell Grants financed \\3/4\\ of \n     the costs at a public 4-year institution of higher education \n     and \\1/3\\ of the costs at a private 4-year institution of \n     higher education. In contrast, in the 1996-1997 academic \n     year, Federal Pell Grants financed \\1/3\\ of the costs at a 4-\n     year public institution of higher education and \\1/7\\ of the \n     costs at a private 4-year institution of higher education.\n       (11) While student dependence on Federal loans programs has \n     increased, the default rate on those loans has decreased. \n     According to the Department of Education, in fiscal year \n     1990, the national default rate on federally insured student \n     loans was 22.4 percent. In fiscal year 1994, the national \n     default rate declined to 10.4 percent.\n       (12) The National Commission on the Cost of Higher \n     Education concluded in the report of the National Commission \n     that Federal student aid grants have not contributed to \n     increases in tuition while the evidence is inconclusive \n     regarding the impact of Federal student loans on increases in \n     tuition.\n\n[[Page S8014]]\n\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the cost of tuition at institutions of higher education \n     continues to increase at a rate above the Consumer Price \n     Index, affecting the nearly 20,000,000 students at all \n     levels, resulting in an increase in the number of students \n     seeking Federal loans and Federal grants;\n       (2) efforts should be made to address the disproportionate \n     share of Federal student aid in the form of Federal student \n     loans compared to Federal student grants available for \n     students at institutions of higher education; and\n       (3) Federal incentives provided to public and private \n     institutions of higher education may be an effective way to \n     limit tuition growth.\n\n     SEC. 799A. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING TEACHER EDUCATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the education of teachers is a university-wide \n     responsibility requiring the integration of subject matter \n     and teacher education course work across faculties with \n     multiple site-based clinical learning experiences;\n       (2) teachers well prepared in both subject matter and good \n     professional practice are essential to raising the \n     achievement levels of our Nation's students, especially in \n     mathematics and the sciences;\n       (3) teacher educators, substantive experts, and \n     kindergarten through grade 12 teachers need to interact with \n     one another through shared experiences that incorporate \n     school-site-based knowledge into the teacher preparation \n     curriculum;\n       (4) partnerships between practitioners and academics \n     working together in all phases of teacher education improve \n     the quality of such education and create incentives for \n     teachers to pursue excellence in their teaching;\n       (5) individuals may be more likely to choose teaching as a \n     career if more flexible teacher preparation programs, \n     tailored to the needs and experiences of the individuals, \n     with multiple entry points and pathways into the teaching \n     profession, are made available;\n       (6) strong leadership skills of school principals are \n     essential to improving the quality of teaching and academic \n     achievement of all students;\n       (7) collaboration among teacher educators, other university \n     faculty, elementary and secondary schools, and community \n     colleges facilitate, strengthen, and renew all the \n     individuals and entities participating in the collaboration.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) Federal programs, including the Federal Work-Study \n     Programs, should encourage students, particularly prospective \n     teachers, to become involved in supervised tutoring and \n     mentoring activities in kindergarten through grade 12 \n     schools;\n       (2) institutions of higher education, kindergarten through \n     grade 12 schools, local educational agencies, States, and the \n     Department of Education should enter into partnerships to \n     identify and prepare promising candidates as future education \n     leaders and to provide continuing professional development \n     opportunities to current principals and other education \n     leaders;\n       (3) options for access to teacher preparation programs and \n     new avenues to careers in teaching should be expanded to \n     reach professionals seeking second careers and individuals \n     whose prior experiences encompass critical subject areas such \n     as mathematics and the sciences;\n       (4) partnerships between institutions of higher education \n     and kindergarten through grade 12 schools should emphasize \n     contacts between faculty and the business community to align \n     expectations for academic achievement to create a more \n     seamless transition for students from secondary to \n     postsecondary schools and to the workplace; and\n       (5) Congress should focus on identifying, replicating, and \n     facilitating the expansion of exemplary partnerships between \n     institutions of higher education and kindergarten through \n     grade 12 schools, with particular emphasis on partnerships \n     targeted toward fostering excellence in kindergarten through \n     grade 12 school leadership, attracting and preparing \n     qualified professionals for new careers in teaching, helping \n     teachers incorporate technology into curricula, and aligning \n     the curricula and expectations for student achievement in \n     secondary schools and institutions of higher education, and \n     for the workplace.\n\n     SEC. 799B.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING GOOD CHARACTER.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the future of our Nation and world will be determined \n     by the young people of today;\n       (2) record levels of youth crime, violence, teenage \n     pregnancy, and substance abuse indicate a growing moral \n     crisis in our society;\n       (3) character development is the long-term process of \n     helping young people to know, care about, and act upon such \n     basic values as trustworthiness, respect for self and others, \n     responsibility, fairness, compassion, and citizenship;\n       (4) these values are universal, reaching across cultural \n     and religious differences;\n       (5) a recent poll found that 90 percent of Americans \n     support the teaching of core moral and civic values;\n       (6) parents will always be children's primary character \n     educators;\n       (7) good moral character is developed best in the context \n     of the family;\n       (8) parents, community leaders, and school officials are \n     establishing successful partnerships across the Nation to \n     implement character education programs;\n       (9) character education programs also ask parents, faculty, \n     and staff to serve as role models of core values, to provide \n     opportunities for young people to apply these values, and to \n     establish high academic standards that challenge students to \n     set high goals, work to achieve the goals, and persevere in \n     spite of difficulty;\n       (10) the development of virtue and moral character, those \n     habits of mind, heart, and spirit that help young people to \n     know, desire, and do what is right, has historically been a \n     primary mission of colleges and universities; and\n       (11) the Congress encourages parents, faculty, and staff \n     across the Nation to emphasize character development in the \n     home, in the community, in our schools, and in our colleges \n     and universities.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     Congress should support and encourage character building \n     initiatives in schools across America and urge colleges and \n     universities to affirm that the development of character is \n     one of the primary goals of higher education.\n\n[[Page S8015]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/10/senate-section/article/S7963-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7963-S8015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HIGHER EDUCATION AMENDMENTS OF 1998\n\n  The text of the bill (H.R. 6) as passed by the Senate on July 9, \n1998, follows:\n\n       Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 6) entitled ``An Act to extend the authorization of \n     programs under the Higher Education Act of 1965, and for \n     other purposes.'', do pass with the following amendment:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the local community, when properly organized and \n     challenged, is one of the best sources of academic support, \n     motivation toward achievement, and financial resources for \n     aspiring postsecondary students;\n       (2) local communities, working to complement or augment \n     services currently offered by area schools and colleges, can \n     raise the educational expectations and increase the rate of \n     postsecondary attendance of their youth by forming locally-\n     based organizations that provide both academic support \n     (including guidance, counseling, mentoring, tutoring, \n     encouragement, and recognition) and tangible, locally raised, \n     effectively targeted, publicly recognized, financial \n     assistance;\n       (3) proven methods of stimulating these community efforts \n     can be promoted through Federal support for the establishment \n     of regional, State or community program centers to organize \n     and challenge community efforts to develop educational \n     incentives and support for local students; and\n       (4) using Federal funds to leverage private contributions \n     to help students from low-income families attain educational \n     and career goals is an efficient and effective investment of \n     scarce taxpayer-provided resources.\n\n     SEC. 743.

GRANTS TO STATES FOR WORKPLACE AND COMMUNITY \n                   TRANSITION TRAINING FOR INCARCERATED YOUTH \n                   OFFENDERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Over 150,000 youth offenders age 21 and younger are \n     incarcerated in the Nation's jails, juvenile facilities, and \n     prisons.\n       (2) Most youth offenders who are incarcerated have been \n     sentenced as first-time adult felons.\n       (3) Approximately 75 percent of youth offenders are high \n     school dropouts who lack basic literacy and life skills, have \n     little or no job experience, and lack marketable skills.\n       (4) The average incarcerated youth has attended school only \n     through grade 10.\n       (5) Most of these youths can be diverted from a life of \n     crime into productive citizenship with available educational, \n     vocational, work skills, and related service programs.\n       (6) If not involved with educational programs while \n     incarcerated, almost all of these youths will return to a \n     life of crime upon release.\n       (7) The average length of sentence for a youth offender is \n     about 3 years. Time spent in prison provides a unique \n     opportunity for education and training.\n       (8) Even with quality education and training provided \n     during incarceration, a period of intense supervision, \n     support, and counseling is needed upon release to ensure \n     effective reintegration of youth offenders into society.\n       (9) Research consistently shows that the vast majority of \n     incarcerated youths will not return to the public schools to \n     complete their education.\n       (10) There is a need for alternative educational \n     opportunities during incarceration and after release.\n       (b) Definition.--For purposes of this part, the term \n     ``youth offender'' means a male or female offender under the \n     age of 25, who is incarcerated in a State prison, including a \n     prerelease facility.\n       (c) Grant Program.--The Secretary of Education (in this \n     section referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall establish a \n     program in accordance with this section to provide grants to \n     the State correctional education agencies in the States, from \n     allocations for the States under subsection (i), to assist \n     and encourage incarcerated youths to acquire functional \n     literacy, life, and job skills, through the pursuit of a \n     postsecondary education certificate, or an associate of arts \n     or bachelor's degree while in prison, and employment \n     counseling and other related services which start during \n     incarceration and continue through prerelease and while on \n     parole.\n       (d) Application.--To be eligible for a grant under this \n     section, a State correctional education agency shall submit \n     to the Secretary a proposal for a youth offender program \n     that--\n       (1) identifies the scope of the problem, including the \n     number of incarcerated youths in need of postsecondary \n     education and vocational training;\n       (2) lists the accredited public or private educational \n     institution or institutions that will provide postsecondary \n     educational services;\n       (3) lists the cooperating agencies, public and private, or \n     businesses that will provide related services, such as \n     counseling in the areas of career development, substance \n     abuse, health, and parenting skills;\n       (4) describes the evaluation methods and performance \n     measures that the State correctional education agency will \n     employ, which methods and measures--\n       (A) shall be appropriate to meet the goals and objectives \n     of the proposal;

PROTECTION OF STUDENT SPEECH AND ASSOCIATION \n                   RIGHTS.\n\n       (a) Protection of Rights.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     no student attending an institution of higher education on a \n     full- or part-time basis should, on the basis of \n     participation in protected speech or protected association, \n     be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, \n     or be subjected to discrimination or official sanction under \n     any education program, activity, or division of the \n     institution directly or indirectly receiving financial \n     assistance under the Higher Education Act of 1965, whether or \n     not such program, activity, or division is sponsored or \n     officially sanctioned by the institution.\n       (b) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed--\n       (1) to discourage the imposition of an official sanction on \n     a student that has willfully participated in the disruption \n     or attempted disruption of a lecture, class, speech, \n     presentation, or performance made or scheduled to be made \n     under the auspices of the institution of higher education; or\n       (2) to prevent an institution of higher education from \n     taking appropriate and effective action to prevent violations \n     of State liquor laws, to discourage binge drinking and other \n     alcohol abuse, to protect students from sexual harassment \n     including assault and date rape, or to regulate unsanitary or \n     unsafe conditions in any student residence.\n       (c) Definitions.--For the purposes of this section:\n       (1) Official sanction.--The term ``official sanction''--\n       (A) means expulsion, suspension, probation, censure, \n     condemnation, reprimand, or any other disciplinary, coercive, \n     or adverse action taken by an institution of higher education \n     or administrative unit of the institution; and\n       (B) includes an oral or written warning made by an official \n     of an institution of higher education acting in the official \n     capacity of the official.\n       (2) Protected association.--The term ``protected \n     association'' means the joining, assembling, and residing \n     with others that is protected under the first and 14th \n     amendments to the Constitution, or would be protected if the \n     institution of higher education involved were subject to \n     those amendments.\n       (3) Protected speech.--The term ``protected speech'' means \n     speech that is protected under the first and 14th amendments \n     to the Constitution, or would be protected if the institution \n     of higher education involved were subject to those \n     amendments.\n\n     SEC. 798. BINGE DRINKING ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Collegiate Initiative To Reduce Binge Drinking''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Many college president rank alcohol abuse as the number \n     one problem on campus.\n       (2) Alcohol is a factor in the 3 leading causes of death \n     (accidents, homicides, and suicides) for individuals aged 15 \n     through 24.\n       (3) More than any other group, college students tend to \n     consume large numbers of drinks in rapid succession with the \n     intention of becoming drunk.\n       (4) 84 percent of college students report drinking alcohol \n     during the school year, with 44 percent of all college \n     students qualifying as binge drinkers and 19 percent of all \n     college students qualifying as frequent binge drinkers.\n       (5) Alcohol is involved in a large percentage of all campus \n     rapes, violent crimes, student suicides, and fraternity \n     hazing accidents.\n       (6) Heavy alcohol consumption on college campuses can \n     result in drunk driving crashes, hospitalization for alcohol \n     overdoses, trouble with police, injury, missed classes, and \n     academic failure.\n       (7) The secondhand effects of student alcohol consumption \n     range from assault, property damage, and unwanted sexual \n     advances, to interruptions in study or sleep, or having to \n     ``babysit'' another student who drank too much.\n       (8) Campus binge drinking can also lead to the death of our \n     Nation's young and promising students.\n       (c) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, \n     in an effort to change the culture of alcohol consumption on \n     college campuses, all institutions of higher education should \n     carry out the following:\n       (1) The president of the institution should appoint a task \n     force consisting of school administrators, faculty, students, \n     Greek system representatives, and others to conduct a full \n     examination of student and academic life at the institution. \n     The task force should make recommendations for a broad range \n     of policy and program changes that would serve to reduce \n     alcohol and other drug-related problems. The institution \n     should provide resources to assist the task force in \n     promoting the campus policies and proposed environmental \n     changes that have been identified.\n       (2) The institution should provide maximum opportunities \n     for students to live in an alcohol-free environment and to \n     engage in stimulating, alcohol-free recreational and leisure \n     activities.\n       (3) The institution should enforce a ``zero tolerance'' \n     policy on the illegal consumption of alcohol by students at \n     the institution.\n       (4) The institution should vigorously enforce the \n     institution's code of disciplinary sanctions for those who \n     violate campus alcohol policies. Students with alcohol or \n     other drug-related problems should be referred for \n     appropriate assistance.\n       (5) The institution should adopt a policy of eliminating \n     alcoholic beverage-related sponsorship of on-campus \n     activities. The institution should adopt policies limiting \n     the advertisement and production of alcoholic beverages on \n     campus.\n       (6) The institution should work with the local community, \n     including local businesses, in a ``Town/Gown'' alliance to \n     encourage responsible policies toward alcohol consumption and \n     to address illegal alcohol use by students.\n\n     SEC. 799. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING HIGHER EDUCATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Higher education must be kept affordable for all \n     families as the number of students attending institutions of \n     higher education in the 1995-1996 academic year reached \n     19,400,000 students at all levels.\n       (2) According to the College Board's Annual Survey of \n     Colleges, 1997-1998 undergraduate students at United States \n     colleges will pay on average, approximately 5 percent more \n     for the 1997-1998 academic year in tuition and fees at 4-year \n     institutions of higher education than the students paid for \n     the 1996-1997 academic year, and from 2 to 4 percent more for \n     the 1997-1998 academic year in tuition and fees at 2-year \n     institutions of higher education than the students paid for \n     the 1996-1997 academic year.\n       (3) From academic years 1980-1981 to academic years 1994-\n     1995, tuition at 4-year public colleges and universities \n     increased 234 percent, while median household income rose \n     only 82 percent, and as a result, families now spend nearly \n     twice as much of their income on college tuition as families \n     did in 1980.\n       (4) A college education has become less affordable as \n     undergraduate public school tuition has increased \n     substantially in the years preceding 1998.\n       (5) In the 1997-1998 school year, average undergraduate \n     tuition and fees--\n       (A) for public 4-year institutions of higher education were \n     $3,111, representing a 97 percent increase from the 1988-1989 \n     school year; and\n       (B) for private 4-year institutions of higher education \n     were $13,664, representing an increase of 71 percent from the \n     1988-1989 school year.\n       (6) In the 1996-1997 academic year--\n       (A) over $580,000,000 in Federal Supplemental Educational \n     Opportunity Grants were disbursed to more than 990,000 \n     students;\n       (B) $760,000,000 in Federal funds supported more than \n     700,000 students in the Federal Work-Study Program; and\n       (C) more than 700,000 students borrowed approximately \n     $940,000,000 in Federal Perkins Loans.\n       (7) In the 1996-1997 academic year, Federal loan programs \n     provided over $30,000,000,000 in financial aid to students.\n       (8) Student financial aid in the form of loans is \n     disproportionate to the amount of financial aid received \n     through grants. In 1980, approximately 40 percent of Federal \n     student financial aid was distributed through loans. In the \n     1996-1997 academic year, 60 percent of Federal, State, and \n     institutional student financial aid was distributed through \n     loans.\n       (9) As the proportion of Federal grants continues to \n     decline, students and families will have to consider \n     alternative ways to finance a college education.\n       (10) In the 1970s, Federal Pell Grants financed \\3/4\\ of \n     the costs at a public 4-year institution of higher education \n     and \\1/3\\ of the costs at a private 4-year institution of \n     higher education. In contrast, in the 1996-1997 academic \n     year, Federal Pell Grants financed \\1/3\\ of the costs at a 4-\n     year public institution of higher education and \\1/7\\ of the \n     costs at a private 4-year institution of higher education.\n       (11) While student dependence on Federal loans programs has \n     increased, the default rate on those loans has decreased. \n     According to the Department of Education, in fiscal year \n     1990, the national default rate on federally insured student \n     loans was 22.4 percent. In fiscal year 1994, the national \n     default rate declined to 10.4 percent.\n       (12) The National Commission on the Cost of Higher \n     Education concluded in the report of the National Commission \n     that Federal student aid grants have not contributed to \n     increases in tuition while the evidence is inconclusive \n     regarding the impact of Federal student loans on increases in \n     tuition.\n\n[[Page S8014]]\n\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the cost of tuition at institutions of higher education \n     continues to increase at a rate above the Consumer Price \n     Index, affecting the nearly 20,000,000 students at all \n     levels, resulting in an increase in the number of students \n     seeking Federal loans and Federal grants;\n       (2) efforts should be made to address the disproportionate \n     share of Federal student aid in the form of Federal student \n     loans compared to Federal student grants available for \n     students at institutions of higher education; and\n       (3) Federal incentives provided to public and private \n     institutions of higher education may be an effective way to \n     limit tuition growth.\n\n     SEC. 799A. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING TEACHER EDUCATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the education of teachers is a university-wide \n     responsibility requiring the integration of subject matter \n     and teacher education course work across faculties with \n     multiple site-based clinical learning experiences;\n       (2) teachers well prepared in both subject matter and good \n     professional practice are essential to raising the \n     achievement levels of our Nation's students, especially in \n     mathematics and the sciences;\n       (3) teacher educators, substantive experts, and \n     kindergarten through grade 12 teachers need to interact with \n     one another through shared experiences that incorporate \n     school-site-based knowledge into the teacher preparation \n     curriculum;\n       (4) partnerships between practitioners and academics \n     working together in all phases of teacher education improve \n     the quality of such education and create incentives for \n     teachers to pursue excellence in their teaching;\n       (5) individuals may be more likely to choose teaching as a \n     career if more flexible teacher preparation programs, \n     tailored to the needs and experiences of the individuals, \n     with multiple entry points and pathways into the teaching \n     profession, are made available;\n       (6) strong leadership skills of school principals are \n     essential to improving the quality of teaching and academic \n     achievement of all students;\n       (7) collaboration among teacher educators, other university \n     faculty, elementary and secondary schools, and community \n     colleges facilitate, strengthen, and renew all the \n     individuals and entities participating in the collaboration.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) Federal programs, including the Federal Work-Study \n     Programs, should encourage students, particularly prospective \n     teachers, to become involved in supervised tutoring and \n     mentoring activities in kindergarten through grade 12 \n     schools;\n       (2) institutions of higher education, kindergarten through \n     grade 12 schools, local educational agencies, States, and the \n     Department of Education should enter into partnerships to \n     identify and prepare promising candidates as future education \n     leaders and to provide continuing professional development \n     opportunities to current principals and other education \n     leaders;\n       (3) options for access to teacher preparation programs and \n     new avenues to careers in teaching should be expanded to \n     reach professionals seeking second careers and individuals \n     whose prior experiences encompass critical subject areas such \n     as mathematics and the sciences;\n       (4) partnerships between institutions of higher education \n     and kindergarten through grade 12 schools should emphasize \n     contacts between faculty and the business community to align \n     expectations for academic achievement to create a more \n     seamless transition for students from secondary to \n     postsecondary schools and to the workplace; and\n       (5) Congress should focus on identifying, replicating, and \n     facilitating the expansion of exemplary partnerships between \n     institutions of higher education and kindergarten through \n     grade 12 schools, with particular emphasis on partnerships \n     targeted toward fostering excellence in kindergarten through \n     grade 12 school leadership, attracting and preparing \n     qualified professionals for new careers in teaching, helping \n     teachers incorporate technology into curricula, and aligning \n     the curricula and expectations for student achievement in \n     secondary schools and institutions of higher education, and \n     for the workplace.\n\n     SEC. 799B.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING GOOD CHARACTER.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the future of our Nation and world will be determined \n     by the young people of today;\n       (2) record levels of youth crime, violence, teenage \n     pregnancy, and substance abuse indicate a growing moral \n     crisis in our society;\n       (3) character development is the long-term process of \n     helping young people to know, care about, and act upon such \n     basic values as trustworthiness, respect for self and others, \n     responsibility, fairness, compassion, and citizenship;\n       (4) these values are universal, reaching across cultural \n     and religious differences;\n       (5) a recent poll found that 90 percent of Americans \n     support the teaching of core moral and civic values;\n       (6) parents will always be children's primary character \n     educators;\n       (7) good moral character is developed best in the context \n     of the family;\n       (8) parents, community leaders, and school officials are \n     establishing successful partnerships across the Nation to \n     implement character education programs;\n       (9) character education programs also ask parents, faculty, \n     and staff to serve as role models of core values, to provide \n     opportunities for young people to apply these values, and to \n     establish high academic standards that challenge students to \n     set high goals, work to achieve the goals, and persevere in \n     spite of difficulty;\n       (10) the development of virtue and moral character, those \n     habits of mind, heart, and spirit that help young people to \n     know, desire, and do what is right, has historically been a \n     primary mission of colleges and universities; and\n       (11) the Congress encourages parents, faculty, and staff \n     across the Nation to emphasize character development in the \n     home, in the community, in our schools, and in our colleges \n     and universities.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     Congress should support and encourage character building \n     initiatives in schools across America and urge colleges and \n     universities to affirm that the development of character is \n     one of the primary goals of higher education.\n\n[[Page S8015]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/10/senate-section/article/S7963-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE CONGRESS RELATIVE TO ADMISSION OF THE \n   REPUBLIC OF CHINA ON TAIWAN TO MULTILATERAL ECONOMIC INSTITUTIONS\n\n  Mr. GRAMS.

Mr. President, yesterday's 96 to 2 vote to reform the \nInternal Revenue Service was a victory for the American people. I am \ngrateful for the cooperation we received from our colleagues. I am \ngrateful for the support that came from our constituents. And I very \nmuch appreciate the willing participation that came from individuals \nwithin the Internal Revenue Service itself.\n  From the beginning of our intensive investigation, and throughout our \nhearings, I made it clear that the IRS is filled with hard-working, \nhonorable men and women.\n  We depend on these individuals, on their integrity and expertise to \ncarry out a complex and often thankless task--yet a task that is \nfundamentally important to the welfare and future of America. Had it \nnot been for those within the IRS who were concerned about the abuses \nthey witnessed--had they not come forward to speak with us--there would \nhave been no hearing. There would have been no reform effort--no \nchange. And the abuses would have continued.\n  What our investigation focused on was the culture of the agency. It \nfocused on an environment that had been allowed to establish itself \nbecause of rules that granted excessive license to those inclined to \nabuse power--an environment that lacked sufficient oversight. This was \nthe culprit. And I am grateful that after an attempt early on in our \ninvestigation to circle the wagons concerning the Finance Committee's \nefforts, the IRS--under the fine leadership of Commissioner Charles \nRossotti--determined to work with us, not against us.\n  Two reports issued today speak volumes about the spirit of \ncooperation Commissioner Rossotti demonstrated. They validate each of \nthe concerns raised in our investigation. They are filled with examples \nthat support those that we heard from the courageous witnesses who \naddressed our committee. They remove any question concerning the \nappropriateness or necessity of the extensive investigation we \nundertook. And they make it clear that our conclusions, and \nconsequently our legislative outcome, were right on target.\n  I appreciate the honesty and candor that is contained in these two \ninternal audits. Prepared by the agency's Chief Inspector's office at \nmy request, they offer a thorough and objective analysis\n\n[[Page S8017]]\n\nof serious problems within the agency's culture. Among other things, \nthese reports paint a vivid picture of how the IRS' Examination \nDivision used performance measures and statistics, compelling auditors \nand examination personnel to inflate taxpayer liabilities. They show \nhow the Collection Division abused seizure authority, in one case \nturning a taxpayer's life upside down for the grand sum of four dollars \nand seventeen cents!\n  The reports even documented the most troubling issue of how the \nInternal Revenue Service would often go after taxpayers who were most \nvulnerable--those suffering from medical problems or severe financial \nsetbacks. According to the internal audits, ``the seizure[s] \ndemonstrated insensitivity to the taxpayer's current situation or \n[were] conducted to enhance statistical measures.''\n  These reports are astonishing in the scope of the taxpayer abuse they \nconfirm and in the fact that they come from the agency itself. In the \ncase of the man whose business was seized and sold to net the IRS four \ndollars and seventeen cents, the report states clearly that, ``The \nrevenue officer did not use sound * * * judgment when conducting this \nlow dollar seizure.''\n  And this is only one of many such cases documented, Mr. President. In \nthese two reports, Americans will find a stunning array of similar \nabuses.\n  The reports make it clear that the agency's focus on goals and \nstatistics come at the expense of quality service and fair treatment of \ntaxpayers. They came at the expense of fairness to IRS employees. One \nreport admits that a full 74 percent of group manager evaluations \ncontained references to enforcement statistics. The evaluations cited \ndollars per hour, hours per return, and dollars recommended for \ncollection.\n  The reports make it clear that districts routinely communicated goals \nand enforcement statistics to group managers and employees.\n  In fact, the agency admits that such statistics were ``communicated \nin all 12 districts through newsletters, monthly reports of Examination \nactivity, group meetings, and similar methods. Enforcement \nstatistics,'' the report continues, ``were often in referenced to how \ngroup managers and employees were doing in relation to district or \ngroup goals.''\n  Cast after case is cited in these reports to illustrate how these \nactivities within the agency adversely influenced the lives of \ntaxpayers. In one example, collections officers did not even attempt to \ncontact the taxpayer prior to seizing his property. The revenue officer \nconfirmed the taxpayer's address and ownership of assets two days \nbefore seizing them. And what did the IRS seize? The tools the taxpayer \nneeded to provide for his family. Even the taxpayer's 11-year-old \ndaughter pleaded with the collections officer to halt the action, but \nthe activity proceeded--the seizure producing a measly net proceed of \n$20!\n  Again, Mr. President, these stories are not coming from witnesses \nwhose credibility might be challenged. They are admissions made by the \nInternal Revenue Service itself.\n  Nearly half of the seizures examined in these reports indicate that \nimproper or abusive tactics were used against the taxpayer. Not only \ndoes this validate our findings, but the very existence of these \ninternal audits demonstrate that a new era is drawing on an agency that \nfor far too long has been operating in darkness. It looks to be an era \nof openness--of cooperation--and accountability. I laud the current \nleadership, Commissioner Rossotti, and those who support him in what \nwill be an historic turning point in the life of the agency. What a \nlegacy they will leave!\n  And again, I express my gratitude to colleagues who stood firm in our \neffort to change the way the IRS does business. Our reform legislation, \nwhich I expect will be signed by the President in the very near future, \nwill go a long way toward preventing the types of abuses chronicled in \nthese reports. We are increasing oversight of the agency and holding \nemployees accountable for their actions. We are ensuring that taxpayers \nhave due process protections in collections activities. We are \nprohibiting the IRS from using enforcement statistics.\n  This is a moment in which we can all be proud. The successful passage \nof reform legislation yesterday, the bipartisan spirit that marked our \ninvestigation and subsequent debate, the willingness of the agency, \nitself, to cooperate--all of these are to be credited.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/10/senate-section/article/S8016-6", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, JULY 13, 1998\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
