Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to pay \ntribute to the distinguished senior Senator from South Carolina.\n  This is a very special occasion for the Senate, as we take this time \nto honor the longest serving Member of this body in history.\n  Senator Thurmond is an institution within this institution. Among the\n\n[[Page S5198]]\n\nAmerican people, he is probably one of the best known--and most \nrecognized--Members of the Senate, every morning opening the Senate \ndutifully here; almost every day when we open. On rare occasions he is \nnot in the chair. And within this congressional family, he holds a \nplace of respect that is truly unique. I have been honored to serve \nwith him, privileged to learn from him, and proud to call him my \nfriend.\n  If the Senate had a Mount Rushmore, Strom would be on it.\n  As my colleagues know, Senator Thurmond's stature in the Senate is \nnot just a matter of longevity. It is a matter of accomplishment.\n  He was first elected to this body on November 2, 1954, as a write-in \ncandidate, and remains to this day the only person elected to the \nSenate in that manner.\n  He has served here on both sides of the aisle, and in both the \nmajority and the minority. But he will quickly tell you that the \nmajority is better.\n  He has chaired both the Armed Services Committee and the Judiciary \nCommittee, and he thereby has made an enduring contribution to both our \nNation's security and our system of justice.\n  He has stood for causes that were popular and causes that were less \nso. He has been fearless in defending his views, and what may be more \nimportant, equally unafraid to change those views when convinced of the \nrightness of change.\n  I can remember some of his speeches here in the Senate. He holds the \nrecord for the longest speech in the history of the Senate. But I \nremember as a brand-new Senator, he was standing in this aisle here and \ngiving the most vigorous speech in behalf of the need for a criminal \nlaw reform that I believe I have ever heard. It was magnificent.\n  When Strom Thurmond came to the Senate almost 42 years ago, he \nbrought with him enough accomplishments already for a lifetime.\n  He had already been a State senator and circuit judge in his native \nbeloved South Carolina. He had been Governor of the Palmetto State and \nhad been the States Rights candidate for the Presidency in 1948.\n  Most telling of all, he had landed in Normandy on D-day with the 82d \nAirborne. Senator Thurmond has much to be proud of in his Senate \ncareer. But I doubt that any honors bestowed on him in the course of \nthat career can rival the decorations he won in the Normandy landing: \nThe Legion of Merit with oak leaf cluster and the Bronze Star for \nValor.\n  All of this, of course, is a matter of public record. But what the \npublic generally does not know, however, is the personality and the \nfantastic character that Senator Thurmond brings to his work in the \nSenate.\n  I often wish I had his unfailing good humor, which, come to think of \nit, probably has something to do with his length of service here. He \nalways comes in ready to go to work with a smile on his face, as he did \nthis very morning.\n  We all know firsthand how strongly he can argue his point, how \nfiercely he can defend his values, and how firmly he can put down an \nopponent who does not have the facts on his side.\n  But we also know how courteous he is when the debate is over, how \ngenerous he is even to those who do not reciprocate that conduct \nsometimes, and how respectful he has always been to this institution--\nand to every Member of this institution.\n  He has been a master of the Senate's rules, for he has always \nunderstood that those rules--frustrating and bothersome as they may \noften seem--are what sets the Senate apart as the most extraordinary \nlegislative body in the world.\n  He has given so much to his country, in so many different ways, and \nyet he would resist any attempt on our part to thank him for his \nlifetime of dedication. For in this regard, Senator Thurmond is truly \nof the old school: He would rather thank his country for the chance to \nrepay the honor of being an American. After all his years, after all \nthose decades, that is the one appellation that best describes him. \nThough he has been a Democrat, a Dixiecrat, and a Republican, he has \never been and always will be, most of all, Strom Thurmond, proud \nAmerican.\n  Thank you, Senator Thurmond for what you have done for your State, \nfor your country, and for all of us as individuals.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/03/senate-section/article/S5197-8", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to participate in this \nopportunity to celebrate the service of Strom Thurmond.\n  When Abraham Lincoln stood on the battlefield at Gettysburg to \nmemorialize the outstanding service of those who had died there, he put \nit succinctly: ``The world will little note, nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.''\n  I do not suggest by my own remarks here this morning that my remarks \nare long to be remembered. But the service of Strom Thurmond is \nunforgettable, and is indelibly marked, not only in the history of the \nSenate but in the States of this great Nation as a part of the \ndevelopment of the character of the United States of America.\n  ``A nation reveals itself,'' said John Kennedy, ``not only by the men \nit produces but also by the men it honors, the men it remembers.'' And \nso it is fitting that we should honor the service of Strom Thurmond. \nFor long after his time in the Senate has ended--and the new millennium \nhas begun--Strom will be remembered; not just for the elections that he \nwon, but for the principles upon which he stood, the State he helped to \ntransform, the party he helped to build.\n  For Strom, winning elections became a habit. From the time he ran his \nfirst campaign for Edgefield County superintendent to his most recent \nreelection, his record of electoral accomplishment is unparalleled in \nour time. The punditry and political operatives have been left to \nsearch for the secret to Strom's success. The answer is really quite \nsimple. At its most basic, it is this: His word is his bond.\n  Whether giving up his seat in 1956 to run for reelection without the \nbenefit of incumbency, or switching parties in 1964 to support Barry \nGoldwater, Strom has been true to himself and to the people he \nrepresents. He embodies the very essence of what it means to be a \nleader, ``decid[ing] where he wants to go, figur[ing] out how to get \nthere, and then do[ing] it.''\n  But Strom has done more than just win the voters' hearts. He, along \nwith Carroll Campbell, Governor Beasley, Bob Inglis, and others, have \nhelped take a State of low-country planters and usher them into the \ninformation age. Today, South Carolina stands as one of America's great \nsuccess stories, part of the booming South Atlantic seaboard; its \nfactories, office buildings, and airports are at the forefront of the \nNation's economic growth. And through it all, Strom has been there.\n  Politically, this new South Carolina has also been moving--more than \nany other southern State--toward the Republican Party. And if ours is a \nmovement of many mansions, then South Carolina is the house that Strom \nbuilt. Under his watchful eye, the GOP has controlled the governorship \nsince 1986 and wrested four of the State's six House seats from \nDemocratic rule.\n  Until Senator Thurmond, most would have scoffed at the suggestion \nthat a Republican could win statewide office. But then Strom joined the \nGOP, and the impossible became the possible. And so today, there are \nelephants in the cottonfields, and we have Senator Thurmond to thank \nmore than any other.\n  Mr. President, in his lifetime Senator Thurmond has seen tragedy and \ntriumph, known both midnight and high noon. At times, he has been a \nsolitary figure seemingly at odds with the world. More often, however, \nhe has stood for the national interest and the Nation has stood with \nhim. And as South Carolina has flourished, so too,\n\n[[Page S5199]]\n\nhas he grown, coming to see fully the diversity and richness of the \nAmerican dream.\n  His secret is not what he gets, not what he gives, not what he \nconsumes, but how he serves. In the end, what Douglas Southall Freeman \nsaid of Robert Lee four decades ago might also be said of Senator \nThurmond today. ``He [is] one of a small company of great men in whom \nthere is no inconsistency to be explained, no enigma to be solved.'' \nWhat he appears, he is. Not merely a man of great faith, but a great \nand faithful friend.\n  A final thought. I often hear the pundits and the national press \nbemoaning what they call an absence of leadership. Where, they ask, are \nthe Thomas Hart Bentons, the Calhouns, and the Clays? Well, let me \nsuggest that they look to the United States Senate; and there, just \nbeyond the camera's eye, you will find them. They go by Helms, Gramm, \nMoynihan. And perhaps most of all, Strom Thurmond--the Palmetto State's \nmarble man--a ``figure lost to flesh and blood and bones, frozen into a \nlegend out of life.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, in 1950 when William Faulkner accepted \nthe Nobel prize for literature, he said that man would not only endure, \nhe would prevail.\n  I recalled of those words this morning when I was coming to the \nChamber to describe my impression of Senator Strom Thurmond. He has not \nonly survived and set a record because of his endurance but he has \nprevailed and set an example that all of us can study with profit. His \ncharacter, his integrity, his commitment, his energy, his enthusiasm \nfor his work and for the Senate, his respect for our Government and our \ncountry and its people, and his devotion to duty all set him apart. So \nit is not just because of his tenure that I praise him this morning but \nit is more importantly for all of these other qualities that have made \nhim so special and so much appreciated as a Senator.\n  I have felt it to be a real honor to serve in the Senate with Strom \nThurmond of South Carolina. He truly is one of the most outstanding \nSenators who has ever served. And he has been easy to get to know and \neasy to like, easy to work with because of his cordiality, his warmth, \nand his willingness to be helpful. He can also give you good advice and \nbe persuasive in a way that makes you want to do what he wants you to \ndo.\n  I recall going to the well of the Senate to vote when he was chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee, and I had planned to vote against his \nposition on an amendment. He grabbed me by the arm and began holding it \nwith his famous firm grip, and he said, ``Now, you ought to do what's \nright on this'' and started talking to me. And in that little while I \nrealized I was going to vote with him and not the way I had thought I \nwas going to vote when I went to the well of the Senate. I later told \nsomebody that I had been ``Thurmonized.'' That's when you are talked to \nin a fashion that is very persuasive, very courtly and charming, very \ndistinctively like Strom Thurmond can talk to you.\n  We have worked closely on agriculture matters. We have worked to \nensure that the farmers of South Carolina and those involved in their \nspecialty crops, such as the peach orchard owners, have the kind of \ninvestment in research that is necessary to maintain our technological \nedge, and our productivity, so that we can be competitive in the global \nmarkets. He is the farmer's friend. He has said on a number of \noccasions, and I have heard him say it, ``We have to be sure we do \nright by the farmers; they're very important to this country.''\n  He has the same kind of attitude towards those who serve in the \nmilitary, and as chairman of the Armed Services Committee he has done \nas much as anyone, more than most, to help ensure that we have a \nmilitary which is well equipped, well trained, and is second to none in \nthe world. By reason of his own personal experiences, he knows what it \ntakes in a time of crisis to prevail. He has been a wonderful example \nin so many ways. He has been devoted to his family. I can recall his \ntalking to the then majority leader, Senator Byrd, about getting out \nearly one night so we could go trick or treating with our children. And \nhe was, of course, in his seventies at that time. But he wanted to be \nsure that family time was made available, and we got out early that \nnight, I recall, because of the insistence of Senator Thurmond that we \nhave time to spend with our families on Halloween night.\n  There are many other things that come to mind, personal \nrecollections. I never will forget being invited by him when I was a \nbrand new Senator, to come to Charleston, SC to address the annual \ndinner of the Hibernian Society. He told me all about what to expect. \nHe said, ``The main thing to remember is don't talk long.'' He said, \n``They don't want a long speech.''\n  Well, I took that to heart. I didn't talk long. And what I really \ncame to realize when he was introducing me was that the people there \nwere interested in his introduction a lot more than they would be in my \nspeech. He brought the house down. They were there to hear vintage \nStrom Thurmond, and he was terrific. He started describing me as he \nintroduced me. He said, ``He is the first person to ever win statewide \noffice in the State of Mississippi on the Republican ticket.'' Well, \nthey cheered. And he said, ``And he thinks just like we do. He believes \nin balancing the budget.'' And they cheered and hollered. And then he \nsaid, ``And he believes in a strong national defense.'' And they jumped \nup and hollered again. And after a while, I realized my speech \nfollowing this was not going to be worth giving; they were being \nentertained, but they were also showing their respect, their love for \ntheir Senator, Strom Thurmond. I was delighted to be invited and \nhonored to be the speaker, and I did not talk long. It was a very \nsuccessful experience because of that.\n  It was a great pleasure working with Senator Thurmond on the \nJudiciary Committee during my first 2 years in the Senate, which was a \nvery interesting time of transition. Another part of the genius of \nStrom Thurmond is to manage transition. The President talks about \nmaking change our friend. Strom Thurmond has been doing that for so \nlong it is second nature. And the fact is he has been able to not only \nmanage transitions and help ease the pain of transition for this \ncountry in so many different areas that he has been a true leader of \nour country in that respect. He is a wonderful example and a wonderful \nman, and it is a great privilege for me to be able to speak today in \nhis honor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I literally cannot remember life \nwithout Strom Thurmond. My first awareness of Strom Thurmond was one of \nthe first things I remember in my entire life. I was 6 years old. I was \nin the first grade at Athens Elementary in Athens, AL. It was 1948. One \nweekend we were on the porch at my grandfather's house, and I was \nsitting there listening to my dad and to my grandfather talk about the \nPresidential election of 1948.\n  Now, I must confess at age 6 that was not a big item in my life, but \nthat was the first time I heard the name Strom Thurmond. My dad and my \ngranddad talked about the election for a little while, and all I \nremember for sure is that they said Strom Thurmond was a fine man, they \nwere going to vote for him for President of the United States.\n  The second time I remember hearing of Strom Thurmond, my family had \nmoved from Alabama to Augusta, GA. My dad was a civilian employee for \nthe Army after having served in World War II in the European theater, \nas did our fellow Senator whom we honor today. My father was working at \nthe Savannah River plant in Aiken, SC, in 1954.\n  And again, at age 12, obviously politics was not something I was \nthinking about very often. It seems to me baseball was most in my \ninterest at that time. But that was the year our colleague whom we \nhonor today got elected to the United States Senate on a write-in in \nSouth Carolina. The only time that has been done in history, Mr. \nPresident--a remarkable accomplishment.\n  The next time I remember thinking about Senator Thurmond's \ndistinguished career I was 22, and it was 1964 and we had moved to \nKentucky by that point. I had begun to think of myself as a Republican \nand taken an interest in\n\n[[Page S5200]]\n\npolitics, and I remember the excitement, having been a son of the Deep \nSouth, when Senator Thurmond decided to become a Republican. In those \ndays, as the occupant of the Chair certainly knows, too, there were not \nany Republicans in the Deep South.\n  I remember the story my dad told me about his father, my grandfather, \nsitting him down at an early age and explaining to him politics. He \nsaid, ``Now, son, this won't take long, just a minute.'' He said, ``The \nRepublican Party is the party of the North and the Democratic Party is \nthe party of the South.'' And that was the end of it. So imagine my \nexcitement as a 22-year-old college senior to see Senator Thurmond from \nthe Deep South, as deep as it gets, South Carolina, saying, I'm going \nto be a Republican as a matter of conviction. Now, that was a pretty \ncourageous thing to do in 1964 in South Carolina even if you were a \npretty established figure, as Senator Thurmond obviously already \nwas. He didn't have to do that. It would have been easy for him to \ncontinue to be a Democrat. That was certainly what everybody was in the \nSouth in those days. But, as a matter of conviction, Senator Thurmond \nsaid, ``I can't be a Democrat anymore. This party doesn't reflect my \nbeliefs and I am going to change.'' That was the beginning, in every \nreal sense, of the growth of the Republican Party in the South--which I \nwant to say the occupant of the Chair and myself have been substantial \nbeneficiaries of on down in subsequent years.\n\n  The next time Strom Thurmond impacted my life was in 1969. I was a \nlegislative assistant to a newly elected Senator from Kentucky who got \nassigned to the Judiciary Committee. And there was Senator Thurmond. I \nobserved him as a staffer for the 2 years that I was here. He was \ninvariably courteous to those who were beneath him in rank. I \noftentimes think that the true test of people's worth is how they treat \nthose people who are not on the same level of influence as they. \nSenator Thurmond was a favorite of the staff that worked at the \nJudiciary Committee because he was unfailingly courteous to all of us, \nand we respected him greatly.\n  Obviously, the next time Senator Thurmond's life and mine intersected \nwas in 1985 when I was sworn into the Senate and became a member of the \nJudiciary Committee myself and Senator Thurmond was our chairman.\n  So, when I say I can't remember life without Strom Thurmond I do not \nexaggerate. He has been somebody I have heard about, observed and \nadmired all of my life. And, as other speakers have said this morning, \nand I'm sure others will in the course of the morning, it is an honor \nfor all of us to be associated with this great American. He is truly a \nlegend in our time and a legend that goes beyond simply his longevity, \nhis tenure. Certainly that is a remarkable record. I remember many of \nus were there at his 90th birthday, when Senator Thurmond looked out at \nthe audience and said, ``Now, if you'll eat right and exercise and take \ncare of yourself, you may be here for my 100th birthday party.'' \nObviously, that kind of optimism, the looking forward, planning ahead, \nthinking about what you want to achieve, that kind of uplifting \noptimism has been an inspiration to all of us who have had the \nopportunity to know and to learn from the senior Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  But, beyond the legend of tenure, there is also the question of \naccomplishment. There isn't anybody in the U.S. Senate who knows more \nabout the issues that the Senate Judiciary Committee deals with than \nStrom Thurmond. And when it comes to national security matters, not \nonly has Strom Thurmond been a hero on the battlefield himself, having \nridden on one of those gliders in behind the lines at Normandy in 1944, \nnot only was he a hero himself, but when it comes to the question of \nsecuring and standing up for the solid national defense of the United \nStates, Strom Thurmond has no peer. He has been there for 40 years in \nthe U.S. Senate seeing to it that America had a strong national defense \nin order to protect this country and our way of life and our interests \naround the world.\n  So, Mr. President, let me say again, the life of Strom Thurmond--\nwhich continues; he is just getting started--has been an inspiration to \nall of us who have had the opportunity to know him and to love him over \nthe years.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to stop on the Senate floor today \non a mission to compliment my distinguished colleague and friend, \nSenator Strom Thurmond. He has achieved quite a remarkable record here \nin the U.S. Senate. I didn't know Senator Thurmond very well except by \nreputation before I came to the U.S. Senate. But, as I have come to \nknow him and his service to our country, I wanted this morning to join \nall of my colleagues who will come this morning and tell him thank you \nfor his service to our country.\n  Senator Thurmond is serving in the U.S. Senate in 1997. He was born \nin the year 1902. That means that Senator Thurmond has spent a great \ndeal of time in public service. He is a remarkable person by any \nmeasure.\n  When I read a piece about Senator Strom Thurmond about 4 years ago, I \nwent up to him on the floor of Senate, after I read the piece, and told \nhim that I learned a great deal about him I did not know.\n  One of the things that impressed me so much was to have read about \nhis record in the Second World War. Senator Thurmond volunteered for \nservice in the Second World War, I believe, when he was near 40 years \nof age. And when I read about what he did in the Second World War, I \nwas really truly astounded. He received five battle stars and 18 \ndecorations: the Legion of Merit with oak leaf cluster, the Bronze Star \nfor valor, the Purple Heart, the Cross of Order of Crown Belgium, and \nso on.\n  But what I read about Senator Thurmond was that somewhere near the \nage of 40, he volunteered to go into service in the Second World War \nand then further volunteered on a mission, a dangerous mission, to go \naloft in a glider and crash-land behind enemy lines at night during the \nD-day invasion.\n  I asked Senator Thurmond on the floor, having read about that, \n``Weren't you terribly afraid that evening as you boarded a glider to \nbe sent aloft?'' And we had a little visit about that. He said, no, he \nwas not. He is a man of enormous courage. If you evaluate the record, \nnot only his record during the Second World War, volunteering for \ndangerous missions and having received so many decorations for valor as \na result of that, but also his record in public service following that, \nyou cannot be anything but admiring of this remarkable and wonderful \nindividual.\n  We spend our time in the Senate here, and I suppose over the couple \nhundred years that the Senate has been in existence, debating each \nother and having the give-and-take of the competition of ideas, and \nsometimes I suppose there might be those who watch these proceedings \nwho think that, gee, this is quite a vigorous debate and we do not have \nthe greatest of respect for each other. I would say to those who watch \nand get that misimpression that, in almost all cases in this body, \nthose of us who come here have enormous respect for others who have \nbeen here and who have come under other circumstances.\n  Senator Thurmond came to the U.S. Senate, I believe, in 1954, and he \nhas served here with great distinction and great honor. There might be \ntimes where he and I would disagree on an issue, but when we disagree \nwe do that without being disagreeable. There have been other times when \nSenator Thurmond and I have worked together on amendments on the floor \nof the Senate, and I have been honored to do so.\n  No matter the circumstance, I feel privileged to have been able to \nserve at a time in this Senate when someone with as distinguished a \nrecord as Senator Thurmond has compiled has been here. I have said on \nother occasions, for example, that same feeling exists with Senator \nByrd of West Virginia, who, I am sure Senator Thurmond would agree, is \none of the great Senators of all times.\n  I, as a young boy, watching and listening and paying some attention \nto\n\n[[Page S5201]]\n\nAmerican politics, read about and heard about and studied the works of \nU.S. Senators. Most of those who I knew about when I was going to \nschool I never had the opportunity to meet and certainly did not have \nthe opportunity to serve with. But because of longevity and because of \nthe length of public service given this country by the likes of Senator \nByrd, and especially Senator Thurmond, I feel pleased that I have come \nto the Senate and had the opportunity to serve during my term with some \nreally wonderful Senators who have contributed a great deal to this \ncountry and left this a richer place because of their public service.\n  Today, I simply wanted to come and say to Senator Thurmond on behalf \nof the constituents I represent in North Dakota, thank you for your \nservice to this country. This is a better country and a better place \nbecause you have served.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am more than honored to come to the floor \ntoday to pay tribute to our senior Senator, Senator Thurmond, who has \nachieved such an outstanding milestone.\n  Last September 6, I had the privilege of being at Oriole stadium in \nBaltimore to watch Cal Ripken break the consecutive game record held by \nLou Gehrig. It was one of the most moving tributes in sports events \nthat I have ever witnessed or ever heard about. And yet, when I watched \na replay of that just the other day and understood the significance of \nan individual who had, through sickness and injury and personal \nconcerns, established that probably never-to-be-broken record, I could \nnot help but think of a similar individual who I have had the privilege \nof serving with in the U.S. Senate who has established his own record. \nAnd I think that the sacrifice and the commitment and the perseverance \nand the dedication of Senator Thurmond really can only be compared with \nthat of Cal Ripken--two extraordinary individuals who have set their \nmind to a task and not allowed anything to come in the way of \nperforming that task and achieving the goal that they have achieved.\n\n  Of course, serving in the House of Representatives, all you really \nknow about Senator Thurmond is the legend. You know he is a legendary \nfigure who has provided extraordinary service to his country and serves \nas a distinguished Member of the U.S. Senate. So when you come to the \nSenate and have the opportunity to serve with Senator Thurmond, you \nbring with you a sense of awe, a sense of, how does this individual do \nthis? But you also bring the perceptions that you read about in the \npress, ``Oh, Senator Thurmond's remarkable service, but you know he's \ngetting older and he perhaps doesn't have the stamina and the energy \nthat he once had.'' Well, it does not take you long here in the U.S. \nSenate to realize that that perception is wrong.\n  The first thing you do is you meet Senator Thurmond and you have to \nshake his hand. And after you shake his hand, you have to take some \naspirin because your hand is going to be sore for the next couple days, \nbecause Senator Thurmond has maintained a grip that few in the Senate \nhalf his age have. So my advice to any new, incoming freshmen or \nanybody who happens to run into Senator Thurmond in the hall or meet \nSenator Thurmond is, have a bottle of aspirin in your pocket because, \nafter you shake his hand, your hand is going to be sore for a couple \ndays.\n  The second thing you find out about Senator Thurmond is that, as \nSenator Dole says, you watch very carefully what he eats because you \nwant to eat whatever Strom Thurmond is eating if you want to stay \nhealthy. And so we jockey to sit near him at lunch to see what is the \nsecret of this man's success, his longevity, his contribution.\n  And then, if you are like me and you are someone that enjoys going \ndown to our small, little workout facility down in the Russell \nBuilding, you run into Senator Thurmond down there and you ask him, \n``Senator, how do you get to be the age you are and maintain such good \nphysical health? How is it possible?'' And he looks at you and says, \n``Well, I get up every morning and I do my stretching, do 20 minutes of \nstretching, and then I do 20 minutes on the bicycle, and then I'll do \nsome calisthenics, and then I swim every week half a mile at a time.''\n  Then he looks at you and says, ``If you want to stay limber and you \nwant to stay strong, you've got to pay the price.'' And I wonder how \nmany of us have the will to pay the price at half his age that he pays \nat the age of 94.\n  I could go on and on with these stories. I had the privilege of \ncoaching youth basketball here in northern Virginia, and I had the \nprivilege of having on my team young Paul Thurmond. And so here I am in \nmy forties--my son is on the team along with Paul Thurmond--and Paul \nThurmond's father is considerably older than I am, and yet there he is \nin the stands right behind where I am coaching, watching those games \nand cheering his son on, who is a remarkable athlete, now a nationally \nranked tennis player, I think, at Vanderbilt.\n  We won the championship of that league, and in no small part due to \nthe terrific contributions of young Paul Thurmond, who is now quite a \nyoung man. But I think what is remarkable to me--it was not Paul's \nathletic prowess--is the fact that Paul's father, Senator Thurmond, was \nright there cheering him on and with the parents of the kids that won \nthat championship.\n  I have gotten to meet the rest of his family, and I have gotten to \nsee how Senator Thurmond handles a very, very complex and difficult job \nand yet cares so deeply for his children and for his family.\n  I know that Senator Thurmond went through probably the most difficult \nthing that any parent can go through, and that is the loss of a child. \nI know how much he grieved the loss of his daughter in that tragic \naccident that took place. And yet, lesser people would have been broken \nby that. Lesser people would not have been able to recover from that. \nSenator Thurmond, I think due in large part to his faith, due to his \nstrength of will, and due to his belief that despite the tragedies in \nour lives, life must go on, and did go on, and did it in a spirit that \nis commendable to all of us, because we know how deeply that tragedy \nstruck him.\n  So there are so many aspects of this extraordinary man that have left \nsuch a deep imprint on the lives of all of us here in the Senate and \nclearly the lives of the people he represents in South Carolina and to \nmany people throughout the world. The impressions I have, the stories I \nhave, the admiration I have for the remarkable person that Strom \nThurmond is is really difficult to put into words.\n  Initially, I was going to sit down and write a speech, but I really \nwanted this to be from the heart. I really wanted to come over here and \nsay to my colleagues and say to Senator Thurmond, in my lifetime, I do \nnot know that I have ever met someone like you. I do not know if I ever \nmet someone who showed the courage and showed the compassion and showed \nthe loyalty and showed the commitment to the people that he knows and \nloves and to the people around him and to the people of this Nation.\n  I bet you could go back 40 years and look up the pages that have \nserved in the Senate, and I will bet you every one of them would say \nthe person that went out of his way to speak to me, to make me feel \nwelcome, was Senator Thurmond. I bet you could go back and talk to \nstaffers from over the last 40 years, or interns, who have worked for \nSenator Thurmond and hear such remarkable praise from them about the \nprivilege they had of serving and working for him in the Senate. You \ncould talk to any of us who have served with him and we talk about \nStrom almost in awe. How does this man keep doing it? How are we \npossibly going to have the energy and passion for the job when we \nbecome the age, or we hope to become the age, that Senator Thurmond has \nbecome--a unique person, a remarkable record, something that I do not \nthink will ever be broken.\n\n  I just want to say to him today what a great privilege it has been \nfor me to\n\n[[Page S5202]]\n\nserve with Strom Thurmond, what a great example he has provided to me \nand to my family, how much I admire him, and how much I want to \ncongratulate him for his remarkable service.\n  Now, the standing story here, and said with all seriousness, is when \nis Strom going to start preparing for the next election? We just had an \nelection, but no one is about to say that Strom Thurmond is serving in \nhis last term. This man of such a remarkable constitution continues to \ngive fine representation to the people that he has represented for so \nlong.\n  Mr. President, I have another dozen stories illustrating the impact \nof this fine southern gentleman on this institution, but others will \nrecount many of those. I just want him to know he has made a lasting \nand deep impression on me and it has been one of the highest honors and \ndeepest privileges of my time in the Congress to be a friend and \nassociated with and to work with the Senator from South Carolina, \nSenator Thurmond.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise this morning to be one of many to \npay tribute to our distinguished senior Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. President, I, like all of Senator Thurmond's colleagues, feel it \nis a privilege to serve with the distinguished Senator, the man whom \nthe Almanac of American Politics calls ``the most enduring figure in \nAmerican politics.''\n  As you and I both know, Mr. President, because you and I are both new \nMembers of this body, we are quickly learning what it means to serve in \nthe U.S. Senate. So it is with genuine respect that I reflect upon \nStrom Thurmond's many, many, many years of service here in this body, \nthe votes he has cast, the issues he has debated and the people he has \nknown, and the history that Senator Thurmond has helped shape.\n  Strom Thurmond was serving America for more than a decade before, \nyou, Mr. President, were born, or before I was born. He landed at \nNormandy on D-Day. Many people do not know that Senator Thurmond was a \nlegitimate hero of World War II. He was jumping out of planes not at \nthe age of 21, but far beyond those tender young ages. He landed at \nNormandy on D-day. He was a State legislator, a Governor, and a \ncandidate for President of the United States, all before he came to the \nU.S. Senate.\n  However, it has been his service in the U.S. Senate that has made \nStrom Thurmond's boldest and most enduring mark, service that began \nwhen I was in grade school in the sand hills of Nebraska. Strom \nThurmond came to this body when there were only 48 stars on the \nAmerican flag. He has served with nine Presidents of both political \nparties, and his leadership has spanned five decades with tremendous \nchange in American culture, society, and government. Strom Thurmond is \npart of American history.\n  This freshman, 6-month-old, humble Senator from Nebraska, wishes to \nthank Senator Thurmond for the opportunity to learn from his \nexperiences and his leadership. I wish to add my commendation to \nSenator Thurmond for his dedication, his commitment to our Nation. I \nadmire the strong example he has set for all of us, especially our \nyoung people. Mr. President, in a day when we do not have enough strong \nrole models in this country, Senator Thurmond is one. He is an example \nof a life well lived. He is a true American role model, an American \nhero.\n  Senator Thurmond is the highest ranking 95-year-old in the Nation, as \nfar as I know, Mr. President. My only request is that I hope that \nduring my time in the Senate I may conduct myself in such a way that \nSenator Thurmond will remember me as his colleague and friend long \nafter I have departed this body and Senator Thurmond is still \npresiding.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for your time. I once again commend my \ncolleague and my friend, the distinguished chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee and a most distinguished American.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I would not be surprised if \nSenator Thurmond did not even know my name, and there is no reason that \nhe should. He had served in this body and had run for President before \nI was ever born, and I want him to know that I was uncomfortable in \npresiding here in seeing time pass by with too few people rising to pay \ntribute to his name and the heritage of political service he leads to \nthis country.\n  I, as a little boy, moved with my father and mother from Pendleton, \nOR, to Washington, DC. My dad worked for Dwight Eisenhower, and as a \nlittle boy I became interested in political affairs and public life, \nand for all of the memory of my life I remember hearing the name of \nStrom Thurmond. I remember him as a Democrat. I remember him as a \nRepublican. I remember him always following the dictates of his \nconscience in pursuing issues as he saw them to be right.\n  I, therefore, join with all who pay tribute to Strom Thurmond. I \nthank him for his service to our country. I thank him for his repeated \nreminders to us and the Republican conference of the first \nconstitutional responsibility that we have--to provide for the common \ndefense. As the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee he does \nthat ably, and I, for one, hear his message and am anxious to support \nhim in providing a strong national defense.\n  I just had occasion to travel with the President of the United States \nto Europe where we witnessed the signing of the Russia-NATO agreement. \nI also participated in the ceremonies for the 50th anniversary of the \nMarshall plan. These are great contributions that America is making to \nworld affairs and to peace. It occurs to me that none of this would \nhave been possible absent a strong national defense. Indeed, providing \nfor an American role in leadership, because we as Americans understand \nour international responsibility and understand that the world looks to \nus. Indeed, it looks to leaders like Strom Thurmond to support our \nmilitary services in making sure that we are the leaders of \npeacefulness throughout this very hostile and difficult world.\n  Senator Thurmond, I come to the Senate today to say thank you. I \nnever served in the military and I suppose every man would like one day \nto have his grandson ask him, ``What did you do in the war, Grandpa,'' \nand I will not be able to say I served in battle like you did, but in a \nsense here in the U.S. Senate we go to war every day, but nobody dies, \nbecause we have found a way in this country, in this deliberative body, \nto fight without bloodshed. It will be my great pleasure that when my \ngrandson sits on my knee and asks what did I do to contribute to the \npublic life of this country, one of the things I will say is I served \nwith Senator Strom Thurmond.\n  Thank you, sir. I salute you and I commend you and I want to say \npublicly it is a high honor and a great privilege to serve as your \ncolleague in this body of the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a few words of \ncongratulations and tribute to a great man.\n  When the history of American politics is written, somebody needs to \nput in a pretty good chapter just about Senator Strom Thurmond. This \ngentleman has seen and lived history as very few people have. He fought \non the beaches of Normandy at the age of 41.\n\n[[Page S5203]]\n\nHis grandfather fought in the Civil War. And his long and dedicated \nservice in the U.S. Senate deserves our honor today. He is both the \noldest living and the longest serving Senator in U.S. history.\n  Like many of my colleagues, he has made a run for the Presidency. \nThat is not so uncommon. But Senator Strom Thurmond ran against \nPresident Harry S Truman. That is a little bit different.\n  Senator Thurmond's life has been spent in public service. He has \nknown every President since Franklin Roosevelt. He has been a county \nsuperintendent of education, State senator, Governor, circuit judge. He \nhas been a schoolteacher, a coach. He has worked on a farm, and has \neven been a motorcycle rider, like my friend Senator Campbell.\n  Senator Thurmond is one of South Carolina's most successful exports, \nand clearly their favorite son.\n  I think it is worth noting that as times have changed, so has Senator \nThurmond. When you look back on his life, you see a pretty good \nreflection of the way he lives. The views of many Americans have \nchanged in this century. I think it is a good thing to know Senator \nThurmond, because his example shows us how someone who serves the \npublic can adapt to the times while still living by his core \nprinciples.\n  Strom is a fair man, a kind man, who steadfastly believes in what he \nsays. He believes in the rights of the people he represents to conduct \ntheir lives as they see fit. He has fought for that for years, and I \nthink that is extremely noteworthy. It is among the highest obligations \nthat elected officials can uphold.\n  But aside from all the history, I think what Senator Thurmond most \nwants to be noted for today is what he sought to do throughout his \nlife; and that is, there is no denying that this man is unendingly \nthoughtful and is faithful to his friends and family and the people \naround him.\n  There aren't too many folks in South Carolina who do not have a \nfirsthand story of Senator Thurmond picking up the phone to offer \ncongratulations or to offer condolences, and getting a note in the mail \nwhere he expresses his concern or his interest in something that has \nhappened in the life of a family.\n  I think that is the mark of the best kind of public service. You \ndon't forget that at the end of the day what matters is the people you \ncan count as friends. And people remember their friends. They respect a \ntrue leader who sticks by his guns. Regardless of your politics, that \nis the kind of respect any public servant strives for, and it is the \nmark of a true statesman and a true gentleman, and, in this case, a \ntrue Southern gentleman.\n  I have read that my colleague wants to be remembered as a man who is \nhonest, patriotic, and helpful. I am here to tell you that he is all \nthree.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Stevens). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, today it is a great honor for me to \njoin in this tribute to a remarkable man who has established a \nremarkable career, Senator Strom Thurmond.\n  Senator Thurmond has served America as a teacher, as an athletic \ncoach, an attorney, a judge, an Army officer, a war hero, a State \nsenator, a Governor, a Presidential candidate, a U.S. Senator, and, \nperhaps most importantly, a father and husband.\n  What an honor it is to serve with Senator Thurmond in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  I mentioned his role as father and husband. Mr. President, I am sure \nyou have seen also, on those occasions when we are all together with \nour family members, the wonderful pride that you see in the eyes of \nStrom Thurmond when he introduces his children to us, when he talks \nabout some of the great accomplishments of his children, and the \ntwinkle in his eye when he talks about his family.\n  While serving, Mr. President, in a variety of these capacities, it \nwas as a circuit judge when war with Germany broke out. As a judge, Mr. \nPresident, he was exempt from military service. But Strom Thurmond, as \nsoon as war was declared with Germany, traded in that robe for the \nuniform of the U.S. military.\n  Recently, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of World War II. We \nthink about all that that meant. And, for many of us, we had not even \nbeen born at that point--World War II. One of the key, key events of \nWorld War II was D-day, the invasion. And it was on that day that this \nformer circuit court judge joined in the invasion of the occupied \nterritory, and, in a glider, went behind enemy lines and fought for his \ncountry. Because of that, Senator Thurmond received 5 battle stars and \n18 decorations, including the Purple Heart and the Bronze Star for \nvalor. And we see that valor every day here in the U.S. Senate.\n  Senator Thurmond set a record for longevity of service in the U.S. \nSenate. But it is his record of accomplishment, not just the length of \nservice, that makes his career legendary.\n  It is my distinct pleasure and honor to serve with Strom as my \nchairman on the Senate Armed Services Committee.\n  As chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond \nis a tireless advocate of a strong defense, a strong America, and the \nmen and women who volunteer to wear the uniform of the United States, \nand with his distinguished, distinguished service in the military here \nis a man who every man and woman in uniform can look to with great \npride knowing how much he cares for them and the duty that they are \ncalled upon to carry out.\n  My colleagues know the strength of Senator Thurmond's convictions \nwhich can be measured directly by his grip on your arm as he discusses \nthose issues with you. Senator Thurmond has never been afraid to stand \nup for his principles and what he believes in, no matter how the \npolitical winds may be blowing.\n  In recognition of his career and his character, the people of South \nCarolina have elected Strom Thurmond seven times to represent them as \ntheir Senator, including the first time in 1954 as a write-in \ncandidate.\n  Mr. President, when we think about this remarkable life of Senator \nStrom Thurmond, who was born in the year 1902, think of all of the \nchanges that have taken place in this country of ours, all of the \nadvances in technology, all of the changes in the progress, the \nachievements of this Nation, of the world, here is a man who has seen \nit all. Here is a man, though, who has absolutely remained current. I \nhope that as I continue my life I can continue to be contemporary. When \nStrom Thurmond goes back to the wonderful State of South Carolina, it \nis the young people who identify with him as well. Here is someone they \nadmire and look to. Here is a man who because of his inquisitive mind, \nbecause of his wonderful sense of humor, his energy for life, and his \nunending love for his country, people of all ages admire.\n  We need the Strom Thurmonds of this country because it is the Strom \nThurmonds of this country who are the role models for the rest of us. \nAt some point when I conclude my career in the Senate, one of the \nthings I will be able to look back on is that I had the great honor of \nserving with Senator Strom Thurmond.\n  Senator Thurmond, as a citizen, I thank you for all that you mean to \nthe United States of America and God bless you.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from the State of \nAlaska, I suggest the absence of a quorum. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank you for presiding at this very \nimportant morning of celebration. We are here to talk about someone who \nis truly remarkable--our distinguished colleague, the President pro \ntempore of the Senate, the Senator from South Carolina, Strom Thurmond.\n  Pablo Picasso once said it takes a long time to grow young. This is \none\n\n[[Page S5204]]\n\npoint on which Strom and Picasso would agree. Picasso was still a \npainter at the age of 92, and of course, we all know what Strom \nThurmond is doing today. He is leading our Nation.\n  Strom often reminds me that Col. William Barrett Travis, the \ncommander at the Alamo, was from Strom's home county in South Carolina. \nAlthough Strom missed the Battle of the Alamo by a few years, he has \ndisplayed the spirit of the Alamo time and time again--the sense of \nduty and commitment to freedom that made Colonel Travis such a hero at \nthe Alamo.\n  He was commissioned in the Army in 1924, and though he didn't need \nto, he volunteered for service in World War II at the age of 40. He \nwanted to. He served in both the Pacific and the European theaters and \nlanded in a glider on the beach at Normandy on D-day. He earned 18 \ndecorations, including the Legion of Merit, the Purple Heart, and the \nBronze Star for Valor. He remained in the Army Reserve. He retired at \nthe rank of major general, following 36 years of active and reserve \nmilitary service, nearly 40 years ago.\n  I remember something that made such an impression on me in 1994 when \nI was a new Member of the Senate. We were celebrating the 50th \nanniversary of the landing at Normandy in 1944. I remember hearing--in \nabsolute awe--that one current Member of Congress who landed at \nNormandy, Strom Thurmond, was to be honored. He missed the anniversary, \nand I remember thinking to myself how extraordinary his reason was. \nStrom Thurmond, who volunteered at the age of 40, and who landed on a \nglider at D-day, missed the 50th anniversary because he had a son \ngraduating from high school. This is an extraordinary man. He has \nserved as a State senator, a circuit court judge, a Governor, a soldier \nin time of war, a Presidential candidate, and now is the oldest and \nlongest serving Senator in our Nation's history.\n  It was my pleasure to serve with Strom Thurmond on the Armed Services \nCommittee, and I can say as one who was there, he worked for only one \npurpose: To ensure our country's national defense remained strong. \nDuring his last campaign, Senator Thurmond asked the people of South \nCarolina one simple question: Who can do more to help steer the future \nof America toward the conservative principles we believe in? Who can \nbest continue to diligently and effectively help all the people of \nSouth Carolina? The people of South Carolina spoke resoundingly that \nthe person was Strom Thurmond and returned him to the U.S. Senate. We \nare here today to honor their choice and their confidence in this \ngentleman.\n  Strom has announced that it is, after all, a man's prerogative to \nchange his mind. He has announced that he will no longer support \ncontinual service without term limits. So, now that he has embraced \nterm limits, in a magnanimous gesture he has announced that he will not \nrun for reelection in 2002. We think that really is magnanimous because \nthere are few South Carolina politicians who would have the energy to \ntake on the man that we have affectionately dubbed ``The Thurmonater.''\n  He began his career in public service as a coach in 1923, and 74 \nyears later he remains a coach and teacher to all of us.\n  Senator Thurmond, it is a pleasure and an honor to work beside you, \nand I wish you continued success in a long and healthy life that I know \nyou will have.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, the celebration of the life and \nrecordbreaking Senate career of Senator Strom Thurmond gives each of us \nan opportunity to underline strengths of our friend and our colleague \nwhich we should emulate. Senator Thurmond is the oldest of our \ncolleagues, but my most vivid memories of him have often involved his \ninteraction with young people.\n  During a trip to military installations early in my Senate career, I \nlearned much about successful constituent relationships from Strom. \nEven while on the road, Strom Thurmond was receiving the names of South \nCarolinians who had recently died, were married, or enjoyed personal \nhonors such as graduation or academic recognition. With the assistance \nof his able staff, Strom obtained daily lists of names and placed \ntelephone calls, through his Washington office, to at least 2 dozen of \nthese persons, according to my observations, leaving appropriate \nmessages when necessary. He displayed the greatest excitement over \nstudents and could often identify their parents and their grandparents \nas he shared pride in the accomplishments of the entire family.\n\n  Upon arrival at one naval base that shall remain nameless, Strom \ndemonstrated another attribute, which has been partly responsible for \nhis longevity of Senatorial service. We were greeted by the naval \ncaptain who commanded the base and, after just a few words of \nconversation, Strom indicated that it was 4:30 in the afternoon, he had \nbeen traveling for hours, and he wanted to jog around the base. He \ninvited the astonished commanding officer to join him for the run and \nstrongly insisted that this would be an excellent opportunity. As \nnegotiations on the running assignment proceeded, the captain \nsuccessfully pled the press of urgent duties and encouraged a young \nensign to suit up for running duty with Senator Thurmond. I saw this \nepisode repeated on another occasion.\n  I noticed a remarkable excitement which young people enjoyed when \nrunning with Strom Thurmond. This excitement is not restricted to \nmiscellaneous strangers that Strom met across the country. Last summer, \nI found that Strom's son, Paul, was a member of my fraternity, Beta \nTheta Pi, and that several of his fraternity brothers were interns in \nSenator Thurmond's office. I invited them to lunch in the Senate dining \nroom where, midway through our meal, Strom entered with constituents \nfrom South Carolina. I was deeply touched while watching Paul greet his \ndad and the constituents and indicate to all the importance of the \nreelection campaign in which the entire family was heavily involved. \nPaul critiqued Strom's early morning TV appearance and the current \nstress of various activities, giving his dad advice. Then Paul and his \nfraternity brothers shared with me great stories about their \nexperiences with Strom, including his intense interest in their daily \nactivities.\n  All of us know from our daily visits with Strom Thurmond on the floor \nof the Senate that he greets each of us warmly. He is excited by these \nencounters, almost as if it were the first time in a long while that he \nhas seen us. In visiting with these young men who were interns in his \noffice, and later with my own son, David Lugar, who had a wonderful \nconversation with Strom at a fundraising reception, I found a common \ntheme.\n  Strom, obviously, is invigorated by his meetings with young people, \nand he has much to say to them about successful patterns of living. His \npolitical instruction is surely world class, and I suspect that all of \nus recognize the power of a truly disciplined life that has been lived \nwith the setting of important goals and the sustained activity \nnecessary to achieve them.\n  Very fortunately, Strom has not only set a record for longevity of \nservice in the Senate, he is still among us, giving encouragement each \nday and inspiring the best of our efforts. I am very grateful for the \nprivilege of serving with him.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to join in honoring a legend, \na legend not just in the Senate but also throughout the United States \nof America.\n  I have been privileged to serve with Senator Thurmond for 21 of the \nlast nearly 42 years that he has represented the State of South \nCarolina as one of the premier U.S. Senators in this body.\n\n[[Page S5205]]\n\n  When I first arrived in January 1977, Senator Thurmond was my special \nmentor. As my senior on the Senate Judiciary Committee, he gave me my \nfirst lessons of the committee's processes. Ever since then, he has \nbeen a personal and very special friend to me.\n  I have admired Senator Thurmond's strong commitment to federalism and \nhis steadfast support of the prerogatives of both State and local \ngovernments. I have admired his toughness in the matters of criminal \njustice. I have admired his objectivity and fairness when it comes to \nmatters concerning the judiciary. There can be no question that Senator \nThurmond has left his mark on the Senate Judiciary Committee and the \nlaws created by it.\n  Nearly 42 years of distinguished service in the U.S. Senate would be \na lifetime accomplishment for anybody--certainly for most people. But \nSenator Thurmond was just warming up when he arrived here for the first \ntime in 1955. Before that he was county superintendent of schools, \ncounty attorney, circuit judge, D-day hero with the 82d Airborne, \nGovernor of South Carolina, and Presidential candidate in 1948.\n  The problem with using the word ``legend'' is that many times the \nexploits ascribed to a legendary figure are exaggerated or apocryphal. \nBut it is entirely safe to say that Senator Thurmond is a legend. His \naccomplishments and contributions both for his beloved home State and \nhis country are very well documented. And a lot of us are very familiar \nwith them.\n  I will never forget his trip to Utah in 1991 to keynote my Utah \nSeniors Conference. About 1,000 seniors from all over the State of Utah \nand the intermountain West gathered in Salt Lake City for a day of \nworkshops and speakers on everything from retirement finances to travel \nbargains. Senator Thurmond is quite a role model. His enthusiasm for \nhis work, his family, for his country, and for life itself was genuine \nand infectious. Our people in Utah were so impressed, that he gave them \nso much to live for, so much to strive for, so much to try to be, that \nI will never forget that appearance out there in Utah.\n  We have been together on so many occasions and we have done so many \nthings together that I think I am in a special position to say how much \nI care for this wonderful human being and how proud I am that he has \nreached this milestone in the U.S. Senate. I am not sure that it will \never be broken.\n  Senator Thurmond is one who will leave a legacy not only of \nachievement but of honor and integrity to the Senate and the people of \nSouth Carolina. But, of course, it is premature to think that the \nlatest milestone is the last milestone. I do not believe Strom Thurmond \nis finished yet.\n  I have a lot of friends in the Senate, and I care for all of them. \nThis is a wonderful body. It is a collegial body. It is an important \nbody, the most important legislative body in the world today. But I \nhave no greater friend than my good friend from South Carolina, Strom \nThurmond.\n  He has been my mentor. He has been my friend. He has been my \nsupporter. He has been a person who has taken time to help me to know \nthe ropes here. And he is a human being who you cannot help but \nrespect.\n  I am proud that he has not lost a step. This man is as effective \ntoday as when I got here in 1977, in fact, in some ways maybe even more \neffective because of the additional 21 years of experience that he has \nbeen able to accumulate.\n  Senator Thurmond has been good to his staff. He is good to the people \naround the Senate. I have seen him shake hands with almost everybody \nwho comes his way. He takes time with young people, children, older \npeople, whoever. He stops and says hello and always has a cheery \nsalutation for people as he serves in the Senate.\n  I also know that there is nobody in the Senate who knows more about \nhis State and the people therein than Strom Thurmond. I have seen him \nmake phone calls to his State. I have seen him worry about funerals, \nabout deaths, about graduations, about education, about so many things \nthat really have been important for people in his State. I think it is \nprobably true that he has basically touched the lives and the hearts of \nvirtually everybody in the State of South Carolina. But it is also true \nthat he has touched the hearts of many of us throughout the rest of the \ncountry.\n  And I for one am a better person because of my relationship and the \nfriendship and brotherhood that I have with Strom Thurmond of South \nCarolina.\n  He is a great man. He is a legend. And I believe that he is going to \nmake these next number of years the most important years of his life. \nAnd if anybody can do it, it is my buddy, my friend, my mentor, Strom \nThurmond.\n\n  So I would have felt badly if I had not gotten over here and at least \nsaid a few of the things that are on my mind. I could go on for hours. \nBut this is a great man, one of the greatest that has ever lived in \nthis country. He is a great patriot, somebody who really loves this \ncountry and has given blood for it.\n  I want you to know, Senator Thurmond, I appreciate you. And I know I \nam not supposed to refer to you in the first person on the floor, but I \nam going to today. I appreciate you and appreciate the kindness and the \nfriendship you have shown me all these years. And we are going to be \nfriends forevermore. So I am grateful to you and I am happy to see you \nachieve this honor. And I wish you many, many more years in the U.S. \nSenate. And I know that as long as you will be here, that you will give \nit everything you have.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in his thought-provoking book, ``The \nFaith We Have Not Kept,'' Senator Strom Thurmond writes:\n\n       The nation that ceases to expand its consciousness begins \n     to die at that very moment. Once a nation loses its \n     conviction of truth, doubts, and self-doubts rob it of its \n     will and its strength.\n\n  During his 41 years and 10 months in the U.S. Senate, Senator Strom \nThurmond has certainly helped ensure that this great Nation continues \nto expand its consciousness and to ensure that we never lose the \nconviction of truth. In so doing, he has helped our Nation continue to \nthrive and prosper and build its will and its strength.\n  For these reasons, we admire as well as honor the man who this past \nSunday, on May 25, became the longest serving Senator in the history of \nthe United States.\n  From the start, I want to make it clear I have not always agreed with \nthe senior Senator from South Carolina. In fact, we probably disagreed \nmore than we have agreed.\n  But I also want to make clear that my disagreements with him have \nnever once diminished my admiration for him as a man, as a lawmaker, \nand as an American. Never once have our differences reduced my respect \nfor his tenacious fights for the causes in which he believes and his \nadherence to what he has called the bedrock for all our expectations, \nthe Constitution of the United States.\n  This historic achievement is another important milestone in the life \nand career of a man who has become a political icon of the South--a \nlife and a career that has included:\n  Being the first and only person to be elected to the U.S. Senate on a \nwrite-in ballot;\n  Delivering the longest speech in the history of the Senate, 24 hours, \nand 18 minutes; and,\n  Being the oldest person to have ever served here in the Senate.\n  One might be inclined to think that being a Federal lawmaker is all \nthat Strom Thurmond has ever done. Actually, he has done a few other \nthings. He has been a farmer, a lawyer, a teacher, a coach, an \neducation administrator, a judge, a Governor, a State senator, and an \nauthor. He is a soldier--a distinguished veteran of World War II who \nparticipated in the D-day invasion and has been awarded 5 military \nstars and 18 decorations. He has been a Democrat, a Dixiecrat, and a \nRepublican.\n  What a life.\n  What a career.\n  In addition to the skill and intellect, the doggedness and drive, and \nthe other\n\n[[Page S5206]]\n\nattributes that make for an outstanding senatorial career, Senator \nThurmond's historic achievement marks the career of someone:\n  Born before the birth of aviation--the year before the Wright \nbrothers took off in their plane at Kitty Hawk;\n  Elected to his first political office while Calvin Coolidge was \nPresident;\n  Who began serving in the Senate before some of its current Members, \nincluding this one, were born; and\n  Who has served with about one-fifth of the 1,843 men and women who \nhave been Members of the U.S. Senate.\n  For his long and distinguished career, the people of South Carolina \nare naming much of that State in Senator Thurmond's honor. Go to almost \nany town in his beautiful and beloved State and you will find Strom \nThurmond Street or Bridge. You will similarly find named in his honor a \nhigh school in Edgefield County, a student center at Baptist College, a \ndormitory at Winthrop College, a criminal justice building at the \nGreenville Technical College, a Federal building in Columbia, the \nCenter for Excellence in Government at Clemson, an auditorium at the \nUniversity of South Carolina School of Law, a mall in Columbia, and a \nvocational rehabilitation center in Aiken. You will also find Strom \nThurmond Lake, Dam, and Highway in Clarks Hill, the Strom Thurmond \nEducational Center in Union, the Strom Thurmond Biomedical Research \nCenter at the Medical University of South Carolina, and the Strom \nThurmond Defense Finance and Accounting Building in Charleston.\n  His office walls are covered floor to ceiling with awards too \nnumerous to mention. The people of South Carolina are obviously pleased \nand proud of their man in Washington just as we are pleased and proud \nto have him here with us.\n  It is interesting to note that the oldest and longest serving Member \nin Senate history has announced his support for term limits. After six \ndecades in political office and four decades in the Senate, this may be \nthe only way that he will ever leave the Senate.\n  One of his staffers aptly pointed out that ``graveyards in South \nCarolina are filled with people waiting for Strom Thurmond to die so \nthey could run for the Senate.''\n  Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Strom Thurmond for his \nremarkable career and his historic feat, becoming the longest serving \nSenator in U.S. history. I thank him for his contributions to the U.S. \nSenate, for his contributions in making this a better country, and for \nbeing a friend and a colleague. Finally, I thank him for expanding the \nconsciousness of this great Nation and ensuring that we never lose our \nconviction of truth.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have served in the Senate for 25 \nyears. Obviously, when compared with Senator Strom Thurmond, I do not \neven have any bragging rights yet.\n  I thought I would come down here to remark, for the Senate record and \nfor the distinguished Senator Thurmond, on a few of my thoughts about \nmy 25 years here, and what I remember most about Senator Thurmond. \nRather than talk about legislation, I will talk about some of his \nqualities and characteristics that stand out most in my mind.\n  I guess the most immediate thought that comes to mind is that he is a \nreal gentleman. I think when you have been such an acclaimed, esteemed \npolitical leader for as long as he has, it is a rare quality and rare \ncompliment that you can say he has never stopped being a gentleman. By \nthat, I mean he is considerate of everyone. He visits more people and \nattends more events to honor other people, than anyone I know, and he \ndoes it with great enthusiasm. He attends events, whether for the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee or a brandnew Senator--he puts \nit on his list and he spends an hour to an hour and a half, 3 or 4 \nnights a week, attending events to honor or help other people. It is \nabsolutely beyond belief how much energy and time he spends on other \npeople.\n  Second--and I hope this characteristic is never passe, I hope it is \nalways important--I believe he is about as loyal an American citizen as \nI have ever worked with, as I have ever exchanged views with, and that \nI have ever been privileged to call friend. By being a loyal American, \nwhat I mean is he is constantly asking what is good for America. When \nhe speaks about our national defense, you just know he loves this \ncountry. That is what I mean when I say he is a true, loyal American. \nHe is a patriot. He has served America and his constituents in his \nState in more capacities than anyone in this institution will ever be \nprivileged to serve. Yet, he is always optimistic and he is always sure \nand certain that this country--that he loves so much--is one of the \ngreat achievements of all humankind. He speaks of it as something that \nwe ought to be proud of, that we ought to preserve.\n  Mr. President, my last observation about Strom Thurmond is that he \nknows how to be a team player.\n  You know, it is entirely possible that a man of his exquisite \naccomplishments and seniority wouldn't have to be a team player. But I \ncan tell you, as one who has had to manage a large number of very, very \ntough measures on the floor of the Senate, Strom Thurmond is one of the \nbest team players when he believes you are trying to do is something \ngood for the country.\n  There are many other characteristics that other Senators will speak \nof. They are all well deserved. I am here to speak of my own \nevaluation: a gentleman, a true and loyal American, and a team player. \nThat is how view him. That is how I think many will view him they look \nat his great accomplishments and marvelous life.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate my good friend, \ncolleague, and neighbor, Strom Thurmond.\n  Mr. President, I cannot say much that has not already been said about \nSenator Thurmond. When I think about the life of Strom Thurmond, his \nlife is literally a chapter of American history.\n  Strom was born in 1902. This was the year before the Wright brothers \ndid their first flight. He has lived through four wars, and was a war \nhero in one of them--World War II. He was at Normandy in June of 1944 \nwhen we liberated Europe.\n  A funny and personal note, quickly: After I came to the Senate, Strom \nsaid to me on the floor one day, ``What year were you born?'' I told \nhim I was born in 1928, which made me pretty old. He looked at me and \nsaid, ``That was a good year. That was the year I was county \nsuperintendent of education.'' So I felt young again.\n  I congratulate him as the longest serving Senator in the history of \nthe United States. I can think of no one more fitting than Strom \nThurmond to hold this honor. He has devoted his entire adult life to \nserving the people of the United States and the people of South \nCarolina.\n  He first became a State senator in 1933, which was a pretty long time \nago. And he served as Governor from 1947 until 1951. He ran for \nPresident, and was a lot closer to being elected than most people \nrealized. But, more appropriately, they elected him to the Senate in \n1954 as a write-in candidate--so far as I know, the only write-in \ncandidate ever elected to the Senate. And they have reelected him ever \nsince, as both Democrat and Republican.\n  As his neighbor from North Carolina, I say to all South Carolinians \nthat they should be proud, and I know they are proud of Senator \nThurmond.\n  Senator Thurmond is a man of deep faith, and he truly has the courage \nof his convictions. In his long career, I have never heard anybody \nquestion his integrity or his dedication to public service. In this day \nand age of attack politics, Strom Thurmond is forever the gentleman. \nHis manner should be a role model for aspiring politicians and \nSenators.\n  Further, I can think of no one in the Senate who I would rather have \nas chairman of the Armed Services Committee. He is a veteran, he is a \nwar\n\n[[Page S5207]]\n\nhero, and he is a man of unwavering integrity and commitment to the \ncauses he believes in. And one of those principal causes is a strong \nnational defense. He is a man of principles, and one of those \nprinciples, I again repeat, is a strong national defense. It is the one \nidentifying characteristic, if no other, of Strom Thurmond.\n  I know that he will not let anyone ever weaken the national defense \nsystem as long as he is chairman. And I hope he remains chairman for a \nlong time to come.\n  Mr. President, I thank Strom Thurmond for his service, and as a \nnation we thank Strom Thurmond for his service. Our veterans and men in \nuniform throughout the country are aware of what he has done, what he \nrepresents, and he still has the strong support of them.\n  I look forward to continuing to serve with Senator Thurmond far into \nthe future.\n  I thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I have been an occupant of the Chair and \nlistened to many statements now concerning my good friend from South \nCarolina. So I am not going to repeat some of the matters concerning \nSenator Thurmond's personal background. I would like to just discuss \nsome of the memories I have of this great Senator.\n  It is a matter of coincidence, I guess, but Senator Thurmond came to \nthe Senate by appointment on December 24, 1954. I came to the Senate by \nappointment on December 24, 1968. I thank the Parliamentarian for \nassisting me in finding those dates. When I came to the Senate, Senator \nThurmond was 22d in seniority. It is an interesting thing that he is \nnow the first in line, and, on our side, I am now the second.\n  A great many people have come to the Senate, and left, since the \nfirst day that I came to the Senate and joined Senator Thurmond. But it \nwas with great interest that I met him because I read a great deal \nabout the Senator from South Carolina prior to coming to the Senate.\n\n  As a matter of history, I was trained to fly gliders in World War II \nand firmly expected to be deployed to the European theater, when I was \nreassigned into the China theater, and did not ever get to tow gliders \ninto combat. But I did train to tow them. And I was very interested to \nfind out that Senator Thurmond was one of those who led part of our \nforces flying a glider into the invasion in June 1944.\n  You know, the whole concept of using gliders was to insert troops far \nbeyond the shore defenses out in front. And that is, I think, what I \nwould say about Senator Thurmond: He has always been out in front.\n  He has also been a leader by example. There is one thing that young \nSenators coming into the Senate, whether in the group that I came in \n1968 or every new term that brings more Senators, soon learn. If you \nwant to see what a Senator should act like, should be like, you should \nemulate the Senator from South Carolina. As a matter of fact, my \nbrother, Bob, lives in South Carolina. When he speaks of ``my \nSenator,'' he is talking about Senator Thurmond--not me--because \nSenator Thurmond is a real champion of the people of his State. They \nknow him personally.\n  It was my privilege in one election to accompany Senator Thurmond to \nSouth Carolina and to go to campaign events with him. I want the Senate \nto know, if they want to learn how to campaign, that they ought to try \nthat. Because when Senator Thurmond goes into an event--and we went to \nseveral on that trip that I made with him to South Carolina--he does \nnot need someone standing beside him to remind him who people are. He \nloves campaigning. You can tell that he knows his people, and they love \nhim because it is a reunion. Each one of his campaign events are \nreunions. They are not just something to go to, to try to listen to; \nthey are supporters coming to meet their Senator. There is a great \ndifference, Mr. President. I think we all know that.\n  But time passes very quickly in the Senate. It passes quickly for \nthose who are busy. Some people come and leave very quickly because \nthey never really become part of the Senate family. Senator Thurmond \nhas been a leader not only in the Senate, but here on the floor and in \nthe Senate family.\n  My daughter, Lily--this is Uncle Strom to her. I think for almost \nevery one of us who have had young children here in the Senate, they \nhave had that same relationship to Senator Thurmond. She literally \nlights up when she sees Strom because she is meeting a friend. He \nreally vibrates with young people. And I like that as a father. But I \nalso admire it greatly in terms of his qualities and the way he \napproaches life.\n  I was thinking, as I sat there in the chair, about what I would say \nabout Senator Thurmond. My message to the Senate is, here is a man who \nloves life. There is a real joy to his life. He has had some sadness. \nBut he has had the strength to overcome that. But he really enjoys \nlife.\n  I remember when he used to tell me that I ought to work out more, \nthat I ought to get more exercise. I thought I was getting a lot of \nexercise. But I soon found out that I needed that exercise because \nevery time he grabbed me by the arm, I went away with a bruise. And I \nhad to get a little bit more muscle there so I could be close enough to \nhim so he could talk to me. You watch. He will do that when I finish. \nHe is going to grab me by the arm and let me know there is still \nstrength in that arm. And it is the strength of a strong heart, a heart \nthat really loves our country, and loves the Senate, and that really \nhas dignified the Senate in his years here.\n  He has been in some battles. He has been in some battles with me. But \nI will tell the Senate that no one in the Senate could have a better \nfriend than Strom Thurmond. I am proud to be here today to call him my \nfriend and to acknowledge his great leadership.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to join my \ncolleagues in paying tribute to the distinguished President pro tempore \nof the Senate, the senior Senator from South Carolina, Senator Strom \nThurmond.\n  Senator Thurmond was born at the dawn of the 20th century, on \nDecember 5, 1902, at Edgefield, SC. He has lived nearly every day of \nthis tumultuous century.\n  Mr. President, I take particular interest and pride in Senator \nThurmond's early career. After graduating from Clemson University in \n1923, Senator Thurmond embarked on 6 years of service as a public \nschool teacher and athletic coach. Mr. President, that is how I began \nmy own career after my own graduation from college.\n  Senator Thurmond subsequently served as his home county's \nsuperintendent of education from 1929 to 1933.\n  Having studied law at night under the tutelage of his father, Senator \nThurmond became a member of the South Carolina Bar in 1930. He was a \ncity attorney and county attorney from 1930 to 1938.\n  In 1933, Strom Thurmond was elected State senator, an office that he \nheld until 1938. He next served as a South Carolina circuit judge from \n1938 to 1946.\n  It has been my honor, Mr. President, to have served on the Armed \nServices Committee with Senator Thurmond since I was elected to the \nSenate in 1990 and, for the past more than two years, under his able \nleadership as chairman. Given that connection, I want to call special \nattention to Senator Thurmond's heroic service in World War II.\n  Mr. President, in June, 1944, Strom Thurmond volunteered to \nparticipate in D-day by parachuting into France, but was told that he \nwas too old. Instead, then-Judge Thurmond, age 41, participated in the \nNormandy Invasion by landing with members of the 325th Glider Infantry \nRegiment, 82d Airborne Division.\n  Ultimately, Strom Thurmond was awarded 5 battle stars and 18 \ndecorations, medals, and awards, including the Legion of Merit with oak \nleaf cluster, the Bronze Star Medal with ``V,'' the Purple Heart, the \nBelgian Order of the Crown, and the French Croix de Guerre.\n  After World War II, Mr. President, Strom Thurmond served as the \nGovernor of South Carolina from 1947 to 1951. He was the States' rights \nDemocratic nominee for President in 1948. He carried 4 States, \nreceiving 39 electoral votes.\n  Following his service as Governor of his beloved state, Strom \nThurmond\n\n[[Page S5208]]\n\npracticed law in Aiken, SC, from 1951 to 1955.\n  Mr. President, Strom Thurmond was elected to the U.S. Senate as a \nwrite-in candidate in 1954. He resigned in 1956, in the words of his \nofficial biography, in order ``to place the office in a primary, \npursuant to a promise to the people during the 1954 campaign.''\n  Subsequently, of course, Mr. President, Strom Thurmond was elected to \nthe Senate in 1956, and reelected in 1960, 1966, 1972, 1978, 1984, \n1990, and 1996. He has spoken of retirement after his current term, \nwhich will end after Senator Thurmond's 100th birthday on December 2, \n2002. I am sure that I am not alone when I say that I hope that he will \nreconsider.\n  Mr. President, it has been my honor and privilege to serve in the \nU.S. Senate with Senator Strom Thurmond for the past more than 6 years. \nI respect him, I admire him, and I value his friendship. I look forward \nto continuing to serve with him, under his leadership as President pro \ntempore of the Senate and as the Chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee, for many years to come.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, last week, Senator Strom Thurmond became \nthe longest-serving U.S. Senator in American history. That, in itself, \nis an amazing feat--42 years tirelessly representing his home State of \nSouth Carolina and our Nation. While this milestone rightly garnered \nmuch attention, it is because of Senator Thurmond's many \naccomplishments in and out of this Chamber, not simply the length of \nhis tenure, that he will always be remembered as one of the true giants \nof this institution and why he will go down in history as one of the \nmost important figures in 20th century American politics. I am proud to \nserve in the Senate with Strom Thurmond and glad to have this \nopportunity to honor him and his continuing record of achievement.\n  We all know of Strom Thurmond's legacy. Teacher, State senator, \njudge, soldier at Normandy, Governor, Presidential candidate, and U.S. \nSenator. Always guided by principle and a strong devotion to service, \nStrom Thurmond's life and career are an example to each and every one \nof us and are a poignant realization of the American dream.\n  Strom Thurmond grew up on a farm in Edgefield, SC, not far from where \nWilliam Barret Travis, the heroic commander of the Alamo, was born. He \nbegan his career as a teacher and athletic coach and his strong love of \neducation soon led him to be the youngest person ever to become \nsuperintendent of education for Edgefield County. In the ensuing years \nhe would further serve the people of South Carolina as a State senator \nand a circuit court judge. When World War II came, Strom Thurmond chose \nto leave the State he so loved to defend democracy overseas. As a \njudge, he was exempt from military service, but Senator Thurmond \nrelinquished his robe and volunteered for active duty in the military. \nHis war record is the stuff of legend: he fought in five battles, \nlanded by glider at Normandy on D-day and was ultimately awarded 5 \nbattle stars and 18 decorations for his service.\n  After the war, Strom Thurmond came home and was elected Governor, and \nin 1948, he ran for President. Soon after, he was elected as a write-in \ncandidate to the U.S. Senate, becoming the first person ever elected to \nthe Senate by this method.\n  Newly-elected Senator Thurmond, drawing upon his firsthand experience \nin the armed services, quickly became an expert on military and defense \nissues, beginning a lifelong dedication to our fighting men and women \nand an unwavering stand in favor of a strong national defense.\n  Senator Thurmond began his political career as a Democrat. But when \nhe concluded that the national Republican Party better embodied the \nprinciples and values he held and cherished, he made a bold decision to \nbecome a Republican in 1964. I know from experience that there are many \npressures and difficulties you face in leaving the party you grew up \nin, but I know that Strom has never regretted his decision.\n  Throughout his historic tenure in the Senate, as chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and as \nPresident pro tempore, Senator Strom Thurmond has served the people of \nSouth Carolina--and America--with uncommon distinction and honor. I \ncongratulate Senator Thurmond today. It is an honor to call him a \nfriend and colleague, and I look forward to his continued strong \nleadership in the U.S. Senate.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, in 1981, the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee had a new chairman, and a new ranking member, and there were \nmore than a few folks who were eagerly looking forward to the \nfireworks. With the election of a new, conservative Republican \nadministration and a new Republican majority in the Senate, The \nJudiciary Committee seemed destined to be a battleground for many of \nthe great philosophical questions which divided us then, and which \ndivide us now. And to many ``Washington Insiders,'' there was little \nprospect that Strom Thurmond--the veteran conservative Republican \nchairman from South Carolina who first made his mark on national \npolitics as a principal advocate of States rights--and Joe Biden--a \nnortheastern democrat still in his thirties whose interest in politics \nwas sparked in large part by the civil rights movement--could ever find \ncommon ground as we grappled with many of those fundamental questions.\n  I never shared those doubts, because by that time, Senator Thurmond \nand I had served together for 8 years. I knew that Strom Thurmond's \npersonal strengths, which I admired greatly regardless of our political \ndifferences, would guide the committee toward responsible consensus \nrather than divisive gridlock, and establish an atmosphere of civil and \nconstructive debate rather than divisive and meaningless partisan \nrhetoric.\n  In his 6 years as chairman, and for several years after we switched \nroles in 1987, Senator Thurmond exceeded my expectations in every way. \nWhile the Judiciary Committee did indeed go through some heated debates \nand contentious hearings--weathering the kind of controversy which I \nhave seen poison the well for other committees for years afterward--\nSenator Thurmond and I worked together to ensure that the committee's \nbusiness, the Nation's business, would go forward once the day was \ndone. That would not have happened had it not been for the strength of \ncharacter of our chairman.\n  First and foremost, Strom Thurmond is an absolute gentleman, \nunfailingly courteous and respectful of each individual's dignity. \nThroughout a lifetime spent in the political arena, he has never \nforgotten that those who disagree with us are nonetheless entitled to \nbeing heard out and treated with dignity. Indeed, that is an important \nreason that his lifetime in politics has been such a long and \nproductive one.\n  Here in the Senate, and--as I have seen firsthand--back home in South \nCarolina, Strom Thurmond's honesty and integrity are the hallmark of \nhis public and private reputation. His word is his bond, and each of \nus--even the most partisan of political opponents--knows that through \nthe heat of political debate, regardless of the intense pressure that \nmay be upon him, Strom Thurmond can be trusted to keep that word; not \nwhen it's politically possible or expedient, but always.\n  Here in the Senate, our integrity is, ultimately, our most valued \npossession, and Senator Thurmond is a living example of the value of \npersonal integrity.\n  Throughout our service on the Judiciary Committee, ``The Chairman'', \nhas distinguished himself by his commitment to absolute fairness; to \nRepublican and Democrat, political ally and philosophical opponent, \nalike. During the years when I held the gavel--and Strom will always be \n``The Chairman'' to me--I tried to match the example of fairness that \nhe set. Indeed, it is a legacy which I hope every committee chairman--\nand every senator--now and in the future, can strive to follow.\n  Long before he was a committee chairman; indeed long before he came \nto the Senate so many years ago, Strom Thurmond was the consummate \npublic servant, dedicated to the proposition that the political system \nis not an end in itself, but an arena for doing the public good. To \nthat end, he has been committed to getting things done; to meeting the \nchallenges facing our\n\n[[Page S5209]]\n\nNation and our people; and to accomplish those goals regardless of \npartisan politics. Though he holds the record for the Senate's longest \nfilibuster, Strom Thurmond is a doer rather than a talker, and his long \nlist of accomplishments here in the Senate is a testament to his \ndetermination to serve the people of South Carolina and this Nation.\n  ``Patriotism'' is a word that is used often in the course of \npolitical debate, sometimes by those seeking to further nothing more \nthan their own personal or political agendas. But patriotism has always \nbeen at the core of Strom Thurmond's being, whether in the fields of \nNormandy or in the Halls of the United States Senate. Senator Thurmond \nhas epitomized the notion that patriotism is neither an outdated value \nnor a term for scoring political points; but a living principle that \nchallenges us daily and refuses to let us rest on our laurels when it \ncomes to doing the public good.\n  Today, we commemorate Senator Thurmond's record-setting tenure here \nin this body. In recent weeks, because I am his friend in spite of our \nages and differing political philosophies, I have been asked numerous \ntimes to explain the secret to his long tenure. The truth of the matter \nis that--in addition to the fact that he is a testament to healthy \nliving--the secret to Strom Thurmond's political longevity lies, not \nwith his considerable political skills or with any local anomaly in \nSouth Carolina, but deep within Strom Thurmond himself.\n  It lies in his strength of character, his absolute honesty and \nintegrity, his strong sense of fairness, and his commitment to public \nservice. None of those things are skills which you learn; they are \nqualities deep within you which, when people know you well, they can \nsense. That is the secret to Strom Thurmond's success.\n  Strom Thurmond's ongoing legacy is not the number of years, months, \nand days he has served in the U.S. Senate. Rather it is his many \naccomplishments and the good that he has done during those years.\n  I have been honored and privileged to serve with and work with \nSenator Thurmond for many of those years. I am proud of the work we \nhave done together on the Senate Judiciary Committee. And I am proud to \ncall him my friend.\n  Mr. President, I join my colleagues in honoring this important \nbenchmark in Senator Thurmond's long career in public service, knowing \nthat he still has much to give and looking forward to working with him \nas we confront the challenges of the 21st century.\n  Mr. FRIST, Mr. President, on May 25, this Congress made history. On \nthat day, we became the Congress to have the longest sitting Senator in \nthe history of the United States. Our distinguished colleague and \nfriend, the senior Senator from South Carolina--Strom Thurmond--set the \nSenate longevity record, serving his State and Nation for 41 years and \n10 months. And like that little bunny, he just keeps going and going \nand going.\n  However, as impressive as Senator Thurmond's legacy of service are \nhis record of successes and the example of leadership he has achieved \nduring his tenure. Today he serves as President pro tempore--a \nconstitutional office that places him fourth in line to the Presidency. \nHe has served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the senior \nmember of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and he now serves as \nchairman of our powerful Armed Services Committee.\n  Senator Thurmond has been elected to eight consecutive terms since \nwinning his seat as a write-in candidate back in 1954.\n  We know of his breadth of experience: teacher, soldier, lawyer, \njudge, administrator, Governor, and even Presidential candidate; and we \nhave been inspired by his example.\n  We see in his life the values and possibilities that still \ndistinguish our great Nation. Small town virtues, selfless service, a \nsense of duty--roots buried deep in lifelong membership in the local \nMason Lodge, the Lion's and Rotary service organizations, the community \nchurch and hometown businesses. These all give Strom an authentic \nquality--a richness of character--an accessibility that's felt even by \nthose who don't know him as well as we do.\n  I cherish Strom's friendship. I count myself fortunate to have served \nthe many years I have served with this great Senator, and I can say \nthat I know of no one in this Chamber who doesn't look to him as I do--\nas a friend. And when you think about it, Mr. President, that's quite a \nremarkable thing to say about a man who started his political career \nwhen Calvin Coolidge was in the White House.\n  During this special time--as Senator Thurmond continues to bring \ndistinction to himself and to the U.S. Senate through his historic \nservice--I want to be counted among those who recognize and appreciate \nall that he has offered to South Carolina and to the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join in these \ntributes to our distinguished colleague, Senator Thurmond and his \nextraordinary record of service to the people of South Carolina and the \nNation.\n  In a very real sense, Senator Thurmond is the Cal Ripken of the \nSenate. He has set a record of longevity in the Senate that few if any \nof us ever thought would be broken. His service to the Senate extends \nover four decades, and we honor him today for that remarkable record of \nsuccess in public service and his enduring commitment to the Nation's \nhighest ideals.\n  Senator Thurmond and I have served together for many of these years \non both the Judiciary Committee and the Armed Services Committee. He \nwas chairman of the Judiciary Committee for 6 years in the 1980's and \nthe ranking Republican on the committee for many other years, and he \nwas always impressive and fair in dealing with all aspects of the \ncommittee's work.\n  Although we have often disagreed on the issues, we have also worked \nclosely together on many important challenges. I think particularly of \nour decade-long effort together on the Judiciary Committee to achieve \nFederal criminal law reform, especially with respect to laws on bail \nand sentencing. Our success in that important effort is an excellent \nexample of the ability of Democrats and Republicans to achieve common \nground and deal effectively with major problems facing the Nation.\n  In recent years, when South Carolina bore the brunt of the tragic \nepidemic of church arsons, Congress enacted bipartisan legislation to \ndeal with these shocking crimes, and Senator Thurmond played a vital \nrole in obtaining the resources needed for an effective response.\n  We have also worked closely on a wide range of immigration and \nrefugee issues on the Judiciary Committee. His leadership was \nindispensable for the enactment of the landmark Refugee Act of 1980--\nthe Nation's first comprehensive refugee law. its passage would not \nhave been possible without him.\n  Senator Thurmond has also dedicated his life, both in and out of the \nSenate, to protecting our national security, and I welcome this \nopportunity to pay tribute to his personal courage, heroism, and \npatriotism. Even though he was a sitting circuit court judge in South \nCarolina, he did not hesitate to enlist in the Army on the very day \nthat the United States declared war against Germany in 1941. He served \nin Europe with great distinction, parachuting into Normandy with the \n82d Airborne Division during the D-day invasion. He earned five battle \nstars and numerous other medals and awards, including the Legion of \nMerit, the Bronze Star, and the Purple Heart.\n  Like President Kennedy, he is a member of the generation that went to \ndistant lands to preserve America's freedom in World War II, and his \npublic service here at home has been dedicated to preserving that \nfreedom ever since.\n  As a member and now chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nhe continues to demonstrate his strong commitment to providing our \nArmed Forces with the equipment, training, leadership, and quality of \nlife that they need to make the Nation's military the world's finest.\n  On this auspicious occasion, I commend Senator Thurmond for his \nleadership and statesmanship and unparalleled record of public service, \nand I extend my warmest congratulations to the Senator and his family. \nI value his friendship, and I look forward to continuing to work \nclosely with him in the years to come.\n\n[[Page S5210]]\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am delighted to join in congratulating \nSenator Thurmond on attaining the distinction of being the Nation's \nlongest serving U.S. Senator.\n  Since coming to the Senate a little over 20 years ago, I have \nrespected Senator Thurmond's abilities, admired his tenacity, valued \nhis judgment, and treasured his friendship. He is an inspiration to all \nof us, not only because of the length of his service, but because of \nthe quality of his work and the depth of his commitment.\n  All of us marvel at the sheer duration of Strom Thurmond's tenure in \nthe Senate--42 years. But we congratulate him today not only for his \nlongevity, but for dedicating most of his adult life to public service. \nAs a school teacher and a coach, as an attorney, as a soldier who \nparticipated in the D-day landing at Normandy, as a State senator, as a \ncircuit court judge, as Governor of South Carolina, and as U.S. \nSenator, Strom Thurmond has repeatedly sought out opportunities to \nserve his community, State, and Nation.\n  And, due to his reputation for hard work and effective leadership, \nthe people of South Carolina have repeatedly demonstrated their \nconfidence in him--a degree of confidence among the voters that all of \nus aspire to but few achieve.\n  Senator Thurmond's unflagging vigor is evident to anyone who shakes \nhis hand--his handshake is firm and formidable. All of us hope and \nexpect that he will stay in the Senate until he reaches the age of 100 \nand beyond.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, it is both an honor and a personal \nprivilege for me to join my colleagues and rise today to pay tribute to \na great Senator, a great patriot, and now the longest-serving Senator \nin our Nation's history, the most distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina, Strom Thurmond.\n  Mr. President, the challenge for one trying to capsule this great \nAmerican's service to South Carolina and our Nation is considerable. \nAll Americans, however, should be encouraged--and I certainly encourage \nthem to do this--to access Senator Thurmond's home page and discover \nthe truly remarkable and unprecedented achievements of this man.\n  Mr. President, it has become very commonplace in public service \ntoday, especially in this city, to refer to individuals of \naccomplishment as ``great Americans.'' And in some respects it is so \ncommonplace that the term has even been overused, and sometimes even in \nhumorous fashion. But that is not the case with Senator Thurmond who \nhas been and is truly a great American in every sense of the word.\n  This man has 27 honorary degrees to go with his BS degree from his \nbeloved Clemson University. He has been a superintendent of education, \na judge, a decorated veteran and hero of World War II, and he earned 18 \ndecorations, medals, and awards. He has been a Governor of the Palmetto \nState. He has been a candidate for President, the first person ever to \nbe elected to a major office on a write-in, a leader within three--not \ntwo--three political parties. And, obviously, he is our President pro \ntem of this body, and continues to serve as chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee providing continued leadership in behalf of our \nmilitary and national security and the individual freedoms we all enjoy \nand also take for granted.\n  If you think about this man's career, and as many of our colleagues \nacross the aisle have said, regardless of issue or politics, it is \nunequaled, it is basically unparalleled.\n  Mr. President, the other challenge in paying tribute to Senator \nThurmond is what to say that has not already been said by his many \nfriends, his constituents, his family, and his colleagues.\n  But having said that, I do have a rather unique relationship with the \nSenator. I am sure that my colleagues have all heard of fathers-in-law \nand mothers-in-law and brothers-in-law. Well, I am proud to say that I \nam a Thurmond staff-in-law.\n  The number of South Carolinians and others who have worked for the \nSenator in various capacities number in the thousands. We could \naccurately call them ``storm troops for Strom.'' And one of those \nformer staff members is my wife, Franki, who worked for the Senator \nback when I first came to Washington as a new administrative assistant \nto then-Senator Frank Carlson of Kansas. As a matter of fact, it was \nStrom Thurmond who told me about all of the South Carolina magnolia \nblossoms who came north and whose charms attracted future husbands, \nalways to return to South Carolina. Put another way, Senator Thurmond \nsaid, ``You can take the girl out of the South, but not the South out \nof the girl.'' And that is what happened to me, a Capitol Hill romance \nif you will, a South Carolina wedding, and in our family a Kansas-South \nCarolina compromise, always to South Carolina.\n  So while many in this body have thanked the Senator for many \ndeserving contributions and accomplishments, mine is somewhat unique.\n  Thank you, Strom, for introducing me to my future wife and the mother \nof my three children, David, Ashleigh, and Anne-Wesley. All three, by \nthe way, are Strom Thurmond fans, having met the Senator many times and \nsharing occasions with his family. In that regard, my wife Franki \ncounts Mrs. Thurmond, Nancy, as a very good and a close friend as well.\n  As a matter of fact, Mr. President, while I was really jotting down \nmy remarks that I am making today, I noted with nostalgia that my \nSenate office overlooks the Methodist building that has served as home \nfor many young women when they first work on Capitol Hill when they \nfirst come to Washington. When my wife, Franki, looked out that window, \nwe both noted in some respects our family had come full circle. Her \ndesk in my office looks out on her first home in Washington.\n  Again, thank you, Senator Strom Thurmond.\n  I might add, Mr. President, with the privilege of serving in this \nbody I have finally achieved status in the Thurmond universe. I am now \nSenator Roberts instead of that Congressman who married Franki.\n  And now, Mr. President, what with all of the Senator's friends having \npaid tribute to him, what they really said in their many deserving \ntributes to Senator Thurmond is that the Strom Thurmond family has come \nfirst. Every time I see the Senator he comes up to me with that smile \nand that twinkle in his eye and, yes, that firm grip that many of my \ncolleagues have described on my arm--and it is a firm grip--and he \nasks, ``How's your family, your lovely wife and your family?'' And he \nmeans it. He cares.\n  One of our treasured scrapbook pictures captured Strom all dressed up \nas Santa Claus some years back with his staff and his and their \nfamilies. And there we sit in the front row with all of the kids and \nthe proud parents. To me, that picture is Strom Thurmond, and enlarged \nit could just as well be a picture of his beloved South Carolina, or \nthis great Nation, for South Carolina and America are his family as \nwell, and he has served them well.\n  Senator Thurmond, a colleague, friend, patriot, and, yes, a great \nAmerican, thank you for your continued service. It is a privilege to \nserve with you.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, as one of the newly elected freshmen it is a \ngreat honor and a privilege to have this chance to extend my \ncongratulations and best wishes to the president of the senior class--\nStrom Thurmond. A term of service that began on December 24, 1954, now \nenters the record books as the longest, and one of the most \ndistinguished terms of service, by any Senator.\n  Over the years, we have all witnessed Strom Thurmond's great \nsuccesses in the Senate and back home in his beloved South Carolina. I \nthink I have found the secret to his success, and I would like to share \nit with my colleagues. Simply put, Strom Thurmond listens to his \nconstituents--otherwise known as voters--and he hears what they have to \nsay. Then he brings that South Carolina brand of common sense back to \nthe Senate as we tackle those thorny issues that come to our attention \nin committee and on the floor. Strom Thurmond has been doing that for \nover 40 years now, and it is clear that the people of South Carolina \nlike his style.\n  Anyone who has any doubts about Strom Thurmond's popularity back home \nneed only check the record. There is no greater gauge of the strength \nof anyone's support in his or her home State than to see how you\n\n[[Page S5211]]\n\nfare at election time. Again, Strom Thurmond has sole possession of the \nrecord for he is the only one who has ever been elected to the Senate \non a write-in vote. Simply put, the people of South Carolina love him \nas much as he loves them. That is why they keep sending him back.\n  Still, Strom Thurmond is not being celebrated and toasted by all of \nour colleagues because of his longevity alone. We take notice of his \nmany years of service in the Senate, but we also make mention of our \ngreat appreciation of the wisdom, insight, and determined effort Strom \nThurmond brings to the work of the Senate every day.\n  Oliver Wendell Holmes once wrote a letter to Julia Ward Howe on the \noccasion of her 70th birthday. In it he said, ``To be seventy years \nyoung is sometimes far more cheerful and hopeful than to be forty years \nold.''\n  As we mark Strom Thurmond's legacy of service in the Senate, I think \nit is clear that no one is younger in spirit, more cheerful in \nattitude, and more hopeful for a better future for our children and \ngrandchildren than Strom Thurmond.\n  It is an honor and a pleasure, as the Senator who sits on the 100th \nrung on the current seniority ladder, to take this opportunity to \ncongratulate the Senator on the top rung, Strom Thurmond, as he hits \nNo. 1 one on the all time seniority list.\n  From this day forth Strom Thurmond will set a new record every day he \ncomes to the Senate. He has been a powerful and effective voice for his \nconstituents. May he continue to do so for many years to come.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I rise to honor a great American and \nSenator, Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. The occasion for this \ntribute is Strom Thurmond's remarkable achievement of becoming the \nlongest serving Member of Congress in history, surpassing the record \nheld by Carl Hayden of Arizona.\n  This historical milestone gives each of us an opportunity to publicly \napplaud Senator Thurmond, but it is not the reason for our praise \ntoday. The reason I am pleased and honored to pay tribute to Senator \nThurmond is that he is a great man and patriot who has served his State \nand his country faithfully in times of war and in times of peace.\n  Senator Thurmond has had a remarkable life. When I reflect on some of \nthe positions he has held in his career, including: attorney, \nsuperintendent of education, State senator, judge, Governor, Army \nofficer, Presidential candidate, and U.S. Senator, I marvel at the \nskill, determination and dedication that was required to achieve each \nof these goals. Most men would be satisfied with just one of these many \ncareers. Not Strom Thurmond. He was on a mission to serve the American \npeople. That mission kept pushing him to strive higher and farther in \nhis lifetime of public service.\n  I came to know Strom Thurmond through my work on the defense \ncommittee in the House of Representatives. I know Senator Thurmond is a \nvery capable legislator in many issue areas. I now serve with him on \nthe Judiciary Committee, for example, and can attest that he is a most \ncapable attorney. I also know that the people of South Carolina are \nenormously proud of him for all the good work he has done for their \nfine State. From my perspective, there is one area in which I believe \nSenator Thurmond has stood out and has made the greatest contribution-- \nas an active member of the Armed Services Committee.\n  Strom Thurmond deeply loves his country. This is apparent in even \nlittle things such as the American flag lapel pin he often wears. Or in \nvivid examples like volunteering for service in World War II when he \nwas in his forties. Today, Senator Thurmond demonstrates his strong \naffection for America and the men and women in uniform by having the \ncourage to take unpopular positions to protect the defense budget and \nto ensure adequate training and equipment for the Armed Forces. As \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee he has presided over \ntumultuous times in the military. The end of the cold war and the \nsocial reengineering of the military have made it a challenge to \npreserve military readiness. But, Senator Thurmond has tried. He \ndeserves much of the credit for preventing our Armed Forces from \nbecoming a hollow Army. As Adlai Stevenson once said, he did this ``Not \n[through] a short and frenzied outburst of emotion, but with the \ntranquil and steady dedication of a lifetime.''\n  Upon his retirement, Carl Hayden said ``I have always dreamed of \npower and the good I could do.'' Strom Thurmond, I believe, has the \nsame motivation. He has not wanted material things or glory, but has \nsimply done the best he could to help those who needed help. Carl \nHayden could not lose his longevity record to a finer man.\n  I remember a recent visit to Senator Thurmond's office where I was \ngreeted by an impressive gallery of presidential pictures, beginning \nwith Franklin Roosevelt. He told me that these pictures are of \nPresidents with whom he has served. It was then that I absorbed the \nmagnitude of the impact of the Thurmond legacy on history. Strom \nThurmond has been involved in every significant event that touched \nCongress or the Presidency in the second half of the 20th century. Very \nfew people can say that, Mr President.\n  Strom Thurmond was a good soldier and good citizen. His high standard \nof allegiance has enriched our national consciousness and has sustained \na sense of purpose and patriotism all across America. I believe history \nwill remember him not for his age or longevity in the Senate, but for \nhis contributions to improve the well-being of his beloved America.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it is not often during the course of \nour busy days here in the Senate that we take time to recognize one of \nour colleagues for their individual accomplishments. Today, however, we \nare doing so on the occasion of Strom Thurmond's history making event \nof having served longer in the U.S. Senate than anyone since the \nfounding of our country. I join with my colleagues in paying special \ntribute to Senator Thurmond, the Senior Senator from South Carolina, on \nthis noteworthy day.\n  On May 25, Senator Thurmond became the longest serving Member ever in \nthe Senate's 208-year history by serving more than the 41 years and 10 \nmonths Senator Carl Hayden served between 1927 and 1969. Senator \nThurmond's longevity in Senate service is truly remarkable because, in \naddition to length of service, he has been deeply commited to providing \nleadership in the Armed Services Committee and as the President pro \ntempore.\n  Senator Thurmond has worn many hats during his distinguished career \nin public service, which began well before he was first elected to the \nSenate in 1954. As a school teacher, State senator, judge, World War II \nveteran, D-day fighter, and Governor, Senator Thurmond's service to our \ncountry is very likely unparalleled. In the Senate, Strom has been an \nindefatigable fighter on behalf of his State of South Carolina and has \ndemonstrated enormous tenacity in championing our national defense and \nveterans causes. His enthusiasm in all that he does is truly unmatched.\n  Mr. President, although Senator Thurmond and I may not always see eye \nto eye, I respect his integrity, his consideration of others, his love \nof country, and his deep sense of responsibility to public service. His \nservice will have a lasting impact on this institution's history \nbecause of the policies he promoted, the high standards he set for us, \nand the lessons he taught so many of us about the will to carry on no \nmatter the obstacle. He fought against the most painful of tragedies by \ntrying to make sure others were spared the grief he endured. I look \nforward to continuing working alongside him for many years to come and \nhope to witness his service at his personal century mark.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am privileged to honor my friend \nand colleague, the distinguished Senator from South Carolina, Strom \nThurmond. Today we salute Senator Thurmond, who becomes the Senate's \nlongest serving Member.\n  It only seems fitting that I should be allowed to speak in his honor \ntoday. Several years ago our roles were reversed, and the distinguished \nSenator was thanking me. Now I would like to return the honor and thank \nhim for his years of leadership. When Senator Thurmond was jostled in \nthe subway 2 years ago, I used my years of police\n\n[[Page S5212]]\n\ntraining to come to his aid and help the police to handcuff his \nassailant. Fortunately, no one was hurt. The incident led to a \nfriendship between the Senator and me that I very much enjoy.\n  Now we are all here to recognize the achievements of Senator Thurmond \nand commend his years of dedicated leadership and service. The senior \nSenator from South Carolina has used his skill and knowledge to serve \nthe Senate and provide direction for over 43 years.\n  Senator Thurmond has provided strong leadership in this institution, \nboth on the floor and in committee. He has drawn from his own personal \nknowledge from his decorated service in World War II to contribute to \nand lead the Armed Services Committee and the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee.\n  In 1942, Senator Thurmond joined the U.S. Army, and was among those \nbrave young men of the 82d Airborne Division who landed in Normandy on \nD-day. For this service, he was awarded 5 Battle Stars. After earning \n18 decorations for outstanding service in World War II, Senator \nThurmond has maintained his dedication to war veterans throughout his \nyears in the Senate. Senator Thurmond represents a wealth of \ninstitutional knowledge and history.\n  Senator Thurmond's tenure has spanned a number of tumultuous decades, \nfrom the end of World War II, through the turmoil of the Vietnam war, \nto the end of the cold war, to this year, when the Congress finally \nagreed to a balanced budget. Through it all he provided the strong \nleadership which we are here to honor today.\n  It gives me great pleasure to recognize our esteemed colleague as he \nbecomes our longest serving U.S. Senator. Congratulations, Strom \nThurmond, on making history as well as being a major part of our \nNation's history.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth). The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Parliamentary inquiry. I understand there is a unanimous \nconsent that these proceedings paying our respect to the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina are to continue until 12:30. Is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. HELMS. I want to defer to the Senator from Florida. But before I \ndo, I ask unanimous consent that, notwithstanding the previous \nunanimous consent, when these proceedings are completed and before we \nrecess for the policy meetings of the two parties, that I be given 10 \nor 12 minutes to speak on a joint resolution that I am introducing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I thank the Chair for the recognition.\n  I, like my colleagues, have come to the floor of the Senate today to \nexpress my fond feelings for Senator Thurmond, the Senator from South \nCarolina. As he is fond of saying about so many of us that he campaigns \nfor, he is a man of character. He is a man of capacity. And I would add \nthat he truly is a man who cares about his fellow man.\n\n  Senator Stevens said a moment ago that Senator Thurmond is someone we \ncan all learn from. I can tell you as a fellow who was running, \ncampaigning for the Senate in 1988, Senator Thurmond volunteered to \ncome to Florida to campaign for me. One of the things he said prior to \nmaking that commitment was that ``if I come, I want to be busy. I do \nnot want to come down there for just one or two events. I want to come \ndown there, I want to be busy.'' We picked him up at about 5:30 in the \nmorning and we finished that day about 10 o'clock at night. We traveled \nfrom Jacksonville, FL, down through the center part of the State, to \nLakeland and Tampa, and then an event close to Winter Haven that \nevening, never missing a beat.\n  And again, I say I learned not just about campaigning but I truly \nlearned about the heart of the man because about halfway through the \nday there was a press conference set up. He asked me if he could make a \nphone call before we did that press conference. And, of course, I said \nsure. And as I stood by him I realized what he was doing. He was \ncalling a family in South Carolina that experienced the loss of a \nfamily member. Here is this man who has been elected and reelected and \nreelected and reelected, and loved in South Carolina in the middle of a \ntough day campaigning taking a moment out of that busy schedule to \nreach out to that family in South Carolina to say we understand your \nconcern, the pain that you are feeling, we are concerned about you; I \nam concerned about you. Your family member was a great, great person; \nhe meant so much to me.\n  Can you imagine the sense of love the family felt that day. If \nanybody ever questions why Senator Thurmond has been elected and \nreelected and reelected and reelected, it is because he is a man who \ntruly cares about others, whose heart is filled with love.\n  I came to the Senate 9 years ago, and in a sense Senator Thurmond \nacts as a bridge between one generation of my family and myself. My \nstep-grandfather retired from the Senate in December 1952, and Senator \nThurmond, if I have that correct, was sworn in to the Senate in the \nnext Congress, and so he served in that interim period of time between \nthe time that my step-grandfather retired from the Senate and I came to \nthe Senate.\n  What an inspiration he has been to me. Frankly, Senator Thurmond, you \nhave created a new dimension of what service to this country is all \nabout. You have created a new dimension about service to the Senate. A \nmoment ago I heard Senator Stevens talk about a strong heart, and it \ntriggered in my mind that in essence, Senator Thurmond, you are a \nmodern day brave heart, and it is has been a true honor to serve with \nyou in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am honored to be in this great body \nand particularly honored today to be able to say a few words from my \nheart about the Senator from South Carolina. I have no doubt really \nthat I would not be here today if it were not for Senator Thurmond. I \nfirst met him--and this is typical of his leadership and commitment to \nthis country--when I was a U.S. attorney in the early 1980's. I had \njust been appointed. There was a reception the Attorney General of the \nUnited States had. He came to that reception and stayed 30 to 40 \nminutes. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he stayed and he met \nevery U.S. attorney in attendance that night before he left. That \ndemonstrated to me his commitment to law and order.\n  Many people have talked about his leadership with regard to military \nmatters, and they are certainly legendary and unsurpassed in this body. \nBut in terms of law enforcement, he has been an absolutely key figure \nin the reform of the Federal criminal justice system in America, that \nmakes our Federal criminal justice system today, in my opinion, \nsuperior to any State criminal justice system. He did that in many \nbills, but in the 1984 act he was chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nthat eliminated parole and made every person who is sentenced in \nAmerica serve the full time they are sentenced, that reformed the bail \nlaw so that people could not be out on bail for years before they were \never tried, and many other reforms--the most historic criminal justice \nreform bill, I am certain, in my lifetime. He was a key player and a \nleader.\n  In 1986, I had the pleasure to be a nominee for U.S. district judge. \nThat was not an experience which worked out good for me, but Senator \nThurmond believed in me. He fought for me. He stood by me day after \nday. He refuted the charges that were made that were not true, and he \nstood by me.\n\n  A number of years later, he came to Mobile as a Patriot of the Year. \nThere were 600 people from the city of Mobile there, and he recognized \nme in the audience. He said good things about me. His support, his \nfriendship, his steadfast commitment to me and to this body was \nimportant in my career and I want to say personally how much I \nappreciate that, Senator Thurmond. It is amazing to me that I have the \nhonor and the privilege to be in this body and to be able to say to you \nhow much I appreciate your support and friendship, to say how much I \nappreciate your service to your country, as a military\n\n[[Page S5213]]\n\nleader and as a Member of this body. I know some may think it not \npolitically correct, but I will say this. Senator Thurmond has \nrepresented his State with great fidelity and character. He has \nrepresented his region as a southerner with the highest of standards as \na southern gentleman. He has reflected the qualities of courage and \nintegrity, bravery and commitment to truth that have reflected great \ncredit on his community, his State, his region, his Nation, and this \nbody. I am honored to have the opportunity to say how much I appreciate \nthat.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMichigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to join with so many of \nour colleagues today to honor the President pro tempore of the U.S. \nSenate and the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. Strom Thurmond \nachieved another of many historic milestones when he became the longest \nserving Senator in the history of this institution.\n  Strom Thurmond had already served on the Armed Services Committee for \n20 years when I came to the Senate and joined the committee in January \n1979. I knew of him as a passionate and effective advocate for a strong \nnational defense even before I joined the committee. In the 18 years I \nhave served on that committee, I have come to appreciate even more his \ncommitment to the welfare of the men and women who serve and who have \nserved in our Nation's Armed Forces, as well as their families.\n  It is my privilege now to serve as the ranking member of the Armed \nServices Committee under the chairmanship of Strom Thurmond. Over the \nyears, one of the hallmarks of the Armed Services Committee has been \nthat we conduct our business with a minimum of partisanship. Our former \ncolleague and chairman, Sam Nunn, was right when he said that there was \nnot a single national security issue facing this country that has been \nor could be solved by one political party. That legacy of \nbipartisanship on the Armed Services Committee continues under Strom \nThurmond's leadership.\n  Mr. President, one of the reasons Senator Thurmond has been such an \neffective leader on national security issues is that all of his \ncolleagues know--and the American people know--that he speaks from the \nheart and he speaks from personal experience. He served his country in \nuniform for 36 years. He was commissioned in the Army Reserve even \nbefore he began his career in politics. He served 36 years in the \nReserves and on active duty before retiring as a major general in the \nArmy Reserve.\n  In June 1944, Lt. Col. Strom Thurmond landed behind German lines with \nthe rest of the 82d Airborne Division as part of the D-day invasion. As \nI and so many others watched the 50th anniversary of the Normandy \ninvasion 3 years ago, we gained an even greater appreciation for the \nlifetime of service to this Nation by someone all of us are proud to \ncall a friend and a colleague.\n  More than a half century after landing behind enemy lines on D-day, \nSenator Thurmond continues to carry out his responsibilities as a \nlegislator with a skill and perseverance that are the envy of his \ncolleagues. I recall a time several years ago when Strom Thurmond and I \noffered an amendment to reform lobbying fees. Our amendment prohibited \nlobbyists who were lobbying for contracts for their clients from \ngetting a contingent fee. We felt it was wrong for lobbyists to be paid \nthat way and we offered an amendment together. The manager of the bill \nobjected to our amendment. What Senator Thurmond did was to hold back \nfor a couple hours while he talked to all of our colleagues personally. \nHe got 51 supporters for his amendment, and then came back to offer it. \nThat kind of perseverance which we know in Senator Thurmond has paid \noff in many, many ways for this institution and for this Nation. We are \nproud to call him a friend and to recognize that kind of capability.\n  The Democratic Party lost a Senator of great ability when Strom \nThurmond joined the Republican Party in 1964. I just want him to know \nthat we would welcome him back on this side of the aisle at any time, \nthis century or next.\n  Senator Thurmond cares about us as people. I cannot say how many \ntimes he has given me advice--and I know this is true of our \ncolleagues--on exercise, on diet, and on other human conditions. I wish \nI had followed his advice more often.\n  I will never forget the time early in my Senate career when Strom and \nI and a few of our Armed Services Committee colleagues were out \nvisiting at a California air base. At about 6 o'clock in the morning I \nwas awakened by people running below. They were talking to each other \nas they were running. I heard this happen on a few turns of the track \nand woke up and then would go back to sleep. A couple of hours later \nwhen I was at breakfast I said, ``Who was that out here running at 6 \no'clock in the morning?'' I should have known the answer. It was Strom \nThurmond.\n\n  He has given us advice on how to try to achieve this kind of \nlongevity. He gives us that advice because he cares about us. And I \njust want him to know that we care about him. We wish him well. It has \nbeen a real privilege to serve with him for 18 years, particularly as \nthe ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, and I am proud to \ncall him a friend.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Our distinguished friend and colleague from South Carolina has long \nbeen, as the saying goes, a legend in his own time. And because of his \nhale and hearty good health and his amazing longevity, Senator Thurmond \nis a legend in the time of everybody else in the Senate. I doubt that \nthere is any one of us whose life has not been touched by the \ndistinguished Senator from South Carolina. He has certainly touched \nmine time and time again, beginning with that day back in early 1972 \nwhen a very brief, speculative item appeared on page umpteen of \nnewspapers around the country saying that a fellow named Helms might \nseek the Republican nomination for the Senate from North Carolina.\n  Early that morning, Senator Strom Thurmond, to my utter delight, was \non the telephone calling from Washington urging that I do run and \nassuring me that if I did and if I wanted him to, he would come to \nNorth Carolina and campaign for me. Mr. President, I did and Strom did. \nAs a matter of fact, he did it time and time again. If I count \ncorrectly, he flew with me that year, in a very small plane, six times \nback and forth across North Carolina, telling the people of my State, \nDemocrats and Republicans alike, that they ought to send Jesse Helms to \nWashington. I will never forget it.\n\n  I remember one episode in particular, since we are all remembering \nnice things about Senator Thurmond. We were at a farm rally outside of \nHickory, NC, after a grueling day of eight stops with that small plane, \nand he made a stemwinder speech at every one of them. I was getting \nmore and more tired. We ended up at this farm, and there were about 400 \npeople at that rally because they were giving away free barbecue and \nbecause Strom Thurmond was there. The barbecue caterer was late. He got \nlost trying to find the place. So they decided to let Senator Thurmond \nspeak and they asked me to introduce my guest. I was a weary guy when I \ngot up, and I introduced Senator Thurmond with such eloquence as I \ncould muster at that time of night after such a day. Well, there came \nanother stemwinder and the last 10 minutes of the stemwinder, we saw \nthe barbecue truck roll in. Everybody had barbecue and then we went \nhome.\n  In the car going to the motel I heard the most awful sound I ever \nheard in my life. He said, ``Jesse, when we get to the motel, I want to \ncall my wife. She's in a family way, you know, and I want to be sure \nshe's all right. And, after that, I understand it's about a mile to \ndowntown, would you want to run downtown and back with me?''\n  I said, ``Senator, if I could crawl to the bed, that's the best I'm \ngoing to be able to do.'' But he did. He ran downtown and he ran back \nand he was up at 6 o'clock next morning.\n  Thanks to my dear friend, the people did send me to Washington, and I \nhave been here for almost a quarter of a century now, watching that \ngreat man from South Carolina serve in the Senate and break record \nafter record. I\n\n[[Page S5214]]\n\nhave been enormously proud of a lot of things. I guess one of the most \nprofound things was when the Senator and Mrs. Thurmond invited me to \nbecome the godfather of that beautiful young lady, Juliana Thurmond.\n  So I am proud to have served with Senator Thurmond. He is a \nremarkable American because he has always been a hard-working, honest, \nand reliable Senator. His friends back home--as a matter of fact his \nfriends all over the country--know that they can always count on Strom \nThurmond to do what he says he will do. Let me tell you something, Mr. \nPresident, South Carolina is far the better off today because Strom \nThurmond has been in the Senate representing the State of South \nCarolina. Moreover, and just as important, the U.S. Senate is better \nbecause Strom Thurmond has been here. And so is the country, better \noff.\n  Congratulations, my dear friend and Senator, you have been a good and \nfaithful servant, and all of us are proud of you.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I see my other colleagues here on the floor. \nI, too, wish to rise this afternoon and pay tribute to my friend and \ncolleague from South Carolina. This past Memorial Day, we recognized \nthe significant achievements and accomplishments of many Americans who \nsacrificed their lives for this country. In a matter of days, we will \ncommemorate the 50th anniversary of the famous speech that Gen. George \nMarshall gave at Harvard University announcing the Marshall Plan on \nJune 7, 1947. But this past Memorial Day, we also recognized a \nmilestone achieved by our colleague from South Carolina, who became the \nlongest serving Member in the history of the U.S. Senate.\n  I was recalling the words of another famous American given in a \nMemorial Day address in 1884. Chief Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, \nanother great American known for his longevity, said on that day, \n``Life is action and passion. It is required of a man that he should \nshare the passion and action of his time at peril of being judged not \nto have lived.''\n  Mr. President, whatever else may be said about our friend and \ncolleague, Strom Thurmond, he is a man of action and passion. That has \nbeen the history of his public life. It is a distinguished career that \nhas covered so many milestones, many of which have been mentioned here \nthis morning.\n  One of his accomplishments which impressed me the most was the fact \nthat at age 41, when a lot of people are preparing to play a round of \ngolf, Strom Thurmond got into a glider and flew behind enemy lines on \nD-day as a volunteer. It was not required of him. He was not ordered to \ndo it. But at that age he decided this is something he ought to do, to \nbe a part of a major effort to retard one of the greatest threats in \nhistory, certainly in the history of this country, to democracy and \nfreedom. A remarkable statement about an individual.\n  I am also deeply impressed by the fact that he was elected to the \nSenate under four different banners: as a Democrat, as a Republican, as \na Dixiecrat, and, the most impressive of all, as a write-in. The fact \nthat citizens of the State had to go and write his name in, that they \nhad to make the conscious decision to write his name on a ballot--it \nwasn't just a question of going in and supporting a political party--\nbut for people to consciously go in and write his name on the ballot \nwas truly a remarkable achievement. It is something that I think \nclearly demonstrates the significance of the affection with which he is \nheld.\n  Senator Thurmond has had to tolerate many things during his Senate \ncareer, not least of which, he has had to put up with two generations \nof my family. One of the dearest friends my father had when he served \nin the U.S. Senate was the Senator from South Carolina. In fact, among \nthe dozens of pictures I have hanging in my office's conference room, I \nhave just two pictures with colleagues of mine. One of them happens to \nbe a photograph which I cherish of myself standing with the senior \nSenator from South Carolina, which he very generously inscribed to me, \nand he made special mention of my father and their relationship. I am \ndeeply appreciative of the loyalty and friendship which Strom Thurmond \nshared with my father, who has been gone these many years now, some 27 \nyears. He passed away that long ago. But theirs was a wonderful \nfriendship. They didn't always agree on issues, but they did agree on \nsome matters. They agreed about the great threat that communism and \nMarxism posed to this country and stood shoulder to shoulder in that \nregard. While they disagreed on other issues, there was still a great \naffection. So today I stand here, not just as a colleague from \nConnecticut, but on behalf of a family that deeply appreciates the \nloyalty and friendship that Strom Thurmond has demonstrated over these \nmany, many years.\n\n  Let me just conclude because so many other things have already been \nsaid which I would endorse and second. Strom Thurmond and I don't \nalways agree on the issues. We agree on some, but not many. But what I \nlove about Strom Thurmond, and what I think America and what the people \nof his State love about him, is not his particular views on issues that \ncome and go, that pass with the time; these issues that are temporal. \nWhat people love about Strom Thurmond, what his colleagues love about \nhim, Democrat and Republican, is that he is a man who, as Oliver \nWendell Holmes described, is a man of passion, action and conviction. \nWhether or not we agree with Strom Thurmond is really not the point. It \nis so refreshing, at a time when everyone seems to end up sort of \nmuddled, that you have an individual who has deep, deep convictions and \nis willing to stand alone and defend them even when he is the only \nperson in the room doing so. Even to people who disagreed with him over \nthe years, he ought to stand, as I know he does to our colleagues, as a \nmonument to principle, to individuality, to conviction and to that \npassion and action that Oliver Wendell Holmes talked about more than a \ncentury ago.\n  Mr. President, I am deeply honored to be able to stand here today. \nWhen Strom completes this term, he will be 100. I look forward to \nstanding on the floor of the Senate with him sitting here, celebrating \nthat milestone with him, I hope, as his colleague. The fact that he has \nbeen sent back here by the people of South Carolina eight times through \nall sorts of changes in the political climate in this country is a \ngreat tribute to the people of South Carolina. But I think all of them \nwould agree with me when I say it is a greater tribute and higher \ntribute to the man who represents that State and represents America in \nso many different ways. I am deeply honored to stand with my colleagues \nto pay tribute to truly an American original, Strom Thurmond of South \nCarolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am privileged to join my colleagues. \nFirst, I ask unanimous consent a statement by the distinguished senior \nSenator from Maine [Ms. Snowe] be printed in the Record along with \nthese proceedings on behalf of our distinguished senior colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (At the request of Mr. Warner, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize one of the \nextraordinary public figures of our time: Senator Strom Thurmond.\n  As we know, Senator Thurmond recently became the longest serving \nSenator in the history of this august institution. His record of \nservice--over 41 years and counting--is unparalleled, and his devotion \nto South Carolina and the United States is unquestioned. His has been a \nlife committed to this Nation, and a life as rich and varied as the \nyears that have passed since his birth in the fledgling days of this \ncentury.\n  Indeed, the breadth and scope of Senator Thurmond's life is truly \nremarkable. Born just before the dawn of flight, Senator Thurmond is \nnow chairman of a committee that oversees the world's most \nsophisticated air force. He has borne witness to an explosion of \nscientific knowledge, fundamental changes in economics and labor, and \ntremendous sociological transformations. Most remarkable of all, \nSenator Thurmond can even remember\n\n[[Page S5215]]\n\nthe last time the Boston Red Sox won the World Series in 1918.\n  Senator Thurmond has been a full participant in this century of \nmonumental events, and in no way is this more profoundly demonstrated \nthan with his service in World War II. As a member of the 82d Airborne \nDivision, Strom Thurmond was part of the invasion force that stormed \nthe beach at Normandy, France on D-day, and he will forever be a heroic \npart of these events that changed the course of history. For his \ncourage and valor, he was awarded 18 decorations, medals, and awards--\nas well as the undying gratitude of America and free nations \neverywhere.\n  Before World War II broke out, as a State senator, Strom Thurmond had \nalready begun what would become a lifelong dedication to public \nservice. That commitment came to the national stage for the first time \nwith his run for the Presidency in 1948--almost 50 years ago--when as \nan independent candidate he garnered the third largest independent \nelectoral vote in U.S. history. Six years later, he became the first \nperson ever elected as a write-in candidate for the U.S. Senate.\n  The rest, as they say, is history--history that is still being \nwritten every day by this remarkable and enduring man. The true iron \nman of the U.S. Senate, his energy, enthusiasm, and love for this \ninstitution is as inspirational to me as I know it has been for \ncountless Members of this body--past and present. Here is a legislator \nwhose labor of love is performed against a backdrop of institutional \nknowledge and historical perspectives unequaled among his 534 \ncolleagues in Congress. One cannot place a value on such service. One \ncan only express their respect and profound appreciation.\n  That is why I feel privileged to be able to join with my colleagues \nin recognizing the extraordinary story that continues to unfold. And \nwhy I am especially honored to serve with Senator Thurmond on the Armed \nServices Committee. As a new member of the committee, Senator Thurmond \nhas made me feel most welcomed and valued, and for his wise guidance I \nam most grateful. After all, he has been an integral part of the \ncommittee through change and crisis, cold war and detente, conflict and \npeace.\n  The defense of this Nation and our responsibility in the world have \nalways been of paramount importance to Senator Thurmond. He understands \nthat we must remain vigilant even as the demise of the Soviet Union has \nleft America as the world's last remaining superpower. Senator Thurmond \nhas seen enough of the world to know that it remains, in many ways, a \ndangerous place--and that we are uniquely capable and indeed obligated \nto stand guard against the potential threats which still exist. And \nmost of all, he knows first hand the importance of providing to our \nservice men and women--people willing to put their lives at risk for \nthis Nation--the best possible personnel, equipment, and resources so \nthat their risk is as low as we can humanly make it.\n  As a member of the Judiciary Committee, he has brought his breadth of \nexperience and his reasoned voice to bear on such issues as immigration \nand crime. And when it comes to the matter of ethics, Senator Thurmond \nhas always stood strong and tall for the forces of integrity, \nsupporting limits on how much Senators can earn outside the Senate, and \nbans on lobbying for foreign countries by former Federal officials to \nname but a few of his initiatives in this regard. His commitment to the \nhonor of the Senate and the confidence of the American people has been \nunflagging for over four decades, and that is a record of which he can \nbe proudest of all.\n  It is no wonder then that his Republican colleagues would elect him \nto be President pro tempore of the Senate. As one of only three \nconstitutionally established officers in Congress, it is a position of \ntremendous respect and trust accorded only to those who have \ndemonstrated an unwavering adherence to the finest ideals of public \nservice and the U.S. Senate. I can think of no finer or more \nappropriate choice than Senator Strom Thurmond, and I am proud that he \nhas come to embody this institution.\n  Throughout this storied career--whether as a superintendent of \neducation, circuit judge, State senator, Governor, or U.S. Senator--\nSenator Thurmond has never forgotten the people of South Carolina. It \nis where his heart is, the place from which he draws his strength. And \nhe is in turn beloved by South Carolinians--just ask the folks at the \nStrom Thurmond Soldier Service Center in Fort Jackson; the Strom \nThurmond Educational Center in Union; the Strom Thurmond Federal \nBuilding in Columbia; or, most telling, the Strom Thurmond Center for \nExcellence in Government and Public Service at Clemson University. They \nknow that the senior Senator from South Carolina has been a strong, \nsteady, consistent voice for them. And they know he will always be so.\n  Senator Strom Thurmond exemplifies a life worth living: courage, \nenthusiasm, service to others, a willingness to learn and grow, and a \ndeep appreciation of the opportunities this life--this country--offers. \nThe mark that he is leaving on the U.S. Senate is a positive and \nenduring one, and I am proud to serve with Senator Thurmond as he \ncontinues to make history.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, much has been said, and I have listened \nwith great interest, as have others. I could summarize my brief remarks \nin two words: Thank you. Thank you, Senator Thurmond, for your service \nto this country, for your service to South Carolina, for your service \nto the Senate, and for the privilege, I thank you, Mr. Thurmond, of \nbeing a colleague who has served with you these 18 years.\n  Senator Thurmond was the first U.S. Senator to greet me when I came \nto the U.S. Senate. We had known each other because I had the privilege \nto serve for 5 years as Under Secretary and Secretary of the Navy and \ntestified before the great Senator on many, many occasions and received \nhis counsel and wisdom during those really tragic and difficult times \nof the Vietnam war, from 1969 through 1974. He encouraged me in that \nperiod of time to someday seek elective office. I counseled with him, \nand, indeed, I am here today in part because of his wisdom and \nforesight to encourage young persons like myself, men and women, to \ncome and serve in the Congress of the United States.\n  Thank you, Senator. Thank you for the opportunities that you have \ngiven me, and I would like to say, and maybe selfishly, thank you for a \ngreat deal of personal attention. When I joined the Armed Services \nCommittee in my first year in the Senate, there were four individuals \non that committee referred to as the Four Horsemen. There was John \nStennis, there was Scoop Jackson, there was John Tower, and there was \nStrom Thurmond. Those four individuals together, in many respects with \nothers--I do not mean to slight anyone not mentioned--but those Four \nHorsemen struck the maximum possible bipartisan relationship because of \ntheir sincere belief that the interests, the security interests, of the \nNation always came first and such partisanship as we indulge in from \ntime to time has to be relegated to second.\n  It was his leadership on our side--in the committee, seniority, of \ncourse, prevailed. When it came time for the opportunity for Senator \nTower to take the leadership role of the Republicans, Strom Thurmond \nonce again yielded the seniority so that Senator Tower could have that \nvery proper recognition and give the strong leadership that he did--\nfollowed by Senator Goldwater. Likewise, Senator Thurmond yielded the \nseniority that was rightfully his so that Senator Goldwater, one of his \nclosest and best friends, could have that opportunity. Then I say quite \nhumbly, he yielded again so the Senator from Virginia, for 6 years, \ncould be the ranking member.\n  But it was always made clear to every member of that committee that, \nat some point in time, Strom Thurmond would cap his distinguished \ncareer by serving as chairman of the Armed Services Committee of the \nSenate of the United States. That he has done for these many years and \ngiven that committee the forceful leadership that it deserves.\n\n  Indeed, the last bill last year, he set a record in terms of the time \nto complete the committee work and to bring the bill to the floor. How \nwell I know because it was late into the night we had the markup \nsessions. But he was always there, always present, and giving us his \nleadership.\n  If I may say, with the deepest of respect, I look upon him as a \nbrother, the\n\n[[Page S5216]]\n\nbig brother that I never had, but he fulfilled that role in my life, \nnot only here in the Senate, but in many ways outside of the Senate.\n  Today, Senators have shared personal recollections of times spent \nwith Strom Thurmond that they remember with great fondness and respect. \nMine was the 40th anniversary of the landing of our forces on Normandy \nBeach. Senator Thurmond was asked by President Ronald Reagan to lead a \ndelegation from the Senate. I was privileged to be with that \ndelegation.\n  I remember as if it were yesterday when we arrived in Normandy, \nPresident Reagan had helo No. 1, Senator Thurmond had helo No. 2. He \nsat right up there with the pilots. For 3 days we toured the entire \narea. I remember one afternoon the helos landed in the vicinity of Sant \nMera'anglis where they reenacted that famous drop by our courageous \nparachutists in the history of recounting the tragedy that befell those \nairmen that parachuted.\n  But we sat there with three of the senior officers that participated \nin that battle. I remember one very vividly. His name was ``Lightning'' \nJoe Collins. We sat on old ammo boxes propped up and watched the drop. \nSenator Thurmond recalled his own recollections throughout our trip of \nthat historic chapter in the march for freedom of the allied forces to \nfend off Adolph Hitler.\n  Senator Thurmond's helicopter, when we went back, malfunctioned and \nwe could not take off to go to the next spot. So the President went on, \nand they sent in another helo. Senator Weicker, who was with us, knew a \ngreat deal about that part of the country of France because his father \nhad been chief of the Army Air Corps intelligence. Senator Weicker said \nto me, ``Let's not stand here and wait for this other helicopter to \ncome in. Let's walk off into the countryside, and perhaps we can knock \non the door of a French farmer and get a little cheese and a little \nwine.'' We did just that. We found in abundance the provisions among \nthe Frenchmen. All of a sudden the Senator's helicopter arrived, and \ntwo of his party were missing. He sent out the gendarmerie to find us, \nand indeed they did, and they hauled us back. What a scolding he gave \nus for delaying his departure by some 20 minutes. But, boy, we \nemboldened ourselves with the finest from a French cellar of their wine \nand their cheese.\n  Those are just moments that we have shared together. And now I look \nforward to serving with him throughout his career here in the U.S. \nSenate and particularly sharing with him, as do all members of our \ncommittee, the responsibilities to keep America strong.\n  I close with one other recollection. That is his great fondness for \nchildren, not only his own, but he never fails to ask me about mine. As \nI watch him go through the Halls of Congress, there is one Senator who \nwill stop and take whatever time is required to greet every child. His \nparting words are, ``Someday you can be a U.S. Senator.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have listened to some of my senior \ncolleagues reminisce on their relationships with our good and dear \nfriend, Senator Thurmond from South Carolina.\n  As a new Senator coming into this body in 1981, I recall my first \nmeeting with Senator Thurmond. It was in the elevator. I felt a very \nfirm, strong grip on my upper arm. As I turned around, he said, ``How \nyou doing, Son?'' I think, without exception, every time I have been in \nthe elevator with Senator Thurmond I have had that tight squeeze--``How \nyou doing, Son?''\n  So it gives me great pleasure to join my colleagues in honoring our \ndear friend.\n  May 25, 1997--the longest serving U.S. Senator in our Nation's \nhistory, a remarkable individual who has unselfishly dedicated his \nentire life to the service of others.\n  Being from Alaska, the newest State in the Union, a State that has \nonly been around for about 39 years, I have found Senator Thurmond to \nbe most understanding of our issues with regard to development. He \ncomes from the school that suggests that those who are elected from \ntheir State ought to have a pretty good handle on what is in the best \ninterest of their State. I think his logic follows that, if the folks \nback home think otherwise, well, they are going to get new \nrepresentation. I have respected him for his support these 17 years \nthat I have been in the Senate.\n  Perhaps one of the most memorable and lasting recollections I have of \nSenator Thurmond is during the years when I was chairman of the Senate \nVeterans Committee. You know Senator Thurmond, as it has been stated, \nlanded behind enemy lines in a glider. He was a volunteer. That was the \nNormandy D-day invasion of the 82d Airborne Division. But he went on to \nearn 5 battle stars during World War II, 18 military decorations during \nhis distinguished military career. He was made a major general of the \nU.S. Army Reserves. In working with him during the years on the Senate \nVeterans' Committee, I found him to be the most significant contributor \ntoward the recognition that we can never do enough to meet our \nobligation to our veterans, those who did so much and gave so much.\n\n  But his balance was that while we can never do enough, we have to do \na better job with what we have to keep up with the changing needs of \nthe veterans and do more and get more input from the veterans' \norganizations and accepting the responsibilities associated with our \nobligation to meet our veterans' needs. He has been honored many times \nby various veterans groups for his contribution.\n  But I particularly look back to the days when we worked together in \nmeeting our Nation's obligations to our veterans and his contribution \nin that regard.\n  I think one of the interesting things, in recognizing the \ncontributions Senator Thurmond has made and continues to make, is his \nhumble beginning as a teacher. He has taught us all, but he began his \nteaching career back in South Carolina in 1923. He wrote the South \nCarolina school attendance law. He worked hard to increase pay for \nteachers and longer school terms. I think it is noteworthy that even \ntoday he sends congratulatory certificates to every graduating South \nCarolina high school student.\n  Senator Thurmond continues to teach us today, and he will again in \nthe next century. He has really taught us all in this institution.\n  I am honored to call him a friend. I am pleased to rise today in \ntribute to this great man, this great American, who has become \nsynonymous with this great institution.\n  Senator Thurmond, we honor you, and we are particularly appreciative \nof your leadership and teaching which has served us all. Thank you, my \nfriend. I look forward to our continued relationship.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak briefly, \nprior to Senator Helms speaking, with regard to Senator Thurmond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  I am happy to be here today. My plane arrived on time, which I was a \nlittle nervous about because I was afraid I would miss the opportunity \nto join our colleagues in talking about the great Senator from the \nState of South Carolina to whom we pay tribute today and whose recent \naccomplishment of becoming the longest serving Member of this Chamber \nis one we all, I think, celebrated from a distance a couple of days \nago.\n  When I was elected to the Senate in 1994, I found myself, after the \nelection was over, given the first chance really to reflect on what it \nmeant to serve here and the people that I would have the chance to \nserve with. I think during an election campaign you only focus on the \nissues and the opposition and the campaign. But when it was finished, I \nwas able to think about the remarkable chance I was going to have to \ncome to this Chamber and be a part of a Chamber filled with so much \nhistory and have the opportunity to serve with such a distinguished \nMember as is the Senator from South Carolina and the Senator from North \nCarolina and others who have been here and who have made their marks.\n\n  No sooner did I arrive--I was listening to the Senator from Alaska \ndescribe his first meeting with Senator\n\n[[Page S5217]]\n\nThurmond. In my first meeting with him, I was amused because he came up \nand said he was stunned that anybody like me could get elected from the \nState of Michigan. I remember when he said that, I was thinking that he \nwas taking note of the fact that I was the first member of my party to \nwin in that State since 1972, and his recollection of how long it had \nbeen since a Michigan Senator from my party had been elected made me \nfeel pretty pleased that I had become known to him and that he had \ntaken note of my success.\n  I was then delighted when, as a consequence of the committee \nselection process, I was able to secure a seat on the Judiciary \nCommittee, which gave me an opportunity to serve directly with the \nformer chairman of that committee, who had distinguished himself in \nthat role. Indeed, some of the former staffers of that committee now \nlive in my State, and we have had the chance to reminisce about some of \nthe various accomplishments that took place when Senator Thurmond \nchaired the Judiciary Committee.\n  Then, indeed, as all the Members who have already spoken have \nacknowledged, his leadership both in his State prior to his election to \nthe Senate and since coming here in a variety of areas, ranging from \nthe defense of this Nation to the role he has played in the judiciary \nprocess and in fighting to combat crime and lawlessness are all signs, \nof course, of somebody who has made this country stronger because of \nhis presence in this Chamber.\n  I want to single out, though, one particular incident that I remember \nvery vividly, and it showed me the other side of Senator Thurmond.\n  Shortly after my arrival here in 1995, we had, as many of the Members \nwill remember, a very busy first 6 months in that year. We were here \nnight after night after night very late, often in situations where we \ncould not share with our families important occasions. One such \noccasion was coming up--in fact, it is going to be repeated again in a \nfew weeks--which was the birthday of my twin daughters. They were born \non June 22, 1993. So our family planned to have a birthday party for \nthose twins on June 22, 1995. We had plans to take them to a restaurant \nand have a birthday cake. At the last minute it turned out we had votes \nthat night. That was back when we were keeping the Senate dining room \nopen for Members and their families on Thursday nights. And, happily, \ntherefore, we were able to still have dinner together, although not as \nwe had planned.\n  We were down in the dining room, and it was just my wife, myself, and \nour two kids. The folks who worked there were nice enough to prepare a \nbirthday cake at the last minute. So we had two candles on that cake. \nOur little daughters, after eating a little bit of their dinner, \nimmediately turned to the birthday cake and plowed into it with their \nfingers and began eating, as 2-year-olds do, in any fashion they could \nwithout using utensils. About that time Senator Thurmond appeared in \nthe dining room and wondered what all the hubbub was over at Senator \nAbraham's table. He came over and asked what the occasion was and we \ntold him it was our birthday party for twin daughters. He took a lot of \ntime and gave each of the girls a birthday hug, and as he walked away I \nnoticed a couple of fingerprints may have adhered to the back of his \ncoat that night from one of our little girls.\n\n  The degree to which he cares about all of us here and the affection \nhe has for us and our families which shows a side beyond the leadership \nside that makes him such a special person. I just want to say, Senator, \nI am very proud to have been given the chance to come to the Senate, \nand especially proud to have had the chance to serve with you. I want \nto thank you on behalf of my constituents for your contributions to our \nNation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The President pro tempore, the senior Senator \nfrom the great State of South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, it hardly seems that almost 43 years \nhave passed since December 24, 1954, when I first became a U.S. Senator \nby raising my right hand and taking the oath of office from then Vice \nPresident Richard Nixon. Though it is only 527 miles, this is certainly \na long way from where I began my career in public service in 1923 as a \nteacher in a high school in rural McCormick, SC. I am pleased to say \nthat it has been a rewarding and gratifying journey.\n  When I graduated from Clemson College and took my first job, my only \nambition in life was to be able to help people. As I worked to educate \nmy students in McCormick--and later in Ridge Spring and in Edgefield--I \nquickly realized that I could have a greater impact in providing for \nthe learning needs of the children of South Carolina by shaping policy. \nI ran for, and was elected Edgefield County Superintendent of Education \nin 1928, and during my tenure in that post, I implemented many measures \nwhich raised the standards of education in that county. I also got my \nfirst taste of how much impact a person can have through elected \noffice.\n  At that time, South Carolina was an economically challenged place \nwell before the great crash of the stock market which sent the Nation \nplummeting into the Great Depression. Without trying to sound \nmelodramatic, life was hard back then, the banks were failing, \nbusinesses were closing, and people were very concerned about the \nfuture. As someone who was eager to try and improve conditions in my \nhome county, as well as throughout the Palmetto State, I declared for \nState Senator in 1932 and was elected to office. For 5 years, I helped \nshape policy that guided South Carolina out of the depths of the \nDepression by, among other things, strengthening education; \nestablishing a rural electrification program; helping our farmers; and \nby establishing the South Carolina Public Service Authority known as \nSantee-Cooper.\n  In subsequent years I became involved in a number of different public \nservice endeavors, some of which have been mentioned by others here \ntoday in their flattering floor statements about me. One position after \nanother, and though I did not deliberately set out on this path, each \njob I had--State senator, State circuit court judge, Army officer, \nattorney, and Governor--seemed to be leading toward the U.S. Senate.\n  To those who want to dedicate a part of their lives to serving the \nNation, I can think of no better place to do so than in the U.S. \nSenate, and my time in this institution has truly been the happiest and \nmost rewarding in my life. Over the past four decades, I have been \npleased to have been a part of hundreds, if not thousands, of \nworthwhile endeavors through my duties as a Senator, and my service on \nthe Committees on the Judiciary and Armed Services and Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  I knew when I moved up here with my first wife, the late Jean Crouch \nThurmond, that I would never earn wealth from my tenure in the Senate, \nbut financial gain was never a consideration for me when I ran for this \noffice. In fact, financial compensation is not why I or anyone else \nbecomes involved in public service. We do it for the opportunity to \nhelp others and to give back to the Nation which has provided us with \nso many opportunities.\n  There is no other job in the world that allows us to have a more \ndirect impact in rendering service than that of a Senator. The work we \ndo here benefits millions of Americans, and how can one not help but \ntake great satisfaction and pride in such important service. Through \noversight, legislation, and old fashioned constituent service, each of \nus is able to help the citizens of our respective States, as well as \nbuild a Nation which is stronger and better for all who live here. I am \nvery proud of the fact that over the past four decades, I have had a \nrole in building the finest military force that history has seen. I am \nproud of the work we have done on the Judiciary Committee which has \nhelped to safeguard the Constitution, keep the judicial branch \nindependent, and provided sound policies to help make our streets safe. \nMost importantly, I am pleased that I have been able to use my Senate \noffice to help hundreds of thousands of South Carolinians interact with \na government bureaucracy that can sometimes be confusing, unyielding, \nand intimidating.\n\n  It has been a special pleasure for me to help the veterans who serve \nthis Nation in times of war, as well as the families of those who have \nmade the ultimate sacrifice.\n  As I stand here and reflect upon my career, I have nothing but \npositive\n\n[[Page S5218]]\n\nmemories. During the course of my tenure, I have had the privilege of \nserving with some of the truly great figures in the history of this \nBody. I have been fortunate to make many good friends through my \nservice in the Senate. I am often asked how I want to be remembered, \nand my answer today is the same as it was in 1954, or would have been \nin 1923--for being an honest, patriotic, and helpful person. I would \nlike to be remembered as one who cares; cares for his family, his \nfriends, and cares for his Nation.\n  Though I look forward to completing this term, when I finally retire \nin 2002, I hope that if I leave any legacy, it is that answering the \ncall of public service is an honorable and worthy vocation. It is only \nthrough the efforts of men and women, regardless of their political \nideology, who believe in working for the greater good that we will be \nable to assure that the United States remains a bastion of freedom, \njustice, and hope.\n  In closing, I wish to thank my colleagues for their beautiful words \nconcerning my public service. It has been a privilege to serve with \nsuch able dedicated, and wonderful people. I thank them for their many \ncourtesies. God bless this magnificent body and the United States of \nAmerica.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Helms pertaining to the introduction of Senate \nJoint Resolution 31 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/03/senate-section/article/S5198-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will now resume consideration of S. \n4, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:.\n\n       A bill (S. 4) to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 \n     to provide to private sector employees the same opportunities \n     for time-and-a-half compensatory time off, biweekly work \n     programs, and flexible credit hour programs as Federal \n     employees currently enjoy to help balance the demands and \n     needs of work and family, to clarify the provisions relating \n     to exemptions of certain professionals from the minimum wage \n     and overtime requirements of the Fair Labor Standards Act of \n     1938, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the Baucus-\nKerrey-Landrieu substitute amendment to Senator Ashcroft's comptime \nbill.\n  The Fair Labor Standards Act is a set of laws that Congress enacted \nsome 60 years ago to protect the American worker from abuse in the \nworkplace. These laws do a good job to make sure that our country's \ngreatest asset, our work force, is protected. They put a halt to child \nlabor. They established a 40-hour workweek. And they set up the concept \nof pay and a half for overtime. Under these laws, our country has grown \nand thrived, and, by and large, our workers are protected from \nextravagant abuses.\n  However, our society has changed a great deal since Congress enacted \nthat landmark legislation. We have more families where both parents \nhold down full-time jobs. We have more single-parent households. And \nfor everyone it seems as if their dollar does not buy as much as it \nused to.\n  All that means longer hours on the job, which, in turn, leads to less \ntime spent with the family. Today's parents find themselves caught in a \ntightrope act as they try to balance the needs of their families with \nthe demands of their jobs, and that just is not fair.\n  I believe we are in a position to help them. That does not mean we \nshould go about dismantling the protections on which our workers have \ncome to rely. That is what some provisions of Senator Ashcroft's bill \nwill do, and I think that is the wrong path.\n  Instead, we must adapt our labor laws to maintain the protections \nthat are so necessary while making it possible for our workers to have \nsome flexibility. That is the right path. That is why my colleagues \nmust support our substitute amendment.\n  In Montana, I meet a lot of hard-working people. One thing they tell \nme time and time again is they need more flexibility in their work \nschedules. They need to be able to choose between earning time-and-a-\nhalf pay for their overtime or taking that time in the form of \nvacation. This choice would allow workers to either put aside a little \nextra money or take some time to be with their families.\n  One area where the effects of this flexibility will be greatly felt \nis education. You see, in Montana, we pride ourselves on the quality \neducation we provide our children. And we have done a pretty good job. \nOne key to our success is parental involvement in their kids' \neducation. That means taking time to meet with teachers, helping out on \nhomework and participating in extracurricular activities.\n\n  The Baucus-Kerrey-Landrieu amendment will allow parents to freely \nchoose how and when they use their overtime so that parents can again \nbe part of their children's lives.\n  At the same time, I know every family is different and their needs \nvary greatly. Lots of folks depend on a little extra money to make ends \nmeet. Others need time for their families. And that is why we need to \nmake sure that every household can choose how to use their time and \nmoney.\n  There are three clear reasons why my colleagues should vote for the \nsubstitute amendment offered by myself, Senator Kerrey from Nebraska, \nand Senator Landrieu. First, our amendment will allow employees the \nfinal choice on when and how they will use their overtime. Whether it \nis time or money, the worker gets the choice. That is very important.\n  Senator Ashcroft's bill leaves the final decision on how you spend \nyour time with the employer. Their bill has no protection for the \nworker. In fact, it would allow an employer to discriminate against a \nworker who chooses to take money for their overtime. That is just not \nfair.\n  The second difference is that our amendment does not tamper with the \n40-hour workweek. If you work more than 40 hours in a week, you are \nentitled to time-and-a-half pay. That is the way it has always been \nunder the Fair Labor Standards Act. Americans overwhelmingly support \nthe 40-hour workweek, and we ought to preserve it.\n  Under Senator Ashcroft's bill, a worker could log 60 hours in 1 week \nand not qualify for 1 minute of overtime. For over 60 years, we have \ntold our employees that if they worked hard and did a good job, they \nwould be rewarded. Under this bill, we are reneging on that promise. \nThe result is a pay cut for America's workers.\n  And finally, the third reason my colleagues should support the \nsubstitute is that President Clinton has said he would sign our \namendment, and he has said he would veto the other comptime bill. So if \nwe are truly interested in giving workers flexibility in passing the \ncomptime bill, we must support, I believe, our amendment. It is the \nonly chance for a meaningful reform this year.\n  Look, I think most Senators agree we need comptime. It is a good idea \nwhose time has come. Yet, there are two ideas of how to get it done. \nOne would take away workers' choice, end the 40-hour workweek, and is \nheaded toward a certain Presidential veto. The other, our substitute, \nlets workers decide how to use their overtime, maintains the 40-hour \nworkweek and will become law if we pass it. Our amendment I think is \nthe more reasonable choice.\n  So if you are really interested in passing a comptime bill, this is \nthe time and our proposal is the bill. I urge my colleagues to vote in \nfavor of the Baucus-Kerrey-Landrieu substitute amendment to the \ncomptime bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield my time, and I also thank the manager of the \nbill for his indulgence.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask that I might be permitted to \nproceed\n\n[[Page S5219]]\n\nfor up to 10 minutes as if in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank Senator \nHutchinson for being so gracious in permitting me this opportunity \nbecause I know he had asked to speak earlier.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/03/senate-section/article/S5218-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5219-S5220]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  VIOLATION OF SWISS BANK SECRECY LAWS\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the case of \nChristoph Meili. He is a heroic young Swiss bank guard, 27 years of \nage, who stumbled on a situation that was rather remarkable. It was the \nshredding this past January of historical documents at Union Bank of \nSwitzerland, one of Switzerland's largest, most prestigious banks. He \nnoted that these records dated during the period of the Holocaust, \nprior to and during World War II, and he knew that the Government of \nSwitzerland had just passed legislation prohibiting destruction of just \nthese types of records. He took a handful of these records and brought \nthem to the Jewish Cultural Society. They then passed them on to the \npolice--never went to the media. The records were never copied. They \nwere never in any way compromised.\n  For his bravery, for standing up and doing the right thing, he has \nbeen fired from his job. In his termination letter, Mr. Meile was told \nthat although his conduct was ``classified as ethical and moral in \ncertain circles,'' his actions were unjustifiable from the perspective \nof labor law.\n  Can you imagine that. He saw the law being violated. He knew that \nthese documents were of import, and he was fired. Here is a noble young \nman who risked everything, a humble man, a high school education, with \na wife and two children. What happened? He is called a traitor to his \ncountry. His wife and children are threatened. Hundreds of letters pour \nin.\n  Let me read one letter, and it is a tough letter. And I have seen \nmany of these:\n\n       Meile, you bastard. The secret numbered account won't do \n     you any good. You are a son of a bitch, a traitor to your \n     country. It will cost you your life. Your children are in \n     danger. We will kidnap them and make sure that you pay the \n     ransom with your Jewish money. We'll finish you off. We're \n     going to wipe out the entire Meile clan. Traitors like you \n     are not wanted. If you have any courage, you'll kill yourself \n     or emigrate into the promised land to your Jewish friends--to \n     Israel or the U.S. You won't live much longer in Switzerland \n     if you don't kill yourself.\n\n  That is the kind of thing he has been subjected to. This brave, \ncourageous and righteous young man finds himself terminated from \nemployment, blacklisted.\n  The chairman of the board of Union Bank, Mr. Studer says that he \nthinks Mr. Meili did this to get money. Now, let me say something. Mr. \nMeili did not go to the press. This information was released by the \nUnion Bank and the police authorities.\n  I have just recently written to the local prosecutor, and in that \nletter of May 15 I said, basically, are you still threatening to \nprosecute Mr. Meili? I ask that the full text of that letter be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \n           Affairs,\n                                     Washington, DC, May 15, 1997.\n     Mr. Peter Cosandey,\n     District Attorney of the Canton Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland.\n       Dear Mr. Cosandey: This letter concerns Mr. Christoph \n     Meili, the former bank security guard who discovered the \n     shredding of Holocaust-era documents at the Union Bank of \n     Switzerland in Zurich and who is currently being investigated \n     by your office for violation of Swiss bank secrecy laws.\n       As you are probably aware Mr. Meili has recently testified \n     before the Senate Banking Committee in Washington, D.C., in \n     reference to his discovery of the shredding of valuable \n     archival documents by the Union Bank of Switzerland. He told \n     of his firing by his employer Wache A.G., even after I \n     received personal assurances from Ambassador Thomas Borer \n     that this would not take place. Mr. Meili stated that this \n     firing has left him penniless and has placed terrible \n     financial strains upon himself and his family. As you are \n     undoubtedly aware Mr. Meili has a wife and two young children \n     that he must now somehow support.\n       Mr. Meili also testified of his hours of intense \n     interrogation by Swiss officials and their silence as to the \n     status of their investigation. Mr. Meili also testified that \n     Swiss officials have yet to provide him with copies of the \n     archival documents that he saved from destruction. Mr. Meili \n     also stated that he fears for his life and the life of his \n     wife and infant children. He stated that both he and the \n     members of his family have received numerous threats against \n     their lives. His children have been threatened with kidnaping \n     and he has been told that ``their ransoms could be paid from \n     monies belonging to the Jewish community.'' This is \n     unconscionable.\n       He also feels that he has been ``black-listed'' by the \n     Swiss banking community and will have great difficulty in \n     securing gainful employment in Switzerland. Mr. Meili should \n     be treated as a hero not as a criminal. It is within this \n     light that I now ask you to end your harassment of Mr. Meili. \n     You do both your office, Mr. Meili and the citizens of \n     Switzerland a great injustice in continuing your present \n     course of action. The Union Bank of Switzerland should be the \n     subject of your investigation, not Mr. Meili.\n       In closing, I would also be most interested in finding out \n     what action your office has taken against Mr. Erwin \n     Hagenmuller, the Archivist for the Union Bank of Switzerland \n     who ordered the shredding of archival documents even though \n     recently enacted Swiss law prohibits such willful \n     destruction. Was a report filed by the Union Bank of \n     Switzerland in reference to Mr. Hagenmuller's actions? If so, \n     could a copy of the report be forwarded to the Committee for \n     review?\n           Respectfully,\n                                               Alfonse M. D'Amato,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I did not receive a direct reply, but let me tell you \nwhat I did get just yesterday. I received a letter from Mr. Meile's \nattorney, Marcel Bosonnet.\n  In the letter the prosecutor says, basically, that ``we intend,'' and \nI quote, ``to bring a charge'' against Mr. Meili. They are going to \ncharge Mr. Meili with criminal conduct, not the bank which shredded the \nrecords. And they want Mr. Meili to come back to Switzerland for \nanother interview. Mr. Meili's lawyer, Mr. Bosonnet, writing to a \nlawyer who is representing Mr. Meili because Mr. Meili is here in \nhiding, has advised him not to come back to Switzerland because he \nwould face not only persecution but prosecution and harassment.\n  Now, Mr. President, it is one thing for the Swiss Government to say, \n``Do not blame us for what took place 50 years ago'', and another thing \nto say, ``Well, what we are doing today is correct.'' I say to the \nSwiss Government and to the Swiss banks, do not shred the truth. Tell \nthe truth. Mr. Meili should not be facing criminal charges for coming \nforward.\n  Let me share with you, if I might, what I learned just before we \nadjourned. And, by the way, I commend my colleagues in the Senate for \npassing the bill which will give to Mr. Meili relief, a private relief \nbill which will permit him and his family to reside in this country \nlegally and to be able to be gainfully employed. That legislation is \nnow pending action in the House. But let me say to you that I think all \nof us were moved when we heard the testimony of Mr. Meili.\n  I said to him, ``Christoph, why did you do this? Why did you take \nthese documents and report and expose what was going on?''\n  Do you know what he said? He said, ``Two months earlier I saw \n`Schindler's List,' and I knew that I must be doing something, and I \ncould not just stand by and let this take place.''\n  So I say to my colleagues in the Senate and in the House, can we do \nanything less than to ask for speedy passage of that legislation that \nwill give Christoph the right to work and live here in this great \ncountry, to tell him that we do appreciate his standing up for truth \nand justice, and also to let the Swiss Government know in the strongest \nterms that we are not going to stand by and do business as usual. We \nare not going to allow them to harass this young man, because this \nprosecutor is way off base. If anything, he should be investigating the \ndestruction of those historical documents by the Union Bank, documents \nthat existed in some cases for more than 60 years. Suddenly they say \nthey began to destroy them by accident. I do not believe it. It also \nraises in this Senator's mind the question of how historical documents \nthat have been stored in warehouses belonging to some of the banking \ninstitutions mysteriously have caught on fire. I'm talking about four \ndifferent warehouses in this country, the latest being in New Jersey, \nconcerning documents that belonged to Credit Suisse.\n\n  I wonder how it is that shredding takes place after 60 years by \naccident.\n\n[[Page S5220]]\n\nWhen a young bank guard comes forward and says, ``Look, this is not \nright,'' he, then, becomes the victim and becomes the criminal.\n  What we seek is justice and a full accounting. And certainly fair \ntreatment of this heroic young man.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/03/senate-section/article/S5219-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5220-S5235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FAMILY FRIENDLY WORKPLACE ACT\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, under the unanimous-consent agreement my \namendment on bankruptcy to this legislation has been filed. I would \nlike to take that amendment up at this point. If it is necessary to \nread the amendment, I would like to have it read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 253.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 28, after line 16, insert the following:\n       (d) Protections for Claims Relating to Compensatory Time \n     Off and Flexible Credit Hours in Bankruptcy Proceedings.--\n     Section 507(a)(3) of title 11, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking ``$4,000'' and inserting ``$6,000'';\n       (2) by striking ``for--'' and inserting the following: \n     ``provided that all accrued compensatory time (as defined in \n     section 7 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. \n     207) or accrued flexible credit hours (as defined in section \n     13(A) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938) shall be \n     deemed to have been earned within 90 days before the date of \n     the filing of the petition or the date of the cessation of \n     the debtor's business, whichever occurs first, for--''; and\n       (3) in subparagraph (A), by inserting before the semicolon \n     the following: ``or the value of unused, accrued compensatory \n     time (as defined in section 7 of the Fair Labor Standards Act \n     of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 207)) or the value of unused, accrued \n     flexible credit hours (as defined in section 13A of the Fair \n     Labor Standards Act of 1938)''.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bankruptcy \namendment to resolve an important question which has been raised \nregarding S. 4. This is a bill which will provide America's working \nfamilies with some much-needed relief from the demands of balancing \nfamily and work. But some have questioned whether workers' rights to be \npaid by companies that declare bankruptcy might inadvertently be \naffected by S. 4. My amendment will make sure that this will not happen \nand that workers will be fully protected.\n  S. 4 is a very important bill. We all know the story. Over the past \ndecade or so, wages have been flat and the tax burden seems to just \ngrow and grow. As both mothers and fathers around the country have had \nto work outside the home and have had to work longer and longer hours, \nthey have less time to spend with each other and with their families. \nThis leads to a decrease in the quality of family life.\n  And with all the assaults we have on families these days--increased \ndrug use by teens, excessive violence and sex coming from Hollywood to \nname a few--Congress needs to give serious consideration to finding \nways to protect and stabilize families. The Senator from Missouri is to \nbe commended for taking such a progressive stance on this important \nissue.\n  S. 4 will give employers the chance to offer families the choice of \nworking harder and earning overtime pay or getting some time off in \nexchange for working more. That makes good common sense and will expand \nthe range of choices that working families can make.\n  Now, I chair the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the \nCourts, which has primary responsibility for bankruptcy policy in the \nSenate. I am offering an amendment today to make sure that unused \ncomptime and unused flexible credit time will be protected when an \nemployer declares bankruptcy. Under current law, unpaid wages up to \n$4,000 are given a preferred status if earned within 90 days prior to a \ncompany declaring bankruptucy. Under the Bankruptcy Code, secured \ncreditors are paid and then the costs of administering the bankruptcy \nestate will be paid. After that--ahead of all the other creditors--\nworkers' wages will be paid subject to those limitations I just \ndescribed.\n  I believe that comptime and flexible credit time should be protected \nin the same way as unpaid wages because unused comptime and unused \nflexible credit time are essentially unpaid wages.\n\n  So, my amendment does two things. First, my amendment provides that \nall unused comptime and unused flexible credit time will be deemed to \nhave been earned within 90 days prior to the employer filing for \nbankruptcy. This will prevent a dishonest employer who wants to cheat \nworkers from arguing that he doesn't have to pay the value of unused \ncomptime or unused flexible credit time because they might have been \nearned over a period of a year or even longer. In other words, by \nhaving the law deem all unused comptime and unused flexible credit time \nas having been earned within 90 days prior to the employer's \nbankruptcy, the worker's right to be paid will be protected. That's \npro-worker and pro-family and it's just plain fair.\n  The second thing that my amendment will do is insert comptime and \nflexible credit time in the list of preferred debts alongside unpaid \nwages. That means that unused comptime and unused flexible credit time \nwill have the same preferred status as unpaid wages.\n  Mr. President, I hope that every Member of this body will support my \namendment. It is pro-worker and it makes sure that the promise of \ncomptime and flexible credit time will not turn into an empty promise. \nAs we all know, most employers are honest and law abiding and will go \ninto bankruptcy only as a last resort. But when a company has to go \ninto bankruptcy, we should take extra care here in Congress to see to \nit that workers are treated fairly. We should also make sure that \nworkers are protected from the small number of dishonest companies that \nmight try to use a loophole to cheat workers out of what they've \nearned.\n  My amendment simply ensures that unused comptime and unused flexible \ncredit time will be as protected as unpaid wages. Workers who choose to \ntake the time to be with their families should not be disadvantaged \nshould their company have to declare bankruptcy.\n  Mr. President, I hope this amendment passes overwhelmingly.\n  I would like to also suggest that as a concession to the Members of \nthe other side of the aisle, I have also raised the dollar amount \nreferred to earlier from $4,000 up to $6,000 as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator from Iowa yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am very pleased to have the Senator come to the floor \nand offer this amendment. I would like to clarify the intent of my \ncolleague. I think I understand it.\n  If the comptime accumulated earnings, which might either be paid off \nat the end of the year as comptime that gets cashed out or might be \ntaken as comptime, as time off--if that is older than 90 days old, \nunder the current law it might not have all the protections in \nbankruptcy that normal wages would have; is that correct?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The Senator from Missouri has the existing law correct. \nThat is right.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. So what the Senator is doing is making sure that \neverything that would be in a comptime or flextime bank in terms of \nhours would be protected at the highest level of protection as recently \nearned wages under the bankruptcy law?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I think that is a clear improvement to this measure, in \nterms of protecting the interests of workers. I thank the Senator from\n\n[[Page S5221]]\n\nIowa for his insight and his expertise in this area, which obviously \nreflects his experience with the bankruptcy laws and his experience in \nmatters of this character.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Is it appropriate to urge the adoption? It is not \nappropriate? We have not had the minority people speak to it yet.\n  I ask unanimous consent to lay this amendment aside for the \nconsideration of a second amendment that I have already filed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 256\n\n    (Purpose: To apply to Congress the same provisions relating to \n  compensatory time off, biweekly work programs, flexible credit hour \nprograms, and exemptions of certain professionals from the minimum wage \n    and overtime requirements as apply to private sector employees)\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer a very important \namendment. This amendment applies the provisions of this bill, S. 4, to \nCongress.\n  As most Senators know, I pushed for the adoption of the original \nCongressional Accountability Act for many years before it was enacted. \nFinally, in the last Congress, with my sponsorship, we enacted the \nCongressional Accountability Act into law. With this act we said that \nwe in Congress are no better than the business men and women in our \nStates. We are not different and we, too, must live under the laws that \nwe pass. We no longer sit in Washington and look down upon the people \nand tell them how to run their businesses. This is a democracy, and \ntherefore we make laws for the people, and we, too, are the people.\n  This amendment is offered for the same purpose. It is a continuation \nof the spirit and intent of the Congressional Accountability Act.\n  In the Federalist Papers, Federalist 57, James Madison wrote that:\n\n       [Members of Congress] can make no law which will not have \n     its full operation on themselves and their friends, as well \n     as on the great mass of society . . . it creates between them \n     that communion of interests and sympathy of sentiments of \n     which few governments have furnished examples, but without \n     which every government degenerates into tyranny.\n\n  The bill before us gives important options to the private workplace \nthat Government--with exceptions including Congress--has enjoyed for \nyears. It is only fair that if these options--compensatory time, bi-\nweekly schedules and flextime--apply to the private sector, then they \nmust also apply to Congress. A rationale of the Congressional \nAccountability Act was that by requiring us to live under the same laws \nas the private sector, we will understand the challenges created by the \nlaws that we pass. If we apply compensatory time, bi-weekly schedules \nand flextime to the private sector, we must also apply it to Congress. \nOtherwise, we will not get an accurate understanding of what our labor \nlaws do to our businesses and workers.\n  The language in this amendment is carefully crafted to complement the \nCongressional Accountability Act. The drafting of this language was a \nlong and careful process. I drafted it in consultation with the Office \nof Compliance and the Senate Employment Counsel. I thank both of these \noffices for their efforts to craft this language and make it the most \neffective and fair language possible.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment and to join me once \nagain in saying that we are not above the laws that we make.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe laid aside temporarily so I may make a statement in support of this \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I have come to the floor this afternoon to express my \nsupport for the Family Friendly Workplace Act introduced by my \ncolleague from Missouri, Senator John Ashcroft. I join with the \nNation's working men and women in thanking my friend for his leadership \nin bringing this legislation to the floor and giving us an opportunity \nto focus on what has become the single most precious commodity for \nworking families in the 1990's, and that is time.\n  Trapped between less time and greater demands, the American people \nare calling for more choices and flexibility in setting their work \nschedules. They want help in balancing the competing demands for time \nbetween their families and their jobs. When surveyed in March by Money \nmagazine, 64 percent of the American public--and 68 percent of working \nwomen--said they would prefer time off instead of extra pay for \novertime, if the law permitted such a choice.\n  Unfortunately, the law does not allow such choices, even though \ndramatic changes have taken place in America since 1938, when Congress \nwrote the basic law governing U.S. workplaces. Six decades ago, most \nlaborers were employed in industrial plants or on farms. Fewer than 16 \npercent of married women with children in school were employed outside \nthe home. Today, service jobs are a key part of the economy where more \nthan 75 percent of married women with school-age children now work \noutside the home.\n  Many parents are under tremendous stress, often holding down more \nthan one job while trying to raise their children. The strain can be \neven more pronounced in single-parent households or two-parent families \nwhere both spouses work. Is it any surprise that today's parents are \nspending 40 percent less time with their children than parents did just \nthree decades ago? It seems there are not enough hours in the day \nanymore to always fulfill the demands of family and of work.\n  Twenty years ago, Congress overwhelmingly approved relief for federal \nworkers by enacting flexible work options for government employees. \nDuring House consideration of the bill, then-Representative Geraldine \nFerraro said, ``Flexible schedules have helped reduce the conflicts \nbetween work and personal needs, particularly for working women and \nothers with household responsibilities.'' Also, Representative Patricia \nSchroeder added, ``Flextime increases employee morale and \nproductivity.''\n  Even though federal workers have enjoyed these benefits for years, \nthe rules governing the workplace and working hours for the private \nsector remain frozen back in 1938. Predictably, this has created \nunintended burdens for millions of workers.\n  For example, under today's law, a worker who wants to put in 45 hours \none workweek in exchange for 35 hours the next--in order to attend a \nchild's soccer game, parent-teacher conference, or doctor's \nappointment--must first have an employer who is willing to pay five \nhours of overtime pay for the 45-hour week. Because many employers \ncannot afford additional overtime expenses, working parents are left \nwith two choices: One is lose five hours of pay in order to be with a \nchild, or miss the soccer game, school award, or doctor's appointment. \nThat is an unfair choice parents should not be forced to make.\n  Employers who try to extend a helping hand to employees with flexible \nscheduling do so at the risk of fines and penalties from the Department \nof Labor. It is the law--you are not allowed to work 45 hours now in \nreturn for 35 hours in another week and still keep a full paycheck.\n  President Clinton has said he understands this problem and has \nproposed expanding unpaid time off under the Family and Medical Leave \nAct. Unfortunately, his plan only allows leave without pay. It was \ndesigned for periods of extended leave, not for the flexibility needed \nto meet the daily challenges of modern family and working life. Working \nparents would still have to take a pay cut to be with their children.\n  Mr. President, I firmly believe the time has come to bring our \nemployment laws into the 1990's, and so I have proudly signed on as an \noriginal cosponsor of the Family Friendly Workplace Act. Our bill would \ncreate flexible scheduling options for working Americans, benefiting \nmillions of hard-working women and men.\n  First, workers under this legislation would have paid flexible leave. \nTo create time for their families, employees could choose to work \nadditional hours in one week, to fill in a shorter week later. \nEmployees could bank up to 50 hours of flexible leave that can be taken \nwith pay.\n  Also second, employees could set 2-week schedules totaling 80 hours \nin any combination. For example, an employee might want every other \nFriday off, compensating for the day off by working 80 hours over the \ncourse of 9 days. This system has worked well for Federal employees.\n  Third, employees could take time and one-half off, instead of \novertime pay. Employees would have the option of cashing out these comp \ntime hours for overtime pay, if they wished. It is important to note \nthat these options are entirely voluntary and any action must be set \ninto motion by the employee, not the employer. Your employer can't \nforce you to take comp time if you prefer the overtime. The bill, in \nfact, sets stiff penalties for coercive or abusive actions by \nemployers.\n\n[[Page S5223]]\n\n  While I believe the bill affords employees the necessary protections, \nshould there be reports of widespread abuse under this legislation, I \nwill be among the first to call for its repeal.\n  Mr. President, an editorial published in the April 7, 1997, edition \nof the Minneapolis Star-Tribune raised some of these same concerns--\nconcerns I believe have been satisfied--and the newspaper found the \npremise behind the bill to be solid. The newspaper wrote:\n\n       This is pretty appealing to busy Americans, many of whom \n     would happily forgo $60 in overtime pay for the chance to \n     spend Friday with their kids or a string of walleyes. And it \n     is an efficient form of time management for employers who see \n     their offices swamped with work one week but becalmed the \n     next.\n\n  The editorial concluded by saying that\n\n       Clinton and Congress' Republican leadership should find a \n     way to accommodate the needs of business and American workers \n     in a changing economy . . . After all, the whole point is \n     flexibility.\n\n  Mr. President, I trust working parents with that flexibility because \nonly they know what is best for their families. The flexibility is \nespecially meaningful for the Nation's working women as well. Both \nWorking Women and Working Mother magazines have endorsed the flextime \nand comptime measures in the Family Friendly Workplace Act, recognizing \nthat 28.8 million working women stand to gain from this proposal.\n  Times have changed dramatically since 1938, and change is long \noverdue. In fairness to workers and their families, and in the interest \nof the productivity of our economy, it is time to modernize our labor \nlaws and give all workers the choice of flexible work options. So Mr. \nPresident, in concluding, I would like to say that the Family Friendly \nWorkplace Act offers much-needed help for Americans striving to meet \nall the needs of their families. I urge the support of my colleagues, \nand once again I want to thank the Senator from Missouri for his \nleadership in bringing this bill before the Senate.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, today the Senate is \ndebating an aptly titled bill, the Family Friendly Workplace Act. The \nworking families of today face more challenges than their parents and \ngrandparents could have imagined. In addition to providing for their \nchildren, parents want to balance the other demands on their time--\nparent-teacher conferences, little league games, doctor appointments, \ncar pools--but have little flexibility.\n  The family friendly workplace will give employees the opportunity to \nadjust their work hours to take advantage of paid time off during the \nworkday. It is a short, simple bill that would extend to the private \nsector the same benefits already enjoyed by public employees for almost \n20 years. First, it will allow hourly workers the ability to bank extra \ntime which could be taken as paid time off. Second, the measure will \ngive employees and employers the ability to work out a flexible \nscheduling arrangement. Sound simple enough? Surprisingly, these \ncommon-sense practices are now prohibited under current law.\n  The only explanation I can find for the opposition to this proposal \nis the flurry of misinformation that surrounds this debate. For \ninstance, I have received a few letters in my office from Washington \nlabor organizations, which reveal their unfortunate misunderstanding of \nthis bill. One letter states, ``S. 4 contains no penalty to punish \nemployers who force workers to take compensatory time off if the \nworkers want, instead, to receive premium pay at the time-and-a-half \nrate, after they work in excess of 40 hours during a week.'' This claim \nis false. Not only are these options 100 percent voluntary for the \nemployee, but, in addition to protections that already exist under the \nFair Labor Standards Act [FLSA], S. 4 establishes further prohibitions \nagainst employee coercion in the voluntary acceptance of comptime. \nIntimidation is outlawed. Another letter I received argues that ``the \nenactment of a less effective FLSA would jeopardize worker safety and \nhealth as employees are forced to accept excessively long and hazardous \novertime assignments without pay fearing loss of future employment \nopportunities * * *'' This claim is untrue. Let me repeat--these \noptions are 100 percent voluntary for the employee.\n  I am also confused by arguments my colleagues have made against this \nmeasure. One amendment the opponents may offer would expand the Family \nand Medical Leave Act to grant workers up to 24 hours of unpaid leave \nto participate in their child's school activities. They point to a poll \nthat found that 86 percent of the American public favor legislation \nthat would allow workers unpaid leave to attend parent-teacher \nconferences. Did the poll ask Americans if they would like paid leave \nfor these educational purposes? I also find this amendment puzzling \nsince the first argument I hear from labor groups is that workers \ncannot afford to take compensatory time off since they rely on their \novertime pay. I agree that many workers would not take the comptime \noption because they prefer additional pay. But if extra pay is their \nfirst priority, why would they be so anxious to take unpaid leave?\n  Furthermore, opponents cite the position of various women's \norganizations in Washington who have come out against this bill. Like \nmany inside-the-beltway groups, they seem to have fallen out of step \nwith the average working woman, since several studies contradict their \nopposition. For example, a study conducted by the Employment Policy \nFoundation reveals that women are far more eager to trade income for \nleisure--among women earning $750 a week, women are more than twice as \nlikely as men to choose ``fewer hours for less pay.'' Second, a recent \npoll by Money magazine found that 66 percent of the American people \nwould rather have their overtime in the form of time off, rather than \ncash wages, and 82 percent said they support the Republican-backed \ncomptime bills. Also worth noting is the endorsement of the Family \nFriendly Workplace Act by Working Woman and Working Mother magazines.\n  Even more perplexing is the President's failure to recognize the \nspecial needs of working women by refusing to allow comptime in \nexchange for overtime pay. While overtime pay is invaluable to many \nworkers, nearly three out of four workers reporting overtime pay are \nmen. In fact, overtime pay is most commonly reported in industries \nwhich are heavily dominated by men--manufacturing (73%), mining and \nconstruction (95%), and transportation (88%). Of the small number of \nwomen who work in mining and construction, only 5 percent worked \novertime in 1996, while 95 percent of men did. The President's \ncommitment to defeating this proposal will disproportionately harm \nwomen.\n  While these polls and statistics are helpful and revealing, I need go \nno further than my home State to be convinced of the value of the \nFamily Friendly Workplace Act. One engineering firm in New Hampshire, \nfor instance, uses a complicated formula to allow employees every other \nFriday off. But the complexity of their current system is exactly why \nthey would prefer the passage of S. 4. If there is any doubt that this \nflextime is appealing to employees, this company, like many in the \nhighly competitive technology industry, advertises their existing \nflexible week as an incentive when seeking out technical expertise. Any \nSenator who represents an area like the Northeast, which has a large \ntechnology presence, can understand how competitive the recruiting can \nbe. The flex week is so appealing to potential employees, firms \nhighlight it in their ads in an effort to outbid their competitors.\n  Because of the false claims, inconsistency, and bias against women, I \nreject the arguments against the Family Friendly Workplace Act. It is \ntime that these options are enjoyed by all American workers, not just \nFederal employees. I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this \ncommonsense legislation, and vote to invoke cloture.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I would like to briefly respond to some of the \ndiscussion that deals with S. 4, which is egregiously entitled the \n``Family Friendly Workplace Act.'' But I also want to say to my \ncolleagues that I am going to spend a little bit of time talking about \ndisaster relief and the failure of the House\n\n[[Page S5224]]\n\nof Representatives to move forward with this legislation because I \nthink that takes priority over all of our business here.\n  Mr. President, I will agree with my colleagues, starting with Senator \nAshcroft, whom I enjoy as a colleague, that this piece of legislation \ndeals with a very important question. And the question is how people \nbalance their commitments to work with their commitments to family. I \nthink that is a very important question.\n  But I would like to just repeat one more time for my colleague from \nMissouri and other colleagues who want to see some kind of positive, \nconstructive legislation passed, this piece of legislation in its \npresent form is going nowhere. And it should not go anywhere.\n  Mr. President, first of all, there are two features that are \nautomatic nonstarters. My colleague from Minnesota, whom I enjoy \nworking with, talked about a couple of women's organizations that \nsupport this bill. My understanding is there are huge numbers of \nwomen's organizations who are in opposition, for good reason.\n  First of all, we have the Fair Labor Standards Act which was hallmark \nlegislation. The idea here was the 40-hour week. If you worked overtime \nyou get overtime pay. That is very important. There are a whole lot of \nfamilies with incomes below $20,000, $25,000 a year for whom overtime \npay is key.\n  What we are doing with this legislation, which has this sort of \nhappy-face title, the ``Family Friendly Workplace Act,'' is we are now \nmoving from a 40-hour week, we are abolishing it and we are going to an \n80-hour 2-week period whereby an employee could work 50 or 60 hours one \nweek, 30 or 20 hours the next week and not get paid any overtime.\n  If you think that the reality is in the workplaces throughout this \ncountry that employees are equal partners in this decisionmaking in all \nthese workplaces, then you might not worry about that. But the fact of \nthe matter is, the vast majority of people, the vast majority of women \nand women's organizations, understanding the threat to the 40-hour \nweek, will not accept this. This provision is not in the House bill \nthat passed, and it should not be in this bill. It is one of the \nreasons this bill will go nowhere.\n\n  Mr. President, in addition, there is another feature that deals with \nflextime which essentially says you can work overtime and then you can \ntake that hour off or however many hours you worked, but you do not get \nan hour and a half off for an hour overtime so it becomes a cut in pay. \nAgain, you have two features in this bill that are in direct \ncontradiction to the Fair Labor Standards Act and, therefore, going \nnowhere.\n  Now, the third point I want to make is that there has to be some \nguarantee, some way that we protect people for whom being able to work \nand working overtime and being paid overtime is critical to their \nfamily's income. In a huge percentage of families with incomes under \n$20,000 a year, the household head works overtime. So what you do not \nwant to have happen is a situation where an employer is only going to \ngive the overtime to those people who take comptime as opposed to \npeople who want to have time-and-a-half pay. Again, so far, we have not \nseen any willingness to sit down and negotiate and compromise on some \nof these questions.\n  Mr. President, in committee Senator Murray talked about an extension \nof the Family and Medical Leave Act which was terribly important. The \nSenator may, while she is here, raise a question with me about this, \nand I am pleased to do a colloquy with her on that. In addition, I had \nan amendment in committee which said if there is a situation dealing \nwith Family and Medical Leave Act considerations where there is \nsickness in the family or whatever and you banked 20 or 40 hours, you \nshould be able to take that time off; you do not need to ask for \npermission.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator from Minnesota is correct that during the \ndebate on this bill I have talked consistently about the fact that \nwomen do want flexibility in the workplace in order to make sure they \ncan take care of their children when they need to.\n  The concerns we have continuously raised about the bill we are \ndebating is who decides when that woman or man, father or mother, gets \nto take that time--whether the employer decides or they do.\n  When it is your child's conference time at school, your employer \ncannot say, or probably will not say to you, ``You can take your \nconference time next week.'' You need to go to them as an employee and \nsay, ``My child's conference is next Thursday at 10 o'clock. I need to \ntake an hour to go visit with my child's teacher.''\n  Let me ask the Senator from Minnesota, the option that I am offering \nthat allows 24 hours off a year for parents to participate with their \nchild, in your opinion, would that give employees the ability to have \nsome control over their time and their ability to participate with \ntheir families?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, in responding to the question that the \nSenator from Washington has raised, that is really what is at issue \nhere. There is an alternative that Senator Baucus and others have \npresented which really does give the employees the flexibility, if that \nis what this is about. We have to make sure that employees have the \nflexibility so that if they need to take the time off--time, I might \nmake the point, time that they banked--if they need their comptime \nbecause they want to go to school and visit with the teacher or because \nthey have an elderly parent that is ill, they ought to be able to do \nit. If we really want to give them flexibility, we should give them \nflexibility. That is not in this piece of legislation.\n  I also say to the Senator from Washington that, in addition, we have \na very serious problem here. Sometimes I think here in the Senate we \nlose sight of the reality of the circumstances of many families in our \ncountry. We have a paradoxical situation where we have this impressive \nabundance, an affluence and good macroeconomic indicators, but at the \nsame time, we have large numbers of families that are struggling to \nearn a decent living and raise their children successfully. People are \nstill feeling the economic squeeze, and one of the ways people are able \nto put food on the table and support their families is to be able to \nget that overtime pay for working overtime. We are not going to abandon \nthat principle.\n\n  This legislation in its present form will be defeated again tomorrow. \nPeople gave their sweat and their tears for fair labor standards and \nfor a 40-hour week and for the idea that if you work overtime you get \novertime pay. Now, if we want to really give employees the flexibility, \nwe should do so. But you do not have a cut in pay with flextime, you do \nnot have a cut in pay by abolishing the 40-hour week and going to an \n80-hour 2-week framework. You make sure that employees, in fact, if \nthey bank that extra time, that flextime, are able to take it off, time \nand a half for every hour worked overtime to be with their child or to \nbe at a doctor's office with their parent. They get to do it. They do \nnot have to ask for permission. You certainly make sure that you do not \nhave any discrimination whereby this becomes too good a deal in its \npresent form for too many employers, and the only people, I say to my \ncolleague from Washington, that they give any overtime to are those \npeople who will not ask for overtime pay, who will only ask for \ncomptime. That is what is at issue here.\n  I agree with the question, which is this is all about working \nfamilies. This is all about how people balance commitment to work with \nbalancing a commitment to family. But this piece of legislation does \nnot give employees the flexibility, and this piece of legislation does \nnot give people the guarantee that they will not be discriminated \nagainst and no longer able to obtain overtime pay for overtime work \nwhich is so important to so many families that are barely able to make \nends meet. This piece of legislation takes the Fair Labor Standards Act \nand it turns it on its head. It literally overturns 50 or 60 years of \npeople's history. It is too bad, because we could pass a piece of \nlegislation.\n  My colleague from Missouri has a good idea, at least in the goal of \ngiving employees the flexibility. But in its present form, this piece \nof legislation will go nowhere.\n\n[[Page S5225]]\n\n  Mr. President, now, I understand I have not looked at some of the \namendments--Senator Grassley's amendment. We also, in committee, were \ntalking about the whole problem of bankruptcy and what happens to \npeople who have earned this time. I think maybe the ceiling is too low \nand we have to have a higher threshold. Maybe something can be worked \nout on that, but then I hear there is another amendment that wants to \napply this piece of legislation to the Congress, to staff, the people \nwho work here.\n  Well, Mr. President, I think that most of the people who work here--I \nhave to look at all of the specifics, but I would think that a lot of \npeople who work here might say, well, we would rather go forward and \nnot backward. Right now, I think, people would be kind of worried about \nlosing some of their fair labor standard protection or they would be \nworried about not being able to work overtime and get overtime pay. I \ndo not think people want to see that. I also think employees here \nworking with us want to make sure that if they bank the time, they will \nbe able to take it off when they need to take it off to be with their \nfamilies.\n  So, again, Mr. President, you cannot take a piece of legislation that \nis flawed, I say with some regret, badly flawed for the vast majority \nof families in this country, and now apply it to people who work here, \nwhich just compounds the problem. Make this a good piece of \nlegislation, and then, I say to my colleague from Iowa, and then we \nshould apply it. I am all for that.\n\n\n                            Disaster Relief\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to mention to some of my \ncolleagues that with some regret, at least for a while this afternoon \nwhile I have the floor, there probably will not be a lot of discussion \nabout this important piece of legislation, because I am now at the \npoint, as a Senator from Minnesota, where I could not have any more \npatience for the political process here.\n  We have had people in our States, and the Chair, I know, would feel \nthe same, and I believe my colleague from Missouri would feel the same \nway, who have been through an absolute nightmare. We have communities \nwhere everybody had to evacuate--total devastation. We have one \ncommunity in Minnesota, East Grand Forks, across the Red River from \nGrand Forks, and everybody had to leave and the people are still \nwaiting for the Congress to provide them with relief. And the House of \nRepresentatives had the nerve to go into recess without providing that \nassistance.\n\n  Well, Mr. President, for a while this afternoon the only point of \ndiscussion while I have the floor is going to be about the problems \nthat we are facing in States that have been flooded, in States that are \nwaiting for this disaster relief, because I think this ought to be the \npriority for the Congress. Whatever I know about this political \nprocess, whatever leverage I have as a Senator, I am going to use it. I \nwill slow up whatever I can slow up. I will stop whatever I can stop. I \nwill do it this week, and I will do it next week and I will do it as \nmany weeks as I need to, until that disaster relief bill is passed. I \ndo not know what else to do. I do not know what else to do.\n  Mr. President, let me just talk a little bit about what is going on \nhere. What we have is a situation where some people are playing \npolitics with the emergency supplemental as opposed to getting this \nrelief out to people who are trying to rebuild their lives.\n  Can you imagine, I say to the Chair and my colleague from Missouri, \ncan you imagine how people in Idaho and Missouri would feel when their \nhomes have been destroyed? We worked together in a bipartisan fashion, \nand Senator Stevens was a big part of that. We came up with not only \nthe funding for FEMA, but most important of all is some small business \nloans we came up with in what is called Community Development Block \nGrants, moneys which would enable people to move forward with buyouts \nfor people who live in the floodplain, enable people to have assistance \nto rebuild their homes. That was the good news part. We were on our \nway.\n  And then we had a disagreement. We had a disagreement over something \ncalled the CR. Frankly, people back in the Dakotas and Minnesota do not \nknow that much about a CR and they do not really care too much. They \njust thought we would have the elementary decency of providing them \nwith some help in their hour of need. But we got a debate about the CR.\n  We have another debate about roads and public parks and maybe a \ncouple of other matters as well. I would have thought that my \ncolleagues--and I think some Republicans agree with me, so I do not \nthink this is really so much a partisan issue; I know that in our \nStates, Republicans agree--I would have thought that my colleagues \nwould have had the elementary decency, the elementary decency before \nthey went into recess, and we were going to stop them, and I cannot \neven remember the technical maneuver, but we were going to try and \nforce a vote on adjournment, I guess it was, but they did not call it \nadjournment. We were in recess. So, theoretically, every 2 or 3 days, \nwe were in session, but we really were not. Then people in the House of \nRepresentatives could then vote against adjournment and feel good about \nit, knowing that nothing had been done.\n  I could not believe it. The leadership in the House of \nRepresentatives--I do not even call it leadership when people in our \nStates are in such need, waiting for some final assurance that relief \nis going to be forthcoming--goes into recess.\n  They don't even have the elementary decency to put aside what \ndifferences we have and just go forward--make sure that people know \nthat they are going to be able to rebuild their homes, make sure that \npeople know they are going to be able to move back into their homes, \nand make sure that people know that they are going to be able to go on \nwith their lives. But no.\n  I am Jewish. I throw my hands around here. I am sorry, my colleagues.\n  But, no. They go into recess. And I am supposed to try to explain to \npeople in Minnesota and North Dakota and South Dakota how we can play \nthese kind of games here? People can't believe it.\n  To all of my colleagues, to all of the people who are here today, no \nwonder so many Americans sour on our political process. You have floods \nthe likes of which haven't been seen for 400 or 500 years. You have \ntotal devastation. The hospitals are destroyed, schools are destroyed, \nand everybody in the town are all leaving. You have flooding. You have \nhail. You have snow. You have fire. And, in spite of all of that, the \ngoodness of people comes out. They support each other, they love each \nother, and they try to get back with their lives. But they know they \nneed help. And the House of Representatives goes into recess. It is \nunbelievable.\n  Now we are back here, and it is Tuesday. We hear that maybe this week \nthis disaster relief bill will not be passed. Or maybe, people say, \n``Well, play a game and we will put on a continuing resolution.'' What \ndoes a continuing resolution have to do with the budget or have to do \nwith getting disaster relief for people? It is called disaster relief \nbecause it is disaster. It is called an emergency supplemental bill \nbecause it is an emergency. Stop playing political games with people's \nlives.\n  So, Mr. President, now we have a situation where some people are \nthinking, OK, what we will do is put a continuing resolution on this \nbill; it has nothing to do with emergency supplemental assistance; we \nwill send it to the President; then he has already said he will veto \nit; and then it will come back here. And I don't know what they will do \nnext.\n  Why are they sending it to the President when you know he is going to \nveto it? If you want to debate the budget, let's debate the budget. If \nyou want to debate the parks and the other issues, fine. But can't we \njust put aside our differences and please get the supplemental \nassistance to people? This is really a huge issue.\n  Mr. President, there are families and business owners in Grand Forks, \nND. My colleague from North Dakota talked about this, and East Grand \nForks. They need to know whether they are going to be part of the \nfloodplain buyout. But they do not know. They do not know whether or \nnot there is going to be a buyout. They do not know whether they should \nmove. They do not know whether they should try to come back to their \nhomes. They don't know whether there is going to be any assistance at \nall. The State does\n\n[[Page S5226]]\n\nnot know whether it should go forward. The mayors do not know what they \ncan say to the citizens because they do not know what we are going to \ndo because people have been waiting and waiting and waiting.\n  Some of my colleagues today are going to wait because I am going to \ntalk on the floor of the Senate for a while as well because it is just \nsimply unconscionable and it is simply indefensible that we just do not \nget on with the business of providing people with this assistance right \nnow.\n  Mr. President, we have another problem. If we are going to start \nrebuilding--I think maybe in Idaho and less in Missouri. But in Idaho I \nthink this is a bit of an issue as well. We have to get going because \nour building season is over come mid to late October.\n  So, if we do not get the approved funding now and we don't started \nwith the construction we are not going to get it done. Minnesota is a \ncold weather State. It is without a doubt the best State in the \ncountry. But it is a cold State. We have to get the funding right now, \nor we are not going to get the construction work done.\n  Colleagues, there are very good, very wonderful, very strong, very \nloving people in Minnesota and the Dakotas, and others States as well \nare confronted with the fierce urgency of now. They are trying somehow \nto rebuild their lives. They have been through a living hell. You would \nnot wish it on anyone. They have been waiting and waiting for us to \nhave the decency to please get the assistance to them. And we are still \nplaying political games here.\n  Mr. President, the supplemental contains $500 million in CDBG funding \nfor flood assistance. This program is one of the oldest Federal block \ngrant programs in existence. This gives the States the most \nflexibility, or it could be the most flexibility for local communities.\n  Let me explain what we are talking about here. Whether we are talking \nabout floods in the Midwest, or hurricanes in the South, or earthquakes \nin the West, this CDBG money is critical because it fills in the \ncracks.\n  In other words, what happens is FEMA money is good for public \ninfrastructure and some help for homeowners and the small business \nmoney in loans. But the problem is many people can't cash flow any more \nloans. They can't get their businesses going. They can't rebuild their \nhomes unless they get this community development block grant money. We \nhave to task--thank you, Republicans, and, thank you, Democrats. We \nwork together. That was the right thing to do. But now--for the last 13 \nor 14 days, whatever it has been--people back in Minnesota cannot \nbelieve what they are seeing here. They don't understand these games. \nThey don't understand why it is we just do not provide them with the \nassistance that they need.\n  Mr. President, we have seen homes destroyed. We have seen city blocks \nimmersed in water. And our communities, Ada, Warren, East Grand Forks, \nand others are in tremendous amount of need. They are in hurt. And they \nhave the task of rebuilding their neighborhoods block by block and home \nby home.\n  I would like to thank FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency \nfor their work, and its Director James Lee Witt for his leadership. He \nhas been great. I would like to thank all of the FEMA people who are \nout in Minnesota. They have been great. They are real heroes and real \nheroines. They are doing everything they can to help people. They are \nworking with our community. And they are thinking about again buyouts \nand relocation plans.\n  They are thinking about how to enable people to move back into their \nhomes, and how people can rebuild their businesses. But we need to get \nthe funding to our States now. We need to begin the process of \nrebuilding our communities.\n  Mr. President, I don't know any other way to say it. I would say to \nmy colleagues: Quit playing political football with the lives of \ndisaster victims. Quit playing political football with the lives of \ndisaster victims.\n  I don't know anything else to do. I mean, I apologize to my \ncolleagues. I am going to continue to talk for a while--not all day and \nall night and all day tomorrow. But I do want to speak for a while \nabout this.\n  Really, every opportunity I get as a Senator I am going to continue \nto come out and hold the floor. And I think just about every other \nSenator will do the same thing from our States. This is going to go on. \nAny Senator would do it, Democrat, or Republican. What else are you \nsupposed to do?\n  I mean the first thing you do is you try to appeal to the common \nsense of some of your colleagues. You say, look, we have some \ndifferences here. So why don't we just put those differences aside and \njust get the assistance to people because we don't differ on that.\n  This is an emergency. Let's get the emergency assistance to people \nnow. We tried to make that appeal. That didn't work. Then you try and \nappeal to the goodness of people. You say, look, people are hurting. \nPeople need some certainty. People need to have some confidence that we \nare going to provide some assistance to people. Please, \nRepresentatives; please Senators--I think even more Representatives now \nthat I think about it on the House side--please. Can't you just put \naside the differences? Can't we just go forward with what we agree on \nand get this disaster relief to people?\n\n  That doesn't work.\n  Then you try another appeal. You say, look, Senator, if it was your \nState, you would want to get that assistance out to the people. You \nwould have a tough time going home and looking at people in the eye and \nhaving them look at you and try to explain what in the world is going \non here.\n  So you try to appeal to colleagues, and you say, ``Look, I have \nalways been there for you when you needed help in Missouri, or you \nneeded help in Idaho, or whatever State, which is true. I remember the \nflooding and what they went through just a few years ago. Now we need \nhelp. Please, won't you help us get this through?\n  And that doesn't work.\n  So, since none of that works, there is only one thing to do. And that \nis just use the Senate rules and figure out your leverage and just do \nnot let the U.S. Congress--in particular the House of Representatives \nwhich has this held up--go on with business as usual. We are going to \ntalk about what is going on in Minnesota, the Dakotas, Missouri, and \nCalifornia, and a variety of other States.\n  Mr. President, I have here a letter from the mayor of East Grand \nForks, MN, Lynn Stauss.\n  I tell you. My colleague, Representative Collin Peterson, made a very \ngood point this morning. Lynn Stauss is a part-time mayor. He makes \nabout $5,300 a year. He is coming back out here tomorrow, and the mayor \nof Grand Forks, ND, as well. They shouldn't have to keep coming out \nhere. But they have to keep coming out here to keep saying to people: \n``Please, Senators and Representatives, don't make the people in our \ncommunities an abstraction.'' We are talking about real men, real \nwomen, and their children.\n  I don't know how the mayor has done it. He has been incredibly \ncourageous. He has given people a lot of hope under some very difficult \nconditions, I say to a former mayor, Mr. President. But I know it gets \nhard after a while. People start to run out of hope when we don't come \nthrough here in the Congress.\n  So this is a letter dated May 20, 1997. I should have brought my \nglasses knowing that I was going to be on the floor for a while.\n  Do you have any glasses? [Laughter.]\n  These glasses are too conservative. I thank my colleague from \nMissouri. I have never understood how such a good person could have \nsuch bad ideas. [Laughter.]\n\n       Dear Senator Dorgan: We understand that there are currently \n     proposals to dispose of the five hundred million in CDBG \n     grants for disaster aid in two separate payments. Because of \n     the magnitude of destruction of the record setting flood of \n     1997 and the ice storm preceding the flood on April 4, 1997 \n     throughout the Red River Valley, especially to the \n     communities of Grand Forks, North Dakota and East Grand \n     Forks, Minnesota, it is imperative that the total amount of \n     five hundred million be released to our communities without \n     delay. The people of our communities have suffered the loss \n     of income, homes and businesses. In addition, our streets, \n     water system, electrical system and sanitation system have \n     been severely damaged and require immediate attention. The \n     public facilities as we once knew them are virtually non-\n     existent. We are now a community without a city hall, a \n     library, several schools, fire hall and senior citizens \n     center.\n       Our number one priority is the acquisition of over 600 \n     homes and businesses from the\n\n[[Page S5227]]\n\n     floodway. Immediate acquisition and relocation is the only \n     preventive measure in relieving stress and allowing our \n     citizens an opportunity to rebuild in our communities. \n     Because of our short window of construction, if we do not act \n     now our businesses and residents will have no alternative but \n     to relocate in other communities.\n       We enclose for your information a copy of a proposal from \n     Wynne Consultants which clearly depicts the aftermath and \n     total devastation left by the flood and ice storm. We believe \n     the report will provide you with a comprehensive \n     understanding of our urgent, basic needs. The five hundred \n     million in CDBG grants must be released to our communities to \n     allow us the flexibility to rebuild and move forward with our \n     lives.\n\n  Mr. President, this is from the mayor, and I just want to emphasize \nthe importance of the words ``to rebuild and move forward with our \nlives.'' Again, Mr. President, I am sorry to inconvenience colleagues, \nbut I feel as if people in Minnesota have been inconvenienced, and I \nthink it is important to focus on this because I think we should pass \nthis before we do anything else.\n  An emergency supplemental is an emergency supplemental. That does not \nmean messing around, playing all sorts of political games. And disaster \nrelief is disaster relief. It seems to me to be patently unfair and \ninsensitive and unconscionable for the House of Representatives to go \ninto recess and not pass this disaster relief bill or for this week all \nof us in the Congress to mess around and mess around and mess around \nand not do this work. If there is one thing we should do this week, it \nshould be to pass this disaster relief bill. This should come before \nanything else. This disaster relief bill should come before, I say to \nmy colleague--I know how much work he has put into this, and I still \nthink there is a possibility of passing a good piece of legislation \nwhen we get down to really give-and-take discussion and work together. \nI do not think this bill will pass in its present form. I do not think \nit should.\n  (Mr. KEMPTHORNE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I do not think this piece of \nlegislation takes first priority. I do not think some of the amendments \nthat are on the floor right now take first priority. I am not speaking \nabout those amendments. There is not anybody who is going to speak on \nthose amendments for a while. I do not think those amendments should \ntake priority. I do not think the budget, if we get to the budget \nsometime this week, should take priority. I do not think there is \nanything we could do this week that would be as important as providing \npeople, families, who have been through just total devastation with a \nhelping hand. Can't we do that? Can't we just provide people a helping \nhand? Can't we give people some confidence they are going to have some \nassistance so they can move back into their homes? Is that too much to \nask? Can't we give some small businesses some confidence that there is \ngoing to be some access to capital and some assistance so they can \nstart up their businesses again?\n  I want to tell you something. Maybe some people think some of this is \nfunny, but I want to tell you something. A whole lot of these people, \nthese homeowners and these business people, are leaving. They are not \ngoing to be able to stay in these communities, I say to the majority \nleader, who has helped us, who has done a good job, and I thank him. \nThese people are not going to be able to move back into their \ncommunities. A lot of these people are going to leave. That is what we \nare now here on.\n  So, Mr. President, I think it is appropriate that I take the floor \nand speak about this because I am hearing this from people in my State. \nAnd I know other Senators are hearing this as well.\n  Mr. President, this is a letter from the mayor of East Grant Forks, \nLynn Stauss, again, who has just done a yeoman job, to members of the \ntask force, the Minnesota Recovery Task Force:\n\n       Please accept the following information as our preliminary \n     application to the Minnesota Recovery Disaster Task Force. We \n     hope the data we have included will assist you in assessing \n     the level of damage in East Grand Forks and allow us to \n     receive early consideration in the coming discussion on \n     recovery activity in our State. We consider our position to \n     be worthy of a serious share of the Federal and State funding \n     that will come to Minnesota. I know that you have been \n     apprised of our damage situation throughout the Nation and \n     statewide media over the hours of this disaster. Our city \n     staff would welcome the opportunity to answer your questions \n     at any time. Thank you for your time and consideration.\n       Lynn Stauss, Mayor, East Grand Forks.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, what I have here--and it will take me a little \nbit of time to read this application--is the application from the \nmayor. I want to emphasize one more time--and, Mr. President, I would \nlike to apologize to some citizens who have come here today who are \nhere during our proceeding. Normally we have debate on amendments, and \nwhen I start reading from some of this I fear that for some people here \nthat will not be--without knowing the ins and outs of all of this, it \nmay not be relevant, but I want to just make it clear one more time I \nonce in a while come to the floor of the Senate and do this, but not \nvery often, and I think those of us, whether we are Democrats or \nRepublicans, don't come to the floor of the Senate and do this and hold \nthe floor unless we really feel strongly about something.\n\n  But, Mr. President, I do feel strongly about this. Time is not \nneutral. Time rushes on. There are too many people who are hurting. \nThey have asked for assistance, and we have got people who are playing \ngames here. There is no other order of business that should come before \nour passing this emergency supplemental bill that provides disaster \nrelief to people who have been through hell. They deserve our help, and \nthey should not have to wait. They should not have to be out there \ntwisting in the wind. They should not have to wonder what in the world \nis the matter with us. This bill ought to pass this week. This bill \nought to pass today. I would be proud or pleased to leave the floor \nright now if I only thought something was going to be done.\n  Mr. President, let me go on and read from this application. This is \njust from East Grand Forks, really not talking about--I was in Ada, MN. \nIn Ada, MN, it was just devastating. The school was completely flooded, \nmuch of it destroyed. They are going to be able to renovate the school, \nbut can you imagine this? Here you have the school completely \ndestroyed. It is going to be rebuilt, but somehow those students and \nthe teachers and the support staff and the superintendent and the \nparents and the neighbors all banded together, and other schools will \ntake in those kids and those kids are now finishing school and they are \ngoing to graduate. That is inspiring.\n  I will tell you something, Mr. President. What is not inspiring is \nthis Congress. What is not inspiring is the House of Representatives. \nWhat is not inspiring is the Representatives or Senators who put \nextraneous measures onto this piece of legislation and are not willing \nto get the assistance to people who need it now. That is not inspiring. \nWe do not set a very good model for young people when we cannot stop \nplaying games and just provide assistance to people who need that \nassistance.\n  In Ada, as well, their hospital was just, again, devastated. They had \nto, in the dark of night, I think it was late at night, 10, 11, 12 \no'clock, they had to take elderly people out of the nursing home, had \nto evacuate them. It was just unbelievable what people went through. \nCan you imagine a hospital destroyed, the community center destroyed, \nthe school destroyed? And can you imagine what it would be like to, \nfirst of all, be flooded out and then you are faced with a blizzard and \npeople do not have any heat? People go through all of this and they \ncontinue to flourish, and the churches or the synagogues all come \ntogether and people help one another and somehow people make it \nthrough, although there is a lot of hurt and there is a lot of pain and \nprobably some people are going to have to go through a fair amount of \ncounseling to get through all this. But at the very minimum couldn't \nthis Congress--I say this now to the majority party--pass this \nemergency supplemental bill now?\n  Doesn't emergency mean emergency? Could not we provide this \nassistance to people now? Is that too much to ask? Is that too much for \nthe people of Grand Forks, ND, to ask? Is that too much for the people \nof East Grand Forks to ask? Is that too much for the people of Warren, \nMN, to ask? Is that too much for the people of Ada, MN, to ask?\n  I heard my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Conrad, this morning. \nI\n\n[[Page S5228]]\n\nthought he was eloquent. He said something like how many more days do \npeople have to wait? I think that is an important question. How many \nmore days, how many more weeks do people have to wait for help? How \nmany more days do the people in our communities who are trying to \nrebuild their schools or hospitals have to wait? How many more days do \nthe people who are trying to find out whether they are going to be \nmoving or whether they are going to be staying or whether they are \ngoing to have money to rebuild their homes or to rebuild their \nbusinesses, how much longer do they have to wait? How much longer do \nsenior citizens, many elderly people--a very high percentage of our \nsmaller towns and communities really are comprised of elderly citizens. \nHow much longer do they have to wait to know whether they are going to \nbe able to live there?\n\n  The answer will be determined by what we do or what we do not do. I \nam determined as a Senator from Minnesota to do everything I can to \nmake as many of my colleagues as uncomfortable as possible until we \ntake action.\n  Let me repeat that. Whatever I can do to make those who are \nresponsible for this delay uncomfortable, whatever I can do to focus \nattention on their irresponsibility, to focus attention on their \ninsensitivity, to focus attention on their callousness, whatever I can \ndo to make it clear to the leadership of the House of Representatives \nit is time to get serious, it is time, as my children would have said \nwhen they were younger, to get real I will do.\n  Mr. President, this application form--let me read from this form:\n\n       The flooding of April 1997 caused hundreds of millions of \n     dollars in damages to private properties, infrastructure and \n     businesses in the city of East Grand Forks.\n\n  Mr. President, I think what I am going to do is actually read this \nslowly because right now time will move on slowly on the floor of the \nSenate:\n\n       Damage to housing ranged from complete destruction of the \n     properties to severely damaged basements, electrical systems, \n     and heating systems.\n\n  By the way, built into this disaster relief bill--and I thank my \ncolleagues, both Republicans and Democrats--is some assistance in the \nlow-income home energy assistance program, the LIHEAP program--Senator \nStevens helped us on that--which will enable people, for example, to \nbuy new furnaces, which will be a big help. Again, it will not happen, \nit will not happen until this disaster relief bill is passed:\n\n       The vast majority of single family and multifamily dwelling \n     units sustained damage. Similar damages to privately owned \n     commercial properties occurred. Beyond the costs of the \n     physical damage, these businesses have also been forced to \n     deal with the economic loss associated with being unable to \n     operate. Many have been unable to reopen and those that have \n     to deal with having lost employees.\n\n  That is another issue, Mr. President. I know that when I went to \nBreckenridge, it was just really poignant because there I met with all \nof these small business people. It was not a meeting that had been \narranged. I just came up to look at the flooding. And as soon as I came \ninto the community, all of these small business people came up to me--\nand I am not putting them down at all, you understand--and they were \nabsolutely desperate. I mean, there was just desperation and fear; they \nwere really so frightened. And they were saying, look, we can't make \nthis unless we get some assistance. And, Senator Wellstone, if you just \ngive us loans, we can't cash flow those loans and we are not only \nworried about ourselves, we also are worried about our employees. Well, \nyou know what? All the time I hear speeches given about small \nbusinesses, ``Oh, we love small businesses. They are just like family \nfarmers.'' We love them in the abstract.\n\n  You know what? We have a lot of small businesses in Minnesota and the \nDakotas that have been flooded out. We have a lot of small businesses \nthat want to rebuild their businesses. We have a lot of towns that \ndepend on those small businesses.\n  I hear my colleagues always say they are for the small businesses. \nYou know what? The best way you can be for small businesses this week \nis to do something concrete, which is to stop playing games with this \ndisaster relief bill, pass this piece of legislation, and get the \nassistance to people so they can start their businesses up again, so \nthey can at least begin the process of rebuilding.\n  The mayor goes on to say:\n\n       The magnitude of the loss has forced the city to move \n     forward on the implementation of measures to minimize the \n     future possibility of a similar event occurring. At a time \n     when the city is forced to deal with the enormous expense of \n     reconstruction, it is also faced with considering the huge \n     expense of future mitigation.\n\n  This is going to be a much bigger part of what we do in the future, \nwhich is mitigation, which is to try to figure out how to prevent this \nfrom happening in the first place. So people who are living in a 100-\nyear floodplain are not necessarily going to live there. We are going \nto relocate some people. We are going to relocate some businesses. We \nare going to do that in lots of parts of this country. That is going to \nbe a bigger part of what FEMA and other agencies do as well.\n\n       The city is currently in the process of planning the \n     construction of a dike-levee system which will ultimately \n     result in the need to relocate households residing on the \n     ``west side'' of the dikes. At this time, the final dike \n     alignment has not been established. However, it is evident \n     that at least 300 households will have to be initially \n     relocated and ultimately 650 to 700 households need to be \n     relocated. Businesses located in the immediate downtown also \n     will need to relocate, probably 10 to 15 commercial \n     properties.\n\n  Mr. President, I have here somewhere a document where Kit Hadley, who \nheads up the Minnesota Housing Finance Agency, said the other day that \nthis was one of the worst housing disasters in the history of our \ncountry. It is true. I mean, when whole towns evacuate, when people \nbecome refugees, when so many people are still homeless, people who \nworked hard all their lives, that is a housing disaster. It is a \nhousing disaster, I say to my colleagues in the House and I say to my \ncolleagues in the Senate, but especially in the House. It is time to \nget on with the work. It is time to provide some relief to people. It \nis time to provide people with some assistance.\n\n       Businesses located in the immediate downtown also will need \n     to relocate, probably 10 to 15 commercial properties. \n     Planning is underway to establish sites to which the \n     business, primarily commercial and residential, relocations \n     will occur. Several potential sites for residential \n     relocation are currently being considered. Although no final \n     decision has been made on the business relocations, the B-N \n     triangle, a parcel situated immediately to the east of the \n     current downtown district, is being considered. At each site \n     to which the relocations will ultimately occur the \n     establishment of essential infrastructure will be necessary--\n     sewer, sanitary and storm water, and streets. Damage to \n     infrastructure was citywide and included all of the major \n     infrastructural systems.\n\n  Can you imagine this? Damage to the sanitary sewer, to the storm \nsewer, to the water system and the streets--all of that damage took \nplace.\n\n       Other public facilities, such as public buildings, were \n     also damaged, several beyond repair, including the city hall \n     and the fire department. Damages to park and recreation \n     facilities and buildings were severe and widespread. Among \n     the public structures which were destroyed were three \n     schools.\n\n  Mr. President, this reminds me of a poignant moment. My colleague \nfrom the 7th Congressional District, Congressman Peterson, Collin \nPeterson, spoke at graduation--I heard about this--to the students of \nEast Grand Forks who had been flooded out, whose school had been \ndestroyed. He said to the students, ``You know, as much agony as you \nand your families have gone through, you have probably learned more \nthan you could have ever learned in school''--and I think that is \ntrue--``about yourselves and, really, about your community.''\n  I would add to Congressman Peterson that I think people in our \ncommunities have learned about all of the heroes and heroines that \nthere are. Someday--as long as I am on the floor here for a while--I am \ngoing to write a book. Maybe I can get my colleague from Missouri to \ncoauthor it. Because this would cut across all parties and all \nideology, and he is like this in terms of what he believes in. What it \nwould be, there was a book written years ago that should be immortal, \nby James Agee, Walter Evans was the photographer, and the name of the \nbook was, ``Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.'' It's a long story. Forbes \nmagazine had commissioned James Agee back in the 1940's to go, I think, \nback to Alabama to write about the pathology of poor\n\n[[Page S5229]]\n\nsharecroppers and tenant farmers. And he went there and lived with \npeople. Mr. President, he, as opposed to his impression before he was \nthere, and his thesis, he thought to himself, ``It's amazing that under \nthese conditions, people are able to survive or even flourish. They \nshould be famous.'' So he wrote a very different kind of book with \nwonderful, powerful photographs.\n  We could do a book. The Chair is like this as well. Three of us could \nwrite this book, and we could title it, ``Let Us Now Praise Famous Men \nor Women.'' It wouldn't matter whether they were Democrats or \nRepublicans. What it would be, it would be about men and women in \ncommunities who do wonderful things in their community. You know what I \nmean? I mean, it wouldn't be cynical; it would be uplifting. It would \nbe about all the people in our country who do really wonderful work in \ntheir communities. No one knows them. They are not nationally famous or \ninternationally famous. They don't do it for that. But they should be \nfamous.\n  Mr. President, only because I don't want to yield the floor, I would \nask my colleague whether he would consider doing it with me, but then I \nwould lose my floor privilege. But I am telling you, this would be a \ngood book. There would be more Democrats profiled in the book than \nRepublicans. But, you know, it would be more or less balanced. More or \nless.\n  To be more serious, it wouldn't have anything to do with parties. But \nthere are a lot of great people in this country. And there are a lot of \npeople who are unsung heroes and heroines. There were a lot of people \nin East Grand Forks and Granite Falls and Montevideo and Warren and Ada \nand Grand Forks who are heroes and heroines. Boy, I don't know how--I \nsay to a former mayor--I don't know how the mayors have been able to do \nthis. But we have had Mayor Owens and Mayor Stauss. They have been just \nunbelievable. Pat Owens has been--people have seen her. She didn't want \nit. I know that it would have been her prayer to have never had this \nopportunity to be such a national spokesperson, because she would never \nhave wanted for this to happen in her community. But she has so \ninspired people, she has, over and over again, called on people not to \ngive up and called on people to have hope, and has said we can rebuild \nour communities.\n  And now the big missing ingredient is our support, our assistance. We \npass disaster relief bills when there are disasters. And this is a \ndisaster. We pass emergency supplemental pieces of legislation when \nthere is an emergency. I really think that we are doing one heck of a \njob in this Congress of souring people toward our political process by \nour failure to live up to just the sort of basic standard of decency.\n  Look, I don't like to say this. I should not say it because, I don't \nknow, maybe I am giving ground here. But, you know, if some of my \ncolleagues, some of my colleagues on the other side, if they want to \nhave a continuing resolution and they are going to put it on this \ndisaster relief bill because it gives them leverage--you do have \nleverage. You do have leverage. When people are desperate, it gives you \nleverage. If that is what they want to do and send it to the President, \nplaying the game, knowing he is going to veto it, do it. Do it today. \nGet it done. Send it to the President, he vetoes it, it comes back \nhere, then take it off. Everybody can claim victory. Whatever you want \nto do. Just get it done and just get this disaster relief bill passed.\n\n  This assistance from the Congress is not going to make people whole. \nIt is not going to be enough. The only thing this does, it gets people \nat least a chance, at least a chance. Can we at least do that?\n  Mr. President, this is one of many articles I see here. Maybe there \nwill be an opportunity while I am on the floor. I know there were \nalso--I am looking for the author of this. It was in the Star Tribune. \nI also know the Pioneer Press--I read of the work of Nick Coleman in \nthe Pioneer Press, which was very, very powerful. I may want to read \nfrom that, either this afternoon or tonight or tomorrow. I will not be \non the floor all day and night. But I will be on the floor a lot over \nthe next couple of days, over the next couple of weeks--who knows, over \nthe next couple of months. I would think we will get this done.\n  But, you know what, my expectations are pretty low. I could not \nbelieve it, Mr. President. We had a press conference last week. I guess \nit was right before we went into recess. I said at this press \nconference--I guess it was Thursday, because we went into recess that \nFriday. I said that the House not sending us back something to work \nwith, it was probably the worst--it was, for me--the lowest or most \ndisappointing or worst time I had in the Senate. Because I thought that \nin the end, the goodness of people would come through. And even though \npeople disagreed on the continuing resolution and whatnot, people would \nat least agree to agree on what we agreed on and get the disaster \nrelief to people who were in such need.\n  There was someone at this press conference, a journalist. There was \nsome laughter. I said, ``Wait a minute. You know, I don't think I am \nbeing naive. I don't think this is naive at all to believe in the \ngoodness of people, including my colleagues.''\n  I love being a Senator. I get goose bumps when I have a chance to be \non the floor of the Senate. I do. I never thought I would have a chance \nto be here. It is a huge honor, and every day you hope you will do your \njob well. You make plenty of mistakes, but you do your very best. It's \na huge honor.\n  I was a teacher for 20 years. I want young people to be interested in \npublic service. I like the people I work with. I enjoy people here in \nthe Senate and I enjoy people in the House, agree or disagree. But \nthere comes a certain point in time where, you know, the indignation \njust kind of takes over. And I have just run out of patience.\n\n  This is outrageous. This is outrageous. Frankly, I would say to \npeople in the House of Representatives, who went into recess without \nsending that disaster relief bill over here and getting the job done, \nshame on you. Shame on you. Shame on you. Shame on you. It is not too \nmuch to expect for you to get some help, some assistance to people in \nour States who are in such pain and really need the help now.\n  They really do. Time is not neutral for them. Time rushes on. I mean, \nif they do not get the help, people are going to leave or families are \ngoing to just be under such pressure and without any hope, who knows \nwhat happens? But I will tell you one thing--I will tell you one thing, \nMr. President--I do not want to go back to East Grand Forks and some of \nthe other communities and look at people and try to explain to them why \nin the world this Congress did not take any action. I just cannot \nexplain it. And the one thing I do know is, even if I inconvenience \nsome of my colleagues, the one thing I do know is there isn't going to \nbe anybody in Minnesota that is going to be able to say I did not fight \nfor this, win or lose.\n  So I get to speak on the floor of the Senate now. And I will continue \nto speak on the floor of the Senate for a while. And then I just want \nto put my colleagues on notice: Everything you bring on the floor of \nthe Senate, everything you bring this week and next week, I will look \nfor leverage, I will somehow get to the floor, and I will do everything \nI can to put the focus back on getting emergency assistance to people \nin Minnesota and the Dakotas and our other States as well.\n  You know, we have some distorted priorities here when people want to \nplay games with the lives of people who are in such pain, in such \nagony.\n  This is an article from the Star Tribune, Minnesota Star Tribune. It \nis called ``Stains of Pain.'' Mr. President, the top of it reads, ``The \npeople at ground zero of the Red River flood want desperately to get on \nwith their lives. But how do they do that when they are adrift in such \nwreckage?''\n\n       The people at ground zero of the Red River flood want \n     desperately to get on with their lives. But how do they do \n     that when they are adrift in such wreckage?\n       Grand Forks, N.D.--On Belmont Road, a fading sign propped \n     against a sagging mound of clothes, furniture and appliances \n     proclaims, ``We are not what we own.''\n       At the Darbyshire house on Polk Street, a battered house \n     knocked off its foundation, a pink ``condemned'' notice is \n     taped on the front door. Look down from the notice and you \n     look into what was the Darbyshires' basement.\n       In north Grand Forks, in the Riverside neighborhood, a \n     bright yellow house is stained dull brown to the eaves. The \n     Riverside Park swimming pool is a sewage lagoon.\n\n[[Page S5230]]\n\n       Across the Red River, on the northwestern edge of East \n     Grand Forks, a girl plays by the street, listless and \n     unsmiling. She tosses a scrap of something into the air, \n     watches it fall, then tosses it again.\n\n  I am going to read that again. ``Across the Red River, on the \nnorthwestern edge of East Grand Forks, a girl plays by the street, \nlistless and unsmiling.''\n  Mr. President, you are talking about a little girl listless and \nunsmiling. I guess so, given what she and her family have been through.\n  Maybe what we need to do is we need to understand that these words or \nthese articles, this is not just a distraction, this is not just \nstatistics, we are talking about people's lives.\n  This little girl, Mr. President, listless and unsmiling, should not \nhave to stay listless and unsmiling. Little children should be smiling. \nLittle children should be happy. Little children should be looking for \ntheir future. We ought to give this little girl and her family, Mr. \nPresident, some reason to expect that will happen. And yet we cannot \nprovide disaster relief for people who have been flooded out of their \nhomes? We cannot provide support for little children? Sounds kind of \nmelodramatic, Mr. President.\n\n  Mr. President, I do not want to lose my floor privilege.\n  Mr. President, ask unanimous consent that my colleague from Kansas be \nable to give a tribute to Senator Strom Thurmond, after which I then \nwould retain my right to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  I wonder if I could ask my colleague how long he might want to speak. \nIt is fine for me however long he wants.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I would tell the distinguished Senator from Minnesota \nthat I do not intend to speak more than about 10 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague. Whatever time he needs. I just \nwanted to know how much time.\n  Mr. ROBERTS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. First, I want to thank my colleague from Minnesota for \nletting me have this time. I know that he feels very strongly about \nthis debate and wanted to make so many pertinent comments.\n  (By unanimous consent, the remarks of Mr. Roberts are printed in \ntoday's edition of the Record under ``Tribute to Senator Strom \nThurmond.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMinnesota has the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me, before entertaining a question \nfrom my colleague, a request from my colleague, let me read from an \narticle. And I see my colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, is \non the floor. Let me read from an article, ``Stains of Pain,'' dealing \nwith Grand Forks, ND. This was May 25, 1997.\n\n       It has been five weeks since the river swamped these towns. \n     The river is back in its banks now, officially below flood \n     stage, far from homes and businesses and children at play.\n       But the water marks remain everywhere.\n\n  Mr. President, I was just thinking, I know some of my colleagues want \nto speak, but I also see my colleague here from North Dakota. I wonder \nwhether it would be possible, Mr. President, I want to read this \narticle, and then if there are some requests about speaking, perhaps we \ncould do that, although I then want to make it clear that on unanimous \nconsent, my resumption on the floor not be counted as a second speech.\n  Now, I want to make it clear to my colleagues if they put in that \nrequest, that would be part of my unanimous-consent agreement. I also \nmake a request, I know my colleagues want to speak about some other \nthings, but, for certain, if colleagues want to speak about Senator \nStrom Thurmond, I do not want to interrupt that in any way, shape or \nform. If colleagues want to speak about Senator Thurmond, fine.\n  Otherwise, I know there are things a few people want to cover. What \nwe are doing here today is saying we want to focus on this and this \nwill be it. This is the issue. This is the action that should be taken.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would like to come and speak for a bit. I understand, I \nthink the Senator from Massachusetts does wish to speak a tribute to \nSenator Thurmond. I suspect the Senator from Missouri wishes to pose \nsome comments on the debate today on the bill on the floor. Perhaps we \ncan find a way to do that. I will come back and discuss the disaster \nsupplemental bill at an appropriate time, probably in the next 30 \nminutes or so.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from North Dakota, that would be \nfine. I would like to finish reading this article and then accommodate \ncolleagues, but I also ask unanimous consent I maintain my floor \nprivilege. If I could finish this, let me go on with this article.\n\n       On Polk Street, a block off Lincoln Drive, Paul Dilling \n     stands in the front yard of his ruined house, which was \n     submerged to the rafters. He stands by his water mark: A U.S. \n     flag, muddy and torn, which he salvaged from the muck and \n     stuck on a stick.\n       But it has been five weeks of misery for Dilling.\n\n  That is really the point I am trying to make. It has been 5 weeks of \nmisery. People have been through misery. They have been devastated, and \nnow they wait for this Congress to pass the disaster relief bill. That \nis why I am saying this should be the first item of business for us.\n  It is interesting, there is a St. Paul Pioneer Press editorial of May \n23, with a headline ``Congress Can't Resist Political Gamesmanship.''\n\n       Congress has breezed out of town, leaving Washington for a \n     long holiday recess. Despite evidence to the contrary, \n     congressional bigwigs figured satisfying their political egos \n     was more important than expediting flood relief legislation \n     that would aid, among other backwaters, Minnesota and the \n     Dakotas.\n\n  I know that my colleagues may want to have some floor time now, so I \nwill be very brief. But let me just for a moment develop this point, \nand then I will keep my floor privileges. This is from the St. Paul \nPioneer Press.\n  Now, I have not always agreed with the editorial positions of the St. \nPaul Pioneer Press. Sometimes I have, sometimes I have not. That is \nbeside the point. Sometimes the St. Paul Pioneer Press will take \neditorial positions closer to the positions of the distinguished Chair \nor my colleague from Missouri. It is an interesting paper, and they, \nlike any good editorial page, have their own integrity and they say \nwhat they think is right. But I just want to make it clear that this is \nnot some sort of editorial written by Democrats trying to figure out a \nway to criticize Republicans.\n\n              Congress Can't Resist Political Gamesmanship\n\n       Congress has breezed out of town, leaving Washington for a \n     long holiday recess [right before Memorial Day recess]. \n     Despite evidence to the contrary, congressional bigwigs \n     figured satisfying their political egos was more important \n     than expediting flood relief legislation that would aid, \n     among other backwaters, Minnesota and the Dakotas.\n\n  We have had enough of this political gamesmanship. We have had enough \nof it. We have people in our States that are hurting. We have children \nthat are homeless. We have children that have had to live through this \ndevastation. We have families under duress. We have families under \npressure. And the people in Minnesota and the people in the Dakotas and \nthe people in some of the other States have every right to believe that \nthe goodness of the Congress would come through and we would provide \nthem with the assistance they so badly need to rebuild their lives.\n  You have people in the House of Representatives that go on vacation \nas opposed to providing this assistance. That is why I am on the floor \ntoday. That is why I am staying on the floor. And now I hear that this \nweek we may not pass this. This is outrageous.\n  One more time: If you want to have a debate about a continuing \nresolution budget, debate it. If you want to have a debate about parks \nand environmental legislation, debate it. But do not put it on a \ndisaster relief bill. Do not hold good people that deserve our support \nhostage to your grand political strategy.\n  Today, it is an inconvenience. We have a bill on the floor. It is a \nslight inconvenience. People wanted to have a discussion on amendments, \nand we are not doing that today. It is not a major inconvenience. But \nyou know what? I actually think, and I do not\n\n[[Page S5231]]\n\nmean this in an arrogant way, I think I am doing some of the leadership \nin the House of Representatives a favor, because if, in my own small \nway, I can put any pressure on them to do the right thing, they will be \nbetter off, because they look terrible. They look terrible. You could \ndo a poll in Missouri, Massachusetts, Minnesota, anywhere in the \ncountry, and 99.9 percent of the people in the country would say this \nis outrageous. Can't you people at least provide help to people when \nthey need it? That is what this is all about.\n  I say to the St. Paul Pioneer Press, I am actually being a pretty \ngood politician. I say first to the Star Tribune, both newspapers, this \nis a very good article, and there are many others. This editorial of \nthe St. Paul Pioneer Press is right on the mark.\n  Now, this hurts. ``Despite evidence to the contrary, congressional \nbigwigs * * * ''--I hate to hear that. But you know something, it is \ntoo easy to do. Mr. President, I do not like it when my colleagues are \ncalled congressional bigwigs.\n  I tell you something, you are bringing it on yourselves. I actually \ndo not know if I should use the word ``leadership'' in the House, \nbecause I think it is hard to say there is any leadership when you \ncannot move forward on a disaster relief bill.\n  But I tell you something, here is a headline in the Star Tribune, \n``Flood Relief''--and I say to my colleague from Massachusetts, I will \nfinish up in a moment--``Flood relief, a political football, takes \nanother bounce in D.C.''\n\n       Congressional skirmishing delayed consideration of flood \n     relief legislation Thursday, and the $5.5 billion aid package \n     will not be approved until Congress returns from the Memorial \n     Day recess early next month.\n\n  That is from Washington bureau chief Tom Hamburger, Star Tribune.\n  Well, Mr. President, I have plenty of articles to read from. I have \napplications from some of our cities that have been devastated. I will \nhave time to continue to talk about what has happened, but I will tell \nyou that if my being on the floor of the Senate at least for a while, \nat least for the rest of the afternoon, and then, as I say, all week \nand the weeks to come, every time I can come out here, any leverage I \nhave to come out here and talk about this, I will keep pressing and \npressing and pressing and pressing and pressing.\n  My colleagues are going to hear about people in East Grand Forks and \nAda and so many towns, they will get tired of hearing about it. But you \nknow what? I do not really care, because this is just outrageous.\n  I have some very good people I work with that are on the floor now, \nrepresenting a broad spectrum of political opinion, Senator Kennedy and \nSenator Ashcroft, but I tell you something, this is not a great moment \nfor the Congress, and I think it is outrageous what the House of \nRepresentatives did. This disaster relief bill has to get passed, and \nit has to get passed this week. The only way I know to try and do \neverything I can, there is no guarantee, is just to raise a lot of \nheck--I did say heck--on the floor of the U.S. Senate. I will continue \nto do so.\n  Now, I have other points I want to make, but I see the Senator from \nMassachusetts. I wonder if the Senator may have an inquiry he would \nlike to make. I still have the floor, Mr. President, and I want to make \nit clear that if I do take any question from the Senator or give the \nSenator any time, I ask unanimous consent if the Senator wants to \nspeak, either Senator, I ask unanimous consent my resumption on the \nfloor not be counted as a second speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator reserves the right to object. The \nobjection is heard.\n  The Senator from Minnesota has the floor, and the Senator from \nMinnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield for a question, and, Mr. \nPresident, let me say before yielding, I do not understand the \nobjection, but I would like to let colleagues speak about Senator \nThurmond and cover some other matters, and I am pleased to do that as \nlong, again, as I get unanimous consent resumption on the floor not \nbeing counted as a second speech.\n  My colleague has objected, I guess, for now.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, what I would like to propose, and ask the \nSenator if he would agree, is that I be recognized for a period of no \nmore than 15 minutes. I will try to make it closer to 10 minutes. And, \nsubsequently, I see Senator Ashcroft, who is the principal sponsor of \nthe underlying legislation which we are debating, and I know he has \nbeen here longer than I have and has some comments and also some \nrequests in terms of perfecting amendments, I hope he would be offered \ntime to be able to do that, and, subsequently, the Senator from \nMinnesota would be recognized and that there would be no objection to \nhis speaking at that time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Is this a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Just trying to work this out in a way that is \naccommodating. I do not know whether the Senator from Missouri wanted \nto be included in the time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I construe this as a question from my \ncolleague from Massachusetts. And I have said before that I would be \nwilling to enable the Senate to have the Senator speak and topics but \nthat I want to do it within this time limit, and if the Senator from \nMissouri wants to speak as well but only with the unanimous-consent \nagreement that my resumption on the floor not be counted as a second \nspeech.\n  Is the Senator asking a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield further, pending the \nagreement, which I hope would take place between the Senator from \nMinnesota and the Senator from Missouri, I would like to be able to ask \nconsent to speak for not more than 15 minutes, and at the time I finish \nthe Senator from Minnesota be recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I will \nnot object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I would like to just clarify where we are \nright now.\n  Only the Senator from Minnesota has the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. And only the Senator from Minnesota may make a \nunanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my colleagues at a minimum be allowed to \nspeak in testimonial to Senator Strom Thurmond and about Senator Strom \nThurmond as long as my resumption on the floor not be counted as a \nsecond speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Minnesota has the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, that is fine. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question? He can yield for \na question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield for a question in one moment.\n  Let me make it clear--and I will yield for a question in a moment--\nwhat has happened here. I just want my colleagues to know that I am out \nhere for very good reason. They would be out here if it were their \nStates. The Senator from North Dakota is going to join me.\n  But, Mr. President, I have been willing to ask unanimous consent that \nSenators who want to speak--at least, the Senator from Massachusetts \nwanted to cover something else as well--but at least speak about Strom \nThurmond be able to do so, who has served for so many decades in the \nSenate, and as long as my resumption on the floor not be counted as a \nsecond speech.\n  It is a reasonable unanimous consent. My colleague from my Missouri \nhas not agreed to do that. I just want Senators to understand what is \ngoing on here.\n  I am pleased to go on and speak. I just think it is a shame that \nSenators who want to speak at least about Senator Thurmond are not able \nto do so.\n  Mr. President, I will go on. I believe my colleague has a question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I just want to apologize, if the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield for a question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator would not share my regret to Senator \nThurmond for being unable to make these comments, I was unable to \nbecause of Senate business on the floor earlier\n\n[[Page S5232]]\n\ntoday and intended to make these comments this afternoon. I hope he \nwould understand that they are included in the Record, and I regret \nthat I am denied the opportunity to make them here on the floor. It is \na very unusual process of procedure in terms of senatorial courtesy. \nBut if that is the way that is going to be, so be it.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. President, let me continue.\n  Mr. President, let me now return for a while. We will get back to the \ndisaster relief. Let me now turn to S. 4. I will speak some about S. 4.\n  Mr. President, let me also say to Senator Thurmond, before I do so, \nthat I would like----\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I would like to call the Senate to order \nunder the Pastore rule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota will confine his \ndebate to the specific question pending before the Senate.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will be pleased to talk about S. 4, \nand will do so.\n  Mr. President, we have here what is called the Family Friendly \nWorkplace Act. Mr. President, in all due respect, it is hardly friendly \nto families.\n  Mr. President, as I have mentioned earlier, we have to approach \nlegislation sometime in the sense of history. There was once an \nexchange I had on the floor of the Senate with my colleague from \nMissouri where we talked about a song, ``Which Side Are You On?'' \nFlorence Reese actually wrote it. Florence Reese was a great troubadour \nfor working people and for unions, especially mine workers.\n  Mr. President, when we were able to pass the Fair Labor Standards Act \nin the 1930's, that was an enormous step forward for working people.\n  This piece of legislation, Mr. President, essentially wipes out \nalmost 60 years of people's history.\n  Mr. President, for those who are watching this debate, since we are \ngoing to talk about this bill for a while before we again talk about \ndisaster relief by the rules that I am now under, for those people that \nare watching this debate, one of the things that was most important \nabout the Fair Labor Standards Act was the idea of the 40-hour week. \nThe idea was that if you worked overtime you would get overtime pay.\n  Mr. President, I am speaking without notes. So I don't remember the \nexact figures. But I believe somewhere in the neighborhood of 60 \npercent of those households with incomes under $20,000 a year depend on \novertime pay.\n  So, Mr. President, one of the things which is a dear principle here \nis that there is no way as a Senator from Minnesota, which is a State \nthat believes in economic justice, that I am going to let any piece of \nlegislation, or at least to the best of my ability I am going to try to \nprevent it from overturning the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n  So, Mr. President, if you work overtime, you ought to get overtime \npay. That is a cherished principle. This piece of legislation wipes \nthat out. And it is called the Family Friendly Workplace Act?\n  Well, Mr. President, let me just make it clear that if you have a \nsituation where you now have a piece of legislation that says that if \npeople work 50 hours or 60 hours or even theoretically 70 hours a week, \nyes, they might only work 20 hours the next week under this \nlegislation, or 30 hours, or whatever but they don't get any time and a \nhalf off. So it becomes a pay cut.\n  That is what it is all about. This isn't the Family Friendly \nWorkplace Act. This is the Paycheck Cut Act.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I actually won't yield for a question right now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. So this piece of legislation, Mr. President, which is \nsupposed to be friendly to families establishes a new framework. It is \nnot the 40-hour week.\n  Second of all, you have a flextime provision which says that you work \novertime and then you can take some time off but it is hour for hour. \nYou don't get time and a half off.\n  Mr. President, that hardly represents a family friendly workplace.\n  Mr. President, I regret what I just said to my colleague. He asked me \nto yield for a question. I certainly will. I got caught up a little bit \nin sort of the, you know, kind of anger from a couple of minutes ago. I \nam not being at all gracious.\n  Mr. President, I will continue to speak, but if my colleague has a \nquestion, I think he did, I will be pleased to respond.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Did my colleague ask me to yield for a question?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I did ask him to yield for a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I ask the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. President, if he \nis aware of the fact that under the bill that the only way you can be \nworking more than 40 hours a week without overtime compensation is to \ndo so as a result of a voluntary agreement similar to the voluntary \nagreement which is entered into now by Federal employees with their \nemployers, whereby you can schedule a 40-hour week to average over a 2-\nweek period.\n  Such agreements, in the Federal system for example, provide the basis \nfor people to work 45 hours in the first week and 35 hours in the \nsecond week, and have every other Friday off. And absent that kind of \nvoluntary written agreement scheduled in advance, no one can be asked \nto work more than 40 hours in a week without being paid overtime.\n  As a matter of fact, absent a specific voluntary agreement, all \nwork--all work--is conducted under the bill as if it were conducted \nwithout the bill's existence; that only with voluntary agreements is \nthere any change in the way the bill is done. And the voluntary \nagreement regarding overtime work when it provides for more than 40 \nhours in 1 week is pursuant to the flexible schedule that is now \nallowed as a benefit for Federal employees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me respond to my colleague's \nquestion.\n  Let me first of all just say that I have spent enough time as a \ncommunity organizer, and I have spent enough time with working people, \nmany of whom are nonunion workplaces. One big difference, of course, is \nthat with Federal employees and public employees that a much larger \npercentage of the work force are unionized and that I know that what in \ntheory can look voluntary and look like a partnership isn't always the \ncase.\n  Whereas, in theory it would look like an employer couldn't say to an \nemployee, ``Look. You know, here is my proposition. I want you to work \n50 hours this week, and, yes, that is 10 hours overtime, but you get 30 \nhours off next week. That is what I want you to do.'' In theory, the \nemployee doesn't have to do it. But anybody who knows anything about \nthe reality of many people in terms of what they deal with at the \nworkplace knows that they don't exactly have a lot of power, and they \nare not exactly in a position to say no, especially when that job might \nbe the only job there and they have to put food on the table for their \nkids.\n  People put up with a lot.\n  Mr. President, lest anyone think that I am some sort of devoted to \nclass warfare, let me just examine the facts.\n  Last year the Department of Labor found violations of current \novertime law in 13,687 cases involving 170,000 workers. They awarded \nover $100 million in back pay. The Department's Wage and Hour Division \nhas a current backlog of approximately 40 percent of annual complaints.\n  In the garment industry, an investigatory survey conducted by the \nDepartment in Los Angeles last year revealed noncompliance with current \novertime law in 55 percent of our shops.\n  In our subcommittee we watched the videotape feature from CBS news \nwhich chronicled a ``Battle Against Overtime,'' apparently conducted \nsystematically by one of the country's largest supermarket chains. The \nnews item reported on the company's alleged practice of coercing \nemployees to perform work off the clock; that is, without any pay in \norder to avoid paying overtime.\n\n  Mr. President, these practices may not be the norm for most employers \nbut they do demonstrate the need to protect against a bill which will \nprovide employers with a tool which they could use to avoid paying \novertime.\n\n[[Page S5233]]\n\n  So I have no doubt that my colleague means exactly what he says. \nThere isn't anybody that believes anything other than that about it. He \nmeans what he says. But, what looks good in theory doesn't work in \npractice. That is the problem.\n  That is why, Mr. President, in the House of Representatives in the \npiece of legislation that they passed the only thing you have is the \ncomptime. With comptime you get an hour and a half off for the hour \nthat you worked overtime, or you get an hour and a half in pay.\n  That is why this piece of legislation has been called, even by some \nof the people in the House that supported that bill, too extreme. And \nit is. Because, Mr. President, what you are going to have here when you \ndo away with a 40-hour week and you get into this 80-hour-week \nframework is all sorts of potential for abuses of power.\n  Mr. President, if we didn't have the record that I just read to you \nabout some of the existing abuses, and the way in which there is forced \novertime right now, I wouldn't worry about it. But, Mr. President, that \nis the reality. That is the reality. That is one of the problems.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to yield for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator yields for a question.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. The Senator cites 13,000 cases that were resolved or \nfiled in the last year. It seems to me, that demonstrates that there is \nan enforcement mechanism in place, and that when there are abuses that \nare undertaken, either under the current law, which obviously isn't \nperfect, or else there wouldn't be any abuses, you know, I think that \nis really a wrong statement because you have abuses even under the best \nlaws. The key is whether you have enforcement. Given the fact that you \nhave enforcement and that you have double penalties under the law that \nhas been proposed so that you double the risk for the employer, given \nthe fact that the law talks about the fact that it shall be against the \nlaw to have either direct or indirect coercion or intimidation, and \ngiven the fact that when you define what coercion is in the bill, you \nfind out that it is to intimidate, threaten, coerce, includes promising \nto confer or conferring any benefit such as appointment, promotion or \ncompensation, or affecting or threatening to affect any reprisal such \nas deprivation of appointment, promotion or compensation, don't you \nthink that the measures in the bill provide a safeguard, and that if \nthere are violations they could be pursued just as aggressively under \nthe new framework, which is a framework that is already shared by the \nFederal Government employees? Could not the enforcement personnel also \nenforce this kind of law, especially with elevated penalties and the \nincreased description of coercion?\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, he raises a \ncouple of important questions and good questions. The fact that the law \ndoes not work so well now does not mean that we now make the existing \nlaw even weaker with the hope that somehow it will work better.\n  That is my first point. My second point, Mr. President, is that we \nhave a backlog. We have a significant backlog of cases, and my \nunderstanding is that another problem with the bill is that not only \ndoes the bill not exclude certain categories of workers, like people in \nthe garment industry that should be excluded given the existing record, \nbut you don't have the existing woman- and man-power enforcement. We \nare going to need more of that.\n  Third, I say to my colleague, I think what he is talking about would \nbe helpful especially if we wanted to pass a piece of legislation and \none of the areas where we would really have to toughen this up is we \nhave to make sure that there is not any discrimination here.\n  I talked about this earlier. What I was talking about earlier is what \nmany people as they now come to find out--at first I think people \nreally liked the bill when they first heard about it. They liked the \nbill because my colleague is on to something important and he is trying \nto do something I think important. And that is, people were saying \nlook, you know, if there is a way that we could have more flexibility \nand could be able to spend more time at home and we could have the \nflexibility to get the comptime and time-and-a-half off instead of \ntime-and-a-half wages, we would like to have that option.\n  But what people are deathly afraid of, and for good reason, is what's \ngoing to happen is that in the absence of some sort of protection here \nagainst discrimination, there is going to be no guarantee that all too \nmany employers are going to basically say, well, Senator Ashcroft and \nBrian Ahlberg and Paul Wellstone, there are three of you. Now, Brian \nAhlberg and Senator Ashcroft, you two folks, you want overtime work and \nyou are willing to take time-and-a-half off but not time-and-a-half \npay. We will give you the overtime work because, as an employer, as a \ncompany, I don't want to give you the time-and-a-half pay.\n  That is a huge problem. If we do not have some sort of a way in which \nwe can guarantee that you will not have that discrimination, then a \nwhole lot of families that are struggling to make ends meet may not be \nable to get that overtime pay that they depend upon.\n  So, Mr. President, let me just make it crystal clear that the bill's \npenalties right now for coercion do not cover the discrimination that \nwe are worried about. And I would just make it clear that one of the \nthings we might want to do is accept the Kennedy amendment which was \nturned down in committee that deals with discrimination.\n  The bill's penalties now apply to this kind of discrimination, and we \nare making progress. But, Mr. President, I am puzzled--I see my \ncolleague on his feet, and I am pleased to take another question if he \nhas one, but let me just say to my colleague that I am puzzled by the \ncurrent approach we are taking.\n  It doesn't trouble me because I am able to speak about what I think \nshould be the priority of this Congress, which is getting disaster \nrelief to people in communities in Minnesota and the Dakotas, and I \nwill be back on that at 5:20 or whenever I can, but I would say to my \ncolleague, I am puzzled with the approach taken here because this bill \nis not going to pass, and yet my colleague is really--I mean, the last \nthing I want to do is say something that is going to offend him. I \nmean, I will in terms of different debate, but I am not going to do it \npersonally, because he is for real. He believes in what he is doing.\n\n  It seems to me there is a way you could really get the flexibility \nfor the employees and you could really accomplish the goals of that, \nbut I do not get to say that because he is the author. He probably \nfeels he knows best. But I am telling you right now, if you do away \nwith the 40-hour week, you are not going to get the bill passed.\n  You have this 80-hour, 2-week framework which we do not have in the \nHouse--their bill is more moderate--you are not going to get this bill \npassed. You have the flextime where you only get 1 hour off for 1 hour \novertime, you are not going to get this bill passed. And if the \npenalties that my colleague talked about for coercion do not cover this \nkind of discrimination, then you are not going to get this bill passed.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. May I ask the Senator a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to yield for a question.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. May I ask the Senator, does he think the Senators on \nhis side of the aisle intend to offer amendments that we can begin to \nprocess providing the kind of relief to the private sector that people \nin the Government area have in terms of these flex benefits? We have \nflextime benefits. We have comptime benefits. Flexible time, in \nparticular, is available to governmental employees. In the 1996 survey \nconducted by the Census Bureau, only 6.6 percent of all hourly paid \nwomen, for example, got overtime pay in a typical work period, and if \nwe are only going to deal with comptime, we are dealing with a very, \nvery small number.\n  Now, when you talk about Federal Government employees and their \nability to have flexible working arrangements, we are talking about a \nbroad population, because flextime applies to those who do not normally \nget overtime work. Are there any--does the Senator know of any Senators \non his side of the aisle who will be offering amendments to get that \ndone?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, a couple of points I would like to make\n\n[[Page S5234]]\n\nto my colleague. The first one is, we will get to some of those \namendments. We filed amendments. But I have to say to my colleague that \nwe are not likely to get to those amendments until we pass a disaster \nrelief bill. So the first answer to his question is just that; I do not \nthink we are going to get to these amendments until we pass the \ndisaster relief bill.\n  The second point I would make to my colleague is that I will be very \ninterested in all of these figures. I do know that in, roughly \nspeaking, 60 percent of the cases of families with incomes under \n$20,000 a year, you have a worker who depends upon overtime pay. And \nwhether or not we are talking about women or men, it seems to me this \nis terribly important. Of women who work overtime, 38 percent of hourly \nworkers earning overtime pay are women--38 percent. And 11.6 million \nwomen work over 40 hours each week.\n  Let me repeat that--11.6 million women work over 40 hours each week. \nThis is 22 percent of the working women in this country. And 6.2 \nmillion women work over 48 hours each week. This is 12 percent of \nworking women. And 2.3 million women work over 59 hours each week. This \nis the 4 percent of working women. So let me just----\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield for a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Let me just make the point if I could, Mr. President, \nit is really quite astounding, and it says something very fundamental \nabout where we are in this debate. Thirty-eight percent of hourly \nworkers earning overtime pay are women; 11.6 million women work over 40 \nhours each week. This is 22 percent of working women.\n  Mr. President, this is not surprising. This is not surprising at all \nbecause we have got in our country--let me just make this clear. In our \ncountry we have a paradox. On the one hand, we have this affluence \nwhich we are grateful for, but on the other hand, we have many families \nwho are still unable to make a decent living and raise their children \nsuccessfully, and many women are working full-time and many women are \nworking overtime.\n\n  You have an alternative bill, if we wanted to have some give-and-take \ndiscussion, you have an alternative bill of Senator Baucus, Senator \nKerrey, and others which makes it clear that what we do is take in part \nwhat the Senator from Missouri has done, but we extend it and we say, \nlook, there are going to be penalties and we are going to have some \nprotection against discrimination so that an employer cannot say to a \nwoman who is working, or, for that matter, a man, look, we will give \nyou overtime if you take comptime but we will not give you overtime \npay.\n  That is unacceptable. It is just simply unacceptable. And, Mr. \nPresident, that is where we say, if you will, in the words of Florence \nReese, which side are you on? That is where we draw the line.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. May I answer that question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to take a question in one second. \nLet me just finish this. Let me just finish it real quickly.\n  I have to go back to this case of whose side are you on. We are on \nthe side of working families when we make it clear that the 40-hour \nweek is protected. And if you work overtime, you are entitled to time-\nand-a-half pay. We are on the side of working families when we make it \nclear that if you want to get some time off to be with your families \nand you have worked overtime, you should get time and a half. We are on \nthe side of working families when we have a piece of legislation that \nmakes it crystal clear that no employer can discriminate and put people \nin a position where the only kind of overtime work they are going to \nget is if it is your comptime and not overtime pay.\n  We are on the side of working families when we make it clear that for \nfamily and medical leave reasons, if you have banked your time and you \nhave 30 hours of banked time and now you have a child sick or you have \na parent that is ill, you can take that time off. You do not have to \nask for permission.\n  None of those features are in this legislation right now, and \ntherefore this legislation in its present form will go nowhere. And, \nyes, there will be amendments on the floor of the Senate, and, yes, \nthere will be efforts to improve this bill. But as long as I have the \nfloor, there are not going to be any amendments until we get to the \ndisaster relief bill.\n  Now, I am not going to be able to stay on the floor forever, but that \nis going to be the point.\n  Now, Mr. President, I want to make it clear I can only yield for \nquestions. So I cannot yield--I think the Senator mentioned he wanted \nto answer, he wanted to answer what I have said, and I would ask the \nChair, am I correct, the Senator--I think he may have meant it \ndifferently. The Senator said I would like to answer the question. Am I \ncorrect I can't let the Senator answer any question; I can only yield \nto a question? So, Mr. President, I would be pleased only to yield for \na question from my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. Does the Senator from \nMissouri have a question?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Yes, I do. I will try to phrase this in the form of a \nquestion. When the Senator from Minnesota asks whose side am I on, he \nindicated that 38 percent of the hourly workers, overtime pay workers \nwere women. That really means that 62 percent are men. Almost twice as \nmany men in the equation are overtime workers as are women and that \nreally does not talk about the number of women generally who are \nworkers that rely on overtime or have the chance to get overtime.\n  My question is, for the vast majority of workers that do not get \novertime at all, and especially for women who are outranked about 2 to \n1 by men in terms of the privilege of getting overtime, setting all \nthose aside, you are doing something for the people who get overtime, \nand it is true that your proposal addresses those people and there are \ntwo men in that group for every woman in that group. That is what your \nown statistics basically show. So you are doing something for mostly \nmen who get overtime. But for the people who do not get overtime and \nstill have sick kids and still have families that have trouble and \nstill need to have flexibility in their workplace, what are you \nproposing for those individuals? And are there going to be amendments \nto this legislation that propose to do something to give them \nflexibility?\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Let me just respond to my colleague in two different \nways.\n  First of all, a pay cut where people are no longer able to get \novertime pay or may be put in a position that they do not get overtime, \ntime off for overtime worked doesn't help anyone. It does not help \nworking women. It does not help working men. And it does not help \nworking families. It is, if you will, elementary.\n  Second of all, as a matter of fact, if you look at the alternative--\nthis is what puzzled me about my colleague here. If you look at the \nalternative that is being presented by Senators Baucus and Kerrey and \nother Democrats, and I would assume there would be Republican support, \nas a matter of fact, that is exactly what we are talking about, which \nis what you have in this alternative. You have comptime--that is what \nit is about. It does not abolish the 40-hour week. It does not amount \nto a pay cut. It is time-and-a-half off for every hour you have worked \novertime. It provides the protection against the discrimination so \nemployers are not able to only give overtime to people who take \ncomptime as opposed to people who need the overtime pay. It makes sure \nthat you get the flexibility that we say the employees want.\n  That is part of it. The other part of it is, in all due respect to \nsome of the employers in our country, not all of them --there are, of \ncourse, many great employers--the fact is--and in the subcommittee we \nheard testimony to this effect.\n  The fact of the matter is, right now there are all sorts of \nopportunities for flexibility. You don't have to overturn the Fair \nLabor Standards Act. People can work 4 10-hour days and then take a \nFriday off or a Monday off; they can work 9-hour days and work half a \nday Friday or take every other Friday off; people can come in at 7 and \nleave at 3; they can come in at 10 and leave at 6. There are employers \nright now that provide employees with that flexibility.\n  The real problem is that a lot of employers don't give employees that \nflexibility. So, all of a sudden I become a\n\n[[Page S5235]]\n\nlittle skeptical, as a Senator from Minnesota, where we put a real \nvalue on economic justice and work and families, when the very people \nwho do not give the employees the flexibility they could right now, \ncome in and testify to the need for this bill. I remember we had \ntestimony from a representative of the National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses saying, ``Look, we need to do this because we \ncan't afford to pay overtime.'' All of a sudden I am saying to myself, \n``My gosh, this is not family friendly. This is going to lead to the \nfunctional equivalent of pay cuts. This is not about giving people the \nchoice and flexibility they need.''\n  Mr. President, we had an amendment in subcommittee. It was turned \ndown. It's part of the alternative. It works like this: If you bank \ncomptime and, for example, you have 20 hours that you have earned, it's \nyour time. Now, if you have to go to your child's school, if you need \nto go visit with the principal or a teacher, or you need to take care \nof a family member, you can use your accumulated comptime to get that \ntime off. We could do that. Then we would have real employee \nflexibility.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to yield for \nthe Chair to make an appointment and that I not lose my right to the \nfloor and that my resumption on the floor not be counted as a second \nspeech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/03/senate-section/article/S5220-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5235]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       APPOINTMENT OF CONFEREES--SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 84\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Minnesota has the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I see that I have another 15 minutes to \nspeak about this legislation before being able to focus my attention on \nmy major priority here today, which is the need to get disaster relief \nto the people in Minnesota and the Dakotas and other States, who \ndeserve our help.\n  Mr. President, let me read a letter that I think is extremely \nimportant as we go through and debate this piece of legislation.\n\n       Dear Senator Lott and Senator Daschle: The undersigned \n     national organizations represent many of the working women of \n     today. We believe passage of S. 4, the Family Friendly \n     Workplace Act, fails to offer real flexibility to the working \n     women it purports to help while offering a substantial \n     windfall to employers. We urge you to delay consideration \n     until a real solution can be found which truly meets the \n     needs of working women and families. Nearly half of the work \n     force is women and the number of women working multiple jobs \n     has increased more than four fold in the last 20 years. S. 4 \n     would affect hourly workers, and most hourly workers are \n     women. The majority of minimum wage workers are women. Many \n     of these women depend on overtime pay. Many of them want more \n     control of their schedules, not less. Without strong \n     protections for workers, the comptime bill will cut women's \n     options and women's pay. For example--\n\n  And I will just read slowly.\n\n       Someone pressured into taking comp time when she really \n     wants or needs overtime pay is taking an involuntary pay cut;\n\n  Let me repeat that. That's an argument I have been making. These \norganizations which I will list in a moment are right on the mark:\n\n       Someone pressured to taking comp time when she really wants \n     or needs overtime pay is taking an involuntary pay cut[.]\n\n  So, again I would say, when it comes to the enforcement machinery, \nyou have to deal with this whole issue.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to yield in just one moment. I will \nfinish reading the letter and I will be pleased to yield:\n\n       . . . supporters argue that S. 4 is voluntary and employees \n     have a ``choice,'' yet working women who have for decades \n     faced subtle (and not-so-subtle) forms of discrimination are \n     all too familiar with the potential consequences of not going \n     along with the employers' wishes: isolation, intimidation and \n     retaliation; and\n       . . . because employees do not control when or if they can \n     use their comp time, they are essentially being asked to \n     gamble on the chance that they will be able to take time when \n     it is as valuable to them as overtime pay.\n\n  This is pretty important because my understanding, with Federal \nemployees get to make that choice. That is a big difference here:\n\n       . . . because employees do not control when or if they can \n     use their comptime they are essentially being asked to gamble \n     on the chance that they will be able to take time when it is \n     as valuable to them as overtime pay.\n\n  This is my point again. We had an amendment which would improve this \nbill. We could pass this bill which says: Look, you bank that time. \nIt's your time. It's your earned compensation. If you have compelling \nreasons that you need that time off, sickness of child, sickness of \nparent--you know, what's in the Family and Medical Leave Act--you \nshould be able to take the time off. You should not have to ask the \nemployer. It's your time:\n\n       S. 4 must be defeated. Women want flexibility in the \n     workplace, but not at the risk of jeopardizing their overtime \n     pay or the well-established 40 hour work week.\n       Sincerely, 9 to 5, National Association of Working Women, \n     American Nurses Association, Business and Professional Women, \n     National Council of Jewish Women, National Women's Law \n     Center, Women's Legal Defense Fund.\n\n  Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.\n  I might also add there is a coalition of 180 national civil rights, \nreligious and working women's organizations which oppose this \nlegislation: League of Women Voters, National Women's Political Caucus, \nNational Women's Law Center, American Association of University Women, \nNational Organization for Women, Women's Legal Defense Fund, National \nCounsel of Senior Citizens, NAACP, National Urban League, National \nCouncil of La Raza, Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, Union \nof American Hebrew Congregations, Southern Christian Leadership \nConference, National Council of Churches.\n  Mr. President, in addition, and then I will yield for a question, a \ncouple of other organizations: Mechanical Contractors Association of \nAmerica, Incorporated, National Electrical Contractors Association, \nSheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors' National Association, \nAFL-CIO, American Nurses Association, National Education Association, \nAmerican Federation of Teachers, Union of Needle Industry and Textile \nEmployees, Service Employees International Union, Communications \nWorkers of America, United Steelworkers of America, Communications \nWorkers of America, United Auto Workers, the International Association \nof Machinists, Laborers' International Union of North America, United \nBrotherhood of Carpenters, International Brotherhood of Teamsters, \nInternational Association of Bridge, Structural and Ornamental Iron \nWorkers, American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.\n  Mr. President, you know, it has become fashionable to do all this \nbashing of unions, but I have to say this. As a matter of fact, above \nand beyond all these women's organizations, unions really in the last \nhalf of the century-plus have been the only institutions which have \nconsistently represented the bottom half of the population, those \npeople who do not own all the capital and do not own the big \ncorporations and depend on the wages and depend on being able to get \novertime when they work overtime, and depend upon being able to bring \nin the resources to support families. It would seem to me, if this was \nsuch a great deal for working families and for working women, the very \norganizations which represent women and so many working people in this \ncountry would be all for it. Yet, you have major opposition.\n  So, I will be pleased to yield for a question, if the Senator has a \nquestion. But otherwise I will continue to make the case that this \nlegislation, in its present form, is going nowhere. I am sorry for \nthat, because my colleague has worked hard on it. But this legislation, \nit really violates some very cherished principles that have to do with\n\n[[Page S5236]]\n\nfairness in the workplace: Decent wages, overtime wages for overtime \nwork, and giving employees--employees--employees the flexibility. This \nlegislation does not do that, Mr. President.\n  Now, Mr. President, since I have not been asked to yield for a \nquestion----\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask the Senator if he would yield for \na question? He had indicated earlier he would. If he still is of a mind \nto yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am sorry, I am being careful about keeping the \nfloor. I will be pleased to yield for a question.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I ask if the Senator from Minnesota is aware that the \nlaw would be enforced as it is written and not as it its characterized \nin that letter? I do not have any doubt that people could oppose the \nlaw as it is represented in that letter that was written by all the \nlabor unions. The letter says that a person who takes comptime forever \nloses their right to the money. That is just simply wrong.\n  The law provides, not only do you have a choice about whether you \nwant comptime, whether you want to be paid time and a half--and that is \na clear choice and it is a choice that is to be made without any \ncoercion, indirect or direct, or intimidation indirect or direct, or \nthreatening--but, even after you have made that decision the law \nprovides, not the letter but the law provides you can change your mind \nand decide to cash out your benefits. So, if you want the money you \nhave the ability to say I am just going to take the money.\n  So, my view is I wondered if the Senator were aware of those kinds of \nthings?\n  Second, if I could ask a second question, I wonder if the Senator is \naware that there have been a group of people come to the floor over the \nlast several hours who have come to me with amendments, some of which \nare specifically directed toward points of concern raised by the \nSenator, but that the Senator is unable to consider them as long as the \nSenator from Minnesota continues to monopolize the floor and to say \nthat no one else will have a chance to work constructively on the bill?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me respond to my colleague's second \nquestion first.\n  I am very well aware of the fact that Senators may want to come to \nthe floor with amendments and I have said a number of times, and my \ncolleague has been here during this long afternoon, I apologize for the \ninconvenience, but, quite frankly, right now my focus is not on whether \nor not some Senators can bring some amendments to this bill.\n  My focus is on men, women, and children back in Minnesota, in \ncommunities, many of whom have been flooded out of their homes, have \nbeen devastated, many of whom have supported one another, have loved \none another. And right now they have been waiting and waiting and \nwaiting, and waiting, and the House of Representatives went into recess \nand did not pass a disaster relief bill.\n  A disaster is a disaster. And an emergency supplemental is an \nemergency supplemental. So I am going to continue to be on the floor \nand I am going to continue to speak. If that means that the Senate \ncannot conduct business as usual, then I say to my colleague, that is \nthe way it should be. Because, quite frankly, at this moment, at this \npoint in time, my one priority is to fight like heck for people back in \nthe State.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I actually will not yield for a \nquestion right now because I want to respond to the first question \nfirst.\n  Mr. President, I will just say to my colleague--and I put him at a \ndisadvantage because I have the floor right now--that based upon my \nknowledge of him, and I do not know his as well as I would like to, I \nthink he would be doing the same thing.\n  There comes a point in time when you do not have any other choice. \nYou have to use your language. You have to be out there fighting for \npeople in your State.\n  We tried to appeal, I say to my colleague, in answering this \nquestion, we tried to appeal to common sense. That did not work. We \ntried to appeal to the goodness of people. That did not work. We tried \nto appeal on the basis of ``we have supported you when your States have \nbeen hit with these disasters and please support us.'' That did not \nwork.\n  The leadership in the House, if you can call it leadership, did \nsomething which is unconscionable. They just went into recess. It was \ninsensitive. And now I come back and people are still waiting. We do \nnot even know whether they are going to do it this week.\n  So I say to my colleague, yes, if it means I am inconveniencing \ncolleagues, Republicans or Democrats, I am sorry, but this is what I am \ngoing to do. And, you know, I will be here for a while and I will stay \nat this all week and next week if I have to, as well. I am going to \nfight for people in Minnesota. No apologies.\n  By the way, it does not matter to me whether or not the people who \nwere flooded out of the homes were Republicans or Democrats or \nIndependents or none of the above. They are entitled to some \nassistance, and they are entitled to it now. This Senate is not going \nto be conducting business as usual until we get our priorities \nstraight.\n  In response to the first question, I guess this is an honest \ndisagreement. I mean, this letter says that someone could be pressured \ninto taking comptime when she really wants or needs overtime pay. That \nis what I have been talking about. I believe they are right.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. There is a second choice.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. But, Mr. President, the fact of the matter is that it \nis only in theory. My colleague has constructed this theory, and it is \na theory that employees have a choice. I have organized with people at \nworkplaces. I have worked with people who are working under conditions \nthat I sometimes say to them, ``Look, you are going to lose your \nhearing. Or, you're breathing in substances that are going to take \nyears of your life.'' They said, ``We have no choice. This is the only \njob we can find.'' People do not always have the choice. It is not an \nequal power relationship; that is not the world of the workplace.\n  And even if my colleague was right--and I wish he was and this theory \nwould turn out to be true and it would be the reality--why not, if you \nwant a piece of legislation, why not err on the side of caution? Why \nnot have a clear provision as in the alternative by Senators Baucus and \nKerrey and Landrieu? Why not have clear protection against that \ndiscrimination?\n\n  The second thing is, you can say that employees are protected from \ncoercion, but it is not clear that that protects them from the \ndiscrimination.\n  Mr. President, the third point is whether or not people will be able \nto take their accumulated comptime and use it when they need to. And we \ndo not have any guarantee of that in this legislation.\n  So, Mr. President, I think that the women's organizations and labor \norganizations that have written their letters and said, look, this is \nnot going to help working people, are right on the mark.\n  Mr. President, I also want to cover for a moment the differences \nbetween the Federal workers program and S. 4. Let me just go over some \nthings. Federal employees--I will read for a moment--have job \nprotections that private sector workers do not. Federal workers are \ncovered by civil service rules requiring good cause for discharge or \ndiscipline. Private employees typically are at-will employees, who an \nemployer can fire or discipline for any reason or no reason. As long as \nwe are talking about parity, maybe we ought to turn this around.\n  Mr. President, I would be pleased to go back to this debate later on. \nBut now I want to focus on what I think is the most important priority \nfor this Congress, and that is to get disaster relief to people in my \nState and to other States where people have been affected by the \nfloods.\n  I would like one more time to say, I am sorry. I mean, I apologize to \nmy colleague from Missouri, and I apologize to other colleagues for the \ninconvenience. But I have promised myself that I would do everything I \ncould do. And I think maybe by speaking on the floor and holding the \nfloor, I can get attention to this unfinished business, that I can put \nsome pressure on people here--I am just being very honest about it--and \nI can just fight. This is the way you fight.\n\n[[Page S5237]]\n\n  I hope, I say to my colleagues, that this disaster relief bill is put \non the fast track and that people will get the work done. I want to be \nreal clear that this has been, up until the last couple days before the \nMemorial Day recess, the opposite of sour. It was bipartisan. Thank \nyou. I mean, thank you, Republicans; thank you, Democrats. We worked \ntogether. We put together a really good package. Senator Stevens was \nvery sensitive and very committed to what we were saying and went out \nof his way to help. The majority leader, Senator Lott, was helping us. \nI do not believe that the House of Representatives being unwilling to \ndeal with this, instead going home, was what the majority leader \nwanted. But this is the deck of cards that we have been dealt.\n  At this point in time, it is really a moral outrage. I am going to \nstay at this until the Congress does the right thing for the people in \nMinnesota, the people in the Dakotas.\n  This is an article written by Nick Coleman, Tim Nelson, and Brian \nBonner, who are staff writers for the Pioneer Press. This will give \ncolleagues a feel for why I am out here. This was written on Saturday, \nApril 19, 1997:\n\n       The river won.\n       The Red River of the North overwhelmed months of massive \n     efforts to keep it at bay Friday, bursting over, around and \n     through the dikes of Grand Forks and East Grand Forks, Minn., \n     surging down evacuated streets and rapidly drowning hundreds \n     of homes.\n       Air raid sirens on both sides of the bloated river wailed \n     ominously all day and night as first one dike, then another \n     succumbed to the river, which in a few short hours made a \n     mockery of the effort to contain it.\n       Late last night, Grand Forks Mayor Pat Owens interrupted \n     local TV programming to urge the entire city of 50,000 people \n     to voluntarily evacuate their homes and businesses and \n     prepare for possible forced evacuation.\n       With the Red on the rise last night to a predicted crest of \n     54 feet--a full 25 feet above flood stage--the overmatched \n     dike sagged like the sides of a child's sandcastle at the \n     beach.\n       By the end of the day, several abandoned neighborhoods were \n     swamped in roof-high water. After darkness fell, the \n     situation appeared critical: Water had begun to seep up \n     through downtown sewers, and the city's emergency operation \n     center was forced to move from downtown to the outlying \n     University of North Dakota.\n       On the Minnesota side, most of East Grand Forks was under \n     order to evacuate and 400 additional National Guardsmen were \n     on the way to aid the city of 8,000.\n\n  And I say to my colleagues, I was there the day that people from East \nGrand Forks evacuated. And the people, they were like refugees. People \nwere dazed.\n\n       Normally divided by the Red River, the two cities found \n     themselves joined in misery by a spreading river that knows \n     no borders. At nightfall, the last bridge linking them was \n     nearly submerged.\n\n  A should have said earlier also that one of the amazing things was \nthe way in which--and this would be the same thing in Missouri or \nKansas--people from the adjoining towns took people into their homes. \nIt was amazing. People showed up. Even towns with all the rivalry where \nthe high schools were always in big football games against one another, \nand people hardly had a good thing to say about one another, partly out \nof rivalry, people just welcomed their neighbors. That was the goodness \nof people.\n  That is what is so frustrating. People have done it right. They have \ndone exactly what they are supposed to do. They have showed a real \nsense of community. This Congress has showed no sense of community. \nPeople back in Grand Forks and East Grand Forks and Warren and Ada, you \nname it, and other communities, they have shown a real sense of \ngoodness. We have not.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would yield for a question in just a moment.\n  Mr. President, I want to continue to read this article first.\n\n       On the Minnesota side, most of East Grand Forks was under \n     order to evacuate--\n\n  Mr. President, I will yield for a question, but just for a question.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. A point of clarification: Is the Senator aware that the \nU.S. Senate passed a supplemental appropriations measure that would \ncarry the relief? I think the Senator is aware of that. And when the \nSenator says this Congress has been irresponsible, I wonder if he means \nwhat the Senate did was irresponsible when it passed that kind of \nrelief or----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. First of all, Mr. President, I made it crystal clear \ntoday that the House----\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Well----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will say to my colleague, I have the floor. I made \nit clear, Mr. President, that I cannot believe that the House of \nRepresentatives went into recess. But it is also true--and I have \nthanked colleagues in the Senate for their work--but I am telling you, \nsomebody has got to make it clear, and our colleagues from the Dakotas \nfeel just as strongly, and they have made it clear, that business as \nusual is not going to go on. We will use our leverage as Senators.\n  It is also true, however, that even on the Senate side, on the \nmajority side, I am sorry to say, there is the idea that you should \nattach extraneous measures to the disaster bill. That is not \nacceptable. That was in the Senate bill.\n  All this discussion about a CR, good people back in our States do not \nunderstand what in the world people are doing playing games. That is \nwhy I talk about this Congress.\n  Now, Mr. President, Let me go on.\n\n       Normally divided by the Red River, the two cities found \n     themselves joined in misery by a spreading river that knows \n     no borders. At nightfall, the last bridge linking them was \n     nearly submerged.\n       Soon after that, the National Weather Service issued an \n     ominous assessment, raising the crest forecast by a foot. \n     ``This situation is unlike any flooding conditions ever \n     experienced in eastern North Dakota and northwest \n     Minnesota.'' Confounded by the effects of overland flooding \n     and a rapid melt, it was the fifth time in five days that the \n     Weather Service had revised the crest forecast.\n       It didn't take an official bulletin to inform Grand Forks \n     residents they were in deep trouble.\n\n  What was so sad about this, I had visited several times earlier and \npeople did everything they could. There were high school kids out there \nsandbagging. It was a great community effort. People were working day \nand night. They started very early on. We knew we had a lot of snow. \nPeople were worried about this. They did everything they could to get \nready for this.\n\n       It didn't take an official bulletin to inform Grand Fork \n     residents they were in deep trouble.\n       The scene in the deserted Lincoln Park area of Grand Forks \n     Friday afternoon was one of almost eerie splendor, with the \n     sound of rushing streams of water drowning out all other \n     noises except the whumping of Coast Guard helicopters \n     overhead and the sirens. If it weren't for the fact that \n     hundreds of homes were being devastated while their helpless \n     owners waited out the flood in safety, you would think you \n     were on the banks of an untamed northern river.\n       And you'd be right.\n       Millions of sandbags, millions of dollars, hundreds of \n     thousands of hours and months of planning were not enough. \n     Bolstered by a rise in the Red Lake River, which flows into \n     the Red at East Grand Forks, as well as by unprecedented \n     overland flooding to the south--upstream on the north-flowing \n     river, the Red surpassed all expectations and its dikes with \n     an ease that was awe-inspiring to witness.\n       Water spilling over the dike several blocks to the south \n     was rushing knee-high along Lanark Avenue, then cascading \n     down a block-long stretch of pavement that has been \n     transformed into a foaming spillway.\n       A few blocks away, the surging river poured over a 12-foot-\n     high dike on Lincoln Drive, roaring like a waterfall and \n     threatening to burst, unleashing the massive amount of flood \n     water that had been held back by the dikes until yesterday.\n       Fireplace logs, plastic snowmen, sofa cushions, and chunks \n     of ice drifted past in the rapid current, sweeping past \n     stacks of sandbags, shovels and piles of sand. ``We're sad \n     about our city and what's happening,'' Grand Forks Mayor Pat \n     Owens said tearfully. ``It is very devastating to all of us. \n     If I were to say one thing to the people of Grand Forks it \n     would be keep the faith and we will make it through.''\n       Under a bright spring sky, with lovely cumulus clouds on \n     the horizon and birds singing nesting songs, Grand Forks was \n     receiving the pent-up wrath of a winter of record cold and \n     snow. Temperatures soared into the low 60's for the first \n     time in April and residents of Grand Forks dressed in short \n     sleeves as they turned out by the thousands in one last-ditch \n     effort to hold some of the dikes.\n       All nonessential businesses were asked to close and to \n     steer their employees towards the front lines. Cars, pickups \n     and National Guard trucks raced up and down the muddy streets \n     of Grand Forks, giving the city the look of a wartime \n     capital.\n       The scene in a packed McDonald's restaurant on South \n     Washington Street seemed right out of a disaster movie. A \n     woman, her sweatshirt caked with mud, sobbed as she embraced \n     a friend and told him that her house in the Riverside Park \n     area of the town was inundated.\n       Other muddy-booted patrons stood in line for a hot meal \n     while, in the background, a\n\n[[Page S5238]]\n\n     TV emergency channel blared the latest warnings.\n       ``Riverside, Central Park, Lincoln Park areas, please leave \n     at once,'' the message said. ``Critical areas at this time \n     are the Olson Drive and Elmwood Drive areas. Take with you \n     medication, pillow, blankets, immediate clothing needs.''\n       Evacuation at dawn.\n       Evacuations along the Red River started before dawn: at \n     5:45 a.m., the City of Grand Forks sounded emergency sirens--\n     even though almost 1,000 people in the lowest area of the \n     city had left their homes hours before.\n       Authorities did, however, have to clear out a nursing home, \n     relocating 106 elderly residents to the library of an \n     elementary school a few blocks away.\n       All told, 2,000 residents of nearly 800 homes along the \n     river in Grand Forks had been ordered to leave after the \n     river starting pouring over the dike south of downtown.\n       By 10 a.m. the water was running knee deep in the streets, \n     and by evening, it was lapping against the windowsills of a \n     handful of the lowest homes.\n       Officials estimated that more than 4,000 people--nearly 10 \n     percent of this city's 50,000 residents--would have to find \n     shelter elsewhere Friday night, and even more were moving \n     away from an expected break in the city's Riverside dike. At \n     9 p.m., officials ordered the southern end of downtown Grand \n     Forks to evacuate. A few hours later, the mayor made an \n     appeal for everyone in the city to leave.\n       The Minnesota side.\n       On the other side of the river, East Grand Forks authority \n     sent police cars through streets before dawn, exhorting the \n     city's 9,000 residents to wake up and go immediately to the \n     city's sandbagging facility to start filling bags.\n       The levees on the Minnesota side of the Red River started \n     giving way Friday morning, prompting frantic sandbagging in \n     the city's Point neighborhood. It had been cut off after the \n     Red Lake River--a tributary that is one half of the area's \n     famed forks--turned out of its channel and started running \n     overland.\n       Gary Sanders, a consulting engineer who works for East \n     Grand Forks, Minn., estimated that as many as a third of that \n     city's homes might have to be evacuated. He and other \n     officials spent much of the day struggling to stem the \n     breaches in the city's dikes, hoping that massive pumps might \n     be able to drain the area of the city along the river.\n       A sandbagging operation in East Grand Forks turned into a \n     crisis at midafternoon Friday, when part of a dike holding \n     back the Red Lake River gave way. It sent water gushing \n     through a neighborhood just south of the Louis A. Murray \n     Bridge.\n       Dozens of emergency crews with heavy machinery rushed first \n     to repair the breach and then to evacuate dozens of residents \n     from their homes. Polk County Sheriff Douglas Qualley \n     eyeballed Murray Bridge and expressed concern about whether \n     it would hold.\n       There was reason for concern.\n       ``We had just got done shoring up on the west side of the \n     bridge,'' said [a volunteer]. ``We went to take a break, and \n     all of a sudden it just started coming in.''\n\n  Mr. President, that was another impressive thing. Not only the high \nschool students, but the ways in which all of the students--university, \ncollege, vo-tech, community college students--were out there \nvolunteering. It is just incredible the way in which the worst of times \ncan bring out the best in people. Sometimes I wish it would not take \nthe worst in times. I wish we would all be like that all the time. But \nthe students were great, really a great help.\n\n       Within 20 minutes, the southern section of the bridge was \n     submerged and water--sometimes settling to depths of five \n     feet--rushed south down Third Avenue Southeast.\n       Jim Maughton, an Army National Guardsman working on the \n     bridge, said water gushed at ``10,000 gallons a minute'' at \n     its peak.\n       Vince and Sue Taylor, carrying a couple of plastic bags, \n     trudged along with their two children.\n  Mr. President, that gives you a feel for some of what was happening. \nThis is Sunday, April 20, 1997.\n\n       A city was sinking in the night.\n       Occasional bursts of eerie blue light in the black sky \n     signaled the demise of electrical transformers.\n       Water boiled up from the sewers, spurting in fountains that \n     were quickly submerged in rising water as the river sought to \n     equalize itself on both sides of failing dikes.\n       Downtown Grand Forks was going under. Dikes were giving way \n     along both sides of the Red River of the North.\n       Like some proud ocean liner fatally damaged by an iceberg, \n     Grant Forks was dead in the water, filling up fast. And there \n     was not a thing anyone could do but leave.\n       Everywhere, between the warble of the sirens, emergency \n     vehicles splashed through the streets, blaring warnings over \n     loudspeakers. ``All residents are ordered to evacuate this \n     area. Get out now!''\n       Signs in dorm windows at the University of North Dakota \n     said, ``Build the ark.'' But arks weren't necessary in the \n     darkness separating Friday from Saturday, struggle from \n     catastrophe, hope from despair.\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I only yield for a question, I do not \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield only for a question.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Senator for yielding for a question with \nthe understanding he retains the floor after the question is asked.\n  Both the House and Senate passed the emergency supplemental \nappropriations bills. Conferees have been appointed by both of the \nHouses, but the conferees must report out a conference report which \nmust go to the House of Representatives first for passage before \nultimately the Senate gets a chance to act on it.\n  Now the Senator, by expressing his concern in such a lengthy way--\nover concern, obviously, for individuals for whom we have great \nsympathy--the Senator blocks the Senate from doing its business even \nthough the Senate cannot act on the emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill at this point in time.\n  Is the Senator aware of the fact that we are being kept from doing \nour business which is appropriate for us to do and that it is now \nimpossible for us to act on a matter of greatest concern to him?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague that actually the conference \ncommittee is meeting to do their work right now and that goes on right \nnow. Believe me you, when the conference committee finishes its work \nand we get this piece of legislation, then we will move on it right \naway and I will not be on the floor then. I think my colleague confuses \nmatters a little bit in the terms of the sequence of all of this.\n  I remind my colleague one more time that the only reason--we should \nnot be ahistoric. We only have to go to the question, why am I on the \nfloor now? The only reason I am on the floor is because after all the \nwork that we did in a bipartisan way to get help to people who really \nneeded some certainty that they would receive some assistance, the \nHouse of Representatives' leadership decided not to do the work. They \ndid not agree to let through what we do not disagree on. They did not \ndo their work, and they went on vacation.\n  Now we are back here and I am on the floor of the Senate today, you \nbet, to signal to colleagues in the House and my colleagues here, let's \nget it done and get this bill out and stop playing games.\n  As to the inconvenience, toward my colleagues on other legislation \nwhich is important, I am really sorry, but in all due respect I do not \nthink there is anybody here that is as inconvenienced by my holding the \nfloor for a little bit of time today as are the people of Minnesota and \nthe Dakotas. They are in the ones inconvenienced. They were \ninconvenienced by the House leadership refusing to do the work and just \ngoing on vacation. They have been inconvenienced by the games that \npeople have played with this, attaching amendments dealing with a \ncontinuing resolution. People do not know a thing about continuing \nresolutions in Grand Forks or East Grant Forks nor should they have to.\n\n  They have been inconvenienced by other amendments that have been put \non this bill.\n  I refer back to the St. Paul Pioneer Press editorial, in which the \nargument was made that it was important to stop playing games.\n  Mr. President, people are not stupid. People are intelligent. They \nknow full well when they see Representatives or Senators using their \npain as leverage. They know what is going on.\n  So, Mr. President, I again read an editorial. Believe me, there are \nplenty of editorials like this in papers in our States.\n\n       Congress can't resist political gamesmanship.\n       Congress has breezed out of town, leaving Washington for a \n     long holiday recess. Despite evidence to the contrary, \n     congressional bigwigs figured satisfying their political egos \n     was more important than expediting flood relief legislation \n     that would aid, among other backwaters, Minnesota and the \n     Dakotas.\n\n  So, Mr. President, let me just be crystal clear about what is going \non here. I come to the floor today to focus on priorities. And the \npriority should be simple. The priority for the House of\n\n[[Page S5239]]\n\nRepresentatives and the Senate, for the conference committee, for our \nCongress this week, should be to pass a disaster relief bill. And I am \ngoing to make it very difficult for people to conduct business as usual \nuntil we do that. I think the Chair would do the same thing if it was \nKansas. I really do. I am sorry to speak for the Chair. I know he can't \nspeak. But I really think that it doesn't have a heck of a lot to do \nwith party. It just has a lot to do with you just do what you can do to \nfight the people, and this is the way for me to do it.\n  Mr. President, since I have spoken a lot about what has not happened \nso far and what needs to happen, let me talk a little bit about \nBreckenridge. I have not spoken much about Breckenridge, MN.\n\n       In the dark, water lapped up the streets, moving as \n     inexorably as the hands on a clock.\n\n  This is a piece, again, in the Pioneer Press by Nick Coleman.\n\n       Breckenridge was going under; the flood had outflanked the \n     city's dikes.\n       In the worst flooding so far this season, hundreds of homes \n     and businesses on the south side of Breckenridge were caught \n     by a rapidly rising second flood crest that took the city \n     off-guard and quickly became more devastating than the first \n     wave of flooding that hit 10 days ago.\n       Bleary-eyed city officials, assisted by bone-tired troops \n     from the Minnesota Army National Guard, evacuated 400 \n     residents Monday night and Tuesday, trying desperately to \n     keep the city of 3,700 from going completely under.\n\n  Mr. President, I would really like to thank the National Guard. I \nhave not done that today. They have done a great job. It is incredible.\n  So many people back in Minnesota and the Dakotas have done a great \njob, and we have done such a miserable job here. I am not delaying \ndisaster relief. My colleagues are delaying disaster relief. And as \nsoon as the supplemental bill is ready to bring before the Senate, \nbring it before the Senate. Believe me, I will not stand in its way. \nThis is entirely in the hands of my colleagues. It is entirely in the \nhands of my colleagues what happens. And I intend to be on this floor \nfor some period of time to make it crystal clear that I am not going to \nbe silent until we do the right thing here. It is that simple.\n  I ought to add that tomorrow evening the flood Senators will come to \nthe floor and speak from 6 p.m. until 6 a.m. on the need for disaster \nassistance. I will get a chance to speak at 6 p.m. until 9 p.m. Do you \nknow that 3 hours isn't enough time? I mean, there isn't enough time to \ntry and make the case to my colleagues to do the right thing and please \nget the help to people.\n\n       By Tuesday evening, parts of south Breckenridge were under \n     5 or more feet of water and the floodwaters continued to \n     swell. The water was so deep that when a 5-ton Army truck \n     veered off the curb, a National Guardsman was shoulder deep \n     in the driver's seat, craning his neck to keep his chin above \n     water and reaching down to the submerged gears to drive it \n     out. An exhaust stack kept if from stalling.\n       Residents dumped loads of dirt near a railroad line that \n     cuts across town, hoping to stop the flood halfway through \n     the city.\n       But officials worried the flood would encircle them from \n     the north. Efforts to sandbag around a nursing home failed \n     after a night of effort.\n       Dorothy Pierce, 77, came out of her house on the strong \n     back of a 19-year-old National Guard trooper named Conrad \n     Anderson, a specialist with the Duluth-based Co. C of the \n     434th Main Supply Battalion. Anderson ferried Pierce from her \n     house on Second Street through the darkness in hip-high water \n     to the safety of a Guard truck.\n       ``I just moved here from Nebraska in November,'' Pierce \n     said while sitting uncomfortably on a canvas tarp in the back \n     of the truck as it made its bumpy way back to high ground. \n     ``We don't do stuff like this in Nebraska. I got here just in \n     time for the biggest blizzard I ever saw and the only flood I \n     ever saw.''\n       Evacuated with Pierce was her son, Lonnie, his wife, \n     Debbie, and the couple's three young children, Jena, 8, \n     Donald, 6, and Dillon, 2. The children, sitting on the floor \n     and clutching their mom, could be heard crying in the pitch-\n     black covered troop carrier as it drove through the flood.\n       Mama, I'm scared and I'm cold and it's dark,'' Jena said to \n     Debbie Pierce. ``There's nothing to be scared of,'' Debbie \n     Pierce reassured her children, hugging them tight. ``We're \n     all safe.''\n       But under a hazy half moon and in a biting chill, \n     Breckenridge was on red alert.\n       Crews of sandbaggers labored through the night Monday in a \n     vain attempt to stave off the wandering Bois de Sioux River, \n     which jumped its banks and went overland, creeping into the \n     city from the unprotected southeastern side.\n       Everywhere, diesel engines throbbed as dump trucks carrying \n     sand, flatbed trucks carrying as many as 50 volunteer \n     sandbaggers and National Guard trucks on midnight mercy \n     missions roared up and down the streets and slogged into the \n     rising tide.\n       But the situation was critical, the weather nasty and the \n     outcome in doubt.\n       ``We face a real possibility of the whole town going \n     under,'' police Chief Dennis Milbrandt told the National \n     Guard's Col. Gary Sigfrinius Tuesday morning as crews \n     prepared to construct a makeshift dirt dike along the \n     railroad tracks that separate the city's north and south \n     sides.\n       Nearby, three 5-ton Army trucks slowly splashed through \n     cab-high waters on Fifth Street, carrying 41 elderly \n     residents of a senior citizens apartment building that was \n     being evacuated as water poured into the first floor.\n       Reaching the still-dry railroad tracks, the gray-haired \n     evacuees, clutching suitcases and wearing blankets to ward \n     off the 30-degree temperatures and 7-degree wind chill, were \n     helped off by teen-age Guard troops.\n       ``I never thought I'd have to be fed by the Red Cross,'' \n     said 79-year-old Margaret Olson as she was lifted in her \n     wheelchair from the back of an Army truck. ``I've had three \n     strokes and colon cancer but this is something very different \n     and I'm happy to be on dry ground again.''\n       Lonnie Pierce, Breckenridge's utility director, said the \n     rapid rise of the floodwaters had inundated both his family's \n     home and his mother's home. After hours of battling with sump \n     pumps and sandbags to try to save their homes, the Pierces \n     had been forced to make a choice: Save the family or save the \n     house.\n       ``It came in awful quick here, awful high,'' said Pierce, \n     36. ``Christ Almighty, we'll lose a lot of houses,'' he said, \n     peering out the back of the truck as it chugged slowly past \n     the silent, flooded homes of his neighbors, pushing a gentle \n     wake through the black waters that lapped against the houses.\n       ``There's just no end to this. We haven't gotten one break. \n     All this water was out there and we couldn't do anything \n     about it. It was bound to come.''\n       Located where two swollen rivers--the Bois de Sioux and the \n     Otter Tail--join to form the Red River of the North, \n     Breckenridge picked a poor campsite.\n       Forecasters thought the Red River's record crest of 19.18 \n     feet at Breckenridge last week was as high as if was going to \n     get. But the river was at 19.10 and rising at midday Tuesday, \n     with officials fearing it could pass 20 feet.\n       The first round of flooding damaged the city's north side, \n     as the Otter Tail River overflowed. This time, it is the Bois \n     de Sioux cascading into ``South Breck,'' as residents here \n     call the south side of the city.\n\n  I am going to go on, Mr. President, and read just for the Chair. I \nhave been speaking this afternoon about a couple of different issues. \nBut most of the time I have been focusing on the need to get disaster \nrelief to my home. I again apologize to my colleagues who have not been \nable to bring amendments to the floor and to those who came and maybe \ndidn't want to hear one speaker speak all day. But this is just an \nimpossible situation.\n  I mean we have had people that have been flooded out of their homes. \nAlmost everybody in East Grand Forks had to leave. We have schools and \nhospitals destroyed in towns like Ada, and people have done everything \nright. They have supported one another. And we are supposed to get some \nrelief to them. Instead, people have been playing political games in \nthe House of Representatives. Rather than getting the work done, they \nwent on vacation. They went on recess. They didn't even have the \ndecency to provide the assistance to people.\n  Now we are back in conference committee, and people are playing \ngames.\n  So I am using my leverage as a Senator to be out here and to say we \nare not going to have business as usual for a while, and I am going to \nfight for people in my State. That is why I am out here reading about \nthis flooding.\n\n       This flooding is much more severe than the first and the \n     potential is worse yet: Breckenridge is looking down a three-\n     barreled gun, with the possibility that the Red, the Bois de \n     Sioux and the Otter Tail may meet in the middle of town.\n       ``This whole year has just sucked,'' said Beth Meyer, a 35-\n     year-old hairstylist who rode a National Guard truck into her \n     flooded Seventh Street home after midnight to help evaluate \n     her 10-year-old daughter, Samantha, and the family poodle, \n     Whitney Houston.\n       Meyer's husband, Mark, and 13-year-old son, Kyle, remained \n     behind, sandbagging and pumping to try to save the house.\n       In January, the roof caved in on the salon where Meyer \n     works in Wahpeton, ND, across the Red River from \n     Breckenridge. For the past three weeks, the Meyers and other \n     South Breck residents have gone without phone service and \n     been forced to go to an emergency phone bank outside the \n     Wilkin County Courthouse, which itself was closed by \n     floodwaters Tuesday.\n       The National Guard has taken over the school where the \n     Meyer children already\n\n[[Page S5240]]\n\n     have missed four weeks due to blizzards and flooding. And \n     since the first flood crest hit the city 10 days ago, the \n     family has not been able to flush its toilets. If they needed \n     to relieve themselves, cans were required.\n       Wearing a heavy Army jacket lent to her by a trooper, Beth \n     Meyer maintained an exasperated sense of humor about the \n     never-ending battle.\n       ``We call this the Year from Hell,'' Meyer said as she \n     gathered up her daughter in the dark.\n       ``We're the South Breck Islanders. We're already talking \n     about the party we're going to have this summer, if it ever \n     dries out. We're all going to get together for an island \n     party and we're going to have a little rubber pool in the \n     middle of the street. With a sump pump in it.''\n       ``This is very scary stuff,'' said Scott Wermerskirchen, a \n     35-year-old science teacher who was helping out at a \n     barricade Monday night. ``I don't want to think about what \n     will happen if we get an inch of rain. We might as well write \n     a big check and shut the town down.''\n       Although Breckenridge was continuing the fight, there was a \n     palpable edge of discouragement in the chilly air Monday \n     night and Tuesday morning, with the mood of the residents \n     deflating with each increase in the water level.\n       ``We got up this morning thinking we didn't have anything \n     to worry about,'' said Kirk Peterson as he navigated in a \n     fishing boat through the 5 feet of water in his back yard at \n     2 a.m. Tuesday.\n       The floodwater was almost up to the top of his garage door \n     and was running through the first floor of the house where he \n     and his wife, Jackie, live on Second Street.\n       ``So much for finished oak floors,'' Peterson said acidly, \n     using a flashlight to peer through the window in to his \n     darkened home.\n       Peterson, a salesman, and his wife are ``River Rats,'' \n     meaning they belong to a Department of Natural Resources \n     program designed to preserve and clean up state rivers. With \n     his flashlight, Peterson illuminated a sign in his flooded \n     window: ``Please Keep the River Clean,'' it said.\n       Peterson and a friend, Errow Hensch, maneuvered their boat \n     to a clothes pole in the back yard. Monday morning, when he \n     first measured the rising waters, 11 inches of the pole were \n     under water. By 8 p.m., 51 inches were under. And at 2 a.m. \n     Tuesday, as his boat bumped against passing ice chunks and \n     the strangely orange moon glittered off the water, the tide \n     had risen to an even 5 feet.\n       ``I hate to say it, but I wonder whether this whole city \n     won't really go under,'' Peterson said as he steered the boat \n     to help rescue a neighbor, Dave Shockley. ``If we were smart, \n     we would all have moved out in February.''\n\n  Mr. President, as it turns out, Breckenridge was hit hard with \nflooding but not totally flooded out, and people are rebuilding and \npeople are celebrating. Yes, they are celebrating the help that they \ngave one another. And I say to the Chair, because I know of his own \nsmall business background and his commitment to small business, it was \nin Breckenridge that I really first got a feel for what the small \nbusiness people were thinking about. They took me to their businesses \nwhich had just been destroyed by the flooding, and they said to me, \nlook, Paul, or Senator, we are hearing about the Federal Emergency \nManagement assistance, and we know they can do some repair for the \ninfrastructure in the town, and then we are hearing about the Small \nBusiness Administration loans, but we can't cash-flow loans. It will \nnot do us any good at all.\n  So all of us in a bipartisan effort got together, and we put together \na good disaster relief bill with about $500 million in CDBG money for \nall the States affected. But this CDBG money was going to give the \nStates, Mr. President, the flexibility to get some direct grant money \nto some of the businesses, and homeowners who needed it who could not \ncash-flow any more loans.\n  And that is what people are still waiting on. People do not know \nwhether or not they are part of a buyout if they are living in a \nfloodplain. People wonder, do we leave or do we stay? If we leave, are \nwe going to have assistance? Is that coming? The State cannot make \nplans to do that. The cities cannot make plans to do that. The small \nbusinesses are still waiting. People are getting discouraged, and \npeople are getting pretty angry. Frankly, they are probably angry at \nall of us. They are probably angry at all of us except for some of my \ncolleagues from North Dakota, who have just been out here over and over \nagain, and South Dakota and some of the other States; they have been \nspeaking out.\n  But people just cannot understand the code here. They cannot figure \nit out. I think what people are thinking is, look, it is simple--in \nfact, it is a little embarrassing to me because after we passed that \ndisaster relief bill, I was so excited I did what I think the Senator \nfrom Wyoming would do. I got on the phone and had a conference call \nwith lots of the small papers in smaller communities--big communities \nand big papers in heart--and I said we have passed this; it really \nlooks good. And then, all of a sudden, all of a sudden now we have the \ngames being played and people are thinking, well, we have leverage on \nthis. We want to have leverage later on on the budget and on the \nappropriations bills so we have to have a continuing resolution.\n  You can do that separately. Do it on something else. Just do not play \naround with the lives of people who are really in a lot of pain.\n  Now, as I said earlier, if I cannot persuade people to just please \nback off of that for now, then get the work done right now and pass \nthis bill and get it to the President. The President is going to veto \nit. He already said he was because of the continuing resolution. So the \nPresident will veto it. He has to do that. And then you can show that \nthe President vetoed it and maybe you have embarrassed him, if that is \nwhat you are trying to do, and then let us pass it clean. Let us get \nall the provisions off this bill that do not have anything to do with \nmaking sure that people can rebuild their lives in Minnesota and the \nDakotas.\n  That is all people are asking. So if you want to play your game, play \nit. I do not think you should, but if you want to play your game, play \nit, but why don't you play it in the next couple days. Because I will \ntell you something, if not, at least on the Senate side, whenever I \nhave an opportunity to be out here and hold the floor, I am going to do \nit and we are not going to do a lot; we are not going to do much else. \nI put the people from East Grant Forks right now ahead of my colleagues \nin the Senate. I just think that Mayor Stauss and Mayor Owens and other \nmayors have waited too long. So whatever we need to do, whatever I need \nto do as a Senator, I am going to do.\n  Mr. President, this is another piece. And there has been some really \ngood writing because the journalists that were covering this, they saw \nthe pain. They knew what it was in personal terms. They saw the courage \nof people. They saw the devastation, but they saw just that incredible \ndetermination.\n\n  But for some reason here in Washington, DC, starting with that \n``leadership'' in the House--I say leadership in quotes; we never \ntranslate it into personal terms--the leadership in the House decided \nto go on vacation. It is not what the majority leader of the Senate \nwanted them to do. It is not what my colleagues here wanted them to do, \nbut that is what they did.\n  That is why I am in the Chamber. And now I am reading that we may not \npass this this week. That is just outrageous. So, Mr. President, just \nso my colleagues know, I probably will maybe stay in the Chamber for \nabout another 50 minutes or so, up to about 7 o'clock, and then I think \nI will have had time to talk about this today, and I will come back \ntomorrow and figure out a way of getting in the Chamber again, if I \ncan.\n  By the way, Mr. President, I really should also mention that--I \nmentioned FEMA, James Lee Witt. I also wish to thank SBA, the Small \nBusiness Administration. What I said about some of the businesses that \nare worrying about cash-flowing more loans is true. But SBA, they have \nbeen on the ground. They have tried to help. The State people have been \nmarvelous. The State office, Jim Franklin at emergency management \nassistance, that office has been great. Legislators have cared. The \nGovernor has cared. Really, in our States, we are just forgetting the \nparty part, trying to help people. And I want to just make it clear \nthat a lot of people deserve a lot of thanks.\n  So, Mr. President, I will continue to talk about this. I want to make \nnote of the fact that Senator Dorgan had come down to the floor \nearlier, and he is right now tied up in a meeting on the disaster \nconference report. They are in conference, meeting on it, getting ready \nfor it, and that is going to be key. We are going to need Senator \nDorgan's help. But I would just say to members of the committee, thank \nyou for your commitment. The good news is we worked together in a \nbipartisan way and we had something good going and people really \nappreciated it and we\n\n[[Page S5241]]\n\ndid exactly what we are supposed to do: provide people with some \nrelief.\n  The bad news is then people started playing games, and then people \ndecided not to even finish their work and had the insensitivity and the \ngall to just go home, go home. It is amazing to me how some people can \nbe so generous with the suffering of others. Can you imagine a group of \nlegislators--and now, I say to my colleague from Missouri, I am \nspeaking specifically about leadership in the House--saying, oh, well, \nyou know, we got these disagreements and we can't get our work done. We \ncan't resolve this. So they go home. That is being very generous with \nthe suffering of a whole lot of people in the country, including people \nin Minnesota.\n  Well, Mr. President, we can have all of these arguments about what is \nin the pipeline, what is not in the pipeline. We heard from Mr. Raines \ntoday from the Office of Management and Budget that a lot of this, a \nlot of this money is not going to get out there to the communities.\n  I talked earlier about buyouts in construction. I told you Minnesota \nis a cold-weather State. We have to get the work done now because come \nmid-October or the end of October, we are not going to have time to do \nthis at all. So one more time I would say to my colleagues, some of \nwhom have been inconvenienced today, I apologize, but, in all due \nrespect, the problem of time is a bigger problem for the people in \nMinnesota and North Dakota because time is certainly not on their side.\n  Think about this. There was a piece that I read earlier about the \nlittle girl who just sort of had a vacant look in her eyes and was \nreally looking down and not playing like you hope and pray a child \nwould play. We know what has happened. Just imagine, I say to people, \nwhat it would be like to be completely wiped out with a flood and no \nlonger have your home and be homeless and then people in other towns \ntake you in. That is Minnesota. But I bet you it is every State. I love \nto brag about Minnesota, but I bet it is in every State. The goodness \nof people comes out and people take families in and all the rest. But \nit is hard for families because you go back, now the water has receded, \nnow you have to go back to your homes and now you have to look at this \ndevastation and there it is before you. And you do not know what is \ngoing to happen next.\n\n  If you have lived in the floodplain, are you now going to move? If \nyou haven't, are you going to have the money to rebuild your home? And \nyou are just there and you do not know where you stand. And you hear \nthat the Federal Government is going to help.\n  You better believe that over the years when my colleagues have come \nto the floor from Missouri or from California or from Florida and they \nhave said we need help, there has not even been any question in my \nmind.\n  Well, that is the situation right now. The only question is, where is \nthe soul of the Congress. I say to my colleague from Missouri, where is \nthe soul of the leadership of the House of Representatives, who do not \neven get the work done and send back a bill to us. Well, this time, \nthis week there is going to be a conference committee and they are \ngoing to do the work. I feel they will do the work. I believe my \ncolleagues will spearhead that. We are going to get this done. And as I \nsaid before, the best of all worlds will be, please, just keep all the \nextraneous political stuff off. Let's just pass a clean disaster relief \nbill and get the money out there to people, get the help out there to \npeople.\n\n  Mr. President, let me just read about Chip Rankin. I started to talk \nabout him.\n\n       [He] looked tired in his National Guard fatigues, stood in \n     the pulpit of the Immanuel Lutheran Church on Sunday, reading \n     aloud from the Gospel of St. Luke, [this is from the Pioneer \n     Press of April 14] recounting how the apostles, frightened by \n     a storm on the Sea of Galilee, wake Jesus from a nap and beg \n     him to rebuke the raging waves.\n       An hour later, the 22-year-old wrestler--\n\n  Mr. President, did you hear that? Wrestler. Now we're really talking.\n\n       At the University of Minnesota-Duluth would find himself in \n     troubled waters.\n\n  By the way, Mr. President, while I am speaking about wrestling, the \nUniversity of Minnesota-Duluth had their wrestling program shut down. \nIt was a real shame. The title IX program is a great program. I mean, \nas a father of a daughter who loves athletics and is a good athlete, \nand having one granddaughter, the idea of full participation of girls \nand women in athletics is right on the mark. But the shame of it is, in \na lot of these schools, in order to reach parity, what they do is go \nafter the minor men's sports, the sports that don't have the clout. \nIt's a political issue, I say to my colleagues. The University of \nMinnesota lost their wrestling program. A real shame.\n  Mr. President, I am not without my biases, since I wrestled and love \nwrestling. I do think it is a real shame. There has to be some way to \nmake sure this doesn't happen around the country. It is so unfair, \ngymnastics, swimming, other minor sports--who gets to define what's a \nminor sport? Baseball.\n\n       Rankin and a Guard sergeant were caught in a frightening \n     torrent of water that threatened to wash his 2\\1/2\\-ton troop \n     truck off a Norman County highway and into a forbidding sea \n     of ice and water. Rankin's truck lurched and sagged, plunging \n     into holes that were rapidly forming in the crumbling highway \n     while a Hovercraft and men with ropes stood by in case they \n     had to attempt a desperate rescue in the icy current.\n       God, and the National Guard, would come through. But it was \n     close.\n       To some, it might sound like just another day on the Red \n     River of the North, this spring of record flood. But it \n     wasn't just another day. It was the Lord's day. A day when \n     the weary people of Hendrum--those who haven't fled the \n     flood--paused in their struggle against the water that \n     surrounds them on three sides to worship in an extraordinary \n     ecumenical service.\n\n  This was written by Nick Coleman. ``Faith and the flood. It was a \ntime of prayer, reflection and drama as Sunday came to the Red River of \nthe North.''\n\n       You knew it was going to be a different kind of service \n     when you saw Rankin line up a dozen troops and march them, \n     single file, into the church, reminding them to doff their \n     camouflage caps. This wasn't a ho-hum Sunday go-to-meeting \n     with everyone freshly scrubbed and in their Sunday best. This \n     was a battlefield prayer meeting, with the enemy on the \n     horizon and coming on fast.\n       It was a ``come-as-you-are'' service where the pastor \n     sported a week's worth of grizzled whiskers and refused to \n     take an offering because, he said, the people in the pews had \n     been offering all week and giving all they could give. A \n     service in a church where people have been sleeping in the \n     basement and the congregants had mud on their boots and \n     exhaustion on their faces. Where men and women wept without \n     shame. Where some folks had to scoot out during the sermon to \n     check on the pumps keeping the waters at bay. Where \n     helicopters chattered overhead and where everyone looked at \n     each other when the lights flickered, it being only a couple \n     of days since the town got its power restored. Where the \n     mayor read from Genesis about ``the spirit of God hovering \n     above the waters,'' and the police chief's daughter sang, \n     ``Yes, Jesus Loves Me.'' And where the psalm they chose for \n     the day, Psalm 46, praised ``a river whose streams make \n     glad the city of God.''\n       The Red River isn't in the Bible. But it has taken on \n     Biblical proportions. And, for generations, through flood and \n     drought, blizzard and blight, the response of the people \n     along the river, many of them the descendants of devout \n     Norwegian Lutherans, has been to roll up their sleeves and to \n     put their trust in their God. Praise the Lord and pass the \n     sandbags. Or, as they simply say in Hendrum, ``toss 'em.''\n       That was the tone at Immanuel Lutheran. . ..\n\n  Mr. President, I notice that my colleague from North Dakota is here. \nI would be pleased to yield for some questions, if my colleague has \nsome questions. And then, if my colleague, who I know has been out here \nover and over again and back in North Dakota, wants to speak, then I \nwould at that point in time--I would then ask consent to yield. But \nright now let me just ask my colleague whether he has any questions and \nrespond to some questions. Then we will see what kind of unanimous-\nconsent agreement we can get.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator hasn't yielded the floor, he \nhas the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I have not yielded the floor.\n  Mr. President, I was getting ready to yield to my colleague. He \nlooked like he was raising his hand to ask a question. So, if he had a \nquestion, I was going to yield for the question, that's all.\n\n[[Page S5242]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes. Understanding that I don't have the floor, I am \nsimply asking the Senator from Minnesota some questions--without his \nyielding his right to the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has the floor and \nhas the right to yield for a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Has the Senator from Minnesota yielded for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I haven't yielded for the question yet. \nI yield for the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed with his question.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator from Minnesota has been here speaking about \nwhat we confront in North Dakota and Minnesota and South Dakota and the \nother disaster States. I would just ask him if he was aware of the \nrecent editorial that appeared in the Grand Forks Herald on May 27? The \nbold headline in that editorial was, ``4 Days Since Congress Let Us \nDown.'' And they posed the question, ``How Long Will It Be Before \nCongress Gets to Work and Passes the Disaster Relief Bill?''\n  This is an editorial in the Grand Forks Herald. Grand Forks is the \ntown that has been devastated by this remarkable series of disasters--\nfirst of all the most severe winter in our history, 10 feet of snow, \nfollowed by an incredible ice and snowstorm in early April that knocked \ndown the electrical grid for 80,000 people, which was then followed by \nthe 500-year flood and, in the midst of that, a fire that burned down \nnearly three city blocks in the city of Grand Forks that led, this \ncombination of events, to the evacuation of virtually the entire city \nof 50,000 people. Mr. President, 50,000 people evacuated. We have not \nhad that happen in America. That has not happened in American history \nwhere a town that large is virtually totally evacuated. And the \nneighboring town of East Grand Forks, that is in Senator Wellstone's \nhome State, a city of 9,000, similarly evacuated--completely evacuated.\n  In this editorial, I am asking Senator Wellstone if he is aware of \nthis editorial, this gives ``11 Reasons To Pass Federal Disaster Bill \nNow.''\n\n  We have heard a lot of talk from some, ``Well, it doesn't matter that \nthere has been this debate, it doesn't matter that they have had 12 \ndays of delay; there is money in the pipeline.''\n  There is not money in the pipeline for the Housing Department for \nbuyouts and relocations. There is no money in that pipeline. There is \nno money in the Agriculture Department pipeline to give some relief to \nthe ranchers across the State of North Dakota and across the State of \nSouth Dakota that have lost over 200,000 head of cattle. There is no \nmoney in that pipeline. And there is no money in the pipeline to allow \nthe school districts that have taken the kids from the disaster areas \nto get reimbursed. There is no money in that pipeline. That is what is \nhappening out in the State of North Dakota and the State of Minnesota \nand the State of South Dakota.\n  I ask the Senator from Minnesota if he is aware of the 11 reasons \nthat were given in the Grand Forks editorial for the passage of the \ndisaster bill now? The 11 points that they make in this editorial are:\n  No. 1, the need is great; 80 percent of the homes in that town of \n50,000 people were damaged and several thousand are unlivable. We have \nthousands of people who are homeless, don't have a place to stay. We \nhave hundreds and hundreds of people who are still on cots 6 weeks \nafter the disaster.\n  No. 2, they point out that the disaster is different from others \nbecause it affected the entire community and there is no nearby \ncommunity that can provide housing and other support for flood victims.\n  The third point they make is that time is of the essence. Our \nconstruction season is short. In fact, the outdoor work pretty much has \nto be done by October 1 in our part of the country.\n  The fourth point they make is that hundreds of businesses need loans \nand other forms of assistance to get reestablished, and that those \nbusinesses underpin the economy in Grand Forks and East Grand Forks.\n  Fifth, they make the point that they need to make decisions about our \nhomes and businesses. In order to do that, they need certainty about \nthe resources available for disaster relief efforts.\n  The sixth point they make is the property, in the way of flood \ncontrol, will have to be bought out. The buyout money will make it \npossible for people in the way of flood control works to rebuild their \nlives elsewhere in the city.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I raise a point of order. It is my \nunderstanding the Senator from Minnesota yielded for a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I still have the floor, and I intend to \nanswer the question of my colleague.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator from North Dakota is posing a question to the \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is entitled to one \nwarning. It is to be a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, if I might just inquire, I intend to \nanswer the question. But the question embodies the eight reasons, and \nthe Senator from North Dakota is going over those, asking me if I am \naware of those reasons. I can't read that chart.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is understood, but the Chair will rule \nthat a statement is being made rather than a question asked.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Fine. Mr. President, if my colleague, then, in the \nform of a question could summarize that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the duty of the Senator from Minnesota \nto guard his right to the floor. That is one warning.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to make clear I was not aware of \nthe editorial and the Senator from North Dakota--well, I was aware of \nthe editorial. I can't lie. I was aware of the editorial. Nevertheless, \nI need to answer, but I can't read it from here. I would like to \nrespond to the question of the Senator.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would pose a question, a point of order to the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Minnesota yield for a \npoint of order?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask----\n  Mr. CONRAD. Perhaps I could ask that later and just continue my \nquestion of the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Was the Senator aware of this editorial in the Grand Forks Herald and \nthe 11 reasons they gave?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I was aware of the editorial, but I do \nnot remember all of the reasons. And as I go on and speak, it might \nhelp me if the Senator would be able to pose each of those points as a \nquestion, and then we could talk about it as I go forward.\n  I would be pleased to yield to the Senator for a question on each of \nthose points, if the Senator has a question, but only in the form of a \nquestion.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me ask the Senator from Minnesota, very specifically, \nit has been reported in the press that this does not matter, this \ndelay, that there is money in the pipeline. And in this editorial, they \npoint out that it is true that FEMA is adequately funded, but that \nmoney is for immediate disaster relief, not for long-term rebuilding.\n  Was the Senator aware of that point that is in this editorial?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am. It is a very important point. I \nsay to my colleague from North Dakota that the key thing--and both \nefforts are equally important--that people need the short-term relief, \nbut people need to think about how they rebuild their lives and whether \nthey have a future. And that is what is so unconscionable about this \ndelay and the House going on vacation before getting this work done.\n  I would say that to my colleague.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Is the Senator aware-- again, I am asking a question--is \nthe Senator aware that in this disaster supplemental is the money for \nhousing assistance through the CDBG program that would allow the funds \nfor the buyout and relocation of homes that are in the floodway?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I respond to my colleague that this is \nalso an important point. The buyout of the homes in the floodway is key \nto the future for people. And the only way this can be done is through \nthe CDBG money that is being held up right now.\n  And I say to my colleague from North Dakota, who knows this so well, \nthat the awful thing is that so many people do not know where they \nstand. They do not know whether to move, not to move, where they are \ngoing to\n\n[[Page S5243]]\n\nhave a home. They do not know where they are going to be, where their \nchildren are going to be? People have been through enough, I would say \nto my colleague.\n  Why do we want to heap more pain on the people who have already been \nthrough so much pain? That is what is unforgivable about this delay. \nThat is what is unforgivable about political games. That is what is \nunforgivable about our failure to just get the relief to people, to get \nthis emergency supplemental bill passed. It is an emergency. Just get \nthe disaster relief to the people.\n  Mr. CONRAD. In addition to the question of the housing not being \navailable, is the Senator aware of the fact----\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to call the Senate to \norder.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask for recognition. The Senator from \nMinnesota yielded the floor without yielding for a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I yielded for a question. I made it \ncrystal clear it was a question. The Senator from North Dakota asked me \nwhether I was aware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is what I have done. And I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not have the right to solicit \na question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from North Dakota, if my \ncolleague has a question, we will put it in the form of a question.\n  Mr. President, I will, in any case, just to save my colleague from \nMissouri some frustration--I am going to yield the floor in just a \nmoment. I am going to finish up. I am going to respond to some \nquestions that my colleague from North Dakota has put to me. And I will \nyield to questions from the Senator from North Dakota only for \nquestions, but I intend to finish in just a few moments, I say to my \ncolleague. I will be yielding the floor in about 5 minutes or so.\n\n  I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think it has been made abundantly clear the Senator is \nyielding to me for a question, not yielding his right to the floor.\n  The question I would pose is----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinction here is whether the Senator \nhas the right to solicit questions or whether the Senator has to ask to \nyield for a question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I will keep speaking.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask the Senator from Minnesota to yield for the \npurposes of my posing a question to him.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I yield for a question from the Senator \nfrom North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Is the Senator aware that not only does the Housing \nDepartment not have funds that are in the pipeline, but then in \naddition to that that the Agriculture Department does not have funds in \nthe pipeline, so livestock producers in our States, who have lost \nhundreds of thousands of head of cattle, have been in a situation in \nwhich they are delayed in receiving assistance that is in this disaster \nsupplemental?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senator from \nNorth Dakota has posed that question to me because I have been remiss \nin not focusing on livestock producers. The importance of funding that \nis not in the pipeline has everything in the world to do with whether \nour ranchers and producers are going to be able to get back on their \nfeet.\n  So I say to the Senator, yes, I am aware of it. That is yet another \nexample of families in our States--agricultural producers, who work so \nhard and are waiting for some help.\n  And I say to the Senator from North Dakota, earlier I quoted him \nbecause I heard the Senator say, the question is, how many more days do \npeople have to wait? How many more days do the homeowners have to wait? \nHow many more days do the small businesses have to wait? How many more \ndays do ranchers, livestock producers have to wait? So I am aware of \nthat.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for a further question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will be pleased to yield for a question from the \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Is the Senator also aware in the Grand Forks editorial, \nthe 11 reasons they give for passing the Federal disaster bill now, \nthey point out that not only the Housing Department does not have \nfunds, those funds are not in the pipeline, the Agriculture Department \ndoes not have funds to address this disaster, those funds are not in \nthe pipeline, and in addition to that, the school districts that have \ntaken the children from the disaster areas, they do not have funds in \nthe pipeline, and so those school districts that have taken on \nsubstantial additional costs are also being delayed in being \ncompensated even though they have taken children from the disaster \nareas?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to respond to the questions \nbecause this is exactly what is going on. The Senator is raising these \nquestions, and I am responding. And I thank my colleague from North \nDakota, Senator Conrad, because this is again another area that I \nreally did not speak about and I should have.\n  It has been wonderful to see different school districts, a \nneighboring school district taking students and making sure they do not \nhave to drop out of school, making sure they can graduate. That has \nbeen happening in Minnesota and North Dakota. That is the goodness in \npeople.\n  I do not see much goodness in this Congress right now. I do not see \nmuch goodness in the House. I think we make a mistake when we go on \nvacation and do not come through for people.\n\n  I am aware of the fact that these schools are now waiting for some \nassistance for the extra costs that they have incurred in taking in \nother students and making sure those students graduate. And so I say to \nmy colleague, I am aware of this, but I am glad he has emphasized this \nin the question that he has put to me.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Would the Senator further yield for a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to yield for a question.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Is the Senator aware that while some have said that it \njust does not make a difference, these delays are inconsequential, they \nreally do not matter, that the people that I think we can turn to for \nthe best answer as to whether these delays matter are the people who \nare affected most directly by the disaster, the people of Grand Forks, \nthe people of East Grand Forks, and that they are telling us, their \nelected Representatives, that these delays do matter, that delay in the \nface of disaster is a disaster in and of itself?\n  Is the Senator receiving those same kinds of messages from his \nconstituents as I am receiving from mine with respect to how \nsignificant these delays are?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Well, Mr. President, the Senator from North Dakota \nraises a very important question that I will respond to. And the \nquestion that he raises has to do with the effect of the delay both in \na material sense in terms of economic resources but also in almost as \nserious a way, the way in which it erodes people's--it is personal-- \nPeople need some certainty. People need to be able to plan for the \nfuture. People need to get through this.\n  This is a very difficult time. And our failure to act does not give \npeople that confidence, does not give people that support. Moreover, I \nsay to all my colleagues, in responding to the question from the \nSenator from North Dakota, the failure to act, the failure to get help \nto people, the playing of political games, has done an awful lot of \nharm. It has soured people and eroded people's confidence. That is a \nterrible mistake.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleague from North Dakota that I am \nabout ready to yield the floor in any case.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Would the Senator yield for a final question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will yield for a final question.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator from Minnesota perhaps is aware that tomorrow \na group will be coming from Grand Forks and East Grand Forks, a \ndelegation of community leaders and business leaders. I think, perhaps \nthe mayor of East Grand Forks is coming. I ask the Senator from \nMinnesota if he is aware of that?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The message, as I understand it, is that they want to \nsend a\n\n[[Page S5244]]\n\nclear and unmistakable signal to the Congress and to the country that \nthe time to act is now.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am aware of the fact, and I will \nanswer this question, I am painfully aware of the fact, as a Senator \nfrom Minnesota, that the mayors from Grand Forks, ND, and East Grand \nForks, MN, and maybe some other mayors will be here tomorrow to say to \nthe Congress, the time to act is now. And that is what I have tried to \ndo today on the floor of the Senate, to say that as well.\n  That is what the Senator from North Dakota has said today and has \nbeen saying for a good, long period of time.\n  Mr. President, I hope that by holding the floor for a while this \nafternoon that in a small but hopefully significant way I have been \nable to speak for and to fight for and to help people in my State.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to return to Senate bill 4. Senate bill \n4, as you well know, is the Family Friendly Workplace Act. It was to \nhave been the business of the Senate this afternoon. And I do \nunderstand the frustration of the individuals from the flood-ravaged \nStates who have been victims of flooding and all. But I find it very \ndifficult to understand why, especially when a conference report is \nbeing worked on, we have to insist that the Senate cease serving the \nNation while the conference committee serves the people of the flood-\nravaged areas. It seems to me that while we can do both, it would be in \nour best interest so to do.\n\n  And so with all respect to my colleagues who have sought to galvanize \nthe public attention on the need to act here, I want to commend the \nmembers of the conference committee who are working to do exactly what \nthey are being called upon to do to provide an opportunity for relief \nin those areas.\n  The Family Friendly Workplace Act is a way that we can help all \nAmericans. We can help all Americans to balance the tension that exists \nbetween the workplace and the home place. We can help Americans who \nfind that both parents are having to work in two-parent families. We \ncan make sure that they have the capacity to spend the necessary time \nwith their children that they need to spend.\n  So, Mr. President, I think it is important that we get on with the \nbusiness of trying to provide to hourly-paid workers in this country \nthe same kind of flexible working arrangements which have been \navailable to others for quite some extended period of time.\n  As a matter of fact, in 1978, we began according flextime benefits to \nworkers in the Federal Government system. It was done on a pilot \nproject basis so that we could make sure we did not offend the rights \nof individuals and that we made sure that it was a workable system. For \nyears, we inspected the system, and it was extended to more and more \nworkers.\n  In 1985, in the Federal system we made it available to Departments \ngenerally if they thought they could use those procedures wisely and if \nthat would be helpful to people in balancing the needs of their \nfamilies with the needs of the workplace.\n  The major components are these. When you work overtime, instead of \nbeing paid for overtime, you might want to take time off with pay later \non so that you could make up some of the lost time you have with your \nfamily.\n  Most Americans do not realize it is illegal now for an employer \noutside of the Federal Government to offer an hourly paid worker time \noff with pay instead of paying the normal overtime pay. Now, it is, I \nthink, an unjust situation where Government workers have a series of \nbenefits that the private workers do not have. Similarly, Government \nworkers, if they know they will be needing some time for their families \ncan request to work an hour extra one week and take that hour off the \nnext week so they can spend the necessary time with their families.\n  Now, there are ways that private workers have the capacity to spend \ntime with their families, and it is under a rubric known as the Family \nand Medical Leave Act, and that is a Federal law, but it says that \nunder certain narrow conditions if you want to take time off you can \ntake time off but you have to take time off without pay, so if you want \nyour child to go to the doctor or you want to take your child to the \ndoctor you can give notice to your employer that you are going to do \nthat but you take a pay cut in order to do that.\n  Now, if you knew you had a doctors' appointment next Tuesday \nafternoon and you wanted to tell your employer you would like to work \nan extra 2 hours this week to take the 2 hours off next Tuesday, that \nis the Federal system, available to Federal employees. You work the 2 \nhours extra this week, you get your work done, make the arrangements, \ntake the hours off next week and you do not end up with a pay cut but \nkeep your paycheck intact. That is very important.\n  I should hasten to add that nothing in this bill would in any way \nerode, undermine or abolish any of the Family and Medical Leave \nprovisions which are to the benefit of employees across America, but in \nconjunction with those benefits this would add a new array of \npotentials. One of the potentials is that you could take time off to be \nwith your family when necessary, with pay, instead of having to go \nunder the Family and Medical Leave Act procedures which require that \nyou take the time off without pay.\n  Now, most of us are familiar with the fact that not only do Federal \nGovernment workers have comptime and flextime proposals and State \ngovernment workers have been authorized a very substantial comptime \nproposal and the boardroom folks have comptime proposals and the \nsupervisors and managers and all the salary people obviously have \nflexible working arrangements, it is the hourly-paid workers of America \nwho are being treated as second-class citizens. Frankly, they are in a \nminority. The majority of workers in this country have flexible working \narrangements. Hourly paid workers do not.\n  I think it is time that the hourly paid workers have that kind of \nopportunity. That is what Senate bill 4 is all about. I do agree that \nit is important for us to act with expedition on the supplemental \nappropriations bill but, in my judgment, it is also important for us \nwhen we have the opportunity like we should have had today, especially \nwhile this appropriations matter is still in the conference committee, \nto make progress on meeting the needs of Americans, especially when we \nare talking about benefits that Government workers have been enjoying \nin the 1970's, 1980's, and all through the 1990's now. It is time we \ngive the same kind of opportunity to workers in the private sector. It \nis with that in mind that I say that I look forward to the opportunity \nof welcoming amendments and proposed improvements to Senate bill 4.\n  Now, several hours were spent today in criticism of our proposal, but \nthe fact of the matter is none of the amendments that have been filed \nhave been filed by those who have been criticizing the bill. If, \nindeed, they want to do something constructively to help workers, I \ninvite Members of the opposition to bring their amendments to the floor \nand to make their amendments available so they can be filed, so we can \nvote on those amendments, so we can take action on them, so we can make \nthe improvements. We will upgrade what we really need to do to help the \ncitizens of America who do not have this privilege.\n  It is my understanding that the occupant of the Chair might be \ninterested in making some remarks on Senate bill 4. I ask unanimous \nconsent after a quorum call which I will put in place that the occupant \nof the Chair be recognized to make the remarks, and the conclusion of \nthose remarks be followed by another quorum call, at which time I be \nrecognized again to finish my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to again voice my strong \nsupport for S.\n\n[[Page S5245]]\n\n4, the Family Friendly Workplace Act. I have listened to several of my \ncolleagues speak about this important and necessary legislation. I want \nto especially commend Senator DeWine for his steady work in the Labor \nCommittee and for Senator Ashcroft for the many hours he has spent \nworking on this bill.\n  I comment that today we have heard several speeches dealing with S. \n4. We have heard several speeches that did not deal with S. 4. The \nother speeches dealt with a very important topic, too. They dealt with \nthe disaster funding, but that was actually a filibuster against this \nbill. It was a request by certain people in this body that S. 4 not be \nadopted. They do not want people to have that kind of flexibility. It \nwas a plea to do disaster relief, but it was directed to keep this bill \nfrom ever coming to a vote.\n  Disaster is on the mind of everyone that is affected. One of the \nthings I have discovered in my years in the legislature and since I \nhave been here is that the disaster is in the mind of the one who is \naffected as well. Everybody has different kinds of disasters. The \ndisaster that was talked about for a long time tonight is being handled \nin the conference committee right now. There is another disaster in \nAmerica that is being kept from being debated in this body, that is \nkept from being passed in this body, that a vast number of people in \nthis country need. It is a disaster that is happening to them. There \nare people out there that need more flextime and comptime to be able to \nspend time with their families. Some of those people are married to \nFederal employees. That Federal employee is able to take that flextime \nand the other spouse is saying, why can't I?\n  In fact, in the early days when this bill passed that allows the \nFederal employee to do just exactly what we are talking about for the \nprivate hourly employees, the discriminated-against group, the private \nhourly employees, when we allowed Federal employees to do it we should \nhave included the private sector at that time. We should have given \nthem the same right that the Federal employees had.\n  I know that in Cheyenne, WY, at the Unicover Corp., some of the \npeople that worked in that corporation were hired by the Federal \nGovernment. They got flextime and they got comptime. I want to \nemphasize they got flextime and comptime, both of the advantages that \nare being talked about in this bill. Not just one, like is being \nimplied, both of those advantages were given to the Federal employee.\n  Their spouses said this is really a great idea. We should take it to \nour boss and get it implemented, and they took it to the Unicover \nCorp., they took it to the management and the management said, you \nknow, that really is a great idea. We should do it, and they did it. \nThen they found out that they were in violation of the law. The Federal \nemployees could do it, the private hourly employees could not.\n  For 19 years the Unicover Corp. has asked Congress to pass a bill \nthat would give them the same right as the Federal employees--not a \ndifferent right, the same right. The same right for flextime, the same \nright for comptime. They are not asking for a special break that nobody \nelse gets. They are just asking for an even break. Well, they found out \nthey were in violation of the law and they had to end it. They have \nbeen working on it for a number of years to try and get it changed. I \nheard about it when I was campaigning and I said I do not know why we \ndo not have that, and now I have a better idea why we do not have that.\n\n  Today, the Small Business Advocate Award luncheon was held here in \nWashington, DC, over in the Dirksen Building. I had the opportunity to \nattend, and I got to meet the Wyoming Small Business Person of the \nYear, and there were small business people from all over the United \nStates there, being recognized for the leadership that they have taken \nin their company, in their State, to make a difference.\n  Marjorie Mathieson of Jackson is the Wyoming Small Business Person of \nthe year, and I am very proud of her. That is one of the few \nmanufacturing businesses in Jackson and it has been there a long time. \nThey have gone through a number of different phases to keep current \nproducts that will sell to keep that small business in business.\n  She talked to me a little bit about the Family Medical Leave Act. \nSome people have suggested that is an answer for all of the problems of \nmeeting flexibility. Well, it is not. And it should not be expanded to \nbe the answer to all of those either, because it is a paperwork \nnightmare, particularly for smaller businesses. Now, that is limited to \nbusinesses over 50 employees. There has been a request to bring that \ndown to a smaller number. What we need is this Family Friendly \nWorkplace Act that will provide the same kinds of benefits that we are \ntalking about, bringing in the more complicated system, and bringing it \ndown to a smaller level where they cannot handle the paperwork.\n  A part of that business that the Wyoming Small Business Person of the \nYear runs is welding. They have five welders. Those welders make $40 an \nhour. Not bad. Five welders, $40 an hour. They want flextime and \ncomptime. The business needs them to take flextime or comptime or both, \nand the reason they need them to take that is because they have work \nthat has to be done. They have five welders. If one of the welders is \nto leave without doing some kind of a flex in the schedule, they lose \n20 percent of their welding income. That is a significant portion of \ntheir business. That person loses $40 an hour. They do not want to lose \n$40 an hour. For overtime, they lose $60 an hour. They do not want to \nlose that. But the business can make arrangements for them to get \nflextime and comptime so that they can still have the time off, the \nrevenue still comes into the business.\n  More importantly, the paycheck comes to the individual. They want \nflextime. They talked to her about flextime. Marjorie wanted them to \nhave flextime. She allowed flextime, and then found out that she \ncouldn't have flextime, that she couldn't have comptime, that she could \nnot offer this benefit to the people that worked for her. Jackson has \nsome Federal employees. Those Federal employees get this. But these \nguys that weld can't have it not because the business doesn't want to \ngive it to them, but because we have a law against it. And that is not \nfair.\n  I have listened to the debate as we have gone through this topic. I \nam a certified professional in human resources. The Society of Human \nResource Management, a national society, does education and testing in \nall of the areas of human resource management. When you complete the \ncourse and the testing, you can be certified as a professional in human \nresources. I have been through that process. They do an outstanding job \nof keeping track of the problems in the workplace. These are, for the \nmost part, employees. I am not talking about employers. They are \nemployees, employees who want benefits as well. And they see this as \nbeing a critical issue for the hourly worker in the workplace, a way \nfor that worker to have more capability in their own scheduling.\n  Everybody recognizes that this bill has provisions in it that both \nthe employer and the employee have to agree to before it can be done. \nIt isn't the case of forcing the employee to do it. It isn't the case \nof forcing the employer to do it. I am telling you, there are \nbusinesses across this Nation that want this and want it badly. And it \nis usually the employees that bring the idea to the employer and say, \n``Why can't we do this?'' You know, they just do not believe that, \nsince they know that the Federal employees get to do it. They just do \nnot believe the employer when he says it is against the law.\n  One of the biggest things raised in the hearing that we had was, \n``Well, you can be paid for your hours anyway. Then you can save that \nmoney from being paid for your hours, and when somebody gets sick, if \nthere is a soccer match, if you want to go someplace, or if you want to \nhave an anniversary, or any of those great things that people would \nlike to have time off to do, then you can use this money that you \nsave.''\n  I ask you, how easy is it for you to save? It is pretty difficult. A \nlot of the people out there in the work force that we are talking about \nare women. They have gotten into the workplace because of some of the \nthings that we have done back here. They have gotten into the workplace \nbecause of the way that taxes have gone up in the United States, the \nway that inflation has gone up in the United States.\n  We have a situation now where in most families both people work. One \nof\n\n[[Page S5246]]\n\nthem works to pay the expenses, the other one works to pay the taxes.\n  So it is not an option on whether they work or not. We asked a lot of \nwomen through the process in this thing why they didn't just bank the \nmoney and then use that money when they needed time off. And every one \nof them said to me, ``When it is time that I am banking, it is mine. I \ncan use it for my family. But if I accept that paycheck, if I take the \nmoney, that is the family's money. It has to go for all of those family \nexpenses. And there are always family expenses.''\n  But another unique part about this bill is that you can bank the \nhours and you can take the money. I don't know very many families in \nthis country that do not come up with emergencies once in a while. If \nyou have hours banked, there is a provision in this bill to be able to \ncash it in. So when the refrigerator breaks down and you don't have any \nalternative but to buy another refrigerator, even though it means \nputting off that vacation that you had planned, you can take some of \nthe hours you have banked and cash it in.\n  So they see this as a way to bank money for emergencies and to have \ntime for themselves, time for themselves that they invest in their \nfamily. They really want to go to the soccer match. They really have to \ngo sometimes to take their kids to the dentist. They like to celebrate \nthose anniversaries. And this is a bill that allows it.\n  The biggest complaint that I have heard about this bill is that there \nis a cap on the number of hours that they can have, a limit. And they \nsay, ``Why do you have a limit on that--240 hours? Maybe my boss wants \nme to be able to bank more hours and maybe I have a bigger event than \n240 hours.''\n  So that is a complaint on it. We are not even proposing that be \nchanged. But we are asking for some consideration of the bill.\n  The American workplace is dramatically different than it was 60 years \nago when Congress passed the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. We have \nall heard the stories about the dirty thirties from our parents. So I \ndon't have to repeat them here.\n  I will, however, illustrate how nice it was for Congress to pass that \nFair Labor Standards Act to specifically address the numerous problems \nthat existed back then. Cheap labor was abundant. Folks were awfully \nhungry for work. And there were many employers who took advantage of a \nbad economic situation. The 40-hour workweek did not exist. Overtime \ndid not exist. Child labor was being exploited. There were some \nproblems that stemmed from the trends of that era.\n\n  Under the circumstances, Congress acted, and acted appropriately, by \npassing the Fair Labor Standards Act. We are never going back to that. \nThere is no suggestion of ever going back to that. But there is fine \ntuning that needs to be done.\n  It is important to illustrate how times have changed since the 1930's \nand why it is the responsibility of Congress to legislate for the \npresent with the future in mind. As a certified professional in human \nresources, I have had the exhausting and daunting task of filling out \nthe federally mandated forms and paperwork. I have worked one-on-one \nwith my employees to try to meet their needs. Through it all, I have \nalways found my employees to be well schooled and extremely intuitive. \nAs a result, they inherently understand how the modern workplace \nfunctions. And the smaller the business, the better they understand how \nit works, the more connected they are to realizing that the success of \nthat business and the time they spend there means their job and the way \nthey work there means their job. They don't need someone to hold their \nhand and show them the way things work. That might have been the case \n60 years ago.\n  I certainly don't view employee knowledge as a problem, but rather \nwelcome it as an important addition to the mix. Employers have every \nreason to reward employees who clearly understand how to use their time \nin the workplace to its full advantages. America's working parents want \nto decide for themselves whether or not they want overtime or paid time \noff. This is a modern day reality that requires a modern day \nlegislative fix. This act does not eliminate overtime pay, nor does it \neliminate the 40-hour workweek. That kind of talk is simply nonsense. \nThese things will stay just where they are, and the Family Friendly \nWorkplace Act guarantees that.\n  Before coming to the Senate I was the owner and operator of a small \nbusiness for 27 years. Folks in Washington, of course, have a \ncompletely different sense of what constitutes the small in small \nbusiness. I have had several discussions back here about whether a \nsmall business is 500 employees or 125 employees. I can tell you that \nis not even close anywhere in America. A small businessman is one who \nsweeps the sidewalk and cleans the toilets and waits on customers. He \ndoes it all. He has to do it all.\n  We held a small business hearing in Casper, WY, early this year. I \nwas real pleased to have the honor of chairing that in Casper. We had \nabout 75 to 100 people show up for that, rotating out and others \nrotating through. When it was over, one of the news media people said \nto me, ``How come you didn't have a better turnout?'' I said, ``That \nwas a great turnout for a daytime hearing.'' Because we are talking \nabout small businessmen. Quite frankly, they are different than big \nbusiness because in small business, if they had one person that could \ntake off for that day to just listen to a hearing, they would probably \nfire them because it would be one too many people. That is small \nbusiness.\n  So that illustration is radically different from that of a big \nbusiness that has the financial and the employer resources to institute \nvery sophisticated job training and flexibility problems that sidestep \nthe Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. And that is being done now. There \nare ways, very complicated ways. But if you can afford the attorney \nfees and have the specialists, you can provide this for some of your \nemployees--not all of them. But this bill will allow the small business \nperson to have the big business advantage, that extra flexibility.\n  Sadly enough, small businesses are further behind under the \nflexibility of this 60-year-old antiquated law. That is a further \nreason for passing the Family Friendly Workplace Act. Personal \ncomputers, high-speed modems, cellular phones, pagers, and fax machines \nhave all become commonplace in small business. Moreover, these popular \ncommodities have paved the way for telecommunicating, telecommuting--a \nwork environment that could not have been envisioned 60 years ago.\n  While the number of working women in our country continues to rise, \nso does the number of telecommuters and in-home businesses. A lot of \nbusinesses are being started in the home. Then when they expand bigger \nthan the home can handle, they become an outside business. But there \nare a lot of them working in the home that will be the future successes \nin this country. It will be the future opportunity for people who want \nthe American dream. They will start a small business in their home. It \nis happening because of the growing trend of spending more time at home \nwith our families. If they telecommute, they don't have to spend an \nhour each way driving.\n  That is part of the flexibility. That is something that the modern \nage has provided us. It is impossible to bottle up workplace \nflexibility. But we have an antiquated law that is suggesting that we \ncan. That is why it is so important to modernize this archaic Federal \nlaw that squelches any chance of giving American hourly workers more \ntime at home with their kids, a true investment in our Nation's future.\n\n  Congress must legislate with the times to provide the opportunities \nfor our Nation's parents to make that investment. It is often the case \nwith a lot of families that both parents work. They do this, and they \ndo it happily because they have to meet the bills. They also do it \nbecause they cannot get extra hours off from the job the way they would \nreally prefer to do it unless they work for another business as well. \nIf they work two jobs, they don't get any overtime. But a lot of them \nwork two places. They don't get comptime. They don't get flextime. They \ndon't get overtime.\n  This unfortunate trend in the business world can be addressed by \nproviding this workplace flexibility with the choice of paid time off \nfor flextime.\n  Times have changed and the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 does not \npermit employees to choose between\n\n[[Page S5247]]\n\npaid time off or overtime pay. My experience is that there are a lot of \npeople out there who know that if they take the money, they will spend \nthe money. They want the time instead. I also found that fact to be \nmore prevalent among women in the work force. They feel the need for \nthe time to spend with their children, and they understand that money \nbelongs to the family. They have a much stronger family belief than \nmost of the men I have worked with. So they prefer to take flextime or \ncomptime and use that for themselves or their family.\n  One of the businesses I worked for often had additional assignments \nthat employees could take on, if they chose to do so. When we asked if \nthe employees wanted additional work, they said ``yes,'' if they could \nhave time off the following week with compensation, but if they could \nonly choose to be paid, they didn't need it. They would rather have the \ntime off this week than to take the money next week. We explained to \nthem that they had the capability of taking the overtime pay, not \nworking the following week, and spending that extra pay that week. But \nsomehow those paychecks don't get distributed at home quite the same \nway they do on paper or here.\n  I am hoping that everyone will reflect a bit on the trends that our \nmodern work force is talking about and not the mandatory things that \nseem to be implied by this legislation imposed upon us. The downsizing \nproblems today are leading to less flexibility as well as families \nmaking less money than if they were doing the job they preferred to do, \nnot the second jobs they are having to do without getting overtime \nbecause it is a second job. There has been a tremendous increase in \ntemporary positions in this country. This has taken flexibility away \nfrom the families. It has taken money away from the families. This a \nmodern day problem that requires a modern day solution.\n  This matter cannot possibly be addressed by legislation that we have \ncrafted to address the problems of the 1930s. We have taken care of \nthose problems. We are not going back to that situation. But we need to \nadjust for the future. Indeed, our society is constantly driven by \nchanging trends. I can comfortably argue that our society is one of the \nmost trendy in the world, a fact that has kept America on the leading \nedge of technological innovation. We have been at the peak in \ntechnology and at the tail in taking care of the hourly worker.\n  I hope that before people begin making up their minds on this bill, \nthey will take a close look at the language and what it really calls \nfor rather than relying on misstatements, and I see those misstatements \nin the paper from time to time, misleading statistics, partisan \nposturing. Read the bill. Ask for a copy of the bill. Read the bill. It \nis amazing.\n  Our Nation's work force is calling for this much-needed change. I \nagain urge my colleagues to support the Family Friendly Workplace Act. \nBring this to a vote. Give the hourly working people of this country \nthe opportunity to choose how they want to work, the way that they want \nto choose to help their families.\n  I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

Mr. President, these days, just about every aspect of our \ndaily existence is regulated in some way by the Government. And in most \ninstances, it makes sense because we must protect human health and the \nenvironment. We would all agree that food and drugs should be \ninspected, work conditions should be considered and safety measures \nmust be enacted.\n  On the other hand, the Federal regulatory system is notorious for \nproducing top-down, one-size-fits-all regulations that are often \ninefficient and ineffective. These regulations impose tremendous costs \non business and industry, increase the costs of goods and services and \nreduce economic growth. Most importantly, too many regulations fail in \nwhat they are trying to do.\n  As I look more closely at the patchwork of regulation this Government \nhas created in the last few decades, however, I see regulation for \nregulation's sake. We are witnessing an eruption of regulation based on \ninaccurate science, poor judgment, and bad politics. Most shocking is \nthe fundamental lack of trust in the ability of the American people to \ntake responsibility for their own actions.\n  I think it's time we returned to the basics, Mr. President. The \ncentral goal of regulating is to significantly protect human health, \nsafety or the environment. When held to this standard, many regulations \nfall short of the mark. So how do we get from here to there?\n  First, agencies must begin issuing regulations based on sound \nscience. This means one thing--that any Federal regulation issued must \nbe justified by solid science. This principle sounds very simple, but \nmany agencies have become obsessed with the power to regulate, \nforgetting that there must be sound scientific reasoning behind their \naction.\n  The time has come to raise the level of debate. No longer can \nagencies be allowed to dream up and order a regulation without genuine \noversight or input from the outside scientific world. I know that the \nmore informed Congress is about an issue, the better public policy \ndecision we will make. The same should be true of regulatory agencies. \nWith so many experts in the academic, Federal and private sectors, it \nis a shame to limit the scope of debate to one elite group of \nscientists. I have heard some agencies claim that their rulemakings are \nindeed reviewed by outside experts, but a closer look reveals that \nthese objective scientists are not completely independent. I do not \nthink it unreasonable to ask that there be some consensus among truly \nindependent outside scientific experts as to the proper course of \naction before issuing a rulemaking.\n\n  The bottom line is that, to effectively regulate, agencies should not \nissue rules based on anything but honest, peer-reviewed science. \nPeriod.\n  Second, agencies must learn to correctly assess risk. Beginning with \nsound science, agencies should look at the real world risks of a \nsituation, recognizing that not every risk is avoidable. Sometimes I \nthink that these agencies are on a mission to create a 100 percent \nrisk-free, accident-free--possibly industry-free--world. They also need \nto acknowledge that all risks are relative. Regulating small risks can \nhave adverse side effects, resulting in greater risks and less \nprotection. We should focus our efforts and our resources on the \ngreatest risks.\n  Agencies should also realize that exposure to a chemical doesn't \nautomatically present a risk or indicate a cause and effect \nrelationship. The risk associated with a given dosage level should be \nexamined. Where exposure to a truckload of almost any toxin poses a \nsignificant risk, in most cases, an extremely diluted version may not \npresent any danger at all. Regulators should be sensitive to risks as \nthey relate to dosage instead of assuming that any contact with \nchemicals presents too great a danger. Too often, regulations are \nissued based on a better safe than sorry mentality. This can leave us \nless safe and considerably sorrier.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I reiterate the dire need for regulatory \nreform. The invasive regulatory hands of Government are slowly choking \nthe life out those whom they seek to save. Let's get back to the \nbasics. Using sound, peer-reviewed science, agencies should make a \nvalid assessment of real world risks and determine a solid cause-and-\neffect correlation before taking action.\n  I am committed to enacting regulatory reform in the 105th Congress. I \nwelcome the input and support of my fellow Senators.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/03/senate-section/article/S5248-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5248-S5249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            AMERICAN AUTOMOBILE ASSOCIATION LIFESAVING MEDAL\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am proud to announce to the Senate today \nthe names of the four youngsters who are recipients of the 1997 \nAmerican Automobile Association Lifesaving Medal.\n  This is the highest award given to members of school safety patrols \nthroughout the United States. It is presented annually to students, \nwho, while on duty took heroic lifesaving actions to save the life of a \nfellow student from imminent danger.\n  I would like to briefly describe the heroic actions of these four \nyoung citizens.\n  The first two honorees hail from the State of Ohio. On February 28, \n1997, Leawood Elementary School Safety Patrol Captain Surmel D. \nCummings and Patrol Edwin H. Berry were assisting students on their way \nhome. Surmel noticed a 6-year-old boy and his 8-year-old cousin walking \nclose to the westbound on-ramp for I-70.\n  The cousin was trying to prevent the 6-year-old from climbing over \nthe guardrail next to the on-ramp. Surmel ran over to the two boys and \ntried to hold the 6-year-old. The boy began hitting and kicking Surmel. \nEdwin ran to help his partner. The 6-year-old broke loose from Surmel \nand scrambled over the guardrail. He was now confronted by the fast-\nmoving cars on the on-ramp. Surmel told Edwin to try to get the 6-year-\nold back across the guardrail while he returned to the school to get \nhelp.\n  When a car driver started blowing his horn, the 6-year-old covered \nhis ears and turned his back toward Edwin. At that moment, Edwin \ngrabbed the 6-year-old and pulled him back across the guardrail to \nsafety. This was a great team effort by both of these two young men.\n  The State of Indiana can be proud of the next honoree.\n  While on duty on December 6, 1996, Shambaugh Elementary School Safety \nPatrol Marcus A. Morgan, noticed a 6-year-old girl running alongside a \nvan. This vehicle had just dropped her off and was pulling away from \nthe curb. Marcus yelled for the girl to stop chasing the van, but he \nquickly realized the girl's string was caught in the van door. She then \nfell and was being dragged by the van.\n  Marcus raced after the van, shouting for the driver to stop. he ran \nto the passenger-side and banged on the window to get the driver to \nstop. The van kept moving so he ran to the driver-side window to get \nthe driver's attention while a parent banged on the passenger-side \nwindow. The driver finally stopped after 54 feet. The girl was not\n\n[[Page S5249]]\n\nseriously injured due to Marcus' quick and heroic actions.\n  AAA's last honoree is from California.\n  It was a clear afternoon on November 4, 1996, at St. Jarbeth's School \nwhen School Safety Patrol Domonique Fines and April Corral took their \npost on the northwest corner of Harold and Champion Streets.\n  A white pickup truck stopped at the stop sign next to their post and \nthen started up the steep hill on Harold Street. Near the top of the \nhill, the truck stalled and rolled backward. As it came down the hill, \nthe truck picked up speed.\n  Unaware of the truck, April handed her patrol sign to Domonique as \nshe bent down to tie her shoe. Domonique noticed the truck rapidly \nheading toward them. She shouted to April to watch out and started to \ncross Harold Street to get out of its way. Halfway across the street, \nDomonique looked back to see if her partner, April, was following her. \nUnaware of the danger, April was still tying her shoe. Domonique yelled \nagain, but April couldn't hear her over the noise from the street \ntraffic and the playground.\n  Unconcerned about her own safety, Domonique ran back to April, \ngrabbed her arm, and pushed her out of the way. The truck jump the curb \nwhere April had been tying her shoe and then crashed into a fence.\n  I also want to recognize and thank the American Automobile \nAssociation for their invaluable safety program and for honoring these \noutstanding safety patrol members.\n  In the 1920's AAA began organizing safety patrol programs whereby \nolder students assist younger students while crossing streets as they \nwalked to and from school. Today, more than 500,000 students across the \ncountry serve as AAA safety patrol volunteers. In fact, there are \ncurrently 50,000 schools with safety patrols.\n  AAA supplies training materials, belts, badges, and other items \nneeded to operate the safety patrol programs. Importantly, AAA promotes \nand recognizes patrol efforts each year through a series of awards, \nnewsletters, summer camps, and scholarships.\n  On behalf of my Senate colleagues, and for parents all across the \ncountry, I want to thank AAA. Their work in helping to keep our \nyoungsters a little safer on their way to and from school is extremely \npraiseworthy.\n  I am very proud of Surmel, Edwin, Marcus, and Domonique who \nexemplified courage and citizenship. I know that their parents and \ncommunities are equally as proud. These four youngsters showed great \ncourage in saving another individuals life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/03/senate-section/article/S5248-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    HONORING KENTUCKY SMALL BUSINESS PERSON OF THE YEAR, TOM CLOPTON\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Tom \nClopton of Cave City, Kentucky, who has been selected as the Kentucky \nSmall Business Person of the Year by the U.S. Small Business \nAdministration.\n  Tom is the President and CEO of Tekno, Inc., a manufacturing company \nin Cave City. He started the company in 1989 with nothing more than a \nhome computer and his personal savings. Today Tekno is a premier \ndesigner and manufacturer of material handling, factory automation, and \nspecialty machinery systems for industrial applications.\n  Tekno's success is remarkable. Annual sales have grown from $354 \nthousand in 1989 to nearly $13.2 million in 1995. Revenues have \nincreased nearly four thousand percent in just seven and a half years. \nThis remarkable growth has resulted in Tekno being ranked as one of \nAmerica's fastest growing privately owned companies for three \nconsecutive years, 1994-1996.\n  Not only have Tom's business and managerial skills fostered the \ngrowth of a productive company, his ingenuity and engineering skills \nhave enabled him to acquire 13 patents from the U.S. Patent and \nTrademark Office. In addition, he has patents pending in both Canada \nand Mexico.\n  And as any good boss will do, Tom attributes much of his success to \nhis employees. He knows that happy employees are productive employees \nand he makes every effort to ensure that Tekno provides a pleasant \nworking environment. In return, his employees take pride in their job \nand are quick to volunteer for extra hours when urgent tasks need to be \ncompleted.\n  And finally, I want to say that Tom's dedication and commitment to \nhis customers, employees and community sets an example for every small \nbusiness. I am happy that Tom is being recognized for all of the good \nwork he has done. I congratulate him on this significant accomplishment \nand wish him many future years of success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/03/senate-section/article/S5249-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5249]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, of necessity, I was at the Finance \nCommittee hearing on trade negotiating authority this morning, and so \nwas unable to be on the floor to pay tribute--as so many others have \ndone--to our esteemed colleague, Senator Thurmond, who now holds the \nrecord for Senate longevity. But I would like to pay such tribute now.\n  Just about 1 year ago--June 13, 1996, to be precise--my daughter \nMaura and I traveled to the White House for a state dinner in honor of \nIreland's president, Mary Robinson, and her husband Nicholas. We \nstopped at the northwest gate, to be scrutinized by White House \nsecurity officials. An earnest young man in a uniform peered into our \nJeep, studied my face, consulted a clipboard, and then said smartly, \n``Good evening, Senator Thurmond!''\n  A fine compliment, to be mistaken for a man more robust, more \nvigorous, more irrepressible than individuals half his age or mine!\n  I will leave to others the task of highlighting our beloved \ncolleague's absolutely extraordinary private and public lives, which \nspan the 20th century. A few things come to mind which bear mentioning, \nhowever. He learned his populist brand of politics from ``Pitchfork \nBen'' Tillman--a man born 150 years ago--whose Senate seat he now \noccupies. And yet he was just re-elected for the eighth time, again \nwith little difficulty. Senator Thurmond embodies the political and \nsocial transformation of the South.\n  As a 40-year-old, he volunteered for active duty during World War II \nand landed at Normandy with the 82d Airborne Division. Immediately \nafter the war, he was elected governor of South Carolina. While \ngovernor, in 1948, he ran for president as a States' Rights Democrat \nand garnered 39 electoral votes.\n  He was elected to the Senate in 1954 as a write-in candidate, the \nfirst person ever elected to major office by this method. But true to a \ncampaign pledge he made, he resigned in 1956 and stood for re-election. \nIn 1964, he left the Democratic Party and became a Goldwater \nRepublican, presaging--or, perhaps, ushering in--GOP gains in the South \nthat continue to this day. He has served as a delegate to six \nDemocratic and eight Republican National Conventions--a distinction I \ndoubt anyone else shares. Suffice it to say that if Strom Thurmond did \nnot exist, it might be necessary for us to invent him.\n\n[[Page S5250]]\n\n  Senator Thurmond has endured the loss of his first wife, the loss of \nhis daughter. But through it all, he has been indomitable. Always \noptimistic. Unfailingly courteous, the epitome of a Southern \ngentleman--despite living in our current age, when good manners seem to \nelude us so readily. I hope he has a sense of the respect and affection \nwe have for him.\n  When I think of our colleague, I think of the wonderful poem, \n``Ulysses'', by Alfred Lord Tennyson--one of the great English poets, \nwho, I might add, died a mere decade before Senator Thurmond was born, \nand I would like to close my tribute with an excerpt from the poem:\n\n       I am become a name;\n       For always roaming with a hungry heart\n       Much have I seen and known; cities of men\n       And manners, climates, councils, governments,\n       Myself not least, but honour'd of them all;\n       And drunk delight of battle with my peers,\n       Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy.\n       I am a part of all that I have met;\n       Yet all experience is an arch wherethro'\n       Gleams that untravell'd world whose margin fades\n       For ever and forever when I move.\n       How dull it is to pause, to make an end,\n       To rust unburnish'd, not to shine in use!\n       As tho' to breathe were life!\n\n       No one ever could accuse Senator Thurmond of ``rusting \n     unburnish'd''!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/03/senate-section/article/S5249-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      JOHN F. KENNEDY ASSASSINATION RECORDS REVIEW BOARD EXTENSION\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in 1992, I sponsored a joint resolution \nin collaboration with Congressman Louis Stokes, who served as chairman \nof the House Select Committee on Assassinations, to expedite disclosure \nof materials relevant to the assassination of President John F. \nKennedy. That act created the Assassination Review Board, which was \ndirected to oversee the identification and release of records related \nto the assassination of President Kennedy. While the review board has \nmade significant progress in its important work, it will need \nadditional time to complete its task. Today, I am introducing a bill \nthat will authorize the board's extension for 1 year.\n  Through October 1996, the review board was successful in transferring \nnearly 10,000 documents to the National Archives and Records \nAdministration for inclusion in the JFK Collection. Although much has \nbeen accomplished, Congress, in setting its original 3-year timetable, \nwas simply unable to anticipate a number of problems the board has \nencountered since beginning its work. The board was not appointed until \n18 months after the legislation was signed into law. In addition, \nFederal agencies have been slow in identifying records to be processed \nand the hiring and training of new employees to work with the board has \ntaken longer than expected. Nevertheless, the review board serves a \nvital function of removing some of the uncertainty and speculation \nabout the contents of Government files relating to President Kennedy's \nassassination. An additional year will permit the board to finish its \nimportant task.\n  According to information provided to me, over the past 5 years, the \nreview board has worked to facilitate the maximum appropriate \ndisclosure of any additional materials which may have been withheld by \nthe FBI, CIA, Secret Service, or any other Federal agency.\n  In addition, the House committee decided to withhold certain \nmaterials for 50 years following the publication of its report in 1979, \nor until the year 2029. According to information provided to me, the \nreview board has also worked to facilitate the maximum appropriate \ndisclosure of any of these materials which may have been withheld by \nthe House committee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/03/senate-section/article/S5250-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/03/senate-section/article/S5250-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5250]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT CONCERNING EMIGRATION LAWS AND POLICIES OF ARMENIA, AZERBAIJAN, \n    GEORGIA, MOLDOVA, AND UKRAINE--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 43\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n\n  I hereby transmit a report concerning emigration laws and policies of \nArmenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine as required by \nsubsections 402(b) and 409(b) of title IV of the Trade Act of 1974, as \namended (the ``Act'').

A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan; to the Committee on \n     Labor and Human Resources.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 26\n\n       Whereas, while the history of organized labor has often \n     been marked by difficulties and controversy over the years, \n     working men and women bargaining in good faith through formal \n     labor negotiations has brought many benefits to our state and \n     nation. The standard of living for working families is much \n     higher than it could possibly be without organization. For \n     responsible companies, the steady supply of reliable workers \n     also brings many rewards and long-term stability; and\n       Whereas, in recent years, a shift seems to be occurring in \n     strategy for businesses in how they handle labor disputes. \n     Too often, the initial response in a labor dispute is for \n     management to hire replacement workers instead of negotiating \n     with the workers. This short-sighted action severely hinders \n     all communications between management and workers. Often, \n     hiring replacement workers sets in motion an escalating \n     series of actions that are harmful to everyone; and\n       Whereas, Michigan has experienced this recently through the \n     lengthy and bitter newspaper strike in Detroit. Hiring \n     permanent replacement workers has clearly hindered the \n     effectiveness of negotiations and made a difficult situation \n     far worse and more divisive than necessary. This extended \n     tension is harmful to labor, management, and the public; now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact \n     legislation to prohibit the hiring of permanent replacement \n     workers as an alternative to negotiations and settlements of \n     labor disputes; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution and the roll call \n     on its adoption be transmitted to the President of the United \n     States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, and the members of the Michigan \n     congressional delegation.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       POM-112.

The federal statute does provide an overtime \n     exemption for the employers of fire, police and corrections \n     personnel. The exemption allows employers of these employees \n     to calculate overtime pay by averaging the number of hours \n     worked over a period of 28 days rather than on a weekly \n     basis, thereby reducing overtime costs for localities. This \n     exemption permits localities to schedule employees in a more \n     productive, economical, and efficient manner; and\n       Whereas, a recent judicial decision has resulted in the \n     federal government interpreting 29 USCS Sec. 207 in a manner \n     that precludes a similar overtime exemption for EMS \n     employers; and\n       Whereas, the lack of an overtime exemption for EMS \n     personnel results in increased operating costs for localities \n     and a reduction in operating efficiency; now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate, the House of Delegates concurring, \n     That Congress be urged to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act \n     to better address the unique characteristics of emergency \n     medical service employees and to provide an overtime \n     exemption for such employees similar to that provided for \n     fire, police and corrections employees; and, be it\n       Resolved further, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President of the United \n     States Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, \n     and the members of the Congressional Delegation of Virginia \n     in order that they may be apprised of the sense of the \n     General Assembly in this matter.\n                                                                    ____\n\n       POM-114.

This Resolution calls for an amendment to the \n     U.S. Constitution which would end the self-proclaimed \n     authority and power to tax which the federal courts have \n     given themselves. The language of the proposed amendment does \n     not change the Constitution. Rather, it reasserts a basic \n     premise of representative government--there shall be no \n     taxation without representation.\n       POM-121.

A bill to amend part E of title IV of the Social Security Act \nto provide for demonstration projects to test the feasibility of \nestablishing kinship care as an alternative to foster care for a child \nwho has adult relatives willing to provide safe and appropriate care \nfor the child, and to require notice to adult relative caregivers; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                      THE KINSHIP CARE ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Kinship \nCare Act of 1997. Grandparents caring for grandchildren represent one \nof the most underappreciated and perhaps under-utilized natural \nresources in our Nation. Yet they hold tremendous potential for curing \none of our society's most pressing problems--the care of children who \nhave no parents, or whose parents simply aren't up to the task of \nproviding children a stable, secure, and nurturing living environment.\n  There is such a great reservoir of love and experience available to \nus, and more especially to the tens of thousands of American children \nwho desperately need basic care giving. We provide public assistance \nfor strangers to give this kind of care, but the folks available to do \nit are in short supply.\n  Legislation I am introducing in the Senate today will give States the \nflexibility to provide the support these grandparents need, so that our \nseniors can fill the care gap. Last year, as part of welfare reform, \nSenator Coats and I were successful in passing legislation that would \ngive preference to an adult relative over a nonrelated caregiver when \ndetermining a placement for a child. My new legislation will continue \nthe process of shifting the focus of our child welfare system from \nleaving children with strangers to leaving them in the loving arms of \ngrandparents and other relatives.\n  I am not noticing a new trend. States have been moving in this \ndirection for over a decade. Over the past 10 years the number of \nchildren involved in extended family arrangements has increased by 40 \npercent. Currently, more than four million children are being raised by \ntheir grandparents. In other words, 5 percent of all families in this \ncountry are headed by grandparents.\n  My view is that it's time for the Federal Government to get with the \nprogram and start developing policies that make it easier, instead of \nmore difficult, for families to come together to raise their children.\n  My bill has several parts. First, it would allow States to obtain \nwaivers to set up kinship care guardianship systems where grandparents \nand other relative providers can receive some financial assistance \nwithout having to turn over custody of the child to the State and \nwithout having to go through the paperwork and bureaucratic hurdles of \nthe foster care system.\n  Grandparents already face a number of hurdles when they suddenly find \nthemselves caring for a grandchild. These may include living in \nseniors-only housing, not having clothes or\n\n[[Page S5254]]\n\nspace for a grandchild, or living on a fixed income. We need to \nencourage States to start making their child protection systems \ngrandparent- and relative-friendly.\n  The second part of this bill requires states to give relative \ncaregivers notice of and an opportunity to be heard in hearings or case \nreviews with respect to the child's safety and well-being. I have \nrepeatedly heard the frustration of these grandparents and relative \ncaregivers who say they never knew about or were not allowed to attend \na hearing or case review affecting a child for whom they may be caring \nor have cared for years. Surely their voices should be heard in those \ncircumstances where the well-being and safety of the child is being \ndiscussed.\n  As we reevaluate the effectiveness of our country's child protection \nsystems, it's time that we start developing some new ideas and new ways \nto use our resources more effectively to find loving environments for \nchildren who can't live with their natural parents.\n  I applaud the efforts of my colleague in the House, Representative \nConnie Morella who has introduced the companion bill in the House, and \nI urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join with me in \ngiving states increased flexibility to make their foster care systems \nmore grandparent friendly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 822\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for violent and repeat juvenile offender \naccountability, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n                 the protect children from violence act\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, yesterday's Washington Post reported a \ndecrease in crime nationwide. The Post\n\n[[Page S5255]]\n\nalso reported that Attorney General Reno and President Clinton quickly \nstepped up to take credit for this news.\n  But in this same article James Alan Fox, dean of Northeastern \nUniversity's college of criminal justice, suggested that the decreasing \ncrime numbers were more a function of demographics. According to Dean \nFox, ``The aging of a large segment of the population has played a key \nrole in the decline. Adults tend to be less violent than juveniles.'' \nBut if crime statistics are, indeed, a function of demographics, then \nthe demographics suggest that the juvenile crime rates will continue to \nrise. As Dean Fox indicated, the juvenile population will grow over the \nnext decade.\n  The available numbers confirm that the rate of violent juvenile \ncrimes is increasing. The Washington Post also mentioned that between \n1985 and 1995, the number of murders committed by juveniles increased \n145 percent. And criminologist suggest that the baby boom of the 1980's \nwill bring tidalwave of vicious violent youth onto our streets.\n  Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation to protect our \nchildren from people who would lead them astray and from those who are \ndangerous in our midst.\n  The dangerous environment in which our children live today dictates \nthat we make several fundamental changes in the way we treat dangerous, \nviolent juveniles and those people--juveniles and adults, alike--who \nlure our children into drugs and gangs. We must come down harder on \njuveniles who commit serious violent crimes--incarcerating them and \ntrying them as adults--and we must improve our recordkeeping capability \nfor these dangerous juveniles so that courts, police officers, and \nschools know when they have a potential killer in their midst. \nFurthermore, we must punish severely those adults who seek to corrupt \nour kids by luring them into gangs, drugs, and a life of crime.\n  This bill, the Protect Children from Violence Act, will update our \ncurrent juvenile justice laws to reflect the new vicious nature of \ntoday's teen criminals.\n  The act has several components, but first and foremost it would \nrequire Federal prosecutors and States, in order to qualify for $750 \nmillion in new incentive grants, to try as adults those juveniles 14 \nand older who commit serious violent offenses, such as rape or murder. \nThere is nothing juvenile about these crimes, and the perpetrators must \nbe treated and tried as adults.\n  Some of the laws on the books inadvertently pervert the direction of \nthe law enforcement system, offering more protections to the \nperpetrators, than to the public. This must cease. Strengthening our \njuvenile justice laws is the first line of defense in protecting the \npublic and providing greater protection for innocent children than for \nviolent criminals.\n  In order to do this, we must also ensure that our law enforcement \nofficials, courts and schools have clear lines of communications and \naccess to the records of violent juvenile offenders. This bill does \nthis by requiring the fingerprinting and photographing of juveniles \nfound guilty of crimes that would be felonies if committed by an adult. \nThe bill would also ensure that those records are made available to \nFederal and State law enforcement officials and school officials, so \nthey will know who they are dealing with when they confront a dangerous \njuvenile offender.\n\n  Typically, State statutes seal juvenile criminal records and expunge \nthose records when the juvenile reaches age 18. Today's young criminal \npredators understand that when they reach their 18th birthday, they can \nbegin their second career as adult criminals with an unblemished \nrecord. The time has come to discard anachronistic idea that crimes \ncommitted by juveniles must be kept confidential, no matter how heinous \nthe crime.\n  Our law enforcement agencies, courts, and school officials need \nimproved access to juvenile records so that they have the tools to deal \nwith the exponential increase in the severity and frequency of juvenile \ncrimes.\n  For too long, law enforcement officers have operated in the dark. Our \npolice departments need to have access to the prior juvenile criminal \nrecords of individuals to assist them in criminal investigations and \napprehension.\n  According to Police Chief David G. Walchak, who is immediate past \npresident of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, law \nenforcement officials are in desperate need of access to juvenile \ncriminal records. The police chief has said, ``Current juvenile \nrecords--both arrest and adjudication--are inconsistent across the \nStates, and are usually unavailable to the various programs' staff who \nwork with youthful offenders.''\n  Chief Walchak also notes that ``If we [in law enforcement] don't know \nwho the youthful offenders are, we can't appropriately intervene.''\n  Chief Walchak is not the only one saying this. Law enforcement \nofficers in my home State have told me that when they arrest juveniles \nthey have no idea with whom they are dealing because the records are \nkept confidential.\n  School officials, as well as courts and law enforcement officials, \nneed access to juvenile criminal records to assist them in providing \nfor the best interests of all students and preventing more tragedies.\n  The decline in school safety across the country can be attributed to \na significant degree to laws that put the protection of dangerous \nstudents ahead of protecting the innocent--those that go to school to \nlearn, not to rape, maim, and murder.\n  While visiting with school officials in Sikeston, MO, a teacher told \nme how one of her students came to school wearing an electronic \nmonitoring ankle bracelet. Can you imagine being that teacher and \nhaving to turn around--back to the class--to write on the chalk board \nnot knowing whether that student was a rapist, or even a murderer?\n  School officials need access to juvenile criminal records so that \nthey can keep a close eye on potentially dangerous predators and take \npreventive measures. Judicial and law enforcement authorities need this \ninformation because it is vital to the protection of public safety.\n  In addition to requiring that Federal and State prosecutors try \nviolent juvenile offenders as adults and increasing recordkeeping and \nsharing capability, this bill also enhances the Federal criminal \npenalties for those adults who seek to lure juveniles into criminal \nactivity or drug use.\n\n  For example, any adult who distributes drugs to a minor, traffics in \ndrugs in or near a school, or uses minors to distribute drugs would \nface a minimum 3-year jail sentence--as compared to the 1-year minimum \nunder current law.\n  This bill also doubles the maximum jail time and fines for adults who \nuse minors in crimes of violence. The second time the adult hides \nbehind the juvenile status of a child by using him to commit a crime, \nthe adult faces a tripling of the maximum sentence, and fine.\n  Furthermore, the Protect Children from Violence Act elevates a \nFederal crime the recruiting of minors to participate in gang activity. \nUnder this legislation, those gangsters who lure our children into \ngangs will face a Federal prosecutor and a Federal penitentiary.\n  A 1993 survey reported an estimated 4,881 gangs with 249,324 gang \nmembers in the United States. Those figures are disturbing enough. But \na second study, conducted just 2 years later, found that the number of \ngangs had increased more than fourfold, with 23,388 gangs claiming over \n650,000 members. We need legislation to stem this rising tide.\n  Let me quickly recap the highlights of this legislation. In order to \nqualify for incentive grants, States would be required to try juveniles \nas adults if they commit certain violent crimes such as rape and \nmurder. States also would have to fingerprint and keep records on \njuveniles who commit crimes that would be felonies if committed by \nadults, and States must allow public access to juvenile criminal \nrecords of repeat juvenile offenders. These same provisions would apply \nto Federal law enforcement officials. To protect our children from \nadults who prey on them, this bill doubles and triples the jail time \nfor those convicted of using a juvenile to commit a violent crime or to \ndistribute drugs. Anyone caught dealing drugs to minors or near a \nschool will face three times the penalty under current law.\n  This bill is a reasonable and prudent response to the threat that \nviolent\n\n[[Page S5256]]\n\nyouths, and the adults that lead them into life of crime, pose to our \nchildren. The moneys authorized will be used to deter and incarcerate \nviolent juvenile criminals, not just to provide for more midnight \nbasketball and prevention programs--the situation, and our future, \ndemands more that that. We need to take into account the needs of the \ninnocent children--not sacrifice their protection in the name of \nprivacy of violent juvenile perpetrators.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Durbin and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 826. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to protect the \npublic from health hazards caused by exposure to environmental tobacco \nsmoke, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n\n\n                 THE SMOKE-FREE ENVIRONMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I introduce the Smoke-Free \nEnvironment Act of 1997. This bill will help decrease the death rates \nfrom a toxic pollutant that exists in the air of our Nation's \nfactories, office buildings, retail stores, and Government facilities. \nI am speaking of secondhand smoke from cigarettes and other tobacco \nproducts, which kills tens of thousands of Americans each year.\n  A recent study put an end to the tobacco industry's distortions and \nmisinformation on this issue. A Harvard University study which tracked \n32,000 nonsmoking women for 10 years found that regular exposure at \nhome or at work to secondhand smoke nearly doubled their risk of heart \ndisease.\n  Mr. President, we have been aware of the risk of lung cancer from \nsecondhand smoke for several years now, but this study confirms what \nmany have suspected about the link between secondhand smoke and heart \ndisease. The results of this study means that approximately 50,000 \nfatal heart attacks each year are caused by exposure to tobacco smoke.\n  My bill would require that every building--both Government and \nprivate--protect Americans from exposure to secondhand smoke. It can be \naccomplished in one of two ways. The building could either ban smoking \naltogether or set up smoking rooms that are separately ventilated from \nthe rest of the building.\n  Mr. President, the bill also would finish a job I started with \nSenator Durbin 10 years ago. In 1987, we banned smoking on domestic \nairline flights of 2 hours or less. In 1989, we extended that ban to \nflights of 6 hours or less.\n  The smoking ban has been a tremendous success. Passengers have been \nso pleased by a smokefree environment in the air that many airlines \nhave voluntarily extended the ban to all domestic flights and \ninternational flights. However, some airlines have not, and many \npassengers and flight attendants are still subjected to dangerous \nsecondhand smoke on airplanes.\n  Mr. President, the Smoke-Free Environment Act will also ban smoking \non any flight that originates in the United States, and lands in a \nforeign country. Americans should be able to travel abroad with the \npeace of mind that they will not be locked into a poisonous cabin for \n10 or 15 hours, and flight attendants will not have to worry that they \nwill increase their risk of heart disease almost twofold by simply \nperforming their job.\n  Mr. President, yesterday, a trial opened in Miami, in which flight \nattendants sued the tobacco industry over health injuries caused by \nexposure to secondhand smoke before the passage of my law banning \nsmoking on domestic flights. These flight attendants have a legitimate \ncase, and it is time to prevent similar litigation in the future by \ncleaning all the air in the skies, in Government offices, in stores, \nand in all of our places of work.\n  Mr. President, nonsmokers never choose to be exposed to tobacco \nsmoke. The smoke of a cigarette is not only harming the smoker, but \nalso severely injuring others with secondhand smoke.\n  Multiple studies have shown that regular exposure to secondhand smoke \nresults in the following for nonsmokers: Damage to the arteries, \nreduction of oxygen supply in the body, and increases in the tendency \nof blood platelet to stick together and clot.\n  Mr. President, how can we speak about the importance of children's \nhealth while our kids are being exposed to this deadly smoke. It is \ntime for Congress to get serious about the health crisis caused by \nsecondhand smoke, and pass the Smoke-Free Environment Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \ninserted into the Record. I also ask unanimous consent that a New York \nTimes article on the Harvard study be inserted into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 826\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The results mean that ``there may be up to 50,000 \n     Americans dying of heart attacks from passive smoking each \n     year,'' said Dr. Ichiro Kawachi, an assistant professor of \n     health and social behavior at the Harvard School of Public \n     Health and the lead author of the study, which was published \n     in the journal Circulation.\n       By contrast, lung cancer deaths from passive smoking are \n     estimated to be far fewer, at 3,000 to 4,000 a year. Because \n     heart disease is much more common than lung cancer, even a \n     small increase in risk can cause many deaths.\n       Before this study, it was known that passive smoking caused \n     increased risk for several ailments, including asthma and \n     bronchitis, as well as middle-ear infections in young \n     children. But the increased risk for heath disease had been \n     estimated at about 30 percent.\n       ``This is a very important study,' said Dr. Stanton Glantz, \n     a professor of medicine at the University of California at \n     San Francisco, who has done extensive research on passive \n     smoking but who was not involved in the Harvard study. ``It's \n     exceptionally strong and from a very solid group.'' Glantz \n     also praised the Harvard team for what he called its careful \n     analysis of workplace exposure to smoke, which had rarely \n     been done before.\n       :`That's important because of the effort to create laws \n     controlling smoking in the workplace,'' he said.\n       Although the federal Occupational Safety and Health \n     Administration has proposed nationwide workplace rules, they \n     are not yet in effect. Regulations vary by state or city.\n       ``This study will be of enormous help to legislative \n     bodies, statewide and locally, who are trying to get limits \n     on smoking, especially in controversial areas like \n     restaurants and bars, where the tobacco industry has worked \n     closely with restaurant associations to block legislation to \n     make these places go smoke free,'' said Edward Sweda, a \n     senior lawyer with the Tobacco Control Resource Center at \n     Northeastern University in Boston.\n       The study may be particularly pertinent for one lawsuit.\n       ``From our standpoint, that's a wonderful study,'' said \n     Stanley Rosenblatt, a Miami lawyer representing flight \n     attendants in a class-action suit against tobacco companies \n     that will go to trial on June 2.\n       That suit is the first class-action suit based on the \n     effects of secondhand smoke. The case could ultimately \n     involve 60,000 former and current flight attendants, who will \n     be seeking billions in damages, Rosenblatt said. The \n     attendants contend they were harmed by smoke in airplane \n     cabins when smoking was legal on most flights. Most of the \n     plaintiffs have had lung cancer or respiratory ailments.\n       The Philip Morris Cos., which is named in the flight \n     attendants' suit, declined to comment on the study. The \n     Tobacco Institute, an industry group, said it could not \n     comment on the study because it has not seen a copy of it.\n       The data being reported on Tuesday are from the Nurses' \n     Health Study, a project that began in 1976 with 121,700 \n     female nurses filling out detailed surveys every two years \n     about their health and habits. To measure the effects of \n     passive smoking, the researchers asked the women in 1982 \n     about their exposure, and then monitored new cases of heart \n     disease for the next decade. The analysis did not include all \n     the study participants, but only the 32,046 who had never \n     smoked and who at the onset did not have heart disease or \n     cancer.\n       The women who reported being exposed regularly to cigarette \n     smoke at home or work had a 91 percent higher risk of heart \n     attack than those with no exposure. Even though the women \n     worked in hospitals some were exposed to smoke on the job \n     because at the time of the study many hospitals allowed \n     smoking in certain areas. The study was set up to make sure \n     that other risk factors like diabetes and high blood pressure \n     did not account for the difference between the two groups.\n       Laboratory studies of the effects of passive smoke on the \n     body support the survey findings, Glantz said.\n       In studies of both people and animals. Glantz and other \n     researchers have identified several ways in which the \n     chemicals in secondhand smoke can contribute to heart \n     disease. Besides reducing a person's oxygen supply, the \n     substances damage arteries, lower levels of the beneficial \n     form of cholesterol known as HDL and increase the tendency of \n     blood platelets to stick to one another and form clots that \n     can trigger a heart attack. A study last year of healthy \n     teen-agers and adults exposed to passive smoking for an hour \n     or more a day detected artery damage. The higher the exposure \n     was, the greater the damage.\n       But once the exposure ceases, the damage may quickly heal.\n       ``In active smokers, the risk of heart disease drops \n     immediately,'' half of the way to that of a nonsmoker within \n     a year, Glantz said. ``It never gets quite back to the \n     nonsmoker's level, but it comes close,'' he said. ``One would \n     expect the same to be true for passive smoking.''\n       The Harvard study may supply ammunition for more lawsuit \n     against the tobacco industry.\n       ``I think it could have very profound implications \n     legally,'' said John Banzhaf, a law professor at George \n     Washington University and executive director of Action on \n     Smoking and Health, an antismoking group. ``We now have proof \n     which will meet the legal threshold requirement. In an \n     ordinary civil suit, you have to prove something by what we \n     call a preponderance of evidence, which means it's more \n     probable than not.''\n       The doubling of risk shown on Tuesday's study satisfied \n     that requirement, Banzhaf said, adding, ``You're right in \n     that striking range with regard to the quantum of proof which \n     we need.''\n       Because passive smoke can cause heart problems more quickly \n     than it causes lung cancer, Banzhaf said, it will be easier \n     to prove the connection to juries.\n       The study may also affect negotiations between Northwest \n     Airlines and its flight attendants. The airline still allows \n     smoking on many of its flights to Japan and has stated that \n     it will continue to even after other American carriers ban \n     smoking on those routes in July.\n       Flight attendants have protested the decision, but a \n     spokesman for Northwest, John Austin, said the airline would \n     maintain a smoking section because its major competitor on \n     those flights, Japan Air Lines, permitted smoking.\n       ``We believe that absent a smoking section we'll lose quite \n     a bit of business in Japan,'' Austin said. But he added that \n     Northwest's management had not yet seen the Harvard study. \n     ``It'll certainly factor in,'' he said. ``But it's hard to \n     say what the impact will be.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 828. A bill to provide for the reduction in the number of children \nwho use tobacco products, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n[[Page S5258]]\n\n                      THE NO TOBACCO FOR KIDS ACT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for more than 5 years now, the tobacco \ncompanies have said repeatedly, ``We do not want to sell our products \nto kids.'' They have bought full page ads in the Washington Post, the \nNew York Times, and the Wall Street Journal, saying that they adamantly \noppose the sale of tobacco to kids.\n  I don't know many kids who read the Wall Street Journal, the New York \nTimes, or the Washington Post. What the tobacco companies have been \ndoing is creating a sham that they are serious about reducing sales to \nkids.\n  Let's take a look at the record. From 1991 to 1996, the percentage of \nchildren who use tobacco increased by almost 50 percent. This means \nthat, at the same time the tobacco companies have been saying they are \ndedicated to reducing the illegal sales of tobacco to kids, more and \nmore children have been buying the tobacco products those companies \nsell.\n  That is not an accident. This multi-billion dollar industry is made \nup of tobacco companies that design their marketing and advertising to \nlure new customers into this addiction. The fact that more and more \nchildren are smoking is clear evidence that the tobacco companies have \nfailed, once again, to tell the truth. They need these new, young \ncustomers to prop up their profits as older customers die or quit using \ntobacco. And they continue to do what it takes to secure a new \ngeneration of young people who are becoming hooked on their products.\n  Today, I am introducing, along with Senator Frank Lautenberg and \nCongressman Henry Waxman, a new piece of legislation that says the only \nhonest way to approach the reduction of tobacco sales to children is to \nmake the tobacco companies put their profits on the line.\n  The NO Tobacco For Kids Act says we will do a survey of the tobacco \nproducts for sale and find out how many children are using those \nproducts and what brands they are using. Then, each year, we will \nupdate that survey to see which products continue to be purchased by \nchildren. Those companies that continue to sell their products to \nchildren will face a fine of $1 a pack on all their sales if they don't \nreduce the number of children using their brands in steps to reach a \nreduction of 90 percent over the next 6 years. Since current childhood \nusers will cycle out of the underage population over that time, this \nmeasure will give the tobacco companies a chance to show whether they \nare serious about reducing the use of tobacco products by kids.\n  Unless the tobacco companies have their profits on the line, we will \ncontinue to get cheap talk from them about stopping sales to kids. This \nbill puts teeth into the campaign to stop selling tobacco products to \nchildren. It sets a very simple standard for the tobacco companies: \nstop selling cigarettes and spit tobacco to children, or pay the \nconsequences.\n  In the past, every child hooked on tobacco was a new profit center \nfor the tobacco industry. This legislation totally reverses the \nincentives for marketing to children. When this measure becomes law, \nevery new child who picks up a cigarette or pockets a can of spit \ntobacco will become an economic loss to the company whose products the \nchild chooses. With that reversal, the tobacco companies will have a \nstrong economic incentive to stop marketing to children.\n  Mr. President, this legislation could be one the simplest yet most \neffective steps we can take to reduce teenage tobacco use. I invite my \ncolleagues to cosponsor the NO Tobacco For Kids Act and help us put in \nplace clear performance standards for the tobacco industry to stop \nselling their products to minors.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of this bill and the text of \nthe bill appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 828\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Children.--The term ``children'' means individuals \n     under the age of 18.\n       (2) Cigarette.--The term ``cigarette'' has the same meaning \n     given such term by section 3(1) of the Federal Cigarette \n     Labeling and Advertising Act (15 U.S.C. 1332(1)).\n       (3) Cigarette tobacco.--The term ``cigarette tobacco'' \n     means any product that consists of loose tobacco that \n     contains or delivers nicotine and is intended for use by \n     consumers in a cigarette.\n       (4) Manufacture.--The term ``manufacture'' means the \n     manufacturing, including repacking or relabeling, \n     fabrication, assembly, processing, labeling, or importing of \n     a tobacco product.\n       (5) Manufacturer.--The term ``manufacturer'' means any \n     person who manufactures a tobacco product.\n       (6) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services.\n       (7) Smokeless tobacco.--The term ``smokeless tobacco'' has \n     the same meaning given such term by section 9(1) of the \n     Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Education Act of 1986 (15 \n     U.S.C. 4408(1)).\n       (8) Tobacco product.--The term ``tobacco product'' means a \n     cigarette, cigarette tobacco, or smokeless tobacco.\n       (9) Unit.--The term ``unit'' when used in connection with a \n     tobacco product means 20 cigarettes in the case of cigarettes \n     and the smallest amount of tobacco distributed by a \n     manufacturer for consumer use in the case of any other \n     tobacco product.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               The NO Tobacco for Kids Act (NOT for Kids)\n\n       The NO Tobacco for Kids Act (NOT for Kids) will establish a \n     clear performance standard for the reduction of youth smoking \n     in America. For too many years, the tobacco companies have \n     claimed they oppose youth smoking and spit tobacco use while \n     continuing to hook new generations of kids on their deadly \n     products. This bill sets out a schedule to reduce actual \n     youth tobacco use and contains provisions that, for the first \n     time, will give individual tobacco companies an economic \n     incentive to stop marketing their products to children. \n     Specifically, the bill provides that:\n       Within 1 year after enactment, the Secretary of HHS will \n     conduct a survey to determine the number of children who used \n     each manufacturer's tobacco products within the previous 30 \n     days.\n       Each manufacturer will then face penalties if it does not \n     reduce the number of children who use its tobacco products by \n     specified percentages from this baseline level over the \n     succeeding years. The performance standard for each \n     manufacturer is as follows: Year 1: no standard, baseline \n     survey is taken; year 2: 20-percent reduction from the \n     baseline; year 3: 40-percent reduction from the baseline; \n     year 4: 60-percent reduction from the baseline; year 5: 80-\n     percent reduction from the baseline; year 6: 90-percent \n     reduction from the baseline; and subsequent years: 90-percent \n     reduction from the baseline.\n       Manufacturers that reduce use to a de minimus level--one-\n     half percent of the current number of youth smokers--will be \n     deemed in compliance.\n       If a manufacturer violates the performance standard, that \n     manufacturer must pay a noncompliance fee of $1 per pack, \n     pouch, can, et cetera, on all of their tobacco sales in the \n     subsequent year--not just on sales to youth. If the \n     manufacturer violates the performance standard for 2 or more \n     consecutive years, the noncompliance fee is increased by $1 \n     for each consecutive year of violation. A manufacturer who \n     comes within 10 percent of the required reduction for a \n     particular year will have its noncompliance fee reduced on a \n     pro rata basis.\n       The first $1 billion of noncompliance fees collected in any \n     fiscal year will go into a fund for enforcement and public \n     education to discourage children from using tobacco products. \n     Any additional fees will go to the Treasury for deficit \n     reduction.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mrs. Feinstein and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 829. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nencourage the production and use of clean-fuel vehicles, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   THE CLEAN-FUEL VEHICLE ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Clean Fuel \nVehicle Act of 1997 to provide a program of tax incentives and other \nchanges to promote the use of clean fuel vehicles. I believe that, as a \nU.S. Senator, I have no greater responsibility than to support policies \nthat will protect the health and safety of the American people. Today, \nI want to tell you why I believe that my bill, the Clean Fuel Vehicle \nAct, is an important part of meeting that responsibility.\n  More than 43 million people in the United States live in areas that \nfail to meet EPA's air quality standards for carbon monoxide. We have \n13 million people in nonattainment areas for nitrogen oxide. And, in my \nState of California, nearly 26 million people live in a nonattainment \narea for one or more pollutants, out of a state of nearly 32 million \npeople. Air pollution is a very serious problem. According to the EPA, \nthe current annual average concentrations of fine particulate matter in \nsoutheast Los Angeles County may be responsible for up to 3,000 deaths \nannually, and more then 52,000 incidences of respiratory symptoms \nincluding 1,000 hospital admissions.\n  Young children constitute the largest group at high risk from \nexposure to air pollutants. They breathe 50 percent more air by body \nweight than the average adult. In California alone there are over 6 \nmillion children under the age of 14 and approximately 90 percent of \nthem live in areas that fail to meet State and Federal standards. How \nare our children being affected? Studies show health effects ranging \nfrom 20 to 60 percent losses of lung capacity.\n  So much of our air pollution problem comes from automobiles and other \nvehicles that burn fossil fuel. Sixty-five percent of carbon dioxide \nemissions and 47 percent of nitrogen oxide emissions come from cars and \ntrucks.\n  I believe we must reinvigorate--electrify if you will--our efforts \nfor clean fuel vehicles. The role of the Federal Government should be \nto encourage the market for these vehicles for a limited period of time \nwith tax incentives.\n  The Clean Fuel Vehicle Act would make it easier for both individual \ncar buyers and government purchasers of auto fleets to purchase clean \nfuel vehicles. In summary, the bill repeals the luxury excise tax on \nclean fuel vehicles--a $320 savings this year on a $40,000, factory-\nbuilt electric vehicle, and repeals the luxury tax depreciation cap. It \nprovides a full tax credit of $4,000 on the purchase of an electric \nvehicle. It allows companies which lease electric vehicles to \ngovernment agencies to take advantage of the tax incentives and pass on \nthe savings. It makes electric buses and other heavy duty electric \nvehicles eligible for the same tax deduction already in place for other \nclean fuel buses and heavy duty equipment. It lowers the excise tax on \nliquified natural gas--used in heavy vehicles such as tractor-trailer \nrigs and buses--to the gasoline gallon equivalent of compressed natural \ngas so that it can be competitive with diesel fuel. And, it sunsets all \nthese tax incentives by January 1, 2005.\n  According to estimates by the Joint Committee on Taxation, the bill \nwould cost only about $22 million over 5 years. My bill is endorsed by \nthe Union of Concerned Scientists, the Electric Transportation \nCoaltion, and the Natural Gas Vehicle/USA.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 829\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, in offering this resolution, Mr. President, \nwhich formally disapproves President Clinton's renewal of MFN for \nChina, I am pleased that the able Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] \nis a principal cosponsor of the resolution of disapproval.\n  In moving around my State during the Memorial Day recess I was \nimpressed with the attitude of a majority of North Carolinians who are \nabsolutely persuaded that the United States must conduct its policy \ntoward China on the basis of morality as well as pragmatism. It has \nmade no sense either morally or practically for the United States to \nhave conducted its China policy as it has for so long.\n  There are many who are asserting the truth that the term MFN, which \nstands for most favored nation, is certainly a misnomer. MFN, in fact, \nmeans that a country gets trade treatment as good as anybody else's, \nnot that it gets more favorable treatment than any other country. I \naccept that and I oppose MFN on exactly those grounds. China gets the \nsame trade treatment that virtually everybody else gets. When a country \nlike China gets normal trade relations with the United States it is \ngetting better treatment than China deserves. That is just plain \nfoolish.\n  Those who favor MFN for Communist China also like to point out that \nother countries with at least equally dubious records--like Iran, Iraq, \nSyria, Libya and Burma--qualify for MFN without an annual debate. \nTherefore, the proMFN crowd says China ought to get MFN without an \nannual debate.\n  I dissent. The trouble with that, Mr. President, is this. Those \npeople who rely on the cases of these countries to make their points \nabout MFN for China just have not done their homework. It is \ndisingenuous at best for the proMFN lobby to create the impression that \nIran, Iraq, Libya and Syria, enjoy MFN status, because they absolutely\n\n[[Page S5261]]\n\ndo not. MFN for Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Libya is a moot point since \nnearly all trade is banned with them due to their involvement in state-\nsponsored terrorism.\n  Burma may technically have MFN status but it, also, is the subject of \na ban on new United States investment. Syria and Burma both are denied \nlow-tariff benefits under the generalized system of preferences. \nBesides that, policies against individual countries have evolved in \nresponse to historical developments and the needs of U.S. policy. No \nproponent of MFN renewal would say that the United States should treat \nevery country exactly the same way regardless of specific conditions \ninside the country, the type of government it has, or the type of \nthreat it poses to the United States or to the neighbors of the United \nStates.\n  Now, China is a special case, Mr. President. When you stop to think \nabout it there is no valid reason for the United States--this is the \nworld's leader in freedom--offering the same trading terms for China \nthat the United States offers to other nations that do honor their \ncitizens' human rights and that do respect the rule of law. Now, there \ncan be no such thing as normal trade with the world's largest country, \na Communist system engaging in proliferation of conventional nuclear, \nbiological, and chemical weapons.\n  A country of which our State Department can say, there was not a \nsingle dissident active in 1996.\n  A country which is violating commitments it made in an international \nagreement to preserve Hong Kong's institutions and way of life \nvirtually intact.\n  A country whose economy is built on prison labor and Peoples \nLiberation Army joint ventures with U.S. companies.\n  A country which fires missiles across the Taiwan strait in an attempt \nto intimidate the people of Taiwan from conducting democratic \nelections.\n  A country which makes money from organ transplants taken from \nprisoners, who have just been shot in the head.\n  A country which has a policy of forced abortion.\n  A country which has systematically destroyed Tibet's religion and \nculture.\n  A country which violates international law in the South China Sea.\n  A country which has a huge and growing trade deficit with the United \nStates.\n  It matters not whether one calls China's trade status most favored \nnation, or normal trade relations as the White House Office of \n``newspeak'' wishes to call it. Either way, it's a bad policy, when one \nconsiders that in every important area of United States-China \nrelations--from weapons proliferation, to human rights, to trade and \nintellectual property, to Hong Kong--the White House crowd has made the \nword ``engagement'' synonymous with the word ``appeasement.''\n  Let's talk for a little while about China's record of weapons \nproliferation. In April, a subcommittee of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee chaired by the able Senator from Mississippi, [Mr. Cochran], \nheld a hearing which laid out the truth about Chinese proliferation, \nthat this administration has repeatedly failed to impose sanctions \nrequired by United States law for China's transfers of equipment, \ncomponents and weapons of mass destruction to Iran and Pakistan.\n  On human rights, the State Department acknowledges continued \nwidespread abuse of human rights by China. This year's annual human \nrights report catalogues violations of rights of speech, assembly, and \nassociation, and abuses including extra-judicial punishment, prison \nlabor, and religious repression.\n  Even more shocking than the extent of these abuses is the \nadministration's refusal to use United States leverage to influence \nChina, or even United States allies. This year, the United States \nfailed to mount a credible campaign to introduce and pass a resolution \ncondemning Chinese human rights abuses at the U.N. Human Rights \nCommission in Geneva.\n  The Commission's meeting is not a mystery. It is scheduled a year in \nadvance. Yet this administration did almost no lobbying until the last \nminute. That's because the administration hoped against hope that the \nVice President's trip to China would result in some concessions by the \nChinese which would enable the administration to abandon the resolution \nonce and for all.\n  But just guess what happened. China did not make concessions to Vice \nPresident Gore and the Clinton administration was left trying to put \ntogether a coalition at Geneva.\n  In trade, the story is the same. There is absolutely no improvement. \nThe United States trade deficit with China climbed once again this \nyear, to just under 40 percent. According to the President, that's an \nincrease of 17 percent over last year. United States companies have \nprecious little access to China's market, even as they are pouring \ninvestment into China. Sometimes, United States companies deal with the \nPeople's Liberation Army. Sometimes they deal with factories using with \nprison labor. That is the way the game is played--under cover, under \nthe table.\n  The United States buys 30 percent of China's exports. Yet China makes \nup just 2 percent of the United States export market--30 vs. 2. This \npast year, United States exports to Taiwan, Hong Kong--and even to \nBelgium, if you believe that, were greater than United States exports \nto China, even though the populations of each of these countries are a \ntiny fraction of China's population.\n  Just the same, we hear the same old rhetoric from certain \nbusinessmen. They come to my office day after day. I like them. I am \nsorry I can't agree with them. But I tell them I do not agree with \nthem. They sit there and contend that the United States needs to trade \nwith China. It will open up society; that is to say, the Chinese \nsociety, they say. But what is going on in China isn't free trade but \ntrade on the Chinese Government's terms, which can be changed every \nhour on the hour.\n  The Chinese military operates commercial enterprises. Let me repeat \nthat. The Chinese military army, all the rest of it, they are in \nbusiness. They do that so they can pay for the ever-growing cost of \noperating their military establishment--and, by the way, collect \ntechnology from the United States and other sucker governments who send \nit to them.\n  No rule of law protects Chinese or foreign investors. Official \ncorruption is widespread, and everybody knows it. A disagreement with a \nbusiness partner who has an official connection can land you in jail in \nChina, or worse. You might be one of the guys hauled out on that field \ntomorrow morning with a bullet through your head so that one of your \norgans can be sold for $40,000 cash money.\n  Want a run down of stories you won't hear from those lobbying \nCongress for MFN?\n  In 1994, Revpower, a Florida company won an international arbitration \naward against a Chinese state-owned enterprise. Despite China's \nobligations as a party to the 1958 Convention on Recognition and \nEnforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, China has failed to enforce the \naward in its courts.\n  In 1994, James Peng, an Australian citizen, was seized by Chinese \npolice in Macau--which is not yet under Chinese control--and taken to \nChina. In this case, the court found Peng innocent of any wrongdoing, \nbut local officials who saw an opportunity to extort money from Peng \nand his partners. Peng has been in jail ever since.\n  Troy McBride, a United States businessman, had his passport seized \nand was detained for several weeks in a hotel in China in 1995. You can \nread about this in last year's State Department Human Rights Report.\n  According to the Chicago Tribune, Philip Cheng, a Chinese-American, \nwas jailed without charges in 1993 over a dispute with his joint \nventure partner. In the story about Mr. Cheng, a Western diplomat was \nquoted as saying:\n\n       When a deal goes sour we only hear about the worst cases. \n     But dozens, perhaps hundreds of businessmen have been mobbed, \n     punched and even jailed to make them pay what the locals \n     demand. In most cases the victims make no fuss because their \n     companies want to keep doing business in China.\n\n  Zhang Gueixing, a U.S. resident immigrant was imprisoned for 2\\1/2\\ \nyears in connection with a dispute over bicycles. While in prison, \nZhang witnessed executions of prisoners.\n  China has steadily reneged on its commitments in the 1984 Joint \nDeclaration. In that agreement, China\n\n[[Page S5262]]\n\npromised that Hong Kong would have an elected legislature, an \naccountable executive, an independent judiciary, and a broad range of \npersonal and political freedoms including rights of speech, assembly, \nassociation, and religion. For the past several years China has first \nannounced a violation of the joint declaration, then carried it out. \nThis is all a matter of public record.\n  Yet, the United States has failed to prevent or reverse a single \nviolation of the joint declaration. How can it when the \nadministration's official position is that the United States is not \nentitled to say what does or does not violate the Joint Declaration?\n  Where the President will not lead, the Congress must act. An \neditorial from The Weekly Standard noted that:\n\n       The Clinton Administration obstinately refuses to link U.S. \n     China policy to anything the Chinese do or fail to do. \n     Linkage must be reestablished; equilibrium must be restored \n     to the relationship between the United States and its most \n     troublesome and persistent challenger. That mission falls to \n     the Congress by default.\n\n  For far too long, the United States has failed to recognize and use \nits leverage over China.\n  Mr. President, revoking MFN will not be the end of our China policy. \nMFN is the means toward restoring equilibrium in the relationship.\n  China scholar Harry Harding's book, ``A Fragile Relationship,'' \nchronicles the early 1990's, when there was a real threat of MFN \nrevocation in response to the Tiananmen Square Massacre. In response to \nthe threat Beijing ended martial law, released several hundred \npolitical prisoners, bought Boeing aircraft and let a prominent \ndissident out of the country.\n  The Congress should withhold MFN status for China this year, \notherwise the administration will continue to acquiesce to every \nviolation of international law, international agreement, bilateral \nagreement, and United States law. The administration's policy toward \nChina has been an abject failure. Abject, means both ``utterly \nhopeless'' and ``shamelessly servile.'' Which, it seems to me, fairly \nsums up the situation.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The joint resolution will be appropriately \nreferred.\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee [Mr. Helms] and I have today introduced a joint \nresolution of disapproval for the President's decision to extend most-\nfavored-nation status to China.\n  This is third year in a row that I will be introducing this joint \nresolution, and--I am pleased to say--the second time with Senator \nHelms. I have joined with the chairman once again because I believe \nthat trade policy is an effective tool that the United States can and \nshould use with respect to the Chinese Government. I am pleased that \nSenators Wellstone and Hutchinson of Arkansas have joined us in \nintroducing this bipartisan resolution.\n  Mr. President, on May 19, President Clinton announced his intention \nto extend for another year most-favored-nation trading status to China, \nwhich he formally requested from the Congress last week. Although we \nhave expected the President to make such a decision for some time now, \nI can only say that I am once again disappointed in the President's \ndecision. In fact, I have objected to the President's policy regarding \nthe extension of MFN status to China since 1994, when he de-linked the \nissue of human rights from our trading policy. The argument made then \nis that trade rights and human rights are not interrelated. At the same \ntime, it was said, through ``constructive engagement'' on economic \nmatters, and dialogue on other issues, including human rights, the \nUnited States could better influence the behavior of the Chinese \nGovernment.\n  That was a mistake.\n  Let those who support ``constructive engagement'' visit the terribly \nill Wei Jingsheng in his prison cell, and ask him if developing markets \nfor toothpaste or breakfast cereal will help him win his freedom or \nsave his life. I do not see how closer economic ties alone will somehow \ntransform China's authoritarian system into a more democratic one. \nUnless we press the case for improvement in China's human rights \nrecord, using the leverage afforded us by the Chinese Government's \ndesire to expand its economy and increase trade with us, I do not see \nhow conditions will get much better.\n  De-linking MFN has resulted only in the continued despair of millions \nof Chinese people, and there is no evidence that MFN has influenced \nBeijing to improve its human rights policies. Basic freedoms--of \nexpression, of religion, of association--are routinely denied. Rule of \nlaw, at least as I would define it, does not exist.\n  Mr. President, shortly before the Memorial Day recess, the Foreign \nRelations Committee held several hearings on the current situation in \nChina. We had, for example, an excellent hearing on the situation in \nTibet, where China continues its cultural and political repression and \nstill refuses to begin a dialogue with the Dalai Lama, a Nobel \nlaureate. We also heard testimony about how China is not sticking to \nits commitments under a 1992 Memorandum of Understanding with the \nUnited States on the issue of the use of forced prison labor. It is \nunconscionable that American consumers have unwittingly been used to \nhelp finance the abhorrent Chinese policy of reform through labor.\n  And that is not all.\n  Virtually every review of the behavior of the Chinese Government over \nthe past year demonstrates that not only has there been no improvement \nin the human rights situation in China, but in many cases, it has \nworsened.\n  Now, 3 years after the President's decision to de-link MFN from human \nrights, the State Department's most recent Human Rights report on China \ndescribes, once again, an abysmal situation. According to the report,\n\n       The Government continued to commit widespread and well-\n     documented human rights abuses, in violation of \n     internationally accepted norms, stemming from the \n     authorities' intolerance of dissent, fear of unrest, and \n     the absence or inadequacy of laws protecting basic \n     freedoms. . . . Abuses included torture and mistreatment \n     of prisoners, forced confessions, and arbitrary and \n     lengthy incommunicado detention. Prison conditions \n     remained harsh. The Government continued severe \n     restrictions on freedom of speech, the press, assembly, \n     association, religion, privacy, and worker rights.\n\n  In October 1996, we were witness to yet another example of these \npolicies, when Wang Dan, one of the leaders of the 1989 pro-democracy \ndemonstrations in Tiananmen Square, was sentenced to 11 years in \nprison. This was, of course, after he had already been held in \nincommunicado detention for 17 months in connection with the issuance \nof a pro-democracy petition. Many political prisoners--some whose names \nwe know, like Mr. Wang and Mr. Wei, and many of whose names we do not--\nhave become ill as a result of their prolonged incarcerations, and are \nnot receiving proper medical care.\n  The past year also saw the December arrest of Ngawang Choepel, a \nTibetan musicologist and former Fulbright scholar who was the subject \nof a recent Moynihan resolution that I was proud to cosponsor. Also in \nDecember, a Beijing court sentenced activist Li Hai for collecting \ninformation on Tiananmen activists in prison. Li was trying to compile \na list giving the name, age, family situation, crime, length of \nsentence, and the location of the prison in which these activists were \nheld.\n  In June 1996, university teacher Zhang Zong-ai was arrested and later \nsentenced for meeting with Wang Dan and writing to Taiwanese leaders. \nEarlier this year, reports emerged from Tibet indicating severe torture \nof Tibetan nuns allegedly involved in separatist activities.\n  Freedom of expression is curtailed by other means as well. Although \nthe government has recently encouraged the expansion of the Internet \nand other communications infrastructure, it requires Internet users to \nregister and sign a pledge not to endanger security. Selected web \nsites, like those from news organizations based in Hong Kong and \nTaiwan, or those hosted by dissidents, are blocked by the government, \nand authorities continue to jam Voice of America broadcasts.\n  Mr. President, Beijing's contempt for United States values is evident \nin many fora: in the loathsome compulsory one-child family planning \nprogram, in the increased incidence of religious persecution, in the \nsales of nuclear equipment to Pakistan or missiles to Iran, and in \nChina's utter disregard for agreements to end violations of United \nStates intellectual property\n\n[[Page S5263]]\n\nrights. Lack of progress in these areas flies in the face of the United \nStates policy of ``constructive engagement,'' with respect to China.\n  In my view--and I know that Senator Helms agrees with me here--it is \nimpossible to come to any other conclusion except that ``constructive \nengagement'' has failed to make any change in Beijing's human rights \nbehavior. I would say that the evidence justifies the exact opposite \nconclusion: human rights have deteriorated and the regime continues to \nact recklessly in other areas vital to U.S. national interest.\n  At the May 13, 1997, Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on \nThe Situation of Tibet and its People, Dr. Robert Thurman, a renowned \nexpert in Tibetan culture who has traveled to the region numerous times \nover the past 35 years, presented compelling testimony about the \nChinese Government's intentions toward the Tibetan people. Dr. Thurman \nexplained quite clearly that, ``It is a calculated policy consistent \n[of the] Chinese Government . . . to eradicate those who might some day \nclaim the land of Tibet back to them.'' In order to achieve this goal, \nDr. Thurman explained, the Chinese Government engages in all kinds of \nactivities to destroy Tibetan culture, Tibetan religion and Tibetan \nidentity, and in so doing, attempts to assimilate Tibetans into the \nChinese way of life.\n  But what was most striking about Dr. Thurman's testimony was his \ndescription of the behavior of the Chinese Government over the past 3 \nyears, and in particular, Beijing's reaction to United States trade \npolicy. Mr. President, allow me to read from his oral testimony:\n\n       It is definitely a fact that anyone who goes to Tibet \n     regularly--and I have been there eight times--anyone who goes \n     there regularly will tell you that since 1994, when our \n     Executive Branch misguidedly delinked . . . trade \n     privileges from the Chinese behavior, the Chinese behavior \n     accelerated in a negative direction to an extreme degree. \n     Since 1994, the complete oppression of Tibetan religion \n     and the Tibetan national identity has been reembarked upon \n     by the recent and current administration in China. From \n     1994 to 1997, their policy has returned to being \n     completely genocidal, no longer pretending even to \n     tolerate Tibetan religion. . . . They have expelled many \n     monks from monasteries. They have closed important \n     monasteries. . . . [The Chinese] will never abandon \n     [Tibet] when they feel we have no real will to do anything \n     serious no matter what they do. . . . This has been proven \n     in religious terms . . . in the last three years, since \n     1994. Once you delinked the money from their treatment of \n     human rights, from their treatment of religion in Tibet, \n     they just went and completely abused everything totally. \n     They undid all sorts of liberties that had been allowed in \n     the 1980s, in fact. They completely have undone them.\n\n  So, Mr. President, we have here compelling testimony of my main \nargument: that the delinking of trade privileges from human rights \nissues has actually led to a worsening of the human rights situation in \nChina.\n  Perhaps equally disturbing, China continues to violate agreements \nwith the United States on other issues. Violations of agreements on \nintellectual property rights cost U.S. firms an estimated $1.8 billion \nannually. Violations of the memorandum of understanding on prison \nlabor, according to some estimates, have resulted in millions of \ndollars worth of tainted goods being imported into our country. And \nChina's blatant disregard for international efforts to control nuclear \nproliferation cost us unimaginable sums in future international \nsecurity.\n  We have so few levers that we can use against China. And if China is \naccepted by the international community as a superpower under the \ncurrent conditions, it will believe it can continue to abuse human \nrights with impunity. The more we ignore the signals and allow trade to \ndictate our policy, the worse we can expect the human rights situation \nto become.\n  We know that putting pressure on the Chinese Government can have some \nimpact. China released dissident Harry Wu from prison when his case \nthreatened to disrupt the First Lady's trip to Beijing for the U.N. \nConference on Women, and it similarly released both Wei Jingsheng and \nWang Dan around the same time that China was pushing to have the 2000 \nOlympic Games in Beijing. After losing that bid, and once the spotlight \nwas off, the Chinese government rearrested both Wei and Wang.\n  Examples such as this only affirm my belief that the United States \nshould make it clear that human rights are of real--as opposed to \nrhetorical--concern to this country. Until Wei Jingsheng, Wang Dan, and \nothers committed to reform in China are allowed to speak their voices \nfreely and work for change, United States-China relations should not be \nbased on a business-as-usual basis. Last Sunday, Fred Hiatt illustrated \nthis point in a Washington Post editorial called The Skyscraper and the \nBookstore. In recalling the 1993 tour of Beijing that Chinese leaders \noffered to Mr. Wei after he had been in prison for 14 years, Hiatt \nwonders whether the skyscraper, a powerful symbol of Western-style \neconomic modernization, or a bookstore, in which Wei found little \nliterary diversity, is the more significant portent for China's future. \nHiatt's point is that the more the United States focuses on its trade \nand economic relations with China, the more skyscrapers might be built \nin Beijing. But despite massive urban development, there has not been \nmassive development in the most basic freedoms of expression and ideas.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of Hiatt's \nJune 1, 1997, Washington Post op-ed be included in the Record.\n  Mr. President, this year--1997--is perhaps the most important year \nsince 1989 with respect to our relationship with the Chinese \nGovernment. In less than 1 month, Hong Kong will revert to China, and \nalready there are fears of what the transition may mean for democratic \nliberties in that city. There may also be significant developments with \nrespect to China's desire to join the World Trade Organization. And of \ncourse, there are the myriad other issues I have already mentioned.\n  But even with all that is going on, the United States and others in \nthe international community failed to pass a resolution regarding China \nat the United Nations Commission on Human Rights earlier this year \nlargely because China lobbied hard to prevent it. That failure proves \nthat it is even more important for the United States to use the levers \nthat we do have to pressure China's leaders.\n\n  Mr. President, if moral outrage at blatant abuse of human rights is \nnot reason enough for taking a tough stance with China--and I believe \nit is and that the American people do as well--then let us do so on \ngrounds of real political and economic self-interest. We must not \nforget that we currently have a trade deficit of nearly $40 billion. \nForty billion dollars. Political considerations aside, such a deficit \nrepresents a formidable obstacle to developing normal trading relations \nwith China at any point in the near future. Plus, China is becoming \nmore and more dangerously involved in nefarious arms dealings with Iran \nand Pakistan.\n  But, Mr. President, my main objective today is to push for the United \nStates to once again make the link between human rights and trading \nrelations with respect to our policy in China. As I have said before, I \nbelieve that trade--embodied by the peculiar annual exercise of MFN \nrenewal--is one of the most powerful levers we have, and that it was a \nmistake for the President to de-link this exercise from human rights \nconsiderations.\n  So, Mr. President, for those who care about human rights, about \nfreedom of religion, and about America's moral leadership in the world, \nI urge support for the Helms-Feingold resolution disapproving the \nPresident's decision to renew most-favored-nation status for China.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 1, 1997]\n\n                    The Skyscraper and the Bookstore\n\n                            (By Fred Hiatt)\n\n       After keeping him in prison for 14 years, Chinese leaders \n     decided one day in 1993 to give their leading dissident, Wei \n     Jingsheng, a tour of Beijing. For Wei, the tour produced a \n     shock--and perhaps something of a reproof as well. Wei had \n     been writing from his solitary cell that economic \n     modernization could not take place without democracy; yet the \n     sleepy capital he remembered from 1979, with only bicycles \n     clogging its wide boulevards, had become a modern city with \n     traffic jams, skyscrapers and fancy new hotels.\n       ``The changes are enormous,'' Wei admitted. ``They made an \n     old Beijinger like myself feel like a tourist--a stranger in \n     his own hometown.''\n       But then Wei insisted that his keepers take him to a \n     bookstore. There he found offerings no broader than they had \n     been before the Cultural Revolution. The economy had\n\n[[Page S5264]]\n\n     expanded, but freedom of thought and expression had not. \n     ``But this is precisely your goal,'' Wei wrote to China's \n     president. ``Widespread cultural ignorance is the foundation \n     for dictatorship.''\n       The contrast Wei noted during his brief field trip from \n     jail underlies Washington's current debate over extending \n     most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status to China and, more \n     broadly, U.S.-China relations. Which is the more significant \n     portent for China's future, the skyscraper or the bookshop?\n       Those who favor MFN extension point to the skyscraper, \n     arguing that economic modernization inevitably will lead to \n     political liberalization--that if you get enough skyscrapers, \n     eventually you'll get books and newspapers, too. This has \n     been the pattern in South Korea and Taiwan, after all, where \n     a rising middle class eventually insisted on democratic \n     rights. Even in China, where authoritarian rulers maintain \n     tight political control, market reforms have brought new \n     freedoms--to choose one's place of work and residence, to \n     live private and personal lives.\n       Yet a South Korea-style progression is not inevitable. Nazi \n     Germany proved that a totalitarian political regime can \n     comfortably co-exist with capitalism--with private \n     shopkeepers, big corporations, a developed middle class.\n       Ah, but the advent of the information age has changed all \n     that, the argument continues. Knowledge is the essential \n     commodity of tomorrow's economies, and no nation that limits \n     its flow can prosper.\n       It's a seductive argument, and it may be true in the very \n     long run. The demise of the Soviet Union, where even a \n     copying machine was considered subversive, gave currency to \n     the view. But totalitarian regimes can use information \n     technologies as well as be undermined by them as George \n     Orwell realized some time ago. China's regime so far has \n     proved far more adept than the Soviet Union at attracting \n     commercial knowledge and technology from outside while \n     controlling the political debate inside--intimidating print \n     media in Hong Kong, monitoring Internet access in China, \n     whipping up nationalistic fervor to promote its own survival.\n       So China might become more democratic; it also might become \n     more fascist, a danger to its neighbors and to U.S. \n     interests, too. Given that uncertainty, the debate shifts: \n     Can other nations do anything to steer China toward the first \n     outcome? Supporters of MFN extension argue that trade \n     sanctions won't work; China ``has steadfastly resisted \n     efforts to link its commercial interests to its behavior in \n     other areas,'' Laura D'Andrea Tyson, President Clinton's \n     first term economic adviser, wrote in the Wall Street Journal \n     last week.\n       This isn't quite right either. In the few years after the \n     Tiananmen Square massacre, when China's leaders believed \n     Congress would impose serious sanctions, they released \n     political prisoners and allowed a leading dissident to go \n     into exile. Once President Clinton ``delinked'' trade and \n     human rights, the concessions stopped.\n       Yet trade sanctions are surely an imperfect tool. Are there \n     others? Tyson argues that ``with the limited means at our \n     disposal, we can try to shape the kind of great power China \n     will become and the path it will travel to get there.'' She \n     doesn't say what those means might be, but in 1994 the \n     Clinton administration produced a long list of possibilities. \n     The United States would no longer use MFN as a lever, Clinton \n     said then, but it would prod China in many other ways: \n     supporting ``civic society,'' pushing human rights issues in \n     international forums, working with U.S. businesses to develop \n     voluntary principles for operating in China and more.\n       Unfortunately, most of these resolutions fell by the \n     wayside, some right away, some after a few years. Clinton's \n     promise to use non-trade methods to ``try to shape'' China, \n     in Tyson's words, proved to be more spin than policy, so the \n     concept was never really put to the test. As a result, \n     political freedoms in China are, if anything, more \n     restricted, and many in Congress see MFN as the only way to \n     send a message.\n       Wei is back in prison and unavailable for comment on this \n     turn of events. In his prison letters, though (recently \n     published in this country), Wei maintained that a peaceful \n     evolution toward democracy would be almost impossible for \n     China unless other nations pushed in that direction, \n     supporting those Chinese who share their values.\n       ``One way to minimize losses and setbacks for all sides is \n     for countries with related interests to exert pressure and \n     help bring about internal progress and reform,'' Wei wrote in \n     1991. Six years later, Wei undoubtedly is still waiting.\n       The writer is a member of the editorial page staff.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, on my recent trip to Israel, I \nread an illustrative article in the Financial Times of London. It seems \nfinancial experts in England have come to a conclusion many financial \ninstitutions in the United States have failed, thus far, to reach. \nNamely, that it is too late to solve the year 2000 computer problem \ncompletely, and that it is hopeless to rely on a ``silver bullet'' to \nsolve the problem. Instead, officials in the United Kingdom have \nconcluded that the world economy faces a very time-consuming, labor-\nintensive project--the scope of which is unparalleled in modern \nhistory.\n  Upon my return to the United States, I found that Newsweek had just \npublished an important article that will increase awareness, I hope, to \nthe point of action. Thus, I remind my colleagues of my bill (S. 22) to \nset up a commission responsible for ensuring that all executive \nagencies are compliant by 2000. I hope my colleagues recognize--as the \nBritish have begun to do--what we now face and what we must do to \nensure the proper functioning not only of our Government, but of the \neconomy.\n\n[[Page S5269]]\n\n  I ask that the Newsweek cover story, ``The Day the World Shuts Down'' \nand the Financial Times of London's story, ``Millenium Bomb Ticks \nAway'' be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                      The Day the World Shuts Down\n\n       Drink deep from your champagne glasses as the ball drops in \n     Times Square to usher in the year 2000. Whether you imbibe or \n     not, the hangover may begin immediately. The power may go \n     out. Or the credit card you pull out to pay for dinner may no \n     longer be valid. If you try an ATM to get cash, that may not \n     work, either. Or the elevator that took you up to the party \n     ballroom may be stuck on the ground floor. Or the parking \n     garage you drove into earlier in the evening may charge you \n     more than your yearly salary. Or your car might not start. Or \n     the traffic lights might be on the blink. Or, when you get \n     home, the phones may not work. The mail may show up, but your \n     magazine subscriptions will have stopped, your government \n     check may not arrive, your insurance policies may have \n     expired.\n       Or you may be out of a job. When you show up for work after \n     the holiday, the factory or office building might be locked \n     up, with a handwritten sign taped to the wall: out of \n     business due to computer error.\n       Could it really happen? Could the most anticipated New \n     Year's Eve party in our lifetimes really usher in a digital \n     nightmare when our wired-up-the-wazoo civilization grinds to \n     a halt? Incredibly, according to computer experts, corporate \n     information officers, congressional leaders and basically \n     anyone who's given the matter a fair hearing, the answer is \n     yes, yes, 2,000 times yes! Yes--unless we successfully \n     complete the most ambitious and costly technology project in \n     history, one where the payoff comes not in amassing riches or \n     extending Web access, but securing raw survival.\n       What's the problem? It's called, variously, the Year 2000 \n     Problem, Y2K or the Millennium Bug. It represents the \n     ultimate indignity: the world laid low by two lousy digits. \n     The trouble is rooted in a seemingly trivial space-saving \n     programming trick--dropping the first two numbers of the \n     date, abbreviating, say, the year 1951 to ``51.'' This \n     digital relic from the days when every byte of computer \n     storage was precious was supposed to have been long gone by \n     now, but the practice became standard. While any idiot \n     familiar with the situation could figure out that the world's \n     computers were on a collision course with the millennium, no \n     one wanted to be the one to bring it up to management. And, \n     really, which executive would welcome a message from nerddom \n     that a few million bucks would be required to fix some \n     obscure problem that wouldn't show up for several years?\n       So only now, as the centurial countdown begins, are we \n     learning that the digit-dropping trick has changed from \n     clever to catastrophic. Because virtually all the mainframe \n     computers that keep the world humming are riddled with \n     software that refuses to recognize that when 1999 runs out, \n     the year 2000 follows. When that date arrives, the computers \n     are going to get very confused. (PCs aren't as affected; \n     sidebar.) So that seemingly innocuous trick now affects \n     everything from ATMs to weapons systems. Virtually every \n     government, state and municipality, as well as every \n     large, midsize and small business in the world, is going \n     to have to deal with this--in fact, if they haven't \n     started already it's just about too late. Fixing the \n     problem requires painstaking work. The bill for all this? \n     Gartner Group estimates it could go as high as $600 \n     billion. That amount could easily fund a year's worth of \n     all U.S. educational costs, preschool through grad school. \n     It's Bill Gates times 30!\n       That tab doesn't include the litigation that will \n     inevitably follow the system failures. ``You can make some \n     very reasonable extrapolations about litigation that take you \n     over $1 trillion, and those are very conservative \n     estimates,'' says Dean Morehous, a San Francisco lawyer. \n     (Conservative or not, this is more than three times the \n     yearly cost of all civil litigation in the United States.)\n       Come on, you say. Two measly digits? Can't we just unleash \n     some sort of robo-program on all that computer code and clean \n     it up? Well, no. Forget about a silver bullet. It seems that \n     in most mainframe programs, the date appears more often than \n     ``M*A*S*H'' reruns on television--about once every 50 lines \n     of code. Typically, it's hard to find those particular lines, \n     because the original programs, often written in the ancient \n     COBOL computer language, are quirky and undocumented. After \n     all that analysis, you have to figure out how to rewrite the \n     lines to correctly process the date. Only then comes the most \n     time-consuming step: testing the rewritten program.\n       It's a torturous process, but an absolutely necessary one. \n     Because if we don''t swat the millennium Bug, we'll have \n     troubles everywhere.\n       Electricity. When the Hawaiian Electric utility in Honolulu \n     ran tests on its system to see if it would be affected by the \n     Y2K Bug, ``basically, it just stopped working,'' says systems \n     analyst Wendell Ito. If the problem had gone unaddressed, not \n     only would some customers have potentially lost power, but \n     others could have got their juice at a higher frequency, in \n     which case, ``the clocks would go faster, and some things \n     could blow up,'' explains Ito. (Hawaiian Electric revamped \n     the software and now claims to be ready for the year 2000.) \n     Another concern is nuclear power; the Nuclear Regulatory \n     Commission says that the Bug might affect ``security control, \n     radiation monitoring . . . and accumulated burn-up \n     programs [which involve calculations to estimate the \n     hazard posed by radioactive fuel].''\n       Communications. ``If no one dealt with the year 2000 Bug, \n     the [phone] network would not operate properly,'' says Eric \n     Sumner Jr., a Lucent chief technology officer. He's not \n     talking about dial tones, but things like billing (watch out \n     for 100-year charges). Certain commercial operations that run \n     phone systems by computer could also go silent if the \n     software isn't fixed.\n       Medicine. Besides the expected mess in billing systems, \n     insurance claims and patient records, hospitals and doctors \n     have to worry about embedded chips--microprocessors inside \n     all sorts of devices that sometimes have date-sensitive \n     controls. The year 2000 won't make pacemakers stop dead, but \n     it could affect the data readouts it reports to physicians.\n       Weapons. Newsweek has obtained an internal Pentagon study \n     listing the Y2K impact on weapons and battlefield \n     technologies. In their current state, ``a year 2000 problem \n     exists'' in several key military technologies and they will \n     require upgrading or adjustments. One intelligence system \n     reverts to the year 1900, another reboots to 1969. The report \n     confidently states that as far as nuclear devices like \n     Trident missiles are concerned, ``there are no major \n     obstacles which will prevent them from being totally Year \n     2000 compliant by Jan. 1999.''\n       Money. Banks and other financial institutions generally \n     will go bonkers if they don't fix the year 2000 problem. The \n     Senate Banking Committee is even worried that vertiginous \n     computers might automatically erase the last 99 years worth \n     of bank records. Some Y2K consultants are advising consumers \n     to make sure they don't enter the 1999 holiday without \n     obtaining hard-copy evidence of their assets. According to \n     Jack Webb of HONOR Technologies, Inc., ATMs won't work \n     without fixes.\n       Food. In Britain computers at the Marks & Spencer company \n     have already mistakenly ordered the destruction of tons of \n     corned beef, believing they were more than 100 years old.\n       Air-Traffic Control. ``We're still in the assessment stage, \n     determining how big the problem is,'' says Dennis DeGaetano \n     of the Federal Aviation Administration. One possible danger \n     is computer lockup: while planes well keep moving at 12:01 \n     a.m. on Jan. 1, 2000, the screens monitoring them, if not \n     upgraded, might lock. Or the computers might know where the \n     planes were, but mix them up with flights recorded at the \n     same time on a previous day. (``You can bet we're going to \n     fix it,'' says DeGaetano.)\n       Factories. Ford Motor Co. reports that if the Bug isn't \n     fixed, its buildings could literally shut down--the factories \n     have security systems linked to the year. ``Obviously, if you \n     don't fix it, your business will stop in the year 2000,'' \n     says Ford's David Principato. Even if a manufacturing company \n     aggressively solves its own problem, though, it might be \n     flummoxed by a supplier who delivers widgets in the wrong \n     century.\n       Just About Everything Else. Larry Martin, CEO of Data \n     Dimensions, warns that if not adjusted, ``on Jan. 1, 2000, a \n     lot of elevators could be dropping to the bottom of \n     buildings,'' heading to the basement for inspections they \n     believe are overdue. Similarly, automobiles have as many as \n     100 chips; if they are calendar-challenged, experts say, \n     forget about driving. Computerized sprinkler systems could \n     initiate icy midwinter drenchings.\n       Like leaves rustling before a tornado, there have already \n     been harbingers of a bureaucratic meltdown. At a state \n     prison, a computer glitch misread the release date of \n     prisoners and freed them prematurely. In Kansas, a 104-year-\n     old woman was given a notice to enter kindergarten. Visa has \n     had to recall some credit cards with expiration dates three \n     years hence--the machines reading them thought they had \n     expired in the McKinley administration.\n       The $600 billion question is whether we'll fix the Bug in \n     time. The good news is that the computer industry is finally \n     responding to the challenge. For months now, squardrons of \n     digital Jeremiahs have been addressing tech conferences with \n     tales of impending apocalypse. The most sought-after is Peter \n     de Jager, a bearded Canadian who scares the pants off \n     audiences on a near-daily basis. ``If we shout from the \n     rooftops, they accuse us of hype,'' he complains. ``But if we \n     whisper in an alley, no one will listen.'' Last week in \n     Boston de Jager demonstrated the rooftop approach: ``If \n     you're not changing code by November of this year,'' he \n     warned, ``you will not get this thing done on time--it's that \n     simple. We still don't get it.''\n       But we're starting to. Most major corporations now have \n     year 2000 task forces, with full-time workers funded by \n     multimillion-dollar budgets, to fix a problem that their \n     bosses finally understand. They're aided by an army of \n     consultants and specialized companies. Some, like Data \n     Dimensions, offer full Y2K service, providing tools, \n     programmers and guidance. Others, like Peitus, sell special \n     software to help find offending code and, sometimes, even \n     convert it. (The final, most arduous stage, testing, still \n     defies automation.) These firms are the new darlings of Wall \n     Street. But buyer beware--consultants are coming out of the \n     woodwork to exploit the desperation of late-coming companies.\n\n[[Page S5270]]\n\n     Someone might promise a phalanx of brilliant programmers to \n     fix the Bug, but ``for all you know, it could be 10 people \n     in a garage doing it by hand,'' says Ted Swoyer, a Peritus \n     exec. Still, the creation of a Y2K-fixing infrastructure \n     is encouraging.\n       It's not uncommon to find gung-ho efforts like the one at \n     Merrill Lynch: an 80-person Y2K division working in shifts, \n     24 hours a day, seven days a week. It'll cost the company \n     $200 million, a sum that could hire Michael Eisner and fire \n     Mike Ovitz. ``Our return on investment is zero,'' says senior \n     VP Howard Sorgen. ``This will just enable us to stay in \n     business.''\n       So maybe we're not in for a full-scale disaster. Let us \n     assume--oh God let it be true--that those in charge of life-\n     sustaining applications and services will keep their promises \n     to fix what needs fixing. The costs and liabilities of not \n     doing so are too huge not to. (On the other hand, when did \n     you last see a huge software project that met its deadline \n     and worked perfectly? Just asking.) Still, there will almost \n     certainly be severe dislocations because of the mind-boggling \n     enormity of the problem.\n       Even the most diligent companies don't have total \n     confidence they can fix everything. Consider BankBoston, the \n     15th largest commercial bank in the United States. Early in \n     1995, the company realized that ``it was a problem that could \n     bring an institution to its knees,'' says David Iacino, who \n     heads the bank's Team 2000. To stop a meltdown, BankBoston \n     has to probe 60 million lines of code. the harder BankBoston \n     works at solving the problem--it now has 40 people working \n     full time on it--the more complicated it seems. ``Every day, \n     when we see something new we haven't thought about, we get \n     additional angst,'' said Iacino.\n       Of the 200 BankBoston applications that need revamping, \n     only a handful have been completed so far. BankBoston is now \n     separating the essential work from the noncritical, and if \n     the Bug causes less dire problems, like the heavy vault doors \n     swinging open on New Year's Eve, it'll just cope: ``Vaults \n     are physical things,'' says Iacino. ``If push comes to shove, \n     we can put a guard in front.''\n       Now, if BankBoston, which started early and has been \n     driving hard, is already thinking triage, what is going to \n     happen to institutions that are still negotiating in the face \n     of a nonnegotiable deadline? The Gartner Group is estimating \n     that half of all businesses are going to fall short. \n     ``There's still a large number of folks out there who haven't \n     started,'' says Matt Hotle, Gartner's research director.\n       As businesses finally come to terms with the inevitable, \n     it's going to be panic time. In about a year, expect most of \n     the commercial world to be totally obsessed with the Bug. \n     ``Pretty soon we have to just flat stop doing other work,'' \n     says Leo Verheul of California's Department of Motor \n     Vehicles.\n       But no amount of money or resources will postpone the year \n     2000. It will arrive on time, even if all too many computers \n     fail to recognize its presence.\n       ``It's staggering to start doing mind games on what \n     percentage of companies will go out of business,'' says \n     Gartner's Hotle. ``What is the impact to the economy of 1 \n     percent going out of business?'' Or maybe more: Y2K expert \n     Capers Jones predicts that more than 5 percent of all \n     businesses will go bust. This would throw hundreds of \n     thousands of people into the unemployment lines--applying for \n     checks that may or may not come, depending on whether the \n     government has successfully solved its Y2K problem.\n       What is the U.S. government doing? Not enough. ``It's \n     ironic that this administration that prides itself on being \n     so high tech is not really facing up to the potential \n     disaster that is down the road a little bit,'' says Sen. Fred \n     Thompson. If Y2K indeed becomes a calamity, it may well be \n     the vice president who suffers--imagine Al Gore's spending \n     the entire election campaign explaining why he didn't foresee \n     the crisis. (Gore declined to speak to Newsweek on Y2K \n     problem).\n       Here's the recipe for a federal breakdown: not enough time \n     and not enough money. While the Office of Management and \n     Budget claims the problem can be fixed for $2.3 billion, most \n     experts think it will take $30 billion. Rep. Stephen Horn \n     held hearings last year to see if the federal agencies were \n     taking steps ``to prevent a possible computer disaster,'' and \n     was flabbergasted at the lack of preparedness. His committee \n     assigned each department a letter grade. A few, notably \n     Social Security, were given A's. (The SSA has been working on \n     the problem for eight years and now has it 65 percent licked; \n     at that rate it will almost make the deadline.) Those with no \n     plan in place--NASA, the Veterans Administration--got D's. \n     Special dishonor was given to places where inaction could be \n     critical, yet complacency still ruled, like the departments \n     of Labor, Energy and Transportation.\n       State governments are also up against the 2000 wall. \n     California, for instance, finished its inventory last \n     December and found that more than half of its 2,600 computer \n     systems required fixes. Of those, 450 systems are considered \n     ``mission critical,'' says the state's chief information \n     officer John Thomas Flynn. These include computers that \n     control toll bridges, traffic lights, lottery payments, \n     prisoner releases, welfare checks, tax collection and the \n     handling of toxic chemicals.\n       As bad as it seems in the United States, the rest of the \n     world is lagging far behind in fixing the problem. Britain \n     has recently awakened to the crisis--a survey late last year \n     showed that 90 percent of board directors knew of it--but the \n     head of Britain's Taskforce 2000, Robin Guenier, worries that \n     only a fraction really understand what's required. ``I'm not \n     saying we're doomed, but if we are not doing better in six \n     months, I really will be worried,'' he says. He expects the \n     cost to top $50 billion. On the Continent, things are much \n     worse; most of the information-processing energy is devoted \n     to the Euro-currency, and observers fear that when countries \n     like Germany and France finally tackle 2000, it might be too \n     late.\n       Russia seems complacent. Recently Mikhail Gorbachev met \n     with Representative Horn in Washington, expressing concern \n     about how far behind Russia is in dealing with the Bug; \n     Gorbachev raised its possible impact on the country's nuclear \n     safeguards.\n       The list can go on, and on and on. ``It's like an \n     iceberg,'' says Leon Kappelman, an academic and Y2K \n     consultant. ``I would certainly be uncomfortable if Wall \n     Street were to close for a few days, but I can live with \n     that. But what if the water system starts sending water out \n     before it's safe? Or a chemical plant goes nuts? Anybody who \n     tells you `Oh, it's OK' without knowing that it's been tested \n     is in denial.''\n       It's tough out there on the front lines of Y2K. And in less \n     than a thousand days, it might be tough everywhere. ``There \n     are two kinds of people,'' says Nigel Martin-Jones of Data \n     Dimensions. ``Those who aren't working on it and aren't \n     worried, and those who are working on it and are terrified.''\n       Tick, tick, tick, tick, tick.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                       Millennium Bomb Ticks Away\n\n                             (By Alan Cane)\n\n       Staff at a Scottish bank, curious to know what effect the \n     millennium date change would have on their systems, turned \n     the clock on their mainframe computer forward to a minute \n     before the turn of the century--and watched.\n       At first, the system continued to process financial records \n     as before. Then, as time ticked on, the bankers realised that \n     the figures made no sense. It took some time for older staff \n     to realise what was happening. The machine had assumed it was \n     working in 1900 and was calculating in pounds, shillings and \n     pence, the denominations replaced by the present decimal \n     system in 1971.\n       (Do not try that this at home. Your personal computer might \n     crash or destroy information held in programs which rely on \n     dates.)\n       The ``millennium bomb'' is the consequence of the computer \n     specialist's habit of storing the year in a date as two, \n     rather than four, digits--97 rather than 1997. It was a way \n     of saving space when computer memory was expensive. Few \n     programmers expected systems written many years before the \n     millennium to be in use after it.\n       The result? ``Never in human history have we shot ourselves \n     in the feet so badly,'' says Mr. Brad Collier, a director of \n     Millennium UK, a consultancy which specialises in the \n     problem.\n       Nobody who has investigated the problem has any doubt that \n     it is serious and complex and will touch the lives of \n     virtually everyone. In the UK, the normally unemotional \n     National Audit Office, the public spending watchdog, has \n     warned that unless government systems are modified in time, \n     salaries might not be paid, invoices might not be issued, \n     collection of taxes could be put at risk, defence systems \n     could malfunction and inaccurate hospital records could be \n     created.\n       While the government is taking urgent steps to ensure that \n     its systems will work after 2000, the NAO detected some \n     indications that its programme was slipping behind schedule. \n     Computers and software fresh out of the box today are as \n     likely to fail a 2000 compliance test as older systems, so \n     ingrained is the habit--which persists--of writing the year \n     as two digits.\n       Then there is the problem of ``embedded processors''. These \n     are silicon chips which control everything from traffic \n     lights and medical equipment to power stations and \n     electronically guided weapons. They may or may not be \n     affected by the date change--the lack of information is a \n     serious hindrance.\n       If hospital radiation equipment were affected, for example, \n     it might deliver inaccurate doses or close down completely. \n     Sir Robert Horton, the chairman of Railtrack, the company \n     responsible for the UK's railway infrastructure, told a \n     seminar this year that embedded systems could affect lifts, \n     access controls, switchboards and facsimile machines.\n       Mr. Robin Guenier, head of TaskForce 2000, the unit set up \n     by the government to raise awareness of the problem, says it \n     is already too late to solve the problem in its entirety. But \n     he counsels against despair or panic.\n       Yet it is important to realise that while fixing the \n     millennium bomb is not technically difficult, it is tedious, \n     time-consuming and detailed.\n       As a first step, it is sensible to protect your job by \n     asking your employers what steps they have taken to deal with \n     the problem. The next step is to protect your savings and \n     investments by asking these same question of your financial \n     services companies--banks, pension funds, brokers and so on. \n     Only if they show no signs of understanding what you mean \n     should you take extreme steps, such as withdrawing your \n     funds.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/03/senate-section/article/S5268-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5271]]\n  TRIBUTE TO THE PHILADELPHIA MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR. ASSOCIATION FOR \n                              NONVIOLENCE\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, our nation's children are turning \nto crime and violence at alarming rates. Perhaps more than ever before, \nyoung people need direction from good men and women in their \ncommunities who are willing to get involved. They need role models to \nhelp them understand that an honest life is not an easy life, but it is \na better life. Fortunately, there are people and groups who are \nreaching out to at-risk youth. Today, I rise to commend the efforts of \none such organization. The Philadelphia Martin Luther King, Jr. \nAssociation for Nonviolence is making a difference, one child at a \ntime.\n  On April 4, the anniversary of Dr. King's assassination, the \nAssociation for Nonviolence sponsored a ``Youth and the Culture of \nViolence'' town meeting. This event brought a cross-section of the \ncommunity together to discuss violence prevention programs, current \nstatistics on youth violence, and new ideas for training young people \nto solve their problems peacefully. Teenagers from the Philadelphia \narea joined community leaders, educators, juvenile justice officers, \npsychologists, and other concerned citizens in this important outreach \neffort.\n  Almost 30 years ago, Dr. King gave his life for his dream of a non-\nviolent world. Through peaceful protest, he changed the heart of a \nnation. Dr. King's dream of a just, peaceful society lives on through \nthe work of those who continue to teach his principle of non-violence. \nIt is fitting that the organization which bears his name is reaching \nout and offering hope to a new generation.\n  Mr. President, I commend the Philadelphia Martin Luther King, Jr. \nAssociation for Nonviolence for addressing the issue of youth violence. \nI ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the important work this \norganization has done and in extending the Senate's best wishes for \ncontinued success to the men and women who have dedicated their lives \nto preventing youth violence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/03/senate-section/article/S5271-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5271]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO HENRY P.

He assisted Kubantex, a \ntextile company, to set up a business and marketing plans. Henry was an \n``international volunteer'' for our Nation and has represented our \nstrong democratic beliefs and practices of a free-market economy.\n  His spectacular display of voluntarism provided active assistance for \npeople in need and helped to build strong ties of respect and trust \nbetween America and Russia.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to an exceptional \nsmall business person and fellow Missourian: Marilyn Moore. Marilyn \nrecently received the Small Business Administration's [SBA] 1997 Small \nBusiness Person of the Year Award for Missouri. As chairman of the \nCommittee on Small Business, it is exciting for me to congratulate such \na respected and dedicated leader from my home State of Missouri.\n  The SBA honors one small business person from each State at national \nceremonies during Small Business Week, June 1-7. These small business \nowners are acknowledged for their achievements and contributions to the \nNation's economy. SBA uses several criteria to select the small \nbusiness person from each State, these include; staying power, growth \nin number of employees, increase in sales and/or unit volume, current \nand past financial reports, innovative product or service, response to \nadversity, and evidence of contributions by the nominee to aid the \ncommunity. The small businesses are nominated by trade associations, \nchambers of commerce, and business organizations. The SBA then selects \nfrom each State the business it feels has best met all of the criteria.\n  Missouri's representative, Marilyn Moore, is president of TeamRehab, \nInc., located in Clayton, MO. Her company is dedicated to providing \ntherapy services to physically challenged individuals. TeamRehab uses \nphysical, occupational, and speech therapy to help these individuals, \nand its services extend to more than 35 nursing home facilities, \noutpatient clinics, and home health agencies in the greater St. Louis \nmetropolitan area and southern Illinois. TeamRehab was established in \n1982 with two employees, and since that time has grown to more than 135 \nemployees. TeamRehab is committed to quality care as demonstrated by \nits mission to enhance the quality of life and dignity of our clients.\n  Marilyn's work in the St. Louis community is exemplary, and not only \nhave TeamRehab's clients benefited from her work, but so have her \nemployees. Marilyn is known for her fairness and commitment to a team \neffort. Her commitment to this team has proven successful as she \ncontinues to help her clients strive to remain as self-sufficient as \npossible.\n  Abraham Lincoln stated ``Always bear in mind that your own resolution \nto succeed is more important than any other one thing.'' TeamRehab's \nsuccess and accomplishments are testimony to her resolve. She is a role \nmodel for all small business owners and I congratulate Marilyn Moore \nfor this well-deserved honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/03/senate-section/article/S5271-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5271-S5272]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to speak for a few minutes \ntoday about the budget that passed the Senate a week-and-a-half ago--a \nbudget that I opposed. In particular, I want to discuss what appears to \nhave made it possible for congressional leaders and the White House to \nbridge their differences and produce a budget agreement that allegedly \nleads to balance by the year 2002.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me that it was a projected $225 billion \nsurge of revenue from a strong and growing economy--an extra $45 \nbillion in each of the next 5 years--that helped bridge the gap. \nWithout that additional revenue, which was identified by the \nCongressional Budget Office the night before the agreement was reached, \nno deal would have been possible.\n  Of course, the negotiators did not reach balance by applying that \nrevenue windfall to deficit reduction or tax relief, as you might \nexpect. Most of it was used instead to accommodate higher levels of \nspending demanded by President Clinton and even some in Congress. In \nother words, balance would be achieved, but at a level of spending $45 \nbillion higher per year than if all the additional revenue were applied \nto deficit reduction or tax relief alone. The fact that the budget deal \nenlarges Government is one reason why I voted against it.\n  Still, the budget negotiators rightly identified a thriving economy \nas one of the keys to solving our Nation's chronic deficit problem. And \nunlike previous budget agreements, they looked to economic growth to \nprovide the additional revenue, avoiding the trap of tax increases, \nwhich limit the economy's potential and, in turn, make it harder to \neliminate the red ink. They even found a way to provide a limited \namount of tax relief.\n  But with the deal so dependent upon economic growth, and no \nsignificant changes in policy to prevent the already lengthy expansion \nfrom running its course within the next few years, many of us believe \nthat it will be difficult, if not impossible, to ever realize the extra \nrevenues that the budget agreement depends on to bring the budget into \nbalance.\n\n[[Page S5272]]\n\n  As you know, Mr. President, the agreement itself provides no tax \ncuts--no family tax credit, capital gains relief, death-tax relief, or \neducation tax credit. It merely establishes the overall size of the tax \ncut that Congress will begin writing in a few weeks. It permits a net \ntax cut of $85 billion over the next 5 years--a minuscule amount \nconsidering that the Treasury will collect an estimated $8.6 trillion \nover that time period.\n  Considering that even the modest tax-cut package congressional \nleaders proposed earlier this year--a $500-per-child tax credit, a 50-\npercent cut in the capital-gains tax, estate-tax relief, and expanded \nIndividual Retirement Accounts--will cost an estimated $188 billion, it \nis doubtful that Congress will be able to provide even that level of \nrelief. It is more than twice the net tax cut allowed by the agreement. \nThe limited amount of tax relief is another reason that I voted against \nthe budget agreement.\n  Rather than spread tax relief so thin that it does no one much good, \nsome of us are now suggesting that we focus relief on just a few things \nthat will do the most good for the economy overall--that is, on capital \nformation. After all, not one business can begin, not one company can \nexpand, not one new job can be created, not one wage can be increased \nwithout the capital to start.\n  With that in mind, the single best thing we could do would be to \nprovide a deep reduction in the tax on capital gains. Ideally, the \nreduction should match that which was recommended by Democratic \nPresident John F. Kennedy as part of his economic growth plan in 1963--\na 70-percent exclusion for gains earned by individuals, and an \nalternative tax rate of 22 percent for corporations. Ironically, \nPresident Kennedy's plan, which I introduced this year as the Capital \nGains Reform Act, S. 72, proposed even deeper capital-gains cuts than \nthe Republican Congress passed a year-and-a-half ago.\n\n  Capital-gains reform will help employers and employees. The American \nCouncil for Capital Formation estimates that a Kennedy-like plan would \nreduce the cost of capital by at least 8 percent, leading to as many as \n150,000 new jobs a year.\n  It will also help the Treasury. Between 1978 and 1985, the top \nmarginal tax rate on capital gains was cut by almost 45 percent--from \n35 percent to 20 percent--but total individual capital gains tax \nreceipts nearly tripled--from $9.1 billion to $26.5 billion annually. \nThat may come as a surprise to some people, but the fact is that when \ntax rates are too high, people merely hold on to their assets to avoid \nthe tax altogether. No sale, no tax. But that means less investment, \nfewer new businesses and new jobs, and--as historical records show--far \nless revenue to the Treasury than if capital-gains taxes were set at a \nlower level.\n  Research by experts at the National Bureau of Economic Research \nactually indicates that the maximizing capital-gains tax rate--that is, \nthe rate that would bring in the most revenue to the Treasury--is \nsomewhere between nine and 21 percent. The Capital Gains Reform Act, by \nvirtue of the 70 percent exclusion, would set an effective top rate on \ncapital gains earned by individuals at about 12 percent.\n  President Clinton recognized the importance of lessening the capital-\ngains tax burden by proposing to eliminate the tax on most gains earned \non the sale of a home. That is a step in the right direction, but if a \ncapital-gains tax cut is good for homeowners, it should be good for \nothers who save and invest as well. I believe we ought to follow the \nKennedy model and provide a permanent, broad-based capital-gains tax \ncut.\n  Mr. President, estate-tax relief is the second item that should be \naccommodated within the limited amount of tax relief available under \nthe budget agreement. I have proposed that such death taxes be repealed \noutright, as recommended by both the Clinton-sponsored White House \nConference on Small Business in 1995 and the Kemp tax-reform commission \nin 1996.\n  The respected liberal Professor of Law at the University of Southern \nCalifornia, Edward J. McCaffrey, recently observed that polls and \npractices show that we like sin taxes, such as on alcohol and \ncigarettes. ``The estate tax,'' he went on to say, ``is an anti-sin, or \na virtue, tax. It is a tax on work and savings without consumption, on \nthrift, on long-term savings.'' The estate or death tax thus \ndiscourages the very activity that is necessary to help our economy \ngrow and prosper.\n  The tax is particularly harmful to small businesses, including those \nowned by women and minorities. It is imposed on a family business when \nit is least able to afford the payment--upon the death of the person \nwith the greatest practical and institutional knowledge of that \nbusiness's operations. It should come as no surprise then that a 1993 \nstudy by Prince and Associates--a Stratford, CT consulting firm--found \nthat 9 out of 10 family businesses that failed within 3 years of the \nprincipal owner's death attributed their companies' demise to trouble \npaying death taxes.\n  In other words, instead of passing a hard-earned and successful \nbusiness on to the next generation, many families have to sell the \ncompany in order to pay the death tax. The upward mobility of such \nfamilies is stopped in its tracks. The proponents of this tax say they \nwant to hinder concentrations of wealth. What the tax really hinders is \nnew American success stories.\n  The Heritage Foundation estimates that repeal will, over the next 9 \nyears, spur $11 billion per year in extra output, lead to the creation \nof an average of 145,000 additional jobs, and increase personal income \n$8 billion a year over current projections.\n  Mr. President, I know that my two bills--one providing a deep \nreduction in the capital gains tax, and the other eliminating death \ntaxes--will probably not pass in their current form. The small amount \nof tax relief allowed by the budget agreement will not permit it if we \nare to provide child-tax credits, education credits, and other tax \nrelief as well. But it is capital-gains and estate-tax reform that \ncould help keep the economy on track, producing the revenues needed to \nbring the budget into balance.\n  As President Kennedy put it, ``An economy hampered with high tax \nrates will never produce enough revenue to balance the budget, just as \nit will never produce enough output and enough jobs.'' Capital-gains \nand estate-tax relief should be at the top of the list when it comes \ntime for Congress to write a tax bill in the coming weeks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/03/senate-section/article/S5271-4", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5272-S5273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MSGR.

Kenneth Velo, president of the Catholic Church \nExtension Society and priest of the Archdiocese of Chicago, as the \nJoint Civic Committee of Italian Americans honors him on June 7, 1997 \nas the recipient of the Joseph Cardinal Bernardin Humanitarian of the \nYear Award.\n  Monsignor Velo, who was born on Chicago's south side, was ordained as \na Catholic priest in May 1973, after attending St. Mary of the Lake \nSeminary in Mundelein, IL. Monsignor Velo served as associate pastor of \nSt. Angela Parish in Chicago from 1973 to 1980 and as associate pastor \nof Queen of All Saints Basilica from 1980 to 1981. In 1981, he assisted \nthe Archdiocese of Chicago as assistant chancellor, and from 1983 to \n1985 served as vice-chancellor of the Archdiocese of Chicago.\n  Known for his ability to remember not only names and faces, but the \ncircumstances of the people he encountered, Monsignor Velo was asked by \nthe late Joseph Cardinal Bernardin, Archbishop of Chicago, to serve as \nthe Cardinal's executive assistant in 1985. Monsignor Velo would serve \nthe Cardinal in this capacity for 14 years. Monsignor Velo was, at \ntimes, the Cardinal's sounding board, driver, eyes and ears. \nUltimately, it would be Monsignor Velo who would orchestrate Cardinal \nBernardin's death rites and care for the Cardinal's mother after his \ndeath. No one will ever forget the powerful and moving eulogy the \nMonsignor delivered in memory of his friend.\n  In 1994 Pope John Paul II, moved by his reputation as a public \nservant, appointed Monsignor Velo to be President of the Catholic \nChurch Extension Society, a national philanthropic organization that \nhas helped isolated and impoverished missions throughout the United \nStates since 1905. As president of the Catholic Church Extension \nSociety, Monsignor Velo has only reaffirmed his reputation as an \nindividual dedicated to helping others.\n\n[[Page S5273]]\n\n  Monsignor Velo is a true humanitarian. Today, I extend my sincere \ncongratulations to Monsignor Velo for receiving the Joseph Cardinal \nBernardin Humanitarian of the Year Award. Through his extraordinary \npersonal effort for the betterment of our community, Monsignor Velo \ntruly has personified the humanitarian nature of Joseph Cardinal \nBernardin.

RUDY ELLIS\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today I rise to mourn the death \nand celebrate the life of a close friend, Dr. Rudy J. Ellis, Sr., who \npassed away this past Monday, June 2, 1997.\n  Dr. Rudy Ellis was an inspiration to those who knew him. He was a \nrespected orthopedic surgeon in Louisville, KY, and was the team \nphysician for University of Louisville athletics. Through the years, \nRudy touched the lives of many people in the community as well as the \nthousands of Cardinal athletes that he treated during his 35 years as U \nof L's team doctor.\n  I had one thing in common with Rudy, we both started at the \nUniversity of Louisville at about the same time. He became the U of L \nteam physician in 1961. Since that time, he treated athletes in all \nsports, except when he stepped down from the Cards' football and \nbaseball teams in 1986. Dr. Rudy Ellis has done more good for more \npeople through the university than virtually anyone else.\n  As a U.S. Senator, I get to travel across Kentucky and meet many \ngreat people who have made a difference in the State. And if I had to \nmake a list of the truly great Kentuckians, Dr. Rudy Ellis would rank \nin the Top five.\n  A former member of the U of L's board of trustees and board of \noverseers, Rudy was one of the pioneers in sports medicine in Kentucky. \nHe opened the Rudy J. Ellis Sports Medicine Center in 1980. And over \nthe years, he has been an integral part of the athletic programs at \nmany Jefferson County high schools, by providing free annual physical \nexaminations for the 4,000 athletes in the school system. In 1993, to \nshow their appreciation for his hard work and compassion for the young \nathletes, the athletic directors from across Kentucky created an award \nfor people who provide distinguished service to high school sports. Who \nbetter to receive the first award than the man they named it after, Dr. \nRudy Ellis.\n  High school gyms and the University of Louisville weren't Rudy's only \nstomping grounds; he also participated in the athletic programs at \nBellarmine College, Lindsey Wilson Junior College, Hanover College, St. \nCatherine College, Spalding University, Louisville Redbirds, Kentucky \nColonels Basketball Team, CBA Catbirds Basketball Team and Louisville \nShooters Basketball Team. And in 1994, Rudy was recognized for all his \nwork when he was inducted into the Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame.\n  Mr. President please join me in extending my heartfelt sympathy and \nprayers to the Ellis family, his wife Ruth Anne and his four children, \nJohn, Jim, Linda and Amy, and to all those whose lives he touched. He \nwill be missed very, very much.\n  Mr. President I ask that two articles from the Louisville Courier-\nJournal be printed in the Record.\n  The articles follow:\n\n                [From the Courier-Journal, June 3, 1997]\n\n             Ellis, Beloved U of L team Doctor, Dies at 78\n\n                          (By Ashley McGeachy)\n\n       Dr. Rudy J. Ellis, the caretaker of University of \n     Louisville athletes for more than 35 years, died of an \n     apparent heart attack yesterday morning. He was 78.\n       Details of Ellis' death were sketchy, but he and his wife, \n     Ruth Anne, were in Vicksburg, Miss., over the weekend for his \n     high school reunion. He died there.\n       Ellis was said to be in fine health as he embarked on the \n     trip. He had suffered a heart attack five years ago to the \n     day of his death, but he had suffered no serious health \n     problems since.\n       An orthopedic surgeon, Ellis became the team physician for \n     all U of L sports in 1961 and worked with all athletes \n     through 1986 when he stepped down from the Cards' football \n     and baseball teams. He was a U of L institution who never was \n     paid for his work.\n       As news of Ellis' death spread throughout the U of L \n     community, there was sadness over the loss of the soft-\n     spoken, gentle man who healed whoever was ailing.\n       ``He loved athletes whether it was a high school kid or a \n     professional,'' said Cardinals basketball trainer Jerry May, \n     who worked with Ellis since joining U of L as a student \n     trainer in 1971. ``He loved to make sure that they were taken \n     care of. He probably never got paid much for any athlete he \n     ever saw, but the prerequisite wasn't whether they could pay. \n     The prerequisite was them being hurt.''\n       May drove the Ellises to the airport Thursday night for \n     their trip to Mississippi and was scheduled to pick them up \n     last night.\n       ``He was like a father to me,'' May said. ``We were very \n     close. We roomed together (on road trips) and have ridden \n     many a mile together.''\n       Said a teary Sherry Samenick, a U of L trainer who worked \n     with Ellis for 17 years: ``He's the epitome of loyalty, \n     dedication, love, friendship and selflessness. . . . He \n     didn't turn anybody down.''\n       Ellis helped everyone from the biggest stars at U of L to \n     high school athletes to ailing fans and media members. He \n     helped Darrell Griffith and Scooter McCray when they had knee \n     problems, Dwayne Morton when he broke his hand, Samaki Walker \n     when he fractured his foot and, most recently, DeJuan Wheat \n     when he sprained his ankle during the NCAA Tournament in \n     March.\n       ``I don't care how long you're at it, you never get used to \n     it,'' Ellis once said of dealing with players' injuries. \n     ``You get real close to these kids, kind of feel like they're \n     your own children, and you get a little frightened every time \n     they take a spill.''\n       When Scott Davenport, an assistant basketball coach at U of \n     L, broke his arm at age 6, Ellis fixed it. When Davenport's \n     son, Doug, fractured his leg seven years ago, Ellis' son, \n     John, fixed it.\n       ``One generation set one; one generation set the other,'' \n     Davenport said, adding, ``How many people do you meet in a \n     lifetime who have never had anything bad said about them?''\n       Said U of L athletic director Bill Olsen: ``Dr. Ellis meant \n     a lot to this program. . . . His caring and compassion for \n     people extended beyond athletes. Everyone had a lot of \n     confidence in Doc. He was your best friend; he was a father \n     figure to many student-athletes and in many ways was a \n     coach.''\n       Jock Sutherland, the longtime radio announcer for U of L, \n     added: ``He was a great person. There aren't many people \n     outside of your family that you can say you love. I actually \n     love Rudy Ellis. I love everything he stands for.''\n       The university honored Ellis in 1995 with a scholarship in \n     his name. He was inducted into the Kentucky Athletic Hall of \n     Fame in 1994.\n       A native of Mississippi, he attended Mississippi State on a \n     football scholarship and was the Bulldogs' starting \n     quarterback from 1938 through '40. He graduated from U of L's \n     medical school in '43 and became the Cards' team physician in \n     1961 at the behest of Peck Hickman, then the basketball \n     coach.\n       He opened the Rudy J. Ellis Sports Medicine Center in \n     Louisville in 1980, and he served at times as team physician \n     for the Louisville Redbirds and the old Kentucky Colonels. He \n     worked with Bellarmine College, Lindsey Wilson College, \n     Hanover College, St. Catharine College and Spalding \n     University in addition to the Jefferson County Public \n     Schools.\n       Pearson's Funeral Home on Breckinridge Lane is handling the \n     services, although the family didn't plan to make \n     arrangements until today.\n       Ellis is survived by his wife and four children, sons John \n     and Jim, and daughters Linda and Amy.\n\n                 Louisville Has Lost a Doctor To Us All\n\n                            (By Rick Bozich)\n\n       I didn't want to call Dr. Rudy Ellis' home at 10:45 on a \n     Tuesday night during Super Bowl week. But when you're a \n     newspaper person on deadline, where else were you going to \n     turn for an explanation of how an anterior cruciate ligament \n     works and how you repair it?\n       You called Rudy Ellis, doctor to us all.\n       The first thing he did was tell me to stop apologizing for \n     calling at that hour.\n       The second thing was to explain everything he knew about \n     the anterior cruciate ligament, how he repaired one and how \n     long the recovery is.\n       And, finally, after he asked how I was enjoying New \n     Orleans, the third thing he did was make me promise to call \n     back later that evening if I had further questions about \n     anything he had just patiently explained in incredible detail \n     for 20 minutes.\n       ``Don't worry about it, paaaart-ner,'' Ellis always said in \n     that soft comforting drawl that rolled all the way back into \n     his boyhood days in Mississippi. ``We'll take care of it.''\n       Ellis did not believe in the doctor-patient relationship. \n     He believed in the friend-friend relationship. He was an \n     orthopedic surgeon who handled sports-related problems, but \n     his real specialty was his warm and compassionate \n     personality.\n       It did not matter whether you were a University of \n     Louisville Cardinal, a Louisville Redbird, a Kentucky \n     Colonel, a five-morning-a-week jogger or a substitute third \n     baseman in a Sunday night softball league--you lost a \n     tireless friend when Rudy Ellis died yesterday.\n       Ellis was as concerned about your knee as Darrell \n     Griffith's knee, as worried about your shoulder as Felton \n     Spencer's shoulder, as interested in your day as he was in \n     anything he was doing in the most action-packed retirement I \n     have ever seen.\n\n[[Page S5274]]\n\n       You were just as likely to find him and his associates at \n     the Streetball Showdown as you were at Freedom Hall, where he \n     served so many years as the U of L team physician.\n       Jim Watkins, the athletic director for Jefferson County \n     Public Schools, cannot remember when this state has conducted \n     finals for any sport without representatives of Ellis' office \n     on the scene.\n       In 1993 athletic directors across Kentucky created an award \n     for friends of high school sports, outside of school \n     personnel, who provide distinguished service. Not only did \n     the athletic directors give Ellis the first award, but they \n     also named it the Dr. Rudy J. Ellis Award.\n       ``Nobody could be more deserving,'' Watkins said. ``Or more \n     humble.''\n       Ellis never sent the high schools a bill. He only sent \n     every patient on the way with a smile, convincing you that if \n     you followed his instructions you'd be hanging on the rim \n     again soon. No wonder so many local athletes who have become \n     professionals never let another doctor take their temperature \n     until they checked with him.\n       Griffith was not Dr. Dunkenstein, the 1980 college \n     basketball player of the year, when he met Ellis. Griffith \n     was a terrified Male High School sophomore wincing from every \n     breath after taking a hard shoulder to his chest at practice.\n       ``You look a little worried, son,'' Ellis said after Wade \n     Houston, the Male coach, brought Griffith to the office. \n     ``Well, you're going to live. In fact, you'll be fine.''\n       ``Dr. Ellis wasn't in medicine for the money,'' Griffith \n     said. ``He was really in medicine to help people. When you \n     looked in his eyes, you saw he really cared about you.''\n       Ask any high school athlete who attended Super Saturday. \n     For at least the past 15 years, Ellis organized a battalion \n     of local doctors and trainers who provided physical \n     examinations for any high school athlete. He insisted that \n     the Super Saturdays be staged three times a year so athletes \n     from fall, winter and spring sports were covered. Watkins \n     said the doctors examined 1,500 to 2,000 students at each \n     session.\n       At each free session, that is.\n       ``There aren't many people like Rudy Ellis,'' Watkins said. \n     ``He truly believed it was his responsibility that every \n     athlete had quality medical care.''\n       ``Louisville has lost a great man,'' Griffith said.\n       And Louisville has lost a great friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/03/senate-section/article/S5273-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO WILLIAM E. BREW, MINORITY GENERAL COUNSEL, SENATE COMMITTEE \n                          ON VETERANS' AFFAIRS\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I note with great sadness the \ndeparture of someone who had become a veritable institution on the \nstaff of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs--minority general \ncounsel, William E. Brew.\n  Bill retired from the Committee on April 4, 1997--19 years and 1 day \nafter he came for what he believed, at the time, was a less than 2-year \ncommitment. How fortunate we all have been that those 2 years stretched \nout for almost 2 decades!\n  When Bill joined the committee staff as associate counsel in April \n1978, the Committee was still fairly young--it had only been \nestablished in 1971. So, the fact is, Bill has been with the Committee \nfor almost as long as the Committee itself has been in existence. Ask \nhim about any piece of legislation that came before the committee \nduring his tenure, and he can most likely give you a blow-by-blow \ndescription of its legislative history, the major players involved, \nsubsequent modifications, etc. Everyone who has heard of Bill's \ndeparture has commented on how great the loss of his institutional \nmemory will be.\n  Bill is truly a fountain of knowledge about veterans legislation. But \nhis is no dry history lesson. Bill is a wonderful storyteller, whose \nrecounting of the past is full of humor and the little details that \nbring those events to life.\n  And no one shares his knowledge more generously and willingly than \nBill. He is a gifted teacher. Countless young--and not so young--\nlegislative staffers have benefited from his unique expertise. Bill's \npatience is legendary. No matter how many times he explained something, \nhe was always willing to take time to go over it again. His mentoring \nof younger staffers was particularly meaningful to many with whom he \ndiscussed not only work issues, but life goals and philosophies.\n  Bill anchored the committee through times of change. He saw the \ncommittee through several shifts of control from Democratic to \nRepublican Congresses, and although a committed Democrat himself, won \nthe respect and appreciation of both Democratic and Republican chairmen \nalike. He was tremendously helpful to me at the time I assumed \nchairmanship of the committee in 1993. He has truly been a mainstay of \nthe committee.\n  Bill is a graduate of Notre Dame (B.A.) and Catholic University \nSchool of Law (J.D.), a two-term veteran of the Navy, including 18 \nmonths duty in Vietnam, and a devoted family man, the father of five \nchildren. He is a role model of old-fashioned values--honesty, \nintegrity, fairness, service to others, modesty. He is a true team \nplayer. He never claimed the spotlight, but was always there, behind \nthe scenes, to offer his wise counsel, expert guidance, and astute \njudgment.\n  Bill thoroughly understood the legislative process and was a highly \neffective advocate for veterans. He is a master of negotiation, able to \nsort through complex issues and focus on realistic solutions that weigh \nthe ideal vs. the attainable. Whether or not they agreed with him on an \nissue, all who dealt with him knew him to be fair-minded, balanced, and \nan often calming voice of reason in the heat of intense discussions \nthat shaped important legislation.\n  Bill's accomplishments are many. Most significant among them are \nlegislation leading to establishment of the U.S. Court of Veterans \nAppeals for judicial review of veterans claims, and the Veterans' \nClaims Adjudication Commission to conduct a comprehensive review of the \nclaims process; expansion of programs relating to the readjustment \nneeds of Vietnam and post-Vietnam veterans, including creation of a \nNational Center on Post Traumatic Stress Disorder; implementation of \nseveral initiatives to address the problem of nurse shortages at VA \nhospitals; changes in VA's procedures responding to the needs of women \nveterans sexually assaulted while on active duty; and revision of VA \nhealth care eligibility rules. He also collaborated with the General \nAccounting Office to design and conduct a study evaluating the \nsupervision of VA surgical residents, and then worked with VA to carry \nout recommended changes leading to increased quality of surgical care.\n  Bill left behind big shoes to fill. He is enormously missed by all of \nus who worked with him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/03/senate-section/article/S5274-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5274-S5275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF CFIDS AWARENESS DAY\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to reaffirm my \nsupport for the tireless effort of the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome \nAssociation of Lehigh Valley to fight chronic fatigue and immune \ndysfunction syndrome [CFIDS], or Chronic Fatigue Syndrome [CFS].\n  For five years, the CFS Association of Lehigh Valley has been \ndedicated to finding a cure for CFIDS, increasing public awareness, and \nsupporting victims of this disease. The Lehigh Valley organization is \nactively involved in CFS-related research. In addition, they regularly \nparticipate in seminars to train health care professionals. Public \neducation is an essential aspect of the association's mission. For \ninstance, they arranged the broadcast of a video documentary about \nCFIDS on public television. Likewise, the Lehigh Valley organization \nraises public awareness through the International CFIDS Awareness Day, \nwhich is held on May 12 each year. I would also note that the CFS \nAssociation of Lehigh Valley received the CFIDS Support Network Action \nAward in both 1995 and 1996 for their initiatives in public advocacy.\n  Although researchers have made some advances in the study of this \ncondition, CFIDS remains a mysterious illness. Presently, there is no \nknown cause or cure. Victims experience a wide range of symptoms \nincluding extreme fatigue, fever, muscle and joint pain, cognitive and \nneurological problems, tender lymph nodes, nausea, and vertigo. \nRecently, the Centers for Disease Control gave CFIDS ``Priority 1'' \nstatus in the new infectious disease category, which also includes \ncholera, malaria, hepatitis C and tuberculosis. Until this disease is \nobliterated, the CFS Association of Lehigh Valley will continue its \nresearch and education campaigns.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in commending the \nLehigh Valley organization and in supporting the following \nproclamation, which I ask be printed in the Record.\n  The proclamation follows:\n\n[[Page S5275]]\n\n                              Proclamation\n\n       Whereas, the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) Association of \n     the Lehigh Valley joined the Chronic Fatigue and Immune \n     Dysfunction Syndrome (CFIDS) Association of America, the \n     world's largest organization dedicated to conquering CFIDS, \n     in observing May 12, 1997 as International Chronic Fatigue \n     and Immune Dysfunction Syndrome Awareness Day; and\n       Whereas, the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Association of the \n     Lehigh Valley, a member of the Support Network of the CFIDS \n     Association of America, is celebrating their fifth year of \n     service to the community; and\n       Whereas, the Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Association of the \n     Lehigh Valley recently received the CFIDS Support Network \n     Action Award for Excellence in Service in the Area of CFIDS \n     Awareness Day 1996 and for Excellence in Commitment and \n     Service to the CFIDS Community in the Area of Public Policy; \n     and\n       Whereas, CFIDS is a complex illness which is characterized \n     by neurological, rheumatological and immunological problems, \n     incapacitating fatigue, and numerous other symptoms that can \n     persist for months or years and can be severely debilitating; \n     and\n       Whereas, estimates suggest that hundreds of thousands of \n     American adults already have CFIDS; and\n       Whereas, the medical community and the general public \n     should receive more information and develop a greater \n     awareness of the problems associated with CFIDS. While much \n     has been done at the national, state, and local levels, more \n     must be done to support patients and their families; and\n       Whereas, research has been strengthened by the efforts of \n     the Centers for Disease Control, the National Institutes of \n     Health, and other private institutions, the CFS Association \n     of the Lehigh Valley recognizes that much more must be done \n     to encourage further research so that the mission of \n     conquering CFIDS and related disorders can be achieved.\n       Therefore, the United States Senate commends the \n     designation of May 12, 1997 as CFIDS Awareness Day and \n     applauds the efforts of those battling the illness.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I appreciate the Senate's consideration of this issue, \nand I thank my colleagues for their attention.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/03/senate-section/article/S5274-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     JEWEL S. LAFONTANT-MANKARIOUS\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, today I would like to offer \nmy sincere condolences to the family, friends, and colleagues of Jewel \nS. Lafontant-Mankarious. I especially want to convey my most heartfelt \ncondolences to Mrs. Lafontant-Mankarious's son and my dear friend, John \nRogers.\n  On Saturday, May 31, 1997, our Nation lost one of our finest \ncitizens. Mrs. Lafontant-Mankarious, a native of my hometown Chicago, \nwill be remembered by many as a courageous woman who broke barriers for \nAfrican-American women in law and government.\n  Jewel Lafontant-Mankarious was born of a distinguished family of \nAfrican-American professionals and leaders, who had a long history of \nAmerican patriotism. It was only natural that she would want to follow \nin this tradition of leadership. Mrs. Lafontant-Mankarious' desires led \nher to pursue an undergraduate degree in political science at Oberlin \nCollege, and later a law degree from the University of Chicago, where \nshe graduated in 1946. Due to the level of institutional racism and \nsexism that existed in the legal field at that time, however, Mrs. \nLafontant-Mankarious found herself unable to secure a job in a major \nfirm, obtain office space in the downtown area, or even join the \nChicago Bar Association. Mrs. Lafontant-Markarious was resilient, \nhowever, and would later rise to become a senior partner in the firm of \nStradford, Lafontant, Gibson, Fisher & Cousins, senior legal partner at \nVedder, Price, Kaufman & Kammholz, and a partner in the law firm of \nHolleb & Collef. Just this past year, in fact, Mrs. Lafontant-\nMankarious was cited as one of the top female attorneys in the city of \nChicago.\n  Her success never interfered with her commitment to public service. \nMrs. Lafontant-Mankarious, has been remembered as ``a regal woman, a \nperson of the highest integrity,'' who ``gave her legal services to the \ndowntrodden people who couldn't fight for themselves.''\n  It was this sense of fairness that led Mrs. Lafontant-Mankarious in \nher other endeavors. A longtime civil rights activist, Mrs. Lafontant-\nMankarious was a founding member of the Congress for Racial Equality, \nheld office in the Chicago chapter of the NAACP, and was on the board \nof the American Civil Liberties Union. In this capacity she is \nremembered for showing the same sort of tenacity and resilience that \nbrought her success in her legal career, and is known for using \ninnovative, yet peaceful, methods to bring about change. In later \nyears, Mrs. Lafontant-Mankarious would continue to be active in \ncountless civic endeavors, using her influence and her legal skills to \nhelp African-American entrepreneurs.\n  Mrs. Lafontant-Mankarious' activism was consistent and tenacious. She \nnot only fought for the rights of African-Americans during the civil \nrights era, but fought to ensure that women, in particular, had a \nvoice. In fact, by 1969, at a time when very few women had any real \npower in the corporate world, Mrs. Lafontant-Mankarious sat on the \nboards of 15 major corporations, including TWA and Mobile Oil. She \nelegantly broke barriers of both race and gender in all of her \nendeavors.\n  Mrs. Lafontant-Mankarious was extremely active in Republican \npolitics. A close friend of Presidents Eisenhower, Nixon, and Bush, \nMrs. Lafontant-Mankarious served as the first African-American woman to \nhold the position of assistant U.S. attorney during the Eisenhower \nadministration. In 1972, Mrs. Lafontant-Mankarious became the highest \nfemale appointee named in the second Nixon administration, when she was \nselected as Deputy Solicitor General in the Justice Department. Years \nlater, during the Bush administration, she would serve as U.S. \nAmbassador-at-Large for 4 years, visiting 28 countries. President Bush \nalso appointed her to serve as Coordinator for Refugee Affairs for the \nState Department.\n  We should all be proud of the life that Mrs. Jewel S. Lafontant-\nMankarious led. She was a woman of integrity, valor, and achievement, \nand was a personal heroine and role model to me. She rose above \nadversity, used her God-given talents to fight for the rights of \nothers, and served as an example for following generations of what a \nstrong heart and mind can achieve. Mrs. Lafontant-Mankarious will be \nsorely missed by all Americans who believe in the value of a true \ndemocratic society, who oppose discrimination, and who support the \nnotion that we can all serve the good of humanity.\n  Today, I salute Jewel S. Lafontant-Mankarious for her many \nachievements, and thank her for her legacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/03/senate-section/article/S5275-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5275-S5276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MAURICE SORRELL\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to extend my \nheartfelt congratulations to Maurice Sorrell, the dean of black \nphotojournalists, as colleagues, friends, and family gather to \ncelebrate his retirement from a lifelong commitment to capturing \nhistory on film.\n  Mr. Sorrell, a D.C. native, first noticed his love for photography as \na youngster, when he often watched his uncles taking amateur pictures \nof his parents. His first job in photography was at the Pentagon in the \n1950's, where he was permitted to work only in the darkroom because of \nracial segregation policies that existed. In 1957, Mr. Sorrell decided \nto strike out on his own as a freelance photographer. It was in this \ncapacity that Mr. Sorrell served the Afro-American Newspapers and the \nWashington Afro-American Newspaper.\n  In 1962, Mr. Sorrell joined Johnson Publishing Co., Inc., as a staff \nphotographer. Mr. Sorrell's artistic but honest portrayal of most civil \nrights events, as well as other issues of importance to the African-\nAmerican community, has made him a landmark figure at Johnson \nPublishing Co., Inc. For the past 35 years, his work has appeared \nregularly in Ebony and Jet magazines. In addition to having received \nnumerous awards and citations, Mr. Sorrell has earned a reputation \namong his colleagues for being a truly gifted photographer, with a \nunique eye for capturing the essence of the moment with a single \nportrait.\n  Among his many firsts, Mr. Sorrell has the distinction of being the \nfirst African-American to gain admittance in the prestigious White \nHouse News Photographers Association in 1961, as well as the honor of \nbeing the photographer who took the first group photo of the \nCongressional Black Caucus.\n  Over the course of his extensive career, Mr. Sorrell has visited more \nthan\n\n[[Page S5276]]\n\n24 countries, covered nine presidents, photographed the March to Selma, \nAL, with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., shot the World Series and NFL \ngames, and covered many other events. His work has gained him the \nconfidence of some of our Nation's most memorable and influential \npeople.\n  Maurice Sorrell is truly an American legend. Today, I commend him for \nhis accomplishments, and applaud his contributions to the field of \nphotography. Through his dedication to his art, and by his desire to \ncapture our Nation's history on film, he has touched the lives of \ncountless Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/03/senate-section/article/S5275-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HELEN MAYBELL ANGLIN\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, it is indeed my pleasure and \nprivilege to join the family and friends of a distinguished citizen of \nChicago, IL, Mrs. Helen Maybell Anglin, in celebrating her 50th \nanniversary in the restaurant business. Mrs. Anglin has always held \nthat the ``good things in life ought to be enjoyed by all people, \nespecially good food.'' As owner and manager of the Soul Queen \nRestaurant, a popular soul food eatery located on the Windy City's \nSouthside, Mrs. Anglin works her special magic to turn simple, down \nhome fare into something spectacular.\n  Aside from being a local legend, Mrs. Anglin has been nationally \nrecognized for her culinary talents. Her recipes have been published in \nnumerous sources, including the Ladies Home Journal. She has also \nappeared on local and national television programs, including the Oprah \nWinfrey Show, to demonstrate her masterful cooking techniques. \nThroughout her career, Mrs. Anglin has been instrumental in exposing \nthe public-at-large to delicious soul food cuisine.\n  In addition to being a successful restauranteur, Mrs. Anglin has been \na committed civic leader for decades. She is one of the original board \nmembers of the PUSH Foundation and has been an active supporter of the \nNAACP, the League of Black Women Voters, and the United Negro College \nFund. She is well known for inspiring young people to maximize their \neducational opportunities and has provided financial assistance to help \nmany achieve their goals.\n  Mrs. Anglin combines her private passion for good food with her \npublic commitment to the common good. Her community work and civil \nrights advocacy represent a singular distinction for this woman of and \nfor the people. She has distinguished herself as one of Chicago's most \nvaluable leaders through her extraordinary talent, innovation, and \ncompassion. Her achievements and dedication to quality in all her \nendeavors are a shining example to us all, and I am honored to know \nher.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/03/senate-section/article/S5276-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, JUNE 4, 1997\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

Additional votes are expected on or in relation to the \npending amendments as well as additional amendments that may be \noffered.\n  As a reminder, it is still the hope of the leader to complete action \non the budget resolution conference report as soon as that report \nbecomes available. In addition, the majority leader has stated that the \nSenate may also complete action on the supplemental appropriations \nconference report when that report is available.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/03/senate-section/article/S5276-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "03", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 3 P.M.
