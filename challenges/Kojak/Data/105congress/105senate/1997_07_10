The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Who controls time under the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi controls 45 \nminutes and the Senator from Minnesota controls 45 minutes.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, to refresh the memory of Senators about \nthis amendment that is now the pending business, at an early stage in \nthe consideration of this authorization bill I offered an amendment for \nmyself and on behalf of the distinguished Senator from Illinois [Mr. \nDurbin] to modify the administration's existing policy relating to the \nexport by U.S. companies of supercomputers in the global marketplace.\n  The reason this amendment was considered important for the \nconsideration of the Senate on this bill is that it, first of all, \ninvolves exporting technology that no other country in the world has. \nUnlike many of our arms sales, defense equipment or technology sales \naround the world, whether to friendly allies or those who may not be so \nfriendly, computer technology has evolved here in the United States to \nthe point that we have the corner on the market. No one can compete \nwith us in many areas of supercomputer technology. The Japanese have \ndeveloped an impressive capacity in this area as well.\n  But one thing has come to our attention in the subcommittee that I \nchair on Governmental Affairs, the Subcommittee on International \nSecurity, Proliferation and Federal Services. We have had a series of \nhearings that began the first month of this year. We have had at least \none hearing every month. And we have explored one aspect of weapons \nproliferation.\n  It was at a hearing that we had recently on the exporting of \ntechnology that we learned that the United States was a proliferator of \nweapons technology that was threatening the security of the United \nStates, and putting at risk United States servicemen, servicewomen, \nother interests, and other assets and interests throughout the world, \nbecause we were giving countries like Russia and China and others the \ncapacity to improve the lethality, the accuracy, and the capabilities \nof nuclear weapons systems through the exporting of technology that \nthey were using to simulate tests, which they would not otherwise be \nable to do, and to upgrade the quality and accuracy of their missile \ndelivery systems and weapons systems.\n  This does not make good sense. Japan's export control policy is more \nrestrictive than our policy. The President came into office after a \ncampaign which involved a lot of discussion about changes in the world \nsecurity situation. We all rejoiced in the past two administrations \nwhen so much progress was made in terms of reducing the threat to the \nsecurity of the United States because of the changes going on in the \nSoviet Union and Eastern Europe.\n  The fact is, that we were able to relax somewhat when those weapons \nsystems were no longer targeted at us. But the fact remains that there \nis a tremendous potential threat, not only in Russia but some of the \nother states of the former Soviet Union for the development at some \nfuture date of an attitude that may put our security relationship at \ngreater risk than it is today. And so we do have an interest in \nrefraining from doing those things ourselves that end up unwittingly or \ncarelessly investing in others the capability to develop modern, more \nlethal, and more dangerous weapons systems that could threaten our \nsecurity interests.\n\n  One other aspect of this is that part of our hearings have been \ninvolving the sale of weapons systems by countries like Russia and \nChina. We had a whole series of witnesses come before our committee \ntalking about this as a problem now, selling missiles, for example, to \nIran, selling nuclear weapons technology to countries like India and \nPakistan and others.\n  But we see emerging around the world a new capacity on the part of \nmany of these countries that we do not trust at all to have those kinds \nof systems that can inflict great damage, destroy assets that we have, \nand people, troops that we have in the Middle East or in South Korea, \nsailors who are on ships around the world who are now vulnerable to \ncruise missiles in the Mediterranean that we never had to worry about \nbefore because of this proliferation of missiles and technologies and \nweapons systems.\n  So that is the big issue here. So that is why we have suggested that \nthe administration's new policy--when they came into office they said \nwe are going to open up and take the controls off of our exports so we \ncan take advantage of the new security situation around the world, let \nour businesses enjoy a more relaxed atmosphere. That is all fine. But \nwhat we have learned in the last 18 months of this new policy--it was \nput into place in October 1995--the new policy has resulted in \nsupercomputers coming into the possession of the Chinese Academy of \nSciences which has a component that is involved in the modernization of \nthe Chinese nuclear weapons program and systems. They now have seven \nsupercomputers that came from the United States that they are using, \nthey potentially are using, to develop a more modern weapons capability \nin nuclear weapons.\n  The Russian chief of atomic energy boasted recently that his \noperation, the group of people he has under his control in his \nlaboratories--Chelyabinsk 20 and Arzamas 16--these are locations where \nthey do work on nuclear weapons systems in Russia that they now have a \nsupercomputer capability previously unknown, compliments of the United \nStates.\n  This is a sad state of affairs because of a policy that is much more \nrelaxed now. And I want to describe the details of it. That is why we \nhave these 90 minutes reserved here so Senators will understand how \nserious a threat this is and what it means in practical terms.\n  We have seen the administration develop this new policy that \nidentifies countries in categories. They call it a four-tier system.\n  Tier 1 countries are our best friends, NATO Allies. There are no \nrestrictions. Tier 2 are those countries where it is more lenient \nstill. Tier 3 and Tier 4. Tier 4, there is a complete embargo on the \nexporting of computer technology of all capability. You cannot sell \ncomputers under our new system to these Tier 4 countries. They are \nIran, Libya, North Korea, Cuba, a couple of others.\n  Tier 3 are those countries where, depending upon the capability of \nthe computer, there are restrictions. There are no restrictions for the \nPCs, the personal computers, no restrictions. But when you get up into \nthese high-end computer systems there are restrictions, you have to get \nan export license from the Department of Commerce. And the way you \ndecide whether you need a license or not is to decide if the end use of \nthe computer is going to be for a military purpose or a civilian \npurpose or if the user is a military entity or a civilian entity.\n\n[[Page S7133]]\n\n  The problem with the administration's policy is the Commerce \nDepartment does not tell our exporters whether the end use or the user \nis military or civilian. They leave it up to our exporter to find that \nout for themselves. That is the problem. That is what this amendment is \nabout. We are trying to change one part of this policy to require the \nFederal Government to approve the sale--in the case of these countries \nin Tier 3, China, Russia, and a number of others--where the potential \nfor use of this technology for military purposes has become so apparent \nand real.\n  Now, I am not suggesting that our computer companies are carelessly \nand negligently and wholesale selling these high-end computers, these \nadvanced computers, without careful analysis of who their customers \nare. Some of them are making a very conscientious effort to ensure \nthat. But what they cannot do and they do not have the capacity to \ndecide, that in the reality of this new situation there are front \ncompanies being developed--in the case of China, for example, in Hong \nKong and maybe other places, as well, and I cannot discuss all of this \nbecause some of it is classified--but there are companies that have \nbeen established, whether by governments or government-related \nindustries, who are able now to purchase U.S. computers because they \nare a civilian company, and then turn around and sell it to a company \nthat is affiliated with one of these governments. That is what has \nhappened, apparently.\n  So do we want to continue to leave to the capabilities of a computer \nexporter the responsibility of making these determinations, by \nunderstanding what is a front company and what is not? They do not have \nthe resource to do that. Our intelligence community, however, and the \nresources of our Federal Government are much more nearly able to make \nthis kind of determination.\n  Under Secretary Reinsch at Commerce talked about this policy at \nhearings in our committee, and you could tell that Commerce realized \nthat changes had to be made in the way they were monitoring and \nsupervising and implementing this new policy. After our hearing, they \nstarted making changes. They started putting out a list, for example, \nof entities around the world that they think are suspicious enough or \nthey have evidence enough so they can say you cannot tell this entity \nor that entity in these Tier 3 countries because we know that puts at \nrisk the potential use of this technology for nuclear weapons purpose \nor other weapons of mass destruction purpose. So they are making some \nchanges. The fact is they left a lot of things off the list, they left \na lot of entities off the list that we know in the past have purchased \nor wound up having these technologies.\n  So it creates a situation where a change needs to be made right now. \nThis is the change that we think is best. We are pleased to have the \ncosponsorship on this amendment of distinguished leaders in the area of \nproliferation here in the Senate. Senator Thurmond, who is chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee, supports our amendment. Senator Warner \nsupports our amendment. Senator Glenn, who has previously served as \nchairman of this proliferation subcommittee and chairman of the full \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs, and been a leader in this effort his \nentire career in the Senate, and he announced yesterday--and put a \nstatement in the Record, which we invite Senators to look at--that he \nis supporting this amendment. Senator Durbin of Illinois was in the \nhearing and has taken an active role in trying to understand and deal \nwith this emerging problem. It has emerged full-blown into one of the \nmost serious threats to our Nation's security, and it has been done \nbecause of the way this policy has played out and the way the problem \nhas increased. So we think that Senators ought to look carefully at \nthis.\n  Let me just say this chart tries to explain how a small area of the \ncomputer industry and the hardware that are involved are affected by \nthis amendment. The diagonal lines here that say Chelyabinsk-70 and \nArzamas-16 are nuclear weapon labs in the Soviet Union, and the Chinese \nAcademy of Sciences that we know wound up with United States computers \nthat can be used now throughout China for the purpose of developing new \nmodern weapons of mass destruction. This represents numbers of total \ncomputers, 6.34 percent of the total U.S. computer export markets \naffected, and targeted only those computers going to those Tier 3 \ncountries with lethality or capability of 2,000 MTOPS to 7,000 MTOPS. \nThese are millions of theoretical operations per second. That is how \nyou measure the capability or speed of computation of computers. That \nis the way the Commerce Department has broken this down and divided up \nthese up so that they reflect the capabilities of these computers. A PC \nhas a capability of 250 MTOPS. We are talking about advanced computers, \nvery expensive, and, of course, the computer industry is competing with \neach other to make these sales.\n  This is another point: If you were running a big computer company--\nIBM, Cray computer, whatever the names are--you do not want to have to \ngo to the Secretary of Commerce and tell them you are thinking about \nmaking a sale or you have a customer on your screen that you think you \ncan sell a big, heavy-duty, new, modern, expensive computer to, you do \nnot want to tell anybody about it. If you are a salesman, you do not \nwant that word out on the street. You do not want somebody at Commerce \nlooking into it and asking a bunch of questions of you. You would like \nto go in and make the sale. If the customer is ready to buy your \ncomputer, you want to go in, sign the deal, and make the sale. Of \ncourse, you have a responsibility under the new policy to satisfy \nyourself about who the end user is, what the end-use purpose is, and so \nyou hurry to get that done. No matter how conscientious you are, you \nmight not do as good a job with that, particularly if you have a \ncompetitor who is trying to make the same sale.\n\n  So we are in a situation where the competition of the U.S. market and \neconomic system is working against our interests in protecting our \nnational security and maybe taking a little bit more time and \nunderstanding what the potential is for this sale in terms of coming \nback at us in a new, advanced missile that has capabilities never \nbefore possible because of U.S. computer manufacturers selling in these \nmarkets to the countries that have the money to buy them. You are \ntalking about the big countries. I am particularly concerned about \nRussia and China, specifically. We are developing, we hope, better \nrelationships with both countries. We are working to improve our \nrelationships around the world, make this a more stable, safer, \npeaceful world. That effort has to continue.\n  What we are doing today, in calling it to the attention of the Senate \ntoday, is not at all designed to sour or make that process more \ndifficult, but we have to recognize that this is still a dangerous \nrelationship in many respects. These are the countries that have the \ngreatest capability in the world today, and past attitudes among some \nin those countries that do not have our interests at heart, do not have \nour security uppermost in their mind, who may be capable of diverting \nsome of these technologies for uses such as the development of new \ngenerations of weapons of mass destruction which not only they but some \nof their friends end up with in the due course of business.\n  I have gotten calls and we have had visits from some in the computer \nindustry saying this amendment is not necessary; it is not necessary to \nput this in the law. Why don't we just change the policy? Well, we \ncan't change the policy. We are the Congress. The executive branch \nmakes policies. They issue regulations.\n  One of the Senators asked me in a formal colloquy yesterday why we \nneeded to put this in a bill. Well, it is the only way that Congress \nhas available to it to participate in the policymaking process in \nhelping to do our part to ensure that our Nation's security is \nprotected. We cannot issue a regulation, we cannot modify a policy \nother than doing it the way we are doing it right now.\n  Now, the Senator from Minnesota, who is my good friend, has an \nalternative. He wants to do things other than change the policy. He \nwants to ask GAO to investigate it. We are already having GAO \ninvestigate this and gather more information. We are continuing to \ndiscuss with GAO other areas where we might get information\n\n[[Page S7134]]\n\nthat will be more helpful to the Congress in understanding what our \noptions are. He suggests that Commerce ought to publish a list of \nprohibited purchasers. That list is good for as long as the ink is \ndrying, but no further. What if a change occurs and they have not \ngotten a new list out with modifications, and you see nobody is on the \nlist with the name of a company that you have been contacted by and you \nmake the sale or you try to make the sale, and you decide this is a \ncivilian company. There was nobody in uniform who came to see you, so \nyour assumption is that it is a civilian. Well, the names change, these \nidentities change, the purposes of companies change, the contacts and \nrelationships of companies, particularly in this part of the world we \nare talking about, can change.\n\n  So you are going to invite them to start changing things. If they see \nthey are on the list, they will probably dissolve their corporation if \ntheir purpose was to be a front for the People's Liberation Army, and \nsome of these companies are. How is an innocent U.S. exporter to know? \nYou cannot have all these agents and assets to detect this kind of \nthing on the payroll of the company. But the U.S. Government has \nresources, and they have a better opportunity to make these \ndeterminations.\n  What we are simply saying is--not as the Senator from Minnesota wants \nus to do, which is nothing. His amendment just absolutely guts the \neffort to change the policy. It says there will be no change in policy \nas we are suggesting here. There will be no change. We will leave it up \nto the Commerce Department to improve its policy by making a list, and \nwe will ask the GAO to look into this more. That is not good enough. I \nam hoping the Senate will vote down the Grams amendment and support the \nCochran-Durbin amendment.\n  The cosponsors, I hope Senators will consider, who are on this bill \nright now, and I do not have a last count, but we are well into the \ndouble digits. Around 20 Senators have cosponsored this amendment. It \nis a strong statement of support for change that is needed now to \nprotect our Nation's security. If we fool around and argue about this \nand are mealymouthed and don't want to hurt anybody's feelings or scare \nany of the computer companies, they don't want to get Congress to agree \non any sale and they want to use their best efforts--I am not \nsuggesting they don't, but they don't have the capacity, they don't \nhave the expertise, they don't have the reach, the broad reach of the \nU.S. Government and its intelligence community to make these \ndeterminations.\n  So for these few computers with MTOPS between 2,000 and 7,000, for \nthese few countries in tier 3, we are suggesting that any sale has to \nbe first approved by the Commerce Department to ensure that the end use \nis civilian and that the end user is civilian and not military. That is \nall this is. Every other computer sale and administration policy can \ncontinue without any new restraint whatever.\n  I am hopeful the Senate will review this situation carefully, Mr. \nPresident.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise to continue the debate this morning \non the Grams-Boxer amendment to the Cochran-Durbin amendment. I urge my \ncolleagues today to support what I believe is a very reasonable \ncompromise to a very controversial issue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators D'Amato, Bond, \nGregg, and Feinstein be added as cosponsors to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I understand that there is a lot of concern \nin this body about United States computer sales being diverted for \nmilitary use to either China or Russia. None of us wants that to occur. \nBut we have to consider whether the Cochran amendment solves the \nproblem. I believe that it does not.\n  The Cochran amendment would require export licenses for all midlevel \ncomputers. Now, these are not supercomputers, these are not high-end \ncomputers. You are going to hear that term, but they are not \nsupercomputers. These are midlevel computers, and they are shipped to \nChina, Russia, Israel, and 47 other countries. We talk about the Third \nTier countries. They involve 51 nations, like Russia, China, India, \nPakistan, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Romania, and the Baltic States. Some of \nour future NATO Allies could also be involved. Mr. President, export \nlicenses do not solve end-user problems. These are diversions that \nwould not have been caught during the export license procedure. Export \nlicenses do require end-user certification, but if the end user chooses \nto ignore the agreement, or if the computer is stolen, that possibility \nwill not be evident in the licensing process. In my judgment, the \ncurrent system works.\n  Just yesterday, Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen sent us a letter \nopposing the Cochran amendment. He said the current law and system can \ndeal with unauthorized exports and diversions. This is from the \ndepartment that has been very conservative on all export decontrol \nmatters. Secretary Cohen further states that we should focus our \ncontrols on technology that can make a national security difference, \nnot that which is widely available around the world and is obsolete.\n  Yes, Mr. President, there have been three diversions, but that was \nout of 1,400 sales. But, no, this is not the right way to address those \nproblems. The right way is to force the administration to publish as \nmany military end users as possible and then to work with the industry \nto identify all military end users. We have been able to identify \ndiversions through our capable intelligence sources. Mr. President, \nthere is no evidence that there are dozens of computers out there used \nby military end users. It is just not there.\n  Further, I don't believe that the industry irresponsibly ignores \navailable information about military end users. They have too much at \nstake. A company which violates export control laws takes a very big \nrisk. The penalties are prohibition of all exports for 20 years or \nmore, 10 years in prison, and up to a $5,000 fine for each violation. \nThis doesn't include the blemish that would remain on the company's \nreputation or the great difficulty that company would have in the \nfuture seeking an export license. No company, Mr. President, can afford \nthat risk.\n  What we would be doing here this morning is handing this midlevel \ncomputer business over to the Japanese and other allies. Now, again, I \nwant to emphasize that these are midlevel computers, they are not \nsupercomputers. Next year, they will be the kind of systems that we \nwill be able to have in our offices here in the Senate, or what you \ncould find in a small company or in a doctor's office. These are not \nthe computers that are sought after for nuclear weapons production or \ndesign. Again, we are looking at midlevel computers, between 2,000 and \n7,000 MTOPS, which are widely available around the world.\n  Supercomputers, which are sought after for weapons design, start at \nthe 20,000 MTOPS level and go all the way up to 650,000 this year, and \nthey will go beyond the 1 million MTOPS level next year. By the way, \nChina already produces a computer at 13,000 MTOPS. No other country \nconsiders these computers to be anything but generally available and \nwill step in to take over the business that the Cochran amendment will \nhand to them. The question is, is that what we want?\n  Also, anyone can purchase upgrades, by the way, to raise a PC, a \ncurrent PC, above the 2,000 MTOPS level. We can't control the box. We \ncan't control the chips around the world that can be put in it. We \ncan't control the upgrades. There is no way to control these low-level \nPC's under the 2,000 MTOPS threshold, again, since they are available \nin nearly every country in the world.\n  Further, the chips that make up these computers are also available \nand produced around the world. They were decontrolled during the Bush \nadministration. Our chip producers have markets throughout the world, \nand they need to maintain them to remain competitive. Chip producers \ncannot control who receives their end product.\n  Also, how do you prohibit a foreign national from using a computer \neven above the 7,000 level here in the United States and taking the \nresults back, or faxing it back?\n  Our friend Jack Kemp has written to us also this week stating that \nthe Cochran amendment would ``establish a policy that is destined to \nfail and\n\n[[Page S7135]]\n\nwould hurt American computer manufacturers without protecting our \nnational security. The American high-technology sector is critical to \nthe future of this country and must be protected from overly intrusive \nGovernment restrictions.''\n  I wish there was something we could do to effectively control some of \nthese exports, but it is just not possible at these lower levels. We \ncannot convince our allies to reverse 2 years of their own decontrol. \nIn fact, Europe has tabled a decontrol proposal at 10,000 MTOPS, which \nproves that they have no intention of even respecting our 7,000 level. \nWe cannot pull all the PC's and upgrades off the retail shelves, and we \ncannot close our borders to prevent all foreign nationals from entering \nthis country and using our computers.\n\n  We must concentrate our resources on keeping computers above the \n7,000 level from reaching military end users; that's for sure. But I \nfear that an increased license burden in the administration would steer \nresources away from efforts to locate diversions and investigate them.\n  Now, Mr. President, in an earlier statement, I also countered a claim \nthat an export license requirement would not slow down these computer \nsales. I have heard that someone made the comment that an export \nlicense would take 10 days. Well, anyone who knows how the licensing \nprocess works knows that it can take many, many months to obtain one. \nThis will only earn our industry a reputation as an unreliable \nsupplier, and it will cost us sales and it will cost us many, many U.S. \njobs. The administration admits that a computer license application \naverages 107 days to reach a decision. I have seen it take far longer. \nEven 107 days, by the way, is enough to convince the end user to go out \nand seek a buyer in another country.\n  Since so many of the Tier 3 countries are emerging markets, we need \nto be in there early to maintain a foothold for future sales. When we \nhear about the 6.3 percent of sales to Tier 3 countries, that is \nmisleading. It is in an area where the market is expanding rapidly. If \nwe leave our companies out of those markets, they will not be there to \ncompete in the future. They will not be there to provide sales and jobs \nfor the United States.\n  Another argument I have heard is that there is no foreign \navailability over 3,500 MTOPS. Well, last year, NEC of Japan tried to \nsell a supercomputer to the United States Government at a level between \n30,000 and 50,000 MTOPS. They match our speeds all the way to the top.\n  Mr. President, I believe that all of us are proud of our computer \nindustry, that our industry remains the state of the art in so many \nareas, particularly in the levels above 7,000. We have made progress to \nfacilitate exports without compromising our national security, progress \nwhich began back in the Reagan and Bush administrations, but here is an \neffort today to reverse all of that progress.\n  Our industry has to survive on exports, and it has to pursue \ncommercial business with these 50 countries to remain competitive. All \ncomputer sales over the 7,000 MTOPS level do require license now. We \nhave not sold any computers above that level. And, again, the 7,000 \nMTOPS are not supercomputers--they are not--they are midlevel \ncomputers. We have not sold any computers above that level to Tier 3 \ncountries; nor do our allies, to my knowledge. However, we should not \nrestrict the sales of these midlevel and, again, generally available \ncomputers to commercial end users. We should simply maintain the \ncurrent licensing requirement for the questionable end users. I firmly \nbelieve that there will be improved cooperation between the Government \nand industry on end-user information, particularly those for Russia and \nChina.\n  Now, I also commend the Commerce Department for starting to publish \ninformation on end users and to examine all sales that are made to the \nTier 3 countries within these computer speeds.\n  The Grams-Boxer amendment requests the GAO to determine whether these \nsales affect our national security. That is very important. It will \nlook into the issue of foreign availability. It will also require the \npublication of a military end-user list, and it requires Commerce to \nimprove its assistance to the industry on identifying those military \nend users.\n  There will be some that vote today solely to express their \ndissatisfaction with China's alleged military sales to our adversaries. \nLet me remind you once again that there is no evidence that U.S. \ncomputers were involved in any of those cases. I also urge you to look \nat the merits of this issue. Pure and simple, the Cochran amendment \nwould hand the sales of midlevel computers over to the Japanese and the \nEuropeans at the expense of an industry that we have sought to protect \nand to promote and an industry that we are proud of.\n  As chairman of the International Finance Subcommittee of Banking, the \ncommittee that has jurisdiction over this issue, I strongly, this \nmorning, urge my colleagues to vote for my substitute and let us \ncontinue this debate in the normal manner, through committee \nconsideration. At the same time, the administration should step up its \nefforts to express to the Chinese and the Russians our grave concerns \nregarding efforts to divert commercial sales to military end users \nwithout knowledge of the United States seller.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the efforts of my colleague from \nMississippi to address these diversions. I want to work with him in my \nrole as chairman of the subcommittee of jurisdiction to ensure that the \ncurrent system does work or on how we can improve it once we have \nbetter information regarding the extent of the problem.\n\n  I urge the support of my colleagues for the Grams-Boxer substitute as \na compromise to this very, very controversial issue. Thank you very \nmuch.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor with the Senator from \nMississippi, and he has allotted the remaining time to me for this \ndebate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President. There is a quotation attributed \nto Vladimir Lenin. I am not sure he said it, but it has been repeated \noften enough that it is possible he did. It is illustrative of the \nchallenge we face in this debate. It is reported that Lenin said: ``A \ncapitalist will sell you the rope that you use to hang him.''\n  The suggestion from this founder of communism was that countries like \nthe United States with a passion for capitalism and sales will \noccasionally get too overheated and end up selling the very product \nthat can be used against him. Lenin's quotation goes back almost 80 \nyears; yet, it is apropos of the debate today in 1997. We are talking \nabout the sale of a supercomputer to a country that can use it against \nus. How should we take care to prevent that from happening? What \nsafeguards should we establish?\n  You have read in the newspapers over the last few years the sad \ncommentary of people entrusted at the highest levels of Government in \nthe United States with classified and secret information, with access \nto technology, who have literally betrayed the United States and have \nsold that information to one of our adversaries. Ultimately, many of \nthem have been caught and prosecuted and have served time, as they \nshould, for betraying their Nation and giving away something very \ncritical to the defense of this country to one of our adversaries.\n  At the basis of this debate is this same question: Are we giving \naway, through sales, a precious resource that can be used against us? \nAre we handing over a capability to a country that may not have the \nsame interest or the best interest of the United States at heart?\n  That is why Senator Cochran and I have offered this amendment. Let me \nsay at the outset for those who are critical of the amendment, we are \nnot saying that the United States cannot make sales of these \nsupercomputers to any country, Tier 1, 2, or 3; but we are saying, if \nyou are going to sell these supercomputers to one group of countries \nthat we want to take care do not misuse them, then please come to the \nGovernment, come to the Department of Commerce and make certain that \nthe party buying the computer in that country, whether it is China, \nRussia, or another Tier 3 country, is an end user or party that will \nuse it for peaceful purposes.\n\n[[Page S7136]]\n\n  Is that some outrageous suggestion--that before we sell this great \ncapability, this supercomputer capability, to some entity in China or \nRussia that we take care not to sell it to the wrong person? I think \nmost Americans would say, ``Why would we have a Government, if you \naren't going to do something that basic to protect us?'' Is there \nreason to be concerned about this?\n  Think about what we are selling. One supercomputer that was sold to \nRussia increased their computer capability 10 times. We took our \ngenius, our technology, put it up for sale, and they bought it. And \nwith that purchase they not only bought the technology, they bought a \nnew capability--I am sorry to report capability which can be used for \nnegative reasons, for reasons inconsistent with American policy, and as \neasily for peaceful reasons.\n  Some have said, ``Don't do the Cochran-Durbin amendment. It just \ninvolves too many sales. It would restrict too many supercomputer \nsales.''\n  Senator Cochran made this point. When you look at the sales to Tier 3 \ncountries, which are the only countries affected by this amendment, \nthere were 91 sales in the 15 months of new trade policy by the Clinton \nadministration; 6.3 percent of the computers in question are at issue \nhere. Is that too much to ask? That when we start to sell 6.3 percent \nof our computer sales to certain countries, we say, ``Pause. Hold back. \nLet's review and make sure that the entity buying them in the other \ncountry is a peaceful entity, that in fact it won't be used against the \nUnited States.''\n  We have sold 47 supercomputers to China, another 20 to Hong Kong, and \nmany to Russia as well. What have we learned about these sales?\n  I am sorry to report that four silicon graphic machines that were \nsold to Russia are now being used at Russia's nuclear weapons labs; one \nsilicon graphics machine in the Chinese Academy of Sciences, which on \nits face sounds harmless but it is a key part of China's nuclear \nweapons complex; one Sun Microsystems machine we sold, we learned last \nweek, is now running in a Chinese military facility after being \ndiverted from Hong Kong.\n  What Senator Cochran and I are saying is, is it worth our effort and \ntime to take care not to let these computers fall into the wrong hands? \nBut, if you listen to the voices of business and the supercomputer \nindustry, you would think that our suggestion was to stop sales of \nsupercomputers. But it is not. In fact, it wouldn't affect 93 percent \nof the sales already, and for the other 6.3 percent all we are asking \nis for time for review.\n  We received a letter in opposition to our amendment from the \nSecretary of Commerce, a man whom I admire very much. But I would have \nto say to the Department of Commerce and to the Department of Defense \nthat it is not unreasonable for us to ask you to set up a mechanism to \nmake sure these computers don't end up in the wrong hands.\n  I have received a publication from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Not \nsurprisingly they don't want any restrictions on this trade. They want \nU.S. companies to be able to sell whenever and to whomever they choose, \nand they don't want the restriction of the Cochran-Durbin amendment. \nBut I would say to my colleagues that it is a little disingenuous for \nthem to argue that if we do not allow the sale of supercomputers which \ncan be misused against the United States that we endanger American \njobs. There is something larger at stake than American jobs. What is at \nstake here is American security. I would think that every worker in the \ncomputer industry or outside would want to make certain that, No. 1, we \nprovide for the common defense. If I recall, that is part of a document \nthat all of us consider to be illustrative of the goals of America.\n  Let's address this issue about whether or not the Cochran-Durbin \namendment in going after the 2,000 MTOPS model is talking about a \ngarden variety of PC's which people can pick up at the corner computer \nstore and are today available in Senate offices. As one of my \ncolleagues said, it is a common thing that shouldn't be restricted. \nFrom what we are told 10,000 MTOPS is not common to them. The computers \nthat are being sold right now are at a level of 200 MTOPS or 250 MTOPS. \nAnd even assuming that this industry, which is burgeoning and \nincreasing its capability dramatically, should continue to increase the \ncapability of these computers, Senator Cochran and I estimate that it \nwill be more than 4 years before they all reach the end of the MTOPS \nstage. At least until that time shouldn't we take care, be cautious, \nand be concerned about the danger of selling this capability? I think \nwe should. I think it is a serious mistake for us to assume that if we \ndo not sell these computers to our potential enemies some other country \nwill.\n  When we asked the Department of Commerce and the Department of \nDefense this question they said, ``Well, the only country likely to \nstep in, if the United States doesn't sell the computers, is Japan.'' \nIncidentally, Japan has more restrictive export controls than the \nUnited States. So I wonder if we are really thinking very seriously \nabout the potential ramifications.\n  It is very shortsighted to celebrate the sale of a computer to a \ncountry overseas, to celebrate the jobs that are created, and to ignore \nthe reality that that computer may give a potential enemy capability--\ncapability to manufacture, capability to test through computers nuclear \nweaponry, chemical weaponry, and biological weaponry. All of these \nthings I think should be of great concern to all of us.\n  With all due respect to my colleague, the Senator from Minnesota, I \nwould say that his amendment does little to address the core problem \nhere. To call for a study? Well, we have been at this for 15 months. If \nyou want to know what has happened, we can give you the statistics. We \ncan tell you what has occurred in terms of the sales actually made to \nChina, to Russia, and through Hong Kong back to China. We know things \nhave happened that we never wanted to happen. The idea that we can \nsomehow evaluate this and then let those know who are interested really \nstrikes me as a very weak approach.\n  Let me just say that the bottom line is that I know industry is in \nthe business of selling. I think our Government and the Senate should \nbe in the interest of not only encouraging sales but encouraging \nresponsible sales.\n  When Senator Cochran and I come forward and say that for 6.3 percent \nof computers we want to make certain there is a review, that the end \nusers cannot use that technology against us, I think that is a \nreasonable request.\n  I sat through the hearing. I wish some of my colleagues who oppose \nthis amendment could have sat through it as well. I think they would \nhave come away with the same impression that I did. The current liberal \ntrade policy of supercomputers is going to create a situation which \ncould one day come back and haunt America. We are giving to those in \nChina, Russia, and other countries capabilities which we have worked \nhard to create and capabilities which unfortunately they may misuse.\n  We spend so much time in this body discussing the proliferation of \nweapons. We watch every move that the People's Republic of China makes \nfor fear that they are proliferating these weapons around the world. We \nhave classified and unclassified briefings on the subject. And when it \ncomes to the sale of hardware and technology, we step aside and say it \nis another story. It is not. It is the same story. It is the same \nconcern, and should be expressed as such.\n  I hope my colleagues will take a hard look at this. It is not often \nthat I break with the Clinton administration on foreign policy. But I \nthink Senator Cochran is right. I think this policy should be subject \nto thorough review, and I think his amendment, which I am happy to \ncosponsor, is a step in the direction to make sure that we don't turn \nloose to the world supercomputer technology and one day come to regret \nit.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMS. I yield time to my colleague from California who is also a \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you, very much.\n  Mr. President, will you tell me when I have used 10 minutes? Then I \nwill wrap it up because I know the Senator from Missouri is waiting. We \nare very proud that he is here to speak in behalf\n\n[[Page S7137]]\n\nof the Grams-Boxer amendment. I am also proud to say that Senator \nDaschle, the Democratic leader has endorsed the Grams-Boxer amendment.\n  Mr. President, my colleague from Illinois started off his argument by \nquoting Lenin. He said Lenin said that ``The capitalist will sell you \nthe rope that you need to hang him.'' I never agreed with Lenin, and I \ndon't agree now.\n  But, in addition, I really do believe that the Cochran amendment, as \ndrafted, amounts to us hanging ourselves. What do I mean by this? I do \nnot believe the Cochran amendment does anything to protect our national \nsecurity. Rather, it harms it, I believe, a very substantial way, our \ninternational competitiveness in an industry that is leading America \ninto prosperous times.\n  This is a view that is shared by Defense Secretary William Cohen, by \nCommerce Secretary William Daley, and our National Security Adviser, \nSandy Berger. This bipartisan team has told us very directly that the \nCochran amendment is harmful. I truly hope our colleagues will take a \ndeep breath, step back and review these letters.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters from the \nSecretary of Defense, the Secretary of Commerce, and the National \nSecurity Adviser be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 1997.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Majority Leader. I am writing to express my \n     opposition to the Cochran-Durbin and Spence-Dellums \n     amendments to the Fiscal Year 1998 Defense Authorization Act \n     regarding supercomputer export controls.\n       While I understand the concerns that motivated these \n     amendments, I believe they are unnecessary and would \n     undermine the flexibility that we need to adapt to changing \n     security requirements and technology trends. I am a strong \n     advocate for effective export controls. To be most effective, \n     we must focus our limited export control resources on the \n     export of goods and technologies that can make a significant \n     difference for national security and nonproliferation \n     reasons. Therefore, in order to best serve our security \n     interests, we need to maintain a system that allows us to \n     adjust our controls when technology advances and when \n     technology becomes widely available. Putting specific control \n     levels into statute is not an appropriate means to meet these \n     often fast-changing challenges.\n       We have a system and adequate authority under current law \n     that can deal appropriately with unauthorized exports and \n     diversions. In this regard, the Administration is \n     aggressively and intensively addressing recently reported \n     unauthorized computer shipments to Russia and China, using \n     the full range of law enforcement and diplomatic tools \n     available.\n       We remain committed to working with Congress to address \n     these important matters in a manner that maintains the \n     flexibility we need to preserve our security interests.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bill Cohen.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                                       Washington,\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     The Senate,\n     Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Trent: I want to convey the Administration's strong \n     opposition to Cochran-Durbin and Spence-Dellums floor \n     amendments to the FY 1998 Defense Authorization Act \n     concerning export licensing requirements for high performance \n     computers.\n       First, we believe it is a mistake to set these export \n     control limits in concrete by mandating them in statute, \n     particularly in view of the rapid growth in computing power \n     available worldwide. The amendment drastically undercuts our \n     flexibility to adjust controls to keep pace with \n     technological change--an extraordinarily rapid pace in the \n     highly competitive area of computers--and with our ongoing \n     evaluations of evolving security requirements.\n       Second, there is no need to legislate a revision to this \n     policy. There are adequate administrative and enforcement \n     means under current law to address problems that arise with \n     U.S. computer exports. For example, with regard to the \n     reported unauthorized computer shipments to Russia, both the \n     Departments of Commerce and Justice are intensively \n     investigating the shipments, and we are actively addressing \n     the issue through diplomatic means. We also are issuing \n     additional administrative guidance to U.S. exporters \n     regarding impermissible end-users of proliferation concern. \n     The Department of Commerce is reviewing all computer exports \n     above 2,000 MTOPS (Millions of Theoretical Operations per \n     Second) made since January 1996, including those countries in \n     Tier Three such as China, India, and Israel. If problems are \n     identified with any of these shipments, we have the legal and \n     administrative means to address them and I can assure you we \n     will use that authority.\n       The Administration remains willing to work with the \n     appropriate committees of the Congress to address concerns \n     regarding export controls.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Samuel R. Berger,\n\n                                    Assistant to the President for\n     National Security Affairs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                    The Secretary of Commerce,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 8, 1997.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: I am writing to urge you to oppose the \n     amendment to the Defense Authorization Act for 1998 authored \n     by Senator Cochran concerning exports of high performance \n     computers and support instead the alternative proposed by \n     Senator Grams, which would provide an objective assessment of \n     the effect of computer sales on our national security. The \n     Administration opposes the Cochran amendment because it \n     reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of \n     computer technology in the global marketplace and will \n     seriously hurt the competitiveness of the computer industry \n     without enhancing our national security.\n       The Cochran amendment seeks to roll back the President's \n     decision in 1995 to permit the export of computers with a \n     performance capability of 2,000 to 7,000 Million Theoretical \n     Operators Per Second (MTOPS) to civilian end users in 50 \n     countries, including China, Russia, India, Israel, and \n     Pakistan, without advance approval from the government. The \n     amendment would require individual government approval for \n     each such export. (The President's policy currently requires \n     individual approval for all exports of computers with a \n     performance capability above 7,000 MTOPS to all end-users in \n     those countries, as well as for all exports or re-exports \n     with a CTP greater than 2,000 MTOPS to military and \n     proliferation end-users in Computer Tier 3 countries as \n     defined in part 744 of the Export Administration \n     Regulations.)\n       The President's decision was based on an extensive \n     government review of advancements in computer technology and \n     of our national security requirements that concluded (1) that \n     computers with capabilities in this range would become widely \n     available between 1995 and mid-1997, and (2) that critical \n     defense applications that justified export controls were \n     clustered at levels above 7,000 MTOPS. Information we have \n     acquired since the decision supports those conclusions and \n     suggests that, if anything, its forecast of foreign \n     availability of these computers was conservative. The \n     amendment would lock us into an export control policy that is \n     already outdated and which could only be changed by \n     legislation.\n       The Cochran amendment's proposed control levels are \n     outdated because of the rapid pace of development of computer \n     technology and the widespread availability of the \n     semiconductors that run these machines. In late 1995, single \n     processors with a performance capability between 400 and 600 \n     MTOPS were available, while today such processors are \n     commercially available at over 1000 MTOPS. At the beginning \n     of the Clinton Administration, machines performing at over \n     195 MTOPS were defined as ``supercomputers.'' Today, many \n     desktop PCs exceed that level. These computers are not \n     controlled for export and are manufactured in many countries \n     throughout the world. It is relatively simple to upgrade \n     existing machines to higher levels by adding processors. In \n     addition, connecting lower level PCs that are not controlled \n     for export--known as ``distributed parallel processing''--can \n     permit them to function with the capability of a single \n     larger machine.\n       Attempting to stop the spread of computers to selected \n     countries at the Cochran amendment levels would be \n     exceptionally difficult and not the best use of our \n     nonproliferation resources. We can control proliferation of \n     weapons of mass destruction more effectively by concentrating \n     our resources on ``choke point'' goods and technologies--\n     those items without which a weapon cannot be built or \n     delivered. Those items, by virtue of their specialized use, \n     often have a limited number of producers and can be \n     effectively controlled through multilateral agreements. Such \n     items also can be controlled through unilateral action if \n     necessary.\n       At the same time, I want to make clear that the Department \n     of Commerce takes violations of our export control law and \n     regulations very seriously and is prosecuting them \n     aggressively. We have sufficient authority in current law to \n     do that and are also taking a number of steps to help \n     industry better meet its responsibilities. The Bureau of \n     Export Administration (BXA) is reviewing all computer exports \n     in the 2,000-7,000 MTOPS category; where there are concerns, \n     BXA has initiated investigations; where investigations show \n     that a U.S. law may have been broken, BXA has promptly \n     referred the matter to a U.S. Attorney's office for \n     prosecution; BXA has published the names of organizations and \n     other entities involved in activities of proliferation \n     concern (such as nuclear proliferation) to whom dual use \n     exports will require a license; and BXA is re-doubling \n     efforts to educate companies on their obligations to know \n     their customers.\n       I hope you will vote against the Cochran amendment and for \n     the Grams substitute. If you have questions about the \n     technology or\n\n[[Page S7138]]\n\n     our policy, I would be delighted to arrange a briefing for \n     you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 William M. Daley.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, let me share with my colleagues part of \nthe letter the Secretary of Defense has written in opposition to the \nCochran-Durbin amendment and the Spence-Dellums amendment. Secretary \nCohen says, ``I believe they are unnecessary and would undermine the \nflexibility that we need to adapt to the changing security requirements \nand technology trends.'' He goes on to say, ``We have a system and \nadequate authority under current law that can deal appropriately with \nunauthorized exports and diversions.''\n  The Secretary of Commerce is very strong on this point. He says the \nCochran amendment's proposed control levels are outdated because of the \nrapid pace of development of computer technology, and the widespread \navailability of the semiconductors required to run those machines.\n  From the National Security Adviser, Samuel Berger, we hear this. ``We \n[referring to the Administration] believe it is a mistake to set these \nexport control limits in concrete by mandating amendment of statutes, \nparticularly in view of the rapid growth in computing power available \nworldwide.''\n  He continues, ``[the Cochran amendment] drastically undercuts our \nflexibility to adjust controls to keep pace with technological change * \n* *.''\n  I think what we see here in this debate is the bipartisan effort here \nto ask our colleagues in the Senate to really look at the Cochran \namendment and to realize that it will really simply hurt us.\n  It reminds me of someone who wakes up in the morning feeling great, \neverything is going well, and then they just knock themselves in the \nface, knock themselves out. For what reason? There is absolutely no \nreason.\n  There is no reason to put these controls back on these midlevel \ncomputers. The current policy that is in place did not occur in a \nvacuum. The decision to decontrol was based on the collective wisdom \nand judgment of the Department of Commerce, the Department of Defense, \nthe State Department, intelligence agencies, and the Arms Control and \nDisarmament Agency. And the decision to decontrol the chips, that run \nthe computers, was made by the Bush administration. Why were those \ndecisions made? They were made because computers in the 2,000 through \n7,000 MTOPS ranges are mid-level computers that are widely available. \nThey are not supercomputers.\n  Let me repeat this because I know there is a lot of confusion on this \nissue. Computers in the 2,000 MTOPS through 7,000 MTOPS range are not \nsupercomputers. In fact, many computer servers will top the 2,000 MTOPS \nthreshold next year.\n  A server is the central computer in an office, and it holds \ninformation which all of the other computers in the office can access. \nIt is expected that next year a number of law firms, distribution \ncenters, dentist's offices, doctor's offices, car dealers, police \ndepartments, and even congressional offices will be using servers at \nthe 2,000 MTOPS level. Yet, if the Cochran-Durbin amendment were \nadopted, we would reimpose export controls on computers that we may be \nusing right here in the Senate next year.\n  Technology is advancing, as Secretary Cohen noted. It is being \ndeveloped and is moving forward at a very rapid pace, not only in this \ncountry, but in other countries as well. We cannot stop it, nor can we \nslow it down.\n  So it seems to me, Mr. President, our export policy should move \nforward, to keep pace with technology rather than move backward. By \nreimposing export controls on midlevel computers, as called for in the \nCochran amendment, we would in fact, however, be moving backward. \nMoving backward, Mr. President, without a clear national security \nrationale for so doing. That is not coming from Senator Boxer or \nSenator Grams or Senator Bond. It is coming from Secretary of Defense \nWilliam Cohen. It is coming from Samuel Berger, the National Security \nAdviser.\n  Our goal as policymakers should be to establish export policies which \nare efficient, effective and competitive while also ensuring that our \nnational security objectives are maintained. Current law achieves that \nobjective.\n  Does this mean we should allow companies to sell any computer at any \nlevel to any country notwithstanding our national security interests? \nOf course not. Our national security interests are paramount. They are \nparamount. Our export policies absolutely must ensure that our foreign \npolicy and security objectives, particularly as they relate to \nnonproliferation and counterterrorism, are maintained.\n  The Cochran-Durbin amendment, however, restricts our export \ncompetitiveness without furthering our national security objectives. \nLet me explain why the Cochran-Durbin amendment will not further our \nnational security objectives.\n  First, the independent study conducted in 1995 concluded that exports \nof computers in the 2,000 to 7,000 range, destined for civilian use, \nposed no national security risk. The Cochran amendment, however, would \nseverely restrict the sale of these computers to foreign commercial \nusers because, as my colleague Senator Grams has so clearly stated, it \ntakes an average of 107 days for the appropriate agencies--Commerce, \nDefense, State, and others--to issue export licenses on these mid-level \ncomputers. to buy a midlevel computer if you were a person who went \ninto the store in, let us say, a city in Israel; that is one of the \nTier 3 countries that would be impacted here.\n  Let me pose a question, and I think anyone can answer it. If you were \na businessman in, let us say, Israel, that is one of the Tier 3 \ncountries that would be impacted under the Cochran amendment, and \nwanted to purchase a computer from a United States manufacturer, but \nyou were told that the United States manufacturer from whom you wanted \nto purchase the computer would have to wait an average of 107 days to \nget an export license to ship the computer, would you purchase that \ncomputer from the United States manufacturer, or would you opt to \npurchase a similar computer from a Japanese manufacturer? Clearly, the \nanswer is that you would purchase from the Japanese manufacturer and \nnot the American manufacturer.\n  Now, if there was any national security reason for this, I would be \nstanding here arguing for it. But I do not see what national security \nobjective is furthered when an Israeli dentist cannot go buy a computer \nfor his office. I frankly do not see it. Second, we also know that \nsophisticated advanced nuclear weaponry design is not conducted on \nmidlevel computers in the 2,000 through 7,000 range. And again, as my \ncolleague Senator Grams, has clearly stated, the computers are just \nboxes. It is the chip inside the computer which makes the difference, \nand those chips were decontrolled under the Bush administration.\n  Third, and I alluded to this earlier, we know the Japanese make these \ncomputers. We also know companies in France, Taiwan, the United \nKingdom, and Germany all manufacture computers in the 2,000 through \n7,000 MTOPS range.\n  And how about this? China is producing computers at the 13,000 MTOPS \nlevel, far above the level which the Cochran amendment seeks to \ncontrol.\n  So what are we doing here? We are hurting one of the most robust and \nimportant industries in our country, and there is no reason to do it. \nWe cannot control the uncontrollable. If we were the only ones in the \nworld that made these computers, this debate would be worth having, but \nwe are not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will inform the Senator from \nCalifornia that she has now consumed 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair. Will you tell me when I have used 3 \nmore minutes and then I will yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So we cannot turn back the hands of time. All of those \ncountries make these computers already. We are hurting ourselves for no \nrational purpose.\n  Finally, in analyzing this issue, I think it is also important to \nconsider whether we as Senators have the expertise to determine what \nmakes a supercomputer. I really believe we do not have that expertise \namong us. The Secretary of Defense has all of that expertise at his \ndisposal. The National Security Adviser has all of that expertise at \nhis disposal. The Secretary of Commerce has all of that expertise at \nhis\n\n[[Page S7139]]\n\ndisposal. And each opposes the Cochran amendment. So I do not think \nthat any of us, individually or collectively, possess the knowledge to \nmake that kind of determination. I think the fact that we have Senators \nreferring to a 2,000 MTOPS computer as supercomputer evidences that \nfact. We know that 2,000 MTOP computers are not supercomputers because \nthe experts have concluded otherwise.\n  So I hope that my colleagues will join the Democratic leader and will \njoin us and vote for the Grams-Boxer amendment. I think we should study \nthis issue further and defer to the Secretary of Defense and to the \nintelligence agencies. I think that would set us on the appropriate \ncourse.\n  I thank my colleague for his generosity, and I yield back to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from California for \nthat excellent statement, and I appreciate her support on this \namendment as well.\n  Mr. President, I would like to now yield time to the Senator from \nMissouri [Mr. Bond] for whatever time he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished manager of the \namendment.\n  As a former chairman of the Banking Subcommittee on International \nFinance, it is a pleasure to rise in support of the amendment offered \nby the current chair of that subcommittee and the current ranking \nmember. We spent a lot of time in the International Finance \nSubcommittee trying to figure out what export controls work and what \ncontrols do not work.\n\n  Let me tell you something, Mr. President. The one thing that we have \nlearned is we do not spend enough time in dealing with the truly \ncutting-edge technology, the major supercomputers that need to be \ncontrolled. And why? Because we spend too much time on things that are \nreadily available in Radio Shack in the United States or similar stores \nthroughout the world. Why are we wasting our time trying to control \nsomething that any attache from an Embassy can walk into a store here \nin the United States and pick up and send home or can be found in a \nstore in almost any major city in the world.\n  Two years ago, the Clinton administration put to an end the \nrequirement that a U.S. exporter of computer technology attain a \nCommerce Department license prior to selling computer equipment with a \ncapacity greater than 2,000 MTOPS to any Third Tier nation--2,000. We \nneed to keep these numbers in mind and, unfortunately, there are a lot \nof numbers going to be thrown around. We are talking about the range of \n2,000 to 7,000.\n  Now, the administration arrived at this decision at the conclusion of \na detailed study by a professor at Stanford University conducted in \nassociation with the Department of Defense and the Department of \nCommerce. These parties concluded that the marginal benefit to national \nsecurity cannot justify requiring U.S. exporters of technology at this \nlevel to be licensed for sale to nonmilitary users. Acting on the \nconclusions of this very credible source and with the concurrence of \nthe Defense and Commerce Departments, the administration rolled back \nthe regulatory requirement that the first-degree amendment of the \ndistinguished Senators from Mississippi and Illinois would seek to \nreimpose. In spite of my great respect for my esteemed colleagues from \nMississippi and Illinois, let me say that rolling back the decontrols \nis unwise and misdirected policy, and I hope that our colleagues will \njoin us in supporting the second-degree amendment.\n  The policy of the legislative change in the first-degree amendment \nquite simply cannot be policed, it cannot be enforced, it is \nineffective, and it does little to contribute to our national security. \nI might add, ``harsh letter to follow.'' I think if you would take \nthose four points--it cannot be policed, it cannot be enforced, it is \nineffective, and does not contribute to our national security--it does \nharm our economic competitiveness. It does take away jobs from \nAmericans.\n  The question here is about computer technology, but it is also about \ncomputer chips. Dozens of computer chips with a typical capacity of 650 \nMTOPS are available commercially all over the world--650 MTOPS. I \nhappened to stop by the candy desk, and I picked up four pieces of \ncandy. Each one of these could hold a computer chip wrapped in a couple \nof layers of protective shipping material. Four 650 MTOPS chips would \ngive you the capacity of 2,600 MTOPS--600 MTOPS above the level. If \nthese were four computer chips, that would give you more computing \npower than the minimum amount to be licensed in sales under this first-\ndegree amendment. I am told that anyone with the know-how, basic \nelectronic know-how, can fashion these chips together in a computer \nwith capacity that is far greater than that which would be regulated \nunder this amendment.\n  I cite this example to show that it is nearly impossible to prevent \nthe transport of certain technology particularly when it can be carried \nout of the country in somebody's pocket. It is simply fruitless to \nattempt to control technology at this level through export control \nmeasures.\n\n  Now, the proponents and my friend from Illinois have talked about \nsales of supercomputers to our adversaries. If that is what we were \ntalking about, if we were talking truly about supercomputers, I would \nbe on their side because I do not think we ought to be selling \nsupercomputers. Supercomputers that do military work these days are \n20,000 MTOPS to 650,000 MTOPS. They are talking about computers 10 \ntimes, 10 times the range that would be covered by this regulation.\n  Now, the Senator from Illinois said that the servers we have in our \noffices are about 200 to 250 MTOPS. I just checked with the computer \ncenter, and the Pentium server that we have in our office to do such \nsophisticated things as handle the mail and try to get the split \ninfinitives out of the letters my staff prepares for me and handle \nmemoranda and keep the books in our office is a 1,500 MTOPS computer. \nThat server is 1,500, just under the level that would be regulated. And \nwe do the high-technology stuff like keep the mail and send e-mail \nmessages. I have even learned how to use it. That is how simple it is.\n  With little benefit to national security, the first-degree \namendment's proponents are preparing to deliver a serious blow to the \nAmerican computer industry. With very little to show for it, the \nadvocates of this amendment are advocating the subjection of the entire \ncomputer industry to a cumbersome bureaucratic process and a \nsignificant regulatory burden. Our competitors certainly will not be \njoining us in this effort. To the contrary. When they have concluded \ntheir celebration and breaking open the champagne bottles to celebrate \ntheir capture of this market, they will use this opportunity to leave \nour manufacturers in the dust. While perhaps our most dynamic industry \nis forced to comply with added regulatory obstacles, our competitors \nwill be selling to our country's former customers.\n  This amendment, Mr. President, is a blow because it is not regulating \nthe sale of supercomputers. The technology we fear will be employed to \nupgrade weapons systems. The amendment actually regulates the sale of \ntechnology on the level of an office server or an office workstation, a \ntremendous market for our manufacturers. In a short period of time, \nthis amendment will be regulating personal computers and we will be \ndoing it by legislation that will have to be changed. You know how \nquickly we change things around here. Not that quickly.\n  Many levels of technology far below that which pose national security \nrisks will be subjected to this policy. Leadership in the computer \nindustry is incredibly important to the prosperity of this country. We \ncannot afford to foreclose those markets. The disadvantage to our \nproducers on the world market cannot be understated. The potential loss \nof U.S. jobs cannot be underestimated. And the risk to our leadership \nin the industry should not be jeopardized in this manner.\n  I do not take lightly the reports of technology being diverted to \nunauthorized military users. This is a serious matter that requires our \nattention. That is why it is important to study\n\n[[Page S7140]]\n\nthe 1995 decontrol and evaluate its effectiveness. I believe that we \nwill find that it was unlikely that these transfers could have been \nprevented and that they are an inevitable byproduct of the world \nmarket. But, should it be concluded that decontrol is a threat, \ncorrective measures can and should be taken in a prompt fashion. They \ncan be taken administratively. However, to backtrack today with a \nlegislative enactment would be a mistaken rush to judgment and risks \nplacing our companies at a significant competitive disadvantage.\n\n  It has already been pointed out, and I believe the Senator from \nCalifornia has offered into the Record the opposition of the Department \nof Commerce, the Department of Defense, the administration, and several \nof my colleagues. I note just one provision in the letter from our \nformer colleague, the former Senator from Maine now the Secretary of \nDefense, Bill Cohen. He says in that letter:\n\n       I am a strong advocate for effective export controls. To be \n     most effective, we must focus our limited export control \n     resources on the export of goods and technologies that can \n     make a significant difference for national security and \n     nonproliferation reasons.\n\n  Mr. President, that is the gist of this whole thing. We should not be \nfocusing our efforts on things that are readily available commercially. \nI agree with the Secretary of Defense that we ought to concentrate our \nefforts on the true supercomputers and make sure that those, not office \nworkstations, are kept out of the hands of potential adversaries.\n  We need to be selling to countries like Israel workstations and \noffice things, personal computers, that would, if the first-degree \namendment were adopted, be subject to a lengthy licensing process.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the second-degree \namendment of the chairman of the subcommittee, my friend from \nMinnesota. I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President I rise today in opposition to the \nCochran/Durbin amendment to the Defense Authorization bill. The \namendment would bar the sale of many types of computers, denying export \nopportunities for American firms, shifting high-technology sales to \ninternational competitors and flooding the Commerce Department with \nexport applications for routine computer sales.\n  Rather than impose new restrictions, the Senate should adopt a \nsubstitute amendment, offered by Senator Rod Grams of Minnesota and my \nCalifornia colleague Barbara Boxer. The Grams/Boxer substitute would:\n  Require the Commerce Department to improve its licensing process and \nprovide more information to exporters, assisting exporters to identify \nsuspicious potential purchasers and avoid questionable sales.\n  Require the General Accounting Office to study the impact of proposed \nexport restrictions and the impact of foreign availability of computers \non U.S. exports.\n  Rather than restrict a broad range of computer exports, the Grams/\nBoxer substitute amendment will help the administration and exporters \ndistinguish between the potentially damaging sales that place us at \nrisk and the routine computer sales.\n\n\n           Export Controls Must Apply to the Right Computers\n\n  Since the 1940's, the United States has controlled the export of \ndual-use technology, advanced technology which has both defense and \nnondefense applications. These restrictions are appropriate, because we \nall want to keep critical military technology out of the hands of \npotentially hostile militaries.\n  However, technology advances rapidly. What was called a supercomputer \nonly a few years ago, represents only routine computing power today. We \ncannot lock up U.S. exports and deny the administration the necessary \nflexibility to respond to evolving technology and worldwide \ncompetition.\n  In 1993, the administration conducted a thorough review, involving \nthe Departments of State, Defense, and Commerce, intelligence agencies \nand the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. The resulting U.S. policy \npermits the export of computers capable of 2,000 to 7,000 million \ntheoretical operations per second [MTOPS] for Tier 3 countries. Among \nthe more than 50 tier 3 countries are the countries of the former \nSoviet Union, Israel, Saudi Arabia, India, and China.\n  Export restrictions must be based on an objective review of a \ncomputer's computing power and the computing needs of the potential \ncomputer application. As Defense Secretary Cohen stated, ``we need to \nmaintain a system that allows us to adjust our controls when technology \nadvances and when technology becomes widely available. Putting specific \ncontrol levels into state is not an appropriate means to meet these \noften fast-changing challenges.''\n\n\n               the cochran/durbin amendment is overbroad\n\n  The Cochran/Durbin amendment would prohibit the export of computer of \n2,000 to 7,000 MTOPS from being exported to any Tier 3 country without \nan export license. The amendment is overbroad and will deny sales for \nU.S. companies and undermine our long-term national security needs.\n  The amendment will restrict the sale and export of ordinary work \nstations and computers, not just supercomputers. Many low-level work \nstations currently exceed the 2,000 MTOPS level, and are found in \noffices, ranging from law firms to auto dealerships, across the \ncountry. By 1998, personal computers will exceed the 2,000 MTOPS level \nand would be subject to the amendment's licensing requirement. At a \ntime when many have urged the complete abolition of the Commerce \nDepartment, the Cochran amendment will trigger a flood of export \napplications for new categories of common computers.\n\n\n          The Restrictions Will Not Increase National Security\n\n  The proposed amendment will not enhance U.S. national security. In \n1995, the administration's review concluded computers of 2,000 to 7,000 \nMTOPS were widely available throughout the world and no longer \nconsidered to be a critical choke point for technologies used in the \ndesign, testing, or production of weapons of mass destruction.\n  However, if U.S. firms are denied the sales, manufacturers in other \ncountries are prepared to fill the void. Computers in the 2,000 to \n7,000 MTOPS range are manufactured in Japan, as well as 4 European \ncompanies. China reportedly produces a 13,000 MTOPS computer, while \nRussia and India also already produce computers more powerful than \nthose the amendment would seek to control. The proposed restrictions \nwill not keep technology out of the hands of countries posing national \nsecurity concerns. The proposed restriction will be ineffective, \ndenying many legitimate transactions for valid purposes, while allowing \nmilitary testing proceeds through other means.\n\n\n                    Exporters Need More Information\n\n  Under current law, the manufacturers of computers are caught because \nthe Commerce Department cannot release the name or circumstances when \nan export license application is rejected. The notice of the rejection \nof a license is only provided to the individual exporting applicant.\n  As a result, when a U.S. exporter's application is rejected, the \nsuspicious purchaser is encouraged to pursue alternative sellers and \nprovide false information to support the sale. If potential U.S. \nexporter could receive more information, potential sales to suspicious \npurchasers could be detected earlier.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the Cochran amendment. The amendment \nwill impose unnecessary restrictions on routine computer exports and \nundermine our national security in the long-run by shifting more sales \nto international competitors, many with weak or no export control laws \nat all.\n  Rather than impose new restrictions, the administration should \nprovide more information to potential exporters to assist in the \nidentification of suspicious potential purchasers.\n  The Grams/Boxer substitute will offer the appropriate incentives, \nwhile providing the administration with the authority to distinguish \nbetween sales that jeopardize national security and those that do not. \nWhile the administration needs flexibility to focus attention and \nresources on priority export applications, the Cochran amendment will \ndivert attention and resources away from high-priority areas, truly \nplacing our national security at risk. The Cochran amendment should be \nrejected.\n\n[[Page S7141]]\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Grams \nsecond-degree amendment. Today, America leads the world in the \ndevelopment and production of high performance computers and our \ncommercial interests in promoting exports of these machines is strong. \nTo restrict the export of computers at the level set by the Cochran \namendment would unnecessarily hurt our companies without promoting our \nnational security.\n  I, like all other Senators, am concerned about how the export of \nadvanced technology affects our national security. Recent press stories \nhave made it all too clear that potential adversaries wish to acquire \nAmerican technology to assist their military efforts. In addressing \nthis issue, however, policymakers must strike a balance between the \ninterests of American companies and what is required to ensure our \nnational security. This is never an easy task and is made more \ndifficult with the rapid ace of development in the computer industry. \nWe need to be diligent in our efforts to try and match our policies to \nwhat is occurring in that industry.\n  Supercomputers are integral to the development of advanced weapons \ndevelopment. Therefore, our policy which restricts the export of the \nmost powerful computers is necessary and warranted. However, the \nperformance level of the computers that the Cochran amendment seeks to \ncontrol does not reach the extreme speeds of true supercomputers. The \nCochran amendment imposes controls on computers operating at 2,000 to \n7,000 million theoretical operations per second [MTOPS].\n  Today, a computer that operates at 2,000 MTOPS is considered a mid-\nlevel workstation. The next generation of chips may allow Senators to \nhave machines capable of that speed on their own desks by the end of \nnext year. High performance computers start at 10,000 MTOPS and go up \nto 1,000,000 MTOPS. Supercomputers are machines that operate above \n20,000 MTOPS and require validated export licenses under the current \npolicy.\n  In 1995, an extensive Government review of computer technology \ndetermined that critical defense applications required machines that \noperated above the 7,000 MTOPS level. Further, it was determined that \nmachines that operate below the 7,000 MTOPS level would soon become \nwidely available from foreign suppliers. The administration then \nproposed its current policy, which has strong restrictions on the sale \nof computers that operate above the 7,000 MTOPS and lesser restrictions \non machines that operate below that level. This decision was reviewed \nand approved by the Defense Department, the State Department, ACDA, and \nthe intelligence agencies. Information gathered by our intelligence \ncommunity since that decision was made support keeping the export \npolicy in its current form.\n  Today, companies in Germany, Italy, France, India, Japan, and Poland \nare selling computers that operate in the 2,000 to 7,000 MTOPS level. \nAnd the performance level of the computers foreign companies produce \ncontinues to grow. Even if availability of these machines were a \nlegitimate risk to national security, which it is not, restrictions on \nAmerican companies seeking to export computers in this range would have \nlittle or no effect on the ability of foreign militaries to acquire \nthis technology.\n  Further, simply placing license requirements on the sale of these \ncomputers would place American companies at an unfair disadvantage. We \nall know that sales of technology or any commodity depend on the speed \nof delivery. Foreign customers will not wait a week for an American \ncompany to receive a license if another vendor can deliver the same \nquality machine tomorrow.\n  Critics of the current policy believe its implementation has allowed \ncomputers to be diverted to illegitimate end users. The Commerce \nDepartment has not informed companies what foreign customers should or \nshould not receive this type of computers and places the burden on the \ncompanies to acquire this information. However, how well a policy is \nimplemented does not necessarily reflect on the prudence of the policy. \nIf there have been problems in how our current export policy is \nimplemented, recent changes made by the administration and measures \nimposed by the Grams amendment should help fix them.\n  I agree with Senator Grams that we should continue to evaluate our \ncomputer export policy and how foreign availability affects U.S. \nexports. We should also make it easier for companies to know which \nforeign companies, militaries, and nuclear end users should not receive \nour technology. I believe the current policy has been set at a level \nwhich both promotes American commercial interests and helps protect our \nnational security. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the \nGrams amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. How much time remains on both sides, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will advise the Senator from \nMississippi that 8 minutes 53 seconds remain under his control of time, \nand 9 minutes 42 seconds remain under the control of the time of the \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, does the distinguished Senator from South \nCarolina wish time on the amendment?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Cochran, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senator from Maine, Susan Collins, be added \nas a cosponsor of the Cochran amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee for his contribution to the understanding of \nthis issue and for his cosponsorship personally of the amendment and \nhis announcement that the distinguished Senator from Maine, Senator \nCollins, is now a cosponsor of the amendment. This indicates that we \nhave a broad base of cosponsors for the Cochran amendment, which means, \nif you are for the Cochran amendment, you would vote against the Grams \nand Boxer substitute for the Cochran amendment, because their amendment \nundermines the effort to impose a change in the current policy to \nrequire simply that our Department of Commerce approve sales of \ncomputer technology and computers by U.S. firms to overseas customers \nthat have a computing capability of between 2,000 MTOPS and 7,000 \nMTOPS, if they are certain kinds of countries called Tier 3 countries, \nto ensure that they are not military users or that the computers will \nnot be put to a military use.\n  The problem with the current policy is that the Department of \nCommerce is leaving it up to the U.S. exporters to make this \ndetermination now. Some have gotten into trouble because some, like \nSilicon Graphics in California, are now under a grand jury \ninvestigation because of sales made to questionable users in violation \nof the current policy. The question is whether they knew or should have \nknown that the end use was going to be military or the end user was \ngoing to be military; whether they exercised that degree of diligence \nrequired by the current policy.\n  Do we want to continue that kind of policy that puts at risk all of \nour computer companies when engaged in these international sales? I say \nno. It is time to put the onus, not on the computer company trying to \nmake a sale abroad, but on the Department of Commerce, which has the \nresponsibility of administering its own policies. But they are shifting \ntheir burden to the exporter, away from the Government, and this is \ncausing difficulty. It has resulted in seven very sophisticated, high-\nend supercomputers being used now by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, \nan arm of which is involved in the modernization of the Chinese nuclear \nweapon program and capabilities. In Russia, the chairman of the \nequivalent to the Atomic Energy Commission there, boasted that they now \nhave a supercomputer with a potential previously unknown, because of \nU.S. technology exports to Russia. That is the entity that modernizes \nand maintains the nuclear weapons of Russia.\n  What we are unwittingly doing by carrying forward and going forward \nwith this policy with no change, which is what the Grams amendment \nbasically suggests, it says make a list, tell\n\n[[Page S7142]]\n\neverybody who they should not sell to--you cannot do that. You cannot \npossibly make a list and put down all the fronts for the People's \nLiberation Army or others who might be involved in either developing \nnew weapons of mass destruction or exporting the technology for these \nweapons: North Korea, Iran, other countries and nation-states that we \nknow now are developing more and more sophisticated and lethal weapons \nof mass destruction capability, with delivery systems. We know that is \ngoing on.\n  Here we are providing the technology to do simulations that they \ncannot do now without our technology. They cannot buy this. They cannot \nbuy this from any other country except the United States. And we are \nleaving it up to U.S. exporters, saying our policy depends upon the \ngood intentions and the capabilities of our U.S. civilian companies to \ndetermine these end uses and end users, who they are, what they are \ngoing to do with the technology, whether or not they are going to \ntransship it to some other entity.\n  There are facts on the record, as a result of hearings held in our \nsubcommittee that has been looking at proliferation issues all year, \nthat are overwhelming and completely persuasive on this point. This \npolicy ought to be changed. The only way Congress can influence change \nis by adopting a change, by doing so in this amendment. We cannot issue \na regulation. We cannot make an administrative policy change here in \nthe Senate. We can ask them to do it. We have already done that and it \nhas not resulted in the change that is necessary. It is simply if you \nwere a suspicious end user, we want the Department of Commerce to \ncertify that it is OK to make that sale.\n\n  The Senator from California correctly discusses whether or not some \nof our closest allies are going to be adversely affected by this \namendment. Israel has been purchasing computer technology under \nexisting policy with licenses from the Department of Commerce. That is \ngoing to continue. That is not going to change. There is not going to \nbe any slowdown in the process if someone is a trusted ally or friend. \nWe don't even require licenses for our NATO allies. They are Tier 1 \ncountries. But the Tier 3 countries--that includes China, Russia, and a \nlot of other countries--do have to have the approval of the Department \nof Commerce under our amendment if the computer capability is within a \ncertain range.\n  These are not PC's. The Senator from Missouri, and my dear friend, \nsuggests that this is like the PC's on our desk, at our workstations in \nour offices. He is talking about the Pentium server, that is the \nnetwork, the hardware for the entire network. I know he did not mean to \nmisrepresent it, but you have to understand what he's talking about. He \nhas acted like an attache walks into Radio Shack and buys one of these \ncomputers that has an MTOPS speed and capability that would be \ndescribed in this amendment. That is not true. You cannot do that.\n  First of all, an attache could not afford it. These are expensive. \nThe fact is, we are talking about only 6.34 percent of the total \nsupercomputer sales that would be affected by this amendment. Mr. \nPresident, 95 percent of all of the sales have been approved within 30 \ndays that do require licenses. The Senator from Minnesota said it is \nover 100 days you had to wait to get approval. That is not borne out by \nthe facts, by the testimony before our subcommittee by the people at \nthe Department of Commerce.\n  So I am hopeful that Senators will think carefully about what we are \ntrying to do. I know the computer companies are putting a lot of \npressure on, sending everybody messages and phone calls and the rest. I \nwould not want to have to go through another process. But we are \ntalking about only such a small part of the market, a small part of \nthose manufactured workstations and other large pieces of hardware that \nhave the potential to be used to upgrade lethal weapons systems and \nmissile systems to make them more accurate, to make them more lethal, \nto make them competitive with the U.S. arsenal that is designed to \nprotect us. And we are going to put at risk our own system of national \ndefense? We can't do that.\n  Mr. President, I urge Senators to vote against the Grams-Boxer \namendment and then vote for the Cochran-Durbin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I inquire how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 9 minutes 42 \nseconds remaining, the Senator from Mississippi has 25 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to make one brief comment before I \nask to yield time to my colleague from New York.\n  I want to say our friend and colleague from Mississippi has a well-\nintended amendment, but it is aimed at the wrong level. These are not \nsupercomputers, as they continue to try to say. These are midlevel \ncomputers. If you are talking supercomputer, a low-end supercomputer \nstarts at 20,000 MTOPS and goes now to 650,000, and next year it will \nbe over a million; so these are not supercomputers.\n  Mr. President, I now would like to yield up to 7 minutes to my friend \nfrom New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized to \nspeak for up to 7 minutes.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, let me first say there are very few \ncolleagues for whom I have greater respect and who are more \nknowledgeable in the areas of national security than the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Mississippi, Senator Cochran. Indeed, he raises a \nvery valid and natural concern that we have with respect to nuclear \nproliferation and the ability to enhance systems by way of the \ncomputer, the supercomputer in particular, and the need for proper \nbalance in terms of export controls. That has been something which the \nBanking Committee has had jurisdiction over and has grappled with over \nthe years. So, while I am sympathetic to the concerns that are raised, \nI just have to think that the issues of computer sales to foreign \ncountries, as Senator Cochran has made clear to the Senate, is one that \nis so important that it really deserves much more analysis and much \nmore debate than can be allowed for this floor amendment.\n  Indeed, as the chairman of the Banking Committee's International \nFinance Subcommittee, I believe that Senator Grams has offered an \namendment that is worthy of our support, because what it would do, it \nwould allow the entire Senate to ascertain, by way of the kind of \ncomprehensive analysis that we need by the General Accounting Office as \nit relates to what security needs may be open at the present time, what \nconcerns are related to the sales of the high MTOPS computers to Tier 3 \ncountries and what impact they may or may not have on this legislation \nthat has been proposed.\n  I think Senator Grams' amendment is the proper way to proceed, to \ngive us an opportunity, not to just dive in after 45 minutes or 1 \nhour's worth of debate. We need the careful scrutiny, the careful \nstudy, to ascertain is there an availability of these computers to such \nan extent that this really becomes a meaningless impediment to our own \ntrade? Will there be other countries in Europe and other areas that \nwill rush to fill the vacuum? That is what I have been told. That may \nnot be correct, but let's ascertain, let's find out. That is what \nSenator Grams' second-degree amendment would accomplish.\n  It seems to me that makes sense. It would require the Commerce \nCommittee to publish a list of questionable military and nuclear end \nusers, with certain exceptions when sources and methods would be \njeopardized. That is what we have to know.\n  Let me depart just for a moment, if I might. If we want to do \nsomething as it relates to nuclear proliferation, let's say to some of \nthose countries who are looking to get most-favored-nation trading \nstatus, or continue it, that you cannot be exporting--when we know they \nare exporting--the kind of missile systems and delivery systems which \nChina is today exporting.\n  That becomes something of a controversy. Let's find out how many of \nmy colleagues are going to be willing to stand up to the business \ninterests who look the other way and don't look at our national \nsecurity interests or don't look at the abuse of human rights and the \ncrackdown on religious freedoms that take place now or the forced \nsterilization of people. That is\n\n[[Page S7143]]\n\nwhat is going on in China. They present, Mr. President, a very real and \nclear and present danger to the security of the world and to world \npeace by exporting to Iran and to other countries delivery systems and \nall kinds of enhancement of weapons systems which will endanger world \npeace.\n  If we really want to do something, let's take that up, but to simply \ncome forward at this point in time without the proper kind of \nanalysis--again, Senator Grams should be commended because his second-\ndegree amendment would say, ``OK, let's make a detailed analysis,'' and \nnot come down on the floor and raise this. I think this is what we have \nto do.\n  So not only on a jurisdictional basis would I have problems \nsupporting the Cochran amendment, but basically on the basis of fact. I \ndon't think we should just raise jurisdiction and say, ``That's within \nmy committee, and, therefore, I want it to come through my committee.'' \nI sometimes get upset about that. If it is good legislation, so what if \nit didn't come through the committee process properly, particularly \nwhen we are talking about matters of national security. So I don't just \nraise that, but it does need the kind of careful thought, careful \nanalysis that Senator Grams' amendment calls for.\n  For that reason, I hope that we support overwhelmingly this cautious \napproach to making analysis of whether or not the export of the MTOPS \nto Tier 3 countries should go through another process with Government \nbureaucrats analyzing and never coming to a decision. I think that \nwould be a mistake.\n\n  Again, let's take a look at China: $50 billion surplus in trade, and \nyet she does what she wants, and she claims she wants friendship with \nus. I think on the altar of the almighty dollar, we just continue \nbusiness as usual. I am more concerned about saying to them, ``You \ncan't be our friend on one hand, you can't be enjoying a $50 billion \ntrade surplus with us and then have a half a billion dollar industry \nthat your generals are running,'' and we say, ``Oh, no, don't rock the \nboat.''\n  Do we really want to stop nuclear proliferation? Do we want to stop \nthe export of deadly weapons systems? Let's do it when we have some \nclout, and we do have some clout. But I am afraid we will succumb to \nthose who say, ``Oh, we can't do this, we'll lose a lot of jobs here in \nthis country if we stand up to that kind of activity.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I yield another minute to my colleague from \nCalifornia and coauthor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to say to my colleague, it has been \na pleasure working with him and his staff. I think that what we are \noffering here is a very wise alternative to an unwise policy. I am \nlooking at the Tier 3 countries, and my colleague from Mississippi said \nthere is no difference in what will happen to Israel under this \namendment than under current law. It isn't true. Tier 3 includes \nIsrael, Romania, who wants to join NATO, Latvia, and other countries. \nIf a business wanted to buy a computer that fell in the 2,000 to 7,000 \nMTOPS range, which we have already established is mid-level computer, \nand we are going to have them right here in the Congress next year, \nthen that business would have to wait an average of 107 days.\n  Mr. President, this Cochran amendment is kind of a ``Back to the \nFuture'' amendment. It might have some application if it was offered \nmany years ago, but it doesn't have any application now. I think the \nGrams-Boxer amendment, which has so much support from Secretary Cohen, \nfrom Sandy Berger, from Secretary Daley, from so many Senators on both \nsides of the aisle, I think that is the appropriate course to take. I \nreally hope that our colleagues have listened, and I hope that the \nGrams-Boxer amendment prevails. I yield back to my colleague.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 55 seconds, and \nthe Senator from Mississippi has 25 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, in wrapping up the debate this morning, I \nwant to, again, say that I believe the controls we have in place are \nworking. We are taking a step backward if we approve the Cochran-Durbin \namendment. The rest of the world is moving forward very fast. Anybody \nwho has bought a computer in the last 2 years knows that technology has \nalready passed them, and they have to look at a new system. But between \nthe 2,000 and the 7,000 MTOPS level, computers are going to become so \ncommonplace that any commercial industry or any office in this country \nwill be able to buy them next year. These are well intended controls \nbut, again, as I say, placed on the wrong levels. These are not \nsupercomputers. These are not computers that countries would be looking \nfor military end use. These are computers that are more for business \nand office use. I believe that putting any kind of restrictions or \nrecontrolling these would be a step backward in our efforts to provide \njobs and assistance.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, at the outset of the debate, I made a \nspeech that lasted about 20 minutes. It is in the Record, so I am not \ngoing to make it again. I will try to make it in 25 seconds.\n  We are limiting export controls in a very small area of lethal \ncomputer technology. Please vote against the Grams-Boxer weakening \namendment and support the Cochran-Durbin-Thurmond-Glenn amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to the second-degree amendment No. 422. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Roberts pertaining to the introduction of S. 1000 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 668\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I call up amendment 668.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment \nnumbered 668 is now the pending question.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Harkin.\n  Mr. President, let me begin by asking unanimous consent that letters \nfrom the Disabled American Veterans, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, \nand the Vietnam Veterans of America be printed in the Record in support \nof this amendment.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Disabled American Veterans,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 1997.\n     Hon. Paul David Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: On behalf of the more than one \n     million members of the Disabled American veterans (DAV), I \n     express our strong support for your efforts to provide \n     funding to enable Brookhaven National Laboratory to conduct \n     internal dose reconstruction of veterans exposed to ionizing \n     radiation (atomic veterans) and to transfer some $400 million \n     to the Department of veterans Affairs (VA) budget for health \n     care.\n       The DAV believes that $16.959 billion is inadequate--by at \n     least $600 million--to enable VA to provide quality and \n     timely health care to veterans. Your amendment would greatly \n     enhance VA's ability to provide adequate health care to our \n     Nation's sick and disable veterans.\n       Additionally, according to the VA, very few atomic veterans \n     or their survivors have been successful in establishing that \n     the veteran's disability, recognized as a ``radiogenic \n     disease,'' is the result of the veteran's exposure to \n     ionizing radiation in service. The main reason for the high \n     failure rate is due to the current, inadequate and inaccurate \n     method of reconstructing dose estimates which routinely \n     indicate minimal radiation exposure.\n       Senator Wellstone, your amendment would ensure that \n     America's atomic veterans will have available to them Fission \n     Tracking Analysis, a more accurate method of dose \n     reconstruction. Surely, fairness and equity in the \n     adjudication of atomic veterans' claims is the very least \n     that our Nation owes to these brave veterans who were used to \n     advance our country's knowledge of the effects of ionizing \n     radiation, unbeknownst to them.\n       Again, you have the full support of the more than one \n     million members of the DAV in your efforts to ensure that the \n     VA has adequate funding to care for America's sick and \n     disabled veterans and to ensure that atomic veterans are \n     provided with accurate internal dose reconstruction to \n     support their claims.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  David W. Gorman,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                Paralyzed Veterans of America,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 1997.\n     Hon. Paul David Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: On behalf of the members of \n     Paralyzed Veterans of America, please accept our full support \n     for your efforts to increase needed funding for health care \n     benefits and services provided by the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs (VA).\n       As you well know, the proposed FY 1998 VA budget calls for \n     unprecedented reductions in current and proposed \n     appropriations for the health care system. The actual \n     appropriation request freezes VA discretionary funding at a \n     level far below current levels. The only relief given to VA \n     over that period of time comes from a very uncertain plan \n     allowing VA to keep fees and reimbursements from private \n     insurance companies to help cover increasing health care \n     costs. Even with this budget gimmick, VA hospitals will \n     remain seriously under funded next year and in future years \n     under the proposal.\n       Again, we appreciate your efforts to correct this serious \n     funding shortfall, and urge all members of the Senate to \n     support your amendment.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                              Gordon H. Mansfield,\n     Executive Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                            Vietnam Veterans of America, Inc.,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 1997.\n     Hon. Paul Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: On behalf of Vietnam Veterans of \n     America (VVA), I want to thank you for your efforts to secure \n     additional funding for veterans medical care. VVA is pleased \n     to support your amendment to the DOD Authorization bill which \n     would transfer $400 million to VA medical care.\n       As you know, the veterans community remains very concerned \n     about the impacts of discretionary spending cuts on VA \n     medical care and benefits processing. Both programs are in a \n     state of major transition, implementing significant reforms \n     and procedural improvements which will--in time--create \n     enhanced efficiencies. The Senate and House budget \n     reconciliation bills, as well as the appropriation bill \n     moving through the House right now and soon to be considered \n     in the Senate, are placing veterans health care in jeopardy \n     by depending upon VA's ability to collect insurance monies \n     for over $600 million over VA's FY 1998 health care budget. \n     This is a very tenuous plan, as the program is untested and \n     the targeted amount seems overly optimistic.\n       As it currently stands, VA's FY 1998 budget offers the \n     veterans community no guarantee that the national commitment \n     to provide care to our disabled and low-income veterans will \n     be honored. Again, VVA appreciates your strong advocacy for \n     veterans programs and urges the Senate to adopt your \n     amendment. Veterans benefits, after all, are an ongoing cost \n     of our national defense.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                George C. Duggins,\n                                               National President.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, these letters are extremely important. \nThey are from three very fine veterans organizations: The DAV, the PVA, \nand the Vietnam Veterans of America. The reason they are concerned, \nand, for that matter, all of the veterans community is concerned, is \nthat in the budget resolution what we ended up putting into effect was \na cut in veterans health care benefits.\n  Mr. President, the portion of those cuts that directly affect \nveterans health care is $400 million. What this amendment does is \nsimply authorize the Secretary of Defense the ability to be able to \ntransfer this $400 million into the veterans health care.\n  Mr. President, let me just say to colleagues that this is a huge \nissue. I am positive that if my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans \nalike, get a chance to talk with the veterans organizations and \nveterans communities in their States, they will find out that people \nare really indignant about this because it was never clear--I don't \nthink it was clear to any of us--that, in fact, we were voting for \nactual cuts, actual cuts in veterans health care.\n  What this amendment does, it says, look, we have $2.6 billion in the \nPentagon budget more than the Pentagon asked for; we can at least take \na portion of this. And please remember, all this amendment does is give \nthe Secretary of Defense the discretion or the authority to be able to \ntransfer it. It is not a mandate. It seems very appropriate.\n  Mr. President, it seems like this amendment that Senator Harkin and I \nhave introduced is eminently reasonable because if you think about it, \none of the huge concerns in the Veterans' Committee is very much linked \nto national defense. We are talking about men and women who have served \nour country. As we look at veterans health care and we project to the \nfuture, we want to make sure we do not end up sacrificing the quality \nof care for veterans.\n  I know what I hear back in the State of Minnesota, first and \nforemost, we have now an increasing number of gulf war veterans who are \nin need of help. This is yet an additional challenge for the VA. This \nis an additional challenge for our country to get the care to these \npeople.\n\n  Mr. President, this amendment, again, just authorizes the Secretary \nof Defense to make this transfer of funding. These veterans were all \nabout serving our country in defense of our country. If there ever was \nan opportunity to restore this funding for veterans health care, it is \nnow. This Congress, whether it is this afternoon, or whether it is next \nweek, or whether it is next month, is going to have to restore this \nfunding. I don't think there was one Senator that was clear, when we \npassed this budget resolution, that we were actually directing $400 \nmillion of cuts in veterans health care.\n  I will just tell you that more and more and more of the gulf war \nveterans are going to be stepping forward in\n\n[[Page S7145]]\n\nyour States, in our States, and they are going to be saying: We don't \nknow what happened to us, but we do know that before we went and \nserved, we could run 2 miles and we felt good, and now we can't walk a \nhalf mile, and we don't know what happened to us.\n  Over and over again, we are seeing report after report that makes it \ncrystal clear that the gulf war veterans have every reason in the world \nto be indignant about not getting information that they need to get \nfrom our Government and, more important, about their need to receive \nsome care. So what in the world are we doing cutting $400 million in \nthe veterans health care budget?\n  In addition, Mr. President, let me simply point out that above and \nbeyond the gulf war veterans, we have a situation where our veterans \npopulation is aging. More and more of our veterans are living to be 65 \nyears of age and over. More and more of our veterans are living to be \n85 years of age and over. And this is an additional strain.\n  So, Mr. President, I want to point out that, at the very time that \nveterans are showing up at VA hospitals in greater numbers, with \nincreasing health care costs generally and prospects for greater \nmedical costs specifically, at the very time that we have that going \non, we have a cut in this budget resolution.\n  So, what we are saying in this amendment--and I will defer to my \ncolleague from Iowa in a moment--we are saying, look, we have an excess \n$2.6 billion. It is more than the Pentagon asked for. We have a cut in \nveterans health care in the budget resolution to the tune of $400 \nmillion. It is clear it is going to have very negative consequences for \nveterans. The veterans community in our Nation--I have just three \nletters, from the PVA, DAV, and Vietnam veterans, and they are saying: \nYou can't do that. What about those of us who are struggling with \nposttraumatic stress syndrome? What about the Persian Gulf veterans? \nMore and more are asking: What happened to us? More and more of those \nveterans are asking for adequate care. What about the ever-increasing \naging population among veterans at the very time there is going to be \nmore of a strain? At the very time that we have more of a challenge, \nyou have cut $400 million.\n  This is an opportunity to come through for the veterans community. I \nhope it will happen today. I hope we get a very strong vote today. I \nsay this to all my colleagues. One way or another, we are going to have \nto restore this funding. This amendment, if you just think about the \nwording, just provides the Secretary of Defense with the authorization \nto transfer some of this funding to VA health care--$400 million--and \nit makes eminently good sense because, after all, these veterans who \ncome and seek health care within our VA health care system were the \nvery men and women who served our country in defense of our country.\n\n  Mr. President, how much time do we have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no time agreement.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield the floor?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Are we now debating this amendment?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if the Senator from Minnesota will yield \nfor a question, I simply have about 3 minutes I would like to talk, and \nit has nothing to do with this amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would rather not yield the floor at \nthe moment. But if my colleague wants to speak--do we have other \nSenators on the floor who want to speak on this amendment? My colleague \nfrom Iowa wants to speak on the amendment. If Senators want to cover \nother topics for a short period of time, I would be more than willing \nto defer to them. We want to try to make our case here before the vote. \nCan I ask my colleagues whether they are interested in debating this \namendment?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to speak about 10 minutes on the \nLevin amendment. I would certainly be willing to allow the Senator to \nmaintain his right to the floor, but this is unusual procedure. The \nSenator doesn't have a right to control the floor. He has a right to \nspeak, but he doesn't have a right to control the flow of debate for \nothers. I am willing to accommodate him, but this is an unusual \nprocedure. Being the accommodating person that I am, I am willing to do \nit. At some point, we might have to ask if the Senator is through \nspeaking and let somebody else speak.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, my amendment is pending now, I say to \nmy colleague from Texas. The Levin amendment is not pending. I have not \nyielded the floor yet, but I would be more than willing----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from Minnesota \nthat he can yield to his friend from Iowa for a question.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest that we follow the normal rules. \nIf the Senator wants to speak, we can go back and forth. That would be \nfine with this Senator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from New Hampshire be allowed to speak and the Senator from \nTexas for 10 minutes and then that be followed by the Senator from \nIowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/10/senate-section/article/S7131-6", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   WARWICK MILLS OF NEW HAMPSHIRE WEAVED THE AIR BAG TO PROTECT THE \n                           PATHFINDER ON MARS\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise on a matter that is not related \nspecifically to this bill, although it has to do with the issue of \nnational defense and technology, and that is the issue of our probe \nwhich is now on the planet Mars. What an exceptional thing it is, as we \nwatch the TV pictures come back as they analyze the rocks of Mars and \ndetermine that this planet is a fascinating place. We set history and \nwe can investigate the universe.\n  All of this is possible because of a product made in New Hampshire. I \nwanted to congratulate the Warwick Mills of New Ipswich, NH, a small \ncompany started in 1888. NASA decided they wanted to land this probe on \nMars, and they had to go to the Warwick Mills to be able to do it. It \nis one of the few places in this world that still weaves in the old-\nfashioned way. They were able to put together this fabric. This is a \npicture of the probe on Mars and the fabric that allowed the probe to \nset down on Mars without being damaged, and it allows it now to wander \naround the planet Mars and learn about the history of that \nextraordinary planet and to further the knowledge of man dramatically.\n  So from a little mill in New Ipswich, NH, started in 1888, using old-\nfashioned weaving machines, we sent the material to Mars. So on behalf \nof the State of New Hampshire, I congratulate this little firm that is \ndoing such an extraordinary job to advance the knowledge of America and \nthe world.\n\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, in response to what our colleague from New \nHampshire has stated, it is a testament of the genius of small business \nthat this wasn't a big scientific lab somewhere, this wasn't NASA with \nall of its billions; this was a small, independent business. I think we \ncan all rejoice in that.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think the Senator from Texas has probably been to \nIpswich and may have visited this small plant. We appreciate his \ninterest. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/10/senate-section/article/S7145-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7145-S7205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1998\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 778\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we have a pending amendment, the Levin \namendment, which I am strongly opposed to. Let me just basically state \nwhat I would like to do. I would like to set the issue in perspective. \nI am now working with the Federal Prison Industries to see if there \nmight be a second-degree amendment they could support. I intend to try \nto work with Senator Levin and his staff to see if something can be \nworked out. But I am strongly opposed to this.\n  Let me begin with Alexis de Tocqueville and work up to the Levin \namendment. When Alexis de Tocqueville came to America, he came\n\n[[Page S7146]]\n\nto America to study American prisons. He ended up writing a book about \ndemocracy in America, which turned out to be the greatest chronicle \never written of our great country. But one of the things Alexis de \nTocqueville wrote in his other book about prisons was that we had the \nmodel prison system on the planet because we had a mandatory work \nrequirement. As a result, prisoners all over America worked, generally, \n12, 14, 16 hours a day. De Tocqueville noted that they worked hard, but \nthat it probably made life bearable, and that it would have been worse \nhad they sat idle in prisons.\n  In fact, Mr. President, we had the model prison industry in the world \nuntil the Great Depression. During the Great Depression, we ended up in \na period of great economic unen-lightenment, passing a series of bills \nthat destroyed the greatest prison industry that the world has ever \nknown. We passed the Hawes-Cooper bill in 1929, we passed the Sumners-\nAshherst bill in 1935, and we passed the Walsh-Healey bill in 1936. \nHere is what these bills said. They said that nothing produced by \nprison labor can be transported across State lines without losing the \nprotections otherwise afforded interstate commerce. They said nothing \nproduced by prison labor can be transported across State lines to be \nsold in the marketplace, and they limited the use of prison labor. In \nother words, if you haven't figured it out yet, these three bills \ncriminalized prison labor in America.\n  As a result, today, we have the absurd situation that we have 1.1 \nmillion people in State and Federal prisons, almost all of them young \nmen in the peak work period of their life and because of special \ninterests--business and labor, I might add--we are forcing the American \ntaxpayer to pay $22,000 a year to let someone sit idle in air \nconditioning watching color television in prison, while American \nworkers break their backs working to pay to keep these people in \nprison.\n  Now, the only thing under Federal law that we can ask the Federal \nprisoners to do is to make things to sell to the Federal Government. \nThey can't produce things to sell in the marketplace. We spend more to \nkeep somebody in prison than we would sending them to Harvard \nUniversity. That is not even counting the cost of building the prison. \nNow, the Senator from Michigan would say that we are going to come in \nand disrupt the system whereby we force prisoners to work, to make \nfurniture for the Government, or to make other things for the Defense \nDepartment.\n  Now, if our colleague was really talking about procurement reform, I \nwould be a supporter. If this were a normal debate about price \ncompetition, then I would have no objection to his amendment. But our \ncolleague, with all the talk about competition, is not talking about \nremoving restrictions that would let goods produced by prisoners be \nsold on the open market. What he is proposing is that we disrupt the \nFederal Prison Industries as they currently exist.\n  Now, let me review for you, if I may very quickly, how the Federal \nPrison Industries system works. How the Federal Prison Industries works \nis basically that the Government goes out and gets bids on goods and \nestablishes a market price, a fair procurement price. Then they have to \ngo to the Federal Prison Industries and on the basis of an established \nprice they have to give the prison system the right to produce these \ngoods.\n\n  Might I note that Federal Prison Industries has a procedure where, if \nthe Defense Department or any other part of Government is not satisfied \nwith the work they do, or with the price, they can appeal for a waiver.\n  Let me read to you from a letter that is signed by the Assistant \nAttorney General who oversees the Federal Prisoner Work Program.\n\n       Federal Prison Industries does not abuse its mandatory \n     source status. If a customer feels that Federal Prison \n     Industries cannot meet its delivery, price, or technical \n     requirements, the customer may request [the customer is the \n     Government] a waiver of the mandatory sourcing.\n\n  Let me give you a concrete example because it is relevant to the \nSenator's amendment.\n  If Federal prisoners are working to produce desks for the Government, \nand the Government is not satisfied with the price or with the quality, \nthey can ask for a waiver so they don't have to buy the desk made by \nprison labor.\n  Here are the facts. These waivers are processed quickly. It is an \naverage of 4 days between the time the waiver is requested and when it \nis granted, or denied, and in 1996 Federal Prison Industries approved \n90 percent of the requested waivers by Federal agencies.\n  Mr. President, granted, this is not a price competitive system. If \nthis were any other procedure, the Senator's amendment would make \nperfectly good sense. Let's have competitive bidding. Let's have it at \nthe lowest possible price.\n  But we have 1.1 million people in State and Federal prisons. Because \nof the power of organized labor and special interest business who are \nmore worried about their profits and their benefits than they are about \nthe taxpayer, we are in the absurd position that we have 1.1 million \npeople in prison, all prime working age males, for all practical \npurposes, and they can't produce anything of value and sell it on the \nworld market to help defray the cost of keeping them in prison. So the \ntaxpayers pay $22,000 a year just to keep them in prison, not counting \nthe cost of building the prison. The only work we are getting out of \nthese people under this absurd situation is that we can force them to \nwork through a work program to produce things like furniture for the \nFederal Government.\n  The Senator comes along, and says, ``Let's eliminate that system, and \nlet's have price competition.'' Well, the problem, as we all know, is \nthat the money that is going to the prisoners is going to do things \nlike pay for victims restitution, and court-ordered fines. This is the \nonly productive employment we have for people in Federal prisons. This \nisn't a procurement issue. It is a criminal justice issue.\n  We ought not to be dealing with this provision on this bill. Let me \nread for you from the same letter about what we know about people who \nwork in prison versus those who do not work in prison.\n\n       Findings demonstrate that inmates who work in Federal \n     Prison Industries in comparison to similar inmates who do not \n     have Federal prison industry experience have better \n     institutional adjustment and after release are significantly \n     more likely to be employed and significantly less likely to \n     commit another crime.\n\n  Also, as this letter, which I will put in the Record, demonstrates \nover and over again, this is a law enforcement and security issue. If \nwe have all of these young males in prison, locked up, sitting idle, it \nis a powder keg ready to explode. The only productive source we have to \nput them to work, believing in the old Franklin adage, ``Idle hands are \nthe devil's workshop,'' is making goods for the Government.\n  If the Senator wants to try to refine the system, and work with \nFederal Prison Industries, I am willing to work to see if we can do a \nstudy and look. How competitive is the price? Could the system be \nimproved? But the idea that we are going to destroy the last vestiges \nof work in prison for some individual special interest for private \nmanufacturers of furniture, or private manufacturers of anything, \nsimply neglects the fact that prison labor is an important part of \nrunning a prison. It is the important part of preserving order. It is \nthe important part of vocational training. It is the important part of \nrehabilitation.\n\n  It is dangerous to have 1.1 million young men sitting in prison with \nnothing to do. It is also breaking the back of American workers to pay \nfor it.\n  What we ought to be debating is not the Senator's amendment to kill \nwhat is left of the work requirement. What we ought to be debating is \nrepealing these three Depression-era laws and putting 1.1 million \nprisoners to work, work them 10 hours a day, 6 days a week, and make \nthem to go to school at night. That is what we ought to be doing. In \nfact, when I was chairman of the Commerce, State, Justice \nappropriations subcommittee, we passed a bill in the Senate to do \nexactly that. And then when all of the special interests got geared up \nit died in conference and never became law.\n  So I think that this is a very dangerous amendment. This is something \nthat ought to be dealt with by the Judiciary Committee. This is a \ncriminal justice issue. If you want to argue this is a procurement \nissue, I can't argue against the Senator. If we were simply\n\n[[Page S7147]]\n\ntalking about procurement competitive bidding, it is obviously the way \nto go. But we have 1.1 million people in prison. They don't have \nanything to do. And to the extent that we can put them to work making \ndesks or other furniture for the Federal Government, we are at least \nputting them to work. We are maintaining order in our prisons. We are \nsaving money. We are paying money for victims restitution. We are \npaying money for court-ordered fines.\n  So to act as if this is just another procurement issue, clearly it is \nnot. Every time these people go to work, we have to count the tools \nwhen they leave to be sure they are not taking something that can \nbecome a weapon. We basically run it without much capital because we \nwant to use as many people as we can because we are not able to have \nthem produce things to sell on the market. We have elaborate procedures \nthat we have to go through to see that they don't compete with private \nindustry and to minimize their impact. All of these things drive up \ncosts.\n  But the point is when you have 1.1 million people in prison, State \nand Federal, even if it is a very inefficient system by which you have \nthem work, you still benefit by having them work. They still benefit by \nworking.\n  So I think this is a very important issue and I would like to ask to \nhave the opportunity to see if we can work something out.\n  I have a new letter that just came over a minute ago from the \nAssistant Director of Industries, Education and Vocational Training in \nthe Federal Bureau of Prisons. I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  Here is what it says, talking about the Levin amendment. `` * * * it \nwould have a devastating effect on Federal Prison Industries, Inc. and \non the ability of the Federal Prison Industries to support the mission \nof the Federal Bureau of Prisons.''\n  I concur with that judgment. I would like to have this put in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                    Federal Bureau of Prisons,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 10, 1997.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: I have reviewed the attached draft \n     language, which I understand was introduced last night by \n     Senator Levin as an amendment to the Defense Authorization \n     bill.\n       This language is virtually identical in its effect to \n     language previously proposed by Senator Levin (S. 339). For \n     reasons previously explained in a letter from Assistant \n     Attorney General Andrew Fois to Senator Thurmond, it would \n     have a devastating effect on Federal Prison Industries, Inc. \n     (FPI) and on the ability of FPI to support the mission of the \n     Federal Bureau of Prisons.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Steve Schwalb,\n\n                                               Assistant Director,\n                    Industries, Education and Vocational Training.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am not arguing that having real full-\nblown price competition would not make sense under virtually any other \ncircumstance. But when we have literally a captive labor force at the \nState and Federal level of 1.1 million people, it would be absolutely \nsuicidal from a societal point of view to limit the last work that \nthese people are allowed to do in the name of price competition when, \nin fact, if we wanted to have price competition--in fact, let me say I \nwould support the Senator's amendment, if he would add to it that we \nwould repeal all of the provisions that limit the ability that we have \nand that the States have in selling things produced by prisoners. If we \ncould allow prisoners to sell things on the open market subject to the \nrestrictions that they not sell it locally and that they not glut the \nmarket, with that as a second-degree amendment, I would support this \namendment. Because if we didn't depend solely on Government work to \nwork prisoners, then I would see a broader extension for competition.\n  But this is the only thing that Congress allows these people to do. \nWhat we are doing is just creating a hothouse for criminal behavior. \nThese people sit idly in prison with nothing to do because our laws \nprevent them from working and then they get out and they commit more \ncrimes. They impose havoc and death on our society, and then we put \nthem back into prison.\n  So, if I sound that I am emotional about this issue, I am. This is a \nvery, very serious issue.\n  So I would like to have a chance to work with the Senator. I would \nlike to see if we could work out a second-degree amendment. But I \nintend to resist this amendment. If we can't work something out, we are \ngoing to have to have cloture on this amendment. Those are my rights as \na Senator. Those are the rules of the Senate. And I intend to stand by \nmy rights and abide by the rules of the Senate on this issue.\n  It is a very important issue. I am not sure that Members have thought \nthis thing through or know really anything about our problems with \nFederal prison labor and State prison labor. But fortunately, having \nbeen Justice Subcommittee chairman when I was on the Appropriations \nCommittee, I know it all too well. I am adamantly opposed to this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, talk about emotions. We ought to share the \nemotions of the business people who can't compete, who aren't allowed \nto compete on products that are being bought by the Federal \nGovernment--their Government using taxpayers' money paying more for \nproducts, created in a prison by prisoners, rather than by people \noutside of prison, who are not allowed to compete because of the \nmonopoly which is given to Federal Prison Industries.\n  You talk about raw emotions. Try a Vietnam vet who is trying to \nsustain a small business who isn't permitted to sell his product to the \nGovernment at a much cheaper rate than the Government is paying with \nFederal Prison Industries. You want to talk about raw emotions. Put \nyourself in the position of the small business person.\n  Listen to this one from Access Products from Colorado Springs. They \ncouldn't bid on an Air Force contract for toner cartridges because the \nFBI exercised its right to take the contract on a sole source basis.\n  This is a letter from a small business person in Colorado.\n\n       Federal Prison Industries bid on this item, and I was told \n     that the award had to be given to Federal Prison Industries. \n     Federal Prison Industries won the award at $45 per unit. My \n     company's bid was $22 per unit. The way I see it the \n     government just over-spent my tax dollars to the tune of \n     $1,978. Do you seriously believe that this type of \n     procurement is cost effective? I lost business, my tax \n     dollars were misused because of unfair procurement practices \n     mandated by Federal regulation. This is a prime example, and \n     I am certain not the only one, of how the procurement system \n     is being misused and small businesses in this country are \n     being excluded from competition with the full support of \n     Federal regulation.\n\n  Do you want to talk about emotions? My good friend from Texas: How \nabout the Vietnam vet trying to run a furniture business? This is what \nhe testified to in front of the House. ``Is it justice that Federal \nPrison Industries would step in and take business away from a disabled \nVietnam veteran twice wounded fighting for our country effectively \ndestroying and bankrupting that hero's business which the Veterans \nAdministration suggested that they enter?''\n  My good friend from Texas usually believes in competition. I have \nheard him on this floor as eloquently as anyone talking about \ncompetition. That is all we are talking about here. We are only talking \nabout allowing people to compete to sell at the lowest price.\n  We are not trying to say that Federal Prison Industries should not be \nable to compete on products that are sold to the Federal Government. Of \ncourse, they should. But should not the small businessperson paying the \ntaxes be allowed to compete?\n  We talk about emotions on this floor and feeling emotional about a \nsubject. Put yourself in the position of the small businessperson whose \nprice is lower. Despite the fact that prisoners' wages run from 23 \ncents an hour to $1.15 an hour, despite the fact that Federal Prison \nIndustries pays no income taxes, no need to provide health or \nretirement benefits to workers, a private businessperson still, in many \ncases, is able to produce that product more cheaply and is told: Sorry, \nit's got to go to Federal Prison Industries. He's a clothing producer; \nhe's a textile producer; he's a product producer, and he\n\n[[Page S7148]]\n\nis told Federal Prison Industries has the monopoly. They have exerted \ntheir right to prevent you from coming in at a lower price. There is an \nestablished price, and even though you can beat it, private \nbusinessperson, sorry.\n  With all of the advantages, the price advantages that Federal Prison \nIndustries has--cheap labor, no medical cost, no income taxes--if they \ncan't beat a commercial price for a product, then the taxpayer should \nnot make up the difference.\n  Now, this is a very fundamental issue. Of course, prisoners should \nwork. But if they cannot with all those advantages produce a product \nmore cheaply than the commercial world can produce it, they ought to be \nlooking at other products. They ought to be looking at things which we \nimport and are sold to the Government. There they will not be unfairly \ndisplacing American businesses and American workers who can produce \nsomething more cheaply than can Federal Prison Industries.\n  Now, that is what this issue is about, and I want to make sure that \nwe all focus on this. This is an issue of where a business can provide \nthe product more cheaply. This is not an amendment which says that \nwhere an American business can supply a product, Federal Prison \nIndustries should not be allowed to supply it to the Government. That \nis not this amendment. This is simply an amendment which says where the \ncommercial provider can offer a product to the Government, its \nGovernment, our Government at a cheaper price than Federal Prison \nIndustries, Federal Prison Industries should not be able to determine \nthat its product at a higher price must be bought by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Now, we are talking a lot of bucks here. The Defense Department is \nthe biggest purchaser. This is what Master Chief Petty Officer Hagan \nstated when he was--he is from the Navy--testifying in front of the \nHouse National Security Committee. This is his testimony about the \nFederal Prison Industries monopoly on Government contracts and how that \nmonopoly has undermined the Navy's ability to improve living conditions \nfor sailors.\n  How is that for emotions? Are our sailors entitled to the best that \ncan be bought at the cheapest price? Or are we going to say that \nbecause Federal Prison Industries hasn't figured out what they can \nproduce which is now imported or what they can produce which now has a \nhigher cost--and the recycling business is a wonderful example of \nthat--because Federal Prison Industries has not figured out what can be \nproduced which does not in a noncompetitive way displace American \nbusinesses and American labor, that is OK.\n  It is not OK.\n  This is what the Navy witness said.\n\n       Speaking frankly, the FPI product is inferior, costs more, \n     and takes longer to procure. FPI has, in my opinion, \n     exploited their special status instead of making changes \n     which would make them more efficient and competitive. The \n     Navy and other services need your support to change this law.\n\n  We are here on a defense bill. This is what the Navy representative \ntestifying in front of the House said.\n\n       The Navy and other services need your support to change \n     this law and have FPI compete with private sector furniture \n     manufacturers under GSA contracts. Without this change, we \n     will not be serving sailors or taxpayers in the most \n     effective and efficient way.\n\n  We have had estimates now on the cost to the taxpayers that results \nfrom this monopoly where Government agencies are forced to buy products \nat higher than the lowest bid. The Deputy Commander of Defense \nLogistics wrote in May 1996 that Federal Prison Industries had a 42 \npercent delinquency rate in its clothing and textile deliveries \ncompared to a 6 percent delinquency rate for commercial industry.\n  Now, for this record of poor performance--that is just the \nperformance statistics: 42 percent delinquency on Federal Prison \nIndustries versus 6 in the private sector--for this record of poor \nperformance, Federal Prison Industries charged prices that were an \naverage of 13 percent higher than commercial prices. And 5 years \nearlier, the Department of Defense inspector general reached the same \nconclusion, reporting that Federal Prison Industries contracts were \nmore expensive than contracts for comparable commercial products by an \naverage of 15 percent.\n\n  Since the Department of Defense bought about $150 million last year \nfrom Federal Prison Industries, this overpricing is costing a lot of \nmoney, and that is the issue here.\n  Now, the good Senator from Texas is correct, that this bill does not \naddress a problem that he sees. He would like to see Federal Prison \nIndustries be able to use prison labor at from 23 cents an hour to \n$1.15 an hour with no medical benefits and no income tax, he would like \nto see products produced by Federal prison labor out in the commercial \nmarket, and he calls people that do not want to deal with that greedy. \nI do not, any more than I think it is wrong to tell China that if they \nwant to produce products with prison labor, they are not going to be \nable to use those products to displace American workers and American \nbusinesses. I do not think that is wrong.\n  We have a fundamental difference on that issue. And he is sure right. \nThis bill does not reverse those laws because once you did that, you \nwould have businesses in this country going bankrupt in huge numbers \nbecause they would have to be dealing with 23-cents-an-hour prison \nlabor. And we have decided as a people that that is not fair to \nAmerican business. It is not fair to American business either that even \nthough they can sell a product at a cheaper price to an American \nGovernment agency, it will not be allowed to do so where Federal Prison \nIndustries has established a monopoly and asserted that monopoly for \nthat item. It can sell more cheaply and the odds are pretty good the \nproduct will be better. The agency will want to buy it, but it is told, \nsorry, you can't buy at less and frequently a better product because \nFederal Prison Industries has decided to assert a monopoly in that \narea.\n  There are areas where Federal Prison Industries can move. They have \nbeen urged to do so. We have had meeting after meeting, forum after \nforum, summit after summit with Federal Prison Industries. Of course, \nyou want to keep people in prison busy, but you have to keep them busy \nin a way that is not unfairly and anticompetitively dealing with \nAmerican businesses.\n  And, by the way, that is why the Chamber of Commerce and the National \nFederation of Independent Businesses and the National Association of \nManufacturers support this amendment. And that is why it has such \nstrong bipartisan support, cosponsored by Senators Abraham, Robb, \nHelms, Kempthorne, Daschle, and Burns. It has bipartisan support \nbecause this is a procurement issue. It is a competition issue. It is a \nfundamental, commonsense, fairness issue that an American business \nought to be allowed to compete with Federal Prison Industries for sales \nto its own Government.\n  If a commercial product is costing more than the prison product, that \nmay not be fair, but that is not touched by this amendment. This \namendment only goes to the cases where the commercial product is \ncheaper than the Federal Prison Industries product.\n  Mr. President, it is time for the mandatory sourcing rule of Federal \nPrison Industries, this monopoly that they assert, although their \nproducts are more costly, to be changed. There is no better bill to \nchange it on than a defense bill since the Defense Department is the \nbiggest object of that monopoly. The testimony before the House \ncommittee is clear that our service personnel are not being given the \nproducts that they deserve--best quality, cheapest price--because of an \nartificial monopoly which is allowed to exist.\n\n  It is not supposed to be this way, by the way. The theory of this \nmonopoly would be that if Federal Prison Industries can come in cheaper \nthan a commercial product, then it would be allowed to do so because of \nthe work which we want our prisoners to be engaged in. But it is being \nabused. It is being abused. And when Federal Prison Industries asserts \nthat monopoly in cases where its prices, despite all of its advantages, \nare higher than the commercial world, then they should not be allowed \nto continue to deal with the business world and the workers of America \nin that way.\n  Just this morning my staff received a telephone call from an \nacquisition official at an agency that I am not going to name because I \ndo not want to get them in any trouble, but following last night's \ndebate this acquisition official\n\n[[Page S7149]]\n\nasked when this Federal Prison Industries amendment was likely to be \nenacted. Of course, we do not know whether it will be enacted. But the \nofficial explained that their agency was in the process of making a \nsubstantial purchase of office furniture and was told that it would \nhave to buy it from Federal Prison Industries. They requested a waiver \nfrom Federal Prison Industries. That request has been denied. The \nagency in question has had a history of problems with Federal Prison \nIndustries, the official said. ``Quality, price, delivery, timing, you \nname it.'' And when my staff explained that we do not know whether the \namendment would be enacted, much less when it would be enacted, the \nofficial stated, ``Well, we would probably be willing to wait a few \nmonths because we certainly don't want to get stuck with their stuff.''\n  Now, the good Senator talked about waivers, and that is fine. But we \nought to use the marketplace. He has frequently said, and I agree with \nhim, at least in most circumstances, that we ought to look to the \ncommercial world to provide us the best products at the cheapest \nprices. We make an exception with prisoners because if they can produce \na product, even though it is cheaper, we say it is important that we \nkeep people working and we will allow that product, providing it is at \nleast no more expensive than the commercial product, we will then--that \nwas the intent--allow that product to be the one which is bought by our \nGovernment.\n  And there is even some unfairness in that if you are in the business \ntrying to compete with that cheap labor. But what this amendment does \nis simply say where the commercial product, despite all of those \nadvantages of 23 and 40 and 50 cents an hour and a dollar an hour labor \nand none of the benefits and no income tax, despite all those benefits, \nwhen an American business can produce a product more cheaply than \nFederal Prison Industries, then surely it is unfair, anticompetitive \nfor that product to have to be bought from Federal Prison Industries.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the amendment offered by my friend, \nSenator Levin, would devastate the function of the Federal Prison \nIndustries, Inc., known as FPI.\n  FPI is the Bureau of Prisons' most important inmate program. It keeps \ninmates productively occupied and reduces inmate idleness and the \nviolence and disruptive behavior associated with it. Thus it is \nessential to the security of Federal correctional institutions, the \ncommunities in which they are located, and the safety of Federal \ncorrectional staff and inmates.\n  FPI has no other outlet for its products than Federal agencies. The \nconstraints within which FPI operates, cause it to be less efficient \nthan it private sector counterparts. Private sector companies strive to \nobtain the most modern, efficient equipment to minimize the labor \ncomponent of their manufacturing costs. FPI, on the other hand must \nkeep its manufacturing process as labor intensive as possible in order \nto employ the maximum number of inmates.\n  Since FPI operates its factories in secure correctional environments, \nit faces additional constraints that limit its efficiency. For example, \nevery tool must be checked out at the beginning of the day, checked in \nbefore lunch, checked out again in the afternoon, and checked in at the \nend of the day. The costs associated with civilian supervision and \nnumerous measures necessary to maintain the security of the prison add \nsubstantially to the cost of production.\n  It should be noted that the average Federal inmate has an eighth \ngrade education, is 37 years old, is serving a 10-year sentence for a \ndrug-related offense, and has never held a steady job. According to a \nrecent study by an independent firm, the overall productivity rate of \nan inmate with a background like this is approximately one-fourth that \nof a civilian worker.\n  FPI must have some method of offsetting these inefficiencies if it is \nexpected to acquire a reasonable share of Government contracts and \nremain self-sufficient. The offsetting advantage that Congress has \nprovided is the mandatory sourcing requirements in section 4124 of \ntitle 18, United States Code. This section requires that Federal \nagencies purchase products made by FPI as long as those products meet \ncustomer needs for quality, price, and timeliness of delivery. If the \nproduct is not currently manufactured by FPI, or if the FPI is not \ncompetitive in quality, price or timeliness, Federal Prison Industries \nwill grant a waiver to allow the Federal agency to purchase the product \nfrom private sector suppliers.\n  The Federal Prison Industries preference in title 18 is essential if \nthis program is to prevent inmate idleness on a large scale. Increasing \nInmate idleness will risk unrest affecting the safety of prison \nsecurity personnel and the surrounding communities.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the Levin amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to respond to Senator Levin's point. \nI think he gave a great argument for price competition, but we are not \ntalking about price competition. Our dear colleague invokes the name of \nbusiness people and what they want. But let me remind anybody who is \nobjectively considering this debate, when I brought to the floor of the \nSenate legislation to repeal three Depression-era laws that force us to \nidle 1,100,000 prisoners who ought to be working 10 hours a day, 6 days \na week, to help pay the $20 billion cost of keeping them in prison, \nAmerican business and American labor were up in arms. They were up in \narms because they do not want prisoners to work.\n  I can tell you taxpayers want them to work. These special interest \ngroups that represent business and the union bosses in Washington, DC, \nare against it, but the working people who are paying $20 billion a \nyear in taxes to keep people in prison want these prisoners to work. If \nwe held a national referendum on this issue, I believe by a 10-to-1 \nmargin, Americans would say put these 1,100,000 basically young men to \nwork, have them produce things, do it in a way that you don't glut the \nlocal market, do it to displace imports, do it to make component parts, \nbut put them to work to help pay the cost of keeping them in jail and \nto acquire skills they can use when they get out.\n  So I would be, No. 1, more convinced by our colleague from Michigan \nthat these businesses are interested in competition if they weren't the \nsame people who were up here saying don't let prisoners produce \nanything to sell in the marketplace. They don't want to compete. They \nhave already stopped competition. What they are trying to do is stop \nthe last prison inmate work being done in America, and this cannot be \nallowed to happen.\n  In terms of displacing imports, if you try to that, as I did, you \nfind that it is prohibited by law and treaty. As remarkable as it \nsounds to working Americans, it is criminal to make prisoners work to \nproduce anything of value which can be sold in the marketplace. In the \nDepression, Congress passed a law that idled millions--well, it idled \nhundreds of thousands of prisoners then. It now idles 1,100,000 \nprisoners. I would be a strong supporter of a provision that sought to \nidentify industries with high import penetration and allow prisoners to \nmake those products. But I would virtually guarantee that the same \npeople who are for this amendment would oppose that amendment. Because \nbasically, there is strong opposition among groups that feel they might \nlose something to making people in prison work. It is very narrow in \nits perspective, it is very shortsighted, but it clearly is out there.\n  As far as making prisoners work at 22 cents an hour, we are using the \nprofits from this industry to pay victims' restitution, to pay court-\nordered fines, and I think we have a right to make prisoners work. We \nare paying, after all, their room and board. We are paying $22,000 a \nyear at the Federal level, not even counting building the prisons. I \nwould make them work for nothing, 10 hours a day, 6 days a week if that \nis what it came down to. Actually it's more efficient to have a little \nincentive pay and have them volunteer to work.\n  Let me go back to the central point of debate here, and let me read \nfrom\n\n[[Page S7150]]\n\nthe Office of Legislative Affairs of the Justice Department, Assistant \nAttorney General:\n\n       The Federal Prison Industry is the Bureau of Prisons' most \n     important, efficient and cost-effective tool for managing \n     inmates. It keeps inmates productively occupied and reduces \n     inmate idleness and the violence and disruptive behavior \n     associated with it. Thus, it is essential to the security of \n     Federal prisons and the communities in which they are \n     located, and is essential to the safety of Bureau of Prison \n     staffs and inmates.\n\n  When we are talking about people and how they are affected, let me \ngive you some statistics. In the State of South Carolina--our \ndistinguished chairman here is from the State of South Carolina--for \nthose prisoners who have worked in prison industry, the probability \nthat when they get out they are going to commit a crime again and end \nup back in prison is 2 percent. For those who have not worked in prison \nindustry it is 35 percent.\n\n  In the State of Florida the recidivism rate, people coming back to \nprison who have worked in prison industries, is 11 percent; it is 26.7 \npercent for people who have not worked in prison, not acquired a work \nethic, not acquired any skills. In Wisconsin it is 11 percent for \npeople that worked in prison industries, it is 22 percent for those who \ndid not. In Kentucky 36 percent come back to prison versus 65 percent \nwho do not work in Federal Prison Industries.\n  So, if we are talking about price competition let's have it. Let's \namend this amendment and say that we are going to let prison labor work \nin any area, say, that has at least a 30-percent import penetration. \nThat would include automobiles, it would include a lot of industries. \nAnd let's put 1.1 million people to work and let's set a goal: Within \n10 years they are going to pay the full cost of being in prison by \nworking. Let's turn our prisons into industrial parks. Let's have it so \nthat industries are lining up to hire people when they are getting out \nof prison. That's what America needs. That's what we ought to be doing.\n  Every year, I have a dear colleague who offers an amendment barring \ntrade with countries that use prison labor. And every year I wonder why \nwe can't make our prisoners work. They would benefit from it. We would \nbenefit from it. But what we are talking about here is killing off the \nlast vestige of prison labor. We don't let them produce anything that \ncan be sold, we simply let them work and produce things for the \nGovernment.\n  There is a variance between what our colleague says and at least what \nthe Federal Prison Industries report in their published data. One of \nthe things that I intend to do is offer a second-degree amendment to \nhave a study, so we actually know the facts. But here is what they say:\n\n       During fiscal year 1996 [the most recent year where we have \n     complete data] Federal Prison Industries received more than \n     $446 million worth of waiver requests.\n\n  These are from agencies which did not want to buy things from \nprisons. They wanted a waiver to go out and buy it in the private \nsector of the economy.\n\n       Ninety-two percent of these proposed waivers were granted, \n     resulting in $410 million reallocation of Federal prison \n     business to the private sector.\n\n  The law clearly says that prison industries have to meet quality \nrequirements, have to meet the price set by the Government as a \ncompetitive price. If there is a problem there, let's fix it. But we \ncannot claim we are for competition when we don't let prisoners, as a \nmatter of law, produce something of value and sell it on the public \nmarket. I just simply say when, in South Carolina, making prisoners \nwork contributes to a dramatic drop from 35 percent who go back to \nprison to 2 percent going back to prison, I think it is worth something \nmaking these people work. If we have them work and we pay victims' \nrestitution, is that not of some value? If they acquire skills, is that \nnot of some value?\n  So, I would just like to conclude by saying what a great tragedy it \nis that here we are debating ending prison labor rather than debating \nexpanding it. Component parts that are now made all around the world \nought to be made in Federal and State prisons. We ought to be working \nthese people 10 hours a day, providing them a little incentive pay so \nthey can get little extras and using the rest of the money to pay for \nvictim restitution, court ordered fines and to help pay the $20 billion \na year the taxpayers are paying to keep people in prison. But, instead, \nwe are debating a proposal to end prison labor for all practical \npurposes by taking away their Government business.\n  When you are dealing with prisoners, as the Senator from South \nCarolina said, it is a completely different structure because you have \nto supervise what they are doing, you have security requirements, and \nas a matter of principle, the prison industry has to be operated \ninefficiently because we have hundreds of provisions that limit their \nability to do anything, to be in any way competitive with the private \nsector.\n  We require them to use the lowest technology, because we have far \nmore workers than we have work, because of law that prevents people \nfrom working. So they are using, basically, hand labor because we are \ntrying to work as many as we can. We could fix this by repealing \nexisting laws.\n  I would like to propound a parliamentary inquiry. Would it be in \norder for me to submit an amendment to the Levin amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is the amendment of the \nSenator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone].\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside that \namendment temporarily so that I might offer a second-degree amendment \nto the Levin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 794 to Amendment No. 778\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 794 to amendment No. 778.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all in amendment No. 778 and insert in lieu thereof \n     the following:\n       ``The Department of Defense and Federal Prison Industries \n     shall conduct jointly a study of existing procurement \n     procedure regulations, and statutes which now govern \n     procurement transactions between the Department of Defense \n     and Federal Prison Industries.\n       ``A report describing the findings of the study and \n     containing recommendations on the means to improve the \n     efficiency and reduce the costs of such transactions shall be \n     submitted to the U.S. Senate Committee on Armed Services no \n     later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this \n     act.''\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, what this amendment does, very simply, is \nit mandates that the Federal Prison Industries, jointly with the \nDepartment of Defense, conduct a study of our whole procurement system, \nas it relates to Federal Prison Industries and the Defense Department, \nto look at how competitive the system is, how we can make it more \ncompetitive, how we can make it more efficient and, basically, \nascertain the facts.\n  If we listen to Senator Levin, prisons are noncompetitive, producing \nlow-quality material at inflated prices. But yet, when we look at data \nprovided by the Justice Department, in 92 percent of the cases where \npeople have said we don't want to buy this product, they have granted \nthe waiver to bypass Federal Prison Industries and buy in the private \nsector.\n  Somewhere there is a disconnect over the facts. I always try to teach \nmy children to argue about principles and theory, don't argue about \nfacts. I don't know what the facts are. I know what the Bureau of \nPrisons says. I know what Senator Levin says. I have great respect for \nboth, but they don't quite agree. One of the things the study would do \nis to allow us to look at it, to acquire information and to try to \nbring together all of the factors that we have to decide here.\n  This is a tough issue. Let me say to Senator Levin that I don't think \nthere is a Member of the Senate who has a stronger record in supporting \ncompetition, privatization, and price competitiveness than I. Maybe \nthere is, but I don't think so.\n  This is a criminal justice issue. It is not as if we have 1.1 million \npeople\n\n[[Page S7151]]\n\nhere who can go off and do something else. We have them locked up in \nprison, and they are sitting there idle costing us $22,000 a year \napiece to keep in prison. If we can have them work and get some value \nout of it in victim's restitution, in training, any assistance we get \nin paying for their incarceration, I view that as God's work and \nsomething that I want to do.\n  Obviously, in any argument, there is another side to it, and the \nother side here is the people who would rather have the business that \nprisoners are doing. But I simply remind my colleagues, and we probably \nhave overdebated this issue, but I remind my colleagues that we have \n1.1 million people in prison. We are spending billions of dollars to \nkeep them there, and because of our existing laws, they are basically \nin idleness.\n  This is a dangerous situation, and I think when you are dealing with \nthis kind of situation, you can't simply say we are not going to let \nthem compete in any other area but we are going to make them compete \nfor Government business. Government work is all they are allowed under \nlaw to do.\n  So if we are going to change this, we better understand what we are \ndoing, because I would hate to see a situation where, in South \nCarolina, people who are working in prison, only 2 percent of them come \nback to prison when they get out; 35 percent of them come back to \nprison who don't work. When we are talking about compassion and \nconcern, remember these people who are coming back to prison are people \nwho have killed people and robbed people and molested people. I think \nthis is a very important issue. I think my amendment allows us to get \nthe facts and make a rational decision. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport this amendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Texas made a number of \npoints, and one of them particularly I want to comment on. He said, \n``If there is a problem of the price not being competitive, then let's \nadjust it.'' That is this amendment. That is exactly what this \namendment does. There is a problem, and the problem is that even when \nthe price of the prison product is more than the commercial product, \nthat is, noncompetitive, nonetheless, Federal Prison Industries can \ndirect the purchase.\n  So the problem, which was identified with the ``if'' word by my \nfriend from Texas, is the problem which this amendment addresses. I \ndon't know why any of us need a study on the principle involved here. \nThe principle involved is a pretty direct, simple principle. If the \ncommercial product is cheaper than the prison-made product, then don't \nstick the taxpayers with the extra cost and don't cause the private \nbusiness person out of prison the loss of that sale. That is the \nprinciple. If that is true 10 percent of the time or 15 percent of the \ntime or 5 percent of the time, it is the same principle. And that is \nthe principle we will be voting on: Whether or not we want to have a \nstudy to see how often the principle is violated, or whether or not we \nwant to vote for the principle, and it is the principle which is \ndriving this amendment.\n\n  I have a letter from a citizen of Texas:\n\n       I am writing in regards to reforming Federal Prison \n     Industries and ending its mandatory source status. I am a \n     business person and a resident of San Antonio, TX. Not only \n     do I reside in the heart of Texas, but also in the heart of \n     military bases. It is virtually impossible for me to make a \n     living due to the mandatory status implemented by the Federal \n     Prison Industries. I urge you to support and follow Senator \n     Carl Levin and his legislation that would allow businesses to \n     compete with FPI for Federal contracts.\n\n  Those are the keywords. You can put them in bright lights: ``Allow \nthem to compete.'' That is the principle.\n  She goes on:\n\n       Today, we are prohibited from doing so. If a product is \n     made by a Federal prison, then Federal agencies are forced to \n     buy that product. It would also help Government agencies by \n     allowing them to compare price and quality from a broader \n     array of sources.\n\n  That is the principle. Mr. President, our good friend from Texas said \nthat he is sure the American people, by at least a vote of 10 to 1, \nwould want our prisoners to work. I think it is much more than that. I \nhope it would be 100 to 1. But I think it would be 1,000 to 1 that \npeople want our Government to buy the products at the best price. That \nis the discipline of the marketplace. That is what a free enterprise \neconomy should be about.\n  Do we make an exception to that rule when it comes to certain \nproducts that are made by slave labor in other countries? Yes. Have we \nmade an exception for saying it is unfair to American business that \nprison-made products in America should not compete in the commercial \nworld? When the Senator from Texas says that he would like to turn \nprisons into industrial parks, is that fair to Americans who are not in \nprison who need more than 20 or 30 or 40 cents an hour to survive? Is \nthat really fair? I don't think so, and this amendment, he is surely \nright, does not reverse the prohibition on that. But all this amendment \ndoes is to allow the private sector to compete when its price is lower.\n  It is not going to destroy or devastate the Federal Prison \nIndustries. It is going to force them to be producing things where they \ncan do it price competitively with all the advantages they have, and \nthere are many things that they can sell to the Government which fall \nin that category. There are areas of recycling where we do not now \nrecycle because the cost of labor is so high it does not pay to \nrecycle. Prison labor is a very good source of potential labor for \nthat.\n  There are things that Government buys that are important--and I \nemphasize that the Government buys that are important--where prison \nlabor would not be displacing American businesses and where, indeed, it \nwould make good sense and would be fair for those products to be \nproduced and bought by the U.S. Government.\n  All we are doing is implementing the very principle which the Senator \nfrom Texas said: ``If there's a problem now with prices not being \ncompetitive, let's adjust it.'' That is this amendment. That is all we \nare doing, we are adjusting it. We are saying, let American Government \nagencies buy products from American businesses when they can do so more \ncheaply than the product that they are now being forced to buy too \noften by the Federal Prison Industries.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 795\n\n (Purpose: To authorize the Secretaries of the military departments to \n   settle and pay claims by members of the Armed Forces for loss of \n       personal property due to flooding in the Red River Basin)\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I send an amendment to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is currently pending a first- and \nsecond-degree amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \namendments that are currently pending so the amendment that I am \noffering can be considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Conrad], for himself, \n     Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Daschle, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 795.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC.  . CLAIMS BY MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES FOR LOSS OF \n                   PERSONAL PROPERTY DUE TO FLOODING IN THE RED \n                   RIVER BASIN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The flooding that occurred in the portion of the Red \n     River Basin encompassing East Grand Forks, Minnesota, and \n     Grand Forks, North Dakota, during April and May 1997 is the \n     worst flooding to occur in that region in the last 500 years.\n       (2) Over 700 military personnel stationed in the vicinity \n     of Grand Forks Air Force Base reside in that portion of the \n     Red River Basin.\n       (3) The military personnel stationed in the vicinity of \n     Grand Forks Air Force Base have been stationed there entirely \n     for the convenience of the Government.\n       (4) There is insufficient military family housing at Grand \n     Forks Air Force Base for all of those military personnel, and \n     the available off-base housing is almost entirely within the \n     areas adversely affected by the flood.\n\n[[Page S7152]]\n\n       (5) Many of the military personnel have suffered \n     catastrophic losses, including total losses of personal \n     property by some of the personnel.\n       (6) It is vital to the national security interests of the \n     United States that the military personnel adversely affected \n     by the flood recover as quickly and completely as possible.\n       (b) Authorization.--The Secretary of the military \n     department concerned may pay claims for loss and damage to \n     personal property suffered as a direct result of the flooding \n     in the Red River Basin during April and May 1997, by members \n     of the Armed Forces residing in the vicinity of Grand Forks \n     Air Force Base, North Dakota, without regard to the \n     provisions of section 3721(e) of title 31, United States \n     Code.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the amendment that I am offering today is \nintended to prevent unintended discrimination against personnel at the \nGrand Forks Air Force Base as the Air Force provides compensation for \ndamages suffered by personnel as a result of this spring's \nunprecedented flooding.\n  I am joined in this amendment by Senators Dorgan, Wellstone, Johnson, \nand Daschle. This is an amendment that has been requested by the U.S. \nAir Force, specifically by Air Force Secretary Sheila Widnall; General \nFogleman, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force; and Gen. Walter Kross, \nthe commander in chief of the U.S. Transportation Command.\n  By way of background, Mr. President, North Dakota and Minnesota, as \nthe distinguished occupant of the chair knows well, have suffered from \none of the worst winters and spring in our history. The flood that \ncaused the evacuation of both Grand Forks and East Grand Forks was a \n500-year flood and caused literally billions of dollars of damage.\n  This picture shows some of the remnants of what we dealt with in that \ndevastating flood. As I have indicated before, if you went up and down \nthe streets of Grand Forks and East Grand Forks immediately after the \nflood, what you saw was stacks and stacks of everybody's personal \nproperty. All of the carpeting, all of the clothing, all of the \ndraperies and appliances, whether it was washers or dryers or \nrefrigerators, they were all out on the curb. You could see what \neverybody had, because of this devastating flood.\n  In the midst of the flood, of course, we also had this incredible \nfire break out in downtown Grand Forks. Here you can see a picture of \nsome military personnel helping out as the firefighters fought this \ndevastating fire and, of course, the flood simultaneously. This last \npicture shows one of the neighborhoods just a few blocks from where the \nfire hit, and you can see these cars and trucks inundated with water in \na neighborhood that was especially hard hit.\n  Well, Mr. President, the point is, we suffered one of the worst \nfloods ever, worst in 500 years.\n  In the face of this, there was great assistance from Air Force base \npersonnel. And they themselves experienced great devastation. Those \nthat did not live on the base, who were forced to live off base because \nof a housing shortage on the base, are now faced with a Catch-22, \nbecause current law allows the Defense Department to provide \ncompensation for personal property losses of up to $100,000 as long as \nthe housing that those Air Force personnel were occupying are \nGovernment owned.\n  Unfortunately, about 700 families lived in housing that was off the \nbase in the area most devastated but do not live in Government-owned \nhousing. And their personal property losses can be dealt with by other \nGovernment programs, but to the extent they do not cover them, these \npeople are left in the remarkable situation of not being covered. The \npeople on the base, where frankly there was not flooding, they are \ncovered. But the people who are off base who did experience enormous \nlosses are not covered.\n  That is why the top Air Force personnel have asked that we offer this \namendment and that we ask our colleagues to pass it so that military \npersonnel are not discriminated against in this very odd way.\n  Mr. President, I say, many of these individuals who were helping to \nfight the flood and helping to fight the fire were doing it when their \nown homes were being destroyed. This was truly an act of courage and \nheroism by these Air Force personnel. And now they find themselves in a \ncircumstance in which those that were on base, they can be helped by an \nexisting Federal program, but those who are off base in the area that \nwas actually hit by the devastating floods cannot be helped. That does \nnot make sense. It is not fair. And we have a chance to correct it.\n  The amendment that I have offered today will, No. 1, waive the \ndiscriminatory provision for the purposes of the recent disaster. No. \n2, it does not require any new money. I want to make that point very \nclear. This can be accommodated, according to the Air Force, out of \nexisting programs. And there is sufficient money there to address this \ncircumstance. It does not require any new money.\n  The Air Force put the potential liability at $4 million--not billion. \nWe often talk on the floor here of billions of dollars. But this is a \nvery small item, $4 million. And it would be consistent with earlier \nactions taken by the Congress after Hurricane Andrew in 1992 on behalf \nof Homestead Air Force Base personnel living off the base.\n  I again would like to emphasize that this provision has been \nexplicitly requested by General Kross, the Commander in Chief of the \nU.S. Transportation Command; it has also been requested by General \nFogleman, the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force, and by the Air \nForce Secretary, Secretary Widnall.\n  I hope that my colleagues will see fit to approve this amendment. It \nis a relatively minor matter in the scheme of things around here. But \nit will make a significant difference in the lives of these Air Force \npersonnel who were really courageous and heroic in the face of these \ndisasters, and they deserve to be covered just as those who were on \nbase are already covered.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I just have one question to my dear friend \nfrom North Dakota.\n  Is it the intention of this amendment that if the person who was \nvictimized by the flood or fire had personal insurance, that that \npersonal insurance be first exhausted and then any Federal FEMA \nbenefits or other benefits then be next exhausted prior to the kicking \nin of this particular language that the Senator is offering?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to respond to my colleague from Michigan.\n  It is my understanding that the way this program works, first of all, \nall personal insurance benefits have to be exhausted, then all other \nFederal program benefits have to be exhausted, that is, if there is any \neligibility for FEMA benefits, those have to be exhausted before this \nprogram is available to be administered by the Air Force.\n  As I say, that is my understanding of how the program works. I think \nthat is a reasonable way for it to work because obviously we do not \nwant to be expending Federal dollars where private insurance covers the \nloss or where other Federal programs cover the loss.\n  The concern that the Air Force has had is they face circumstances \nhere in both North Dakota and Minnesota, by the way, where Air Force \nbase personnel were forced to live off base because of a housing \nshortage on the base. And those personnel were subjected to this \ndevastating series of circumstances, some of them in North Dakota, some \nof them in Minnesota. And the Air Force would very much like to be able \nto compensate them for personal property losses over and above what the \ninsurance will cover, over and above what other Federal programs will \ncover.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator for his amendment.\n  I know that Senator Cleland, were he here--he is the ranking member \nof our subcommittee--would be supporting this amendment, as do I. I \nthink however there will be some debate on this amendment. But from the \nperspective of at least this Member, it is a good amendment, an \nequitable amendment. It uses the same program that applies to people \nwho are on base to those who are off base, almost all of whom were \nassigned to that base.\n\n[[Page S7153]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I want to, if I can, thank my colleague from Michigan, to \nsay then that this is consistent with what we did after Hurricane \nAndrew with respect to Homestead Air Force Base personnel, and that the \ntop Air Force officials have been in frequent contact with me on this \nmatter. They think it is a matter of equitable treatment for their \nforces and that it is important that we take this action.\n  I very much hope that my colleagues will see fit to honor the call of \nour top Air Force leadership and pass this amendment.\n  I thank the Chair. And I thank my colleague from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I hope that if we do adopt this amendment \nthat the Defense Department would look within it the two precedents in \nterms of establishing a general policy situation such as this. It seems \nto me that the precedent cited by the Senator from North Dakota is in \npoint, and that this would be an additional precedent, if passed, for \nadopting a general policy in situations such as this for persons who \nare assigned to a base but who live off base to be given the same kind \nof coverage as persons who are on base.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, again, on this side there is support for \nthe Senator's amendment. And I know of no opposition on this side. I \nhope this amendment will be adopted.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, we have agreed to accept it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \namendment, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 795) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. I especially want \nto thank the ranking member, Senator Levin, from Michigan for his \nassistance. And I also thank very much the chairman of our committee, \nSenator Thurmond of South Carolina. I thank them both for their \nsupport.\n  I think this is a matter of equity for our Armed Forces personnel. I \nknow they will very much appreciate this assistance.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote on that \namendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 593\n\n  (Purpose: To repeal the restriction on use of Department of Defense \n                       facilities for abortions)\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 593 and ask to \nproceed under the previous agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], for herself, Ms. \n     Snowe, Mr. Robb, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Lautenberg, and Mr. Wyden, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 593.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title VII add the following:\n\n     SEC. 708. RESTORATION OF PREVIOUS POLICY REGARDING \n                   RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE \n                   MEDICAL FACILITIES.\n\n       Section 1093 of title 10, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by striking out subsection (b); and\n       (2) in subsection (a), by striking out ``(a) Restriction of \n     Use of Funds.--''.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I am offering this amendment on behalf of myself, \nSenator Snowe, Senator Kennedy, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Robb, and \nSenator Wyden.\n  Mr. President, this bipartisan amendment simply strikes the existing \nban on privately funded abortions in overseas military hospitals for \nmilitary personnel and dependents. For the information of my \ncolleagues, it is identical to the amendment that I offered last \nCongress which was adopted by the Senate.\n  Mr. President, it is extremely amazing to me that today a woman who \nvolunteers to serve our country and is stationed overseas surrenders \nher ability to receive a safe and legal abortion without unnecessary \nand intrusive obstacles.\n  Not only are female military personnel denied this basic reproductive \nhealth service, but so are dependents of military personnel.\n  Mr. President, I know that my colleagues share my concerns regarding \ncurrent allegations of sexual harassment against women in the military. \nWe all agree this is intolerable and cannot and will not be accepted. \nWe are all committed to protecting women from sexual harassment or \ndiscrimination while serving in the military. We all recognize that \nserving one's country does not mean sacrificing one's civil and \nconstitutional rights.\n  While the military may have a separate code of conduct, basic civil \nrights are afforded all military personnel. It is important for me to \nstress this to my colleagues. No Senator would come to the floor to \nsupport any legislation that eliminated constitutional guarantees for \nmilitary personnel. However, that is exactly what happens today unless \nwe lift the current ban on access to safe and legal abortion services \nfor military personnel serving overseas.\n  In 1993, the ban on privately funded abortion services for military \npersonnel and independents was lifted, restoring basic health care \nprotection to all women serving overseas. Unfortunately, in the 1996 \nDepartment of Defense Authorization Act, this ban was reinstated. I was \nat a loss then and I still am today as to what the justification is for \nthis ban.\n  I have heard supporters of the ban talk about the use of Federal \nfunds to provide abortion-related services. Mr. President, this \nargument is weak at best. My amendment would require that personal \nfunds be used. The cost to the patient to provide abortion services far \nexceed the cost of the procedure itself.\n  Mr. President, without my amendment, we subject women to undue \nhardships when they serve overseas. If a woman serving overseas cannot \nobtain a legal and safe abortion at her own expense, she must request \nleave from her commanding officer to fly back to the United States for \nthis procedure. We should be outraged at the cost to the military for \ntransporting her back to the United States and for the leave time that \nmust be granted. Why is it better to pay for these costs than simply to \nhave the woman pay for the procedure at her own expense at a safe U.S. \nmilitary hospital?\n  Based on this fact, the argument that it costs Federal tax dollars to \nprovide abortion-related services to military personnel cannot be the \nissue. Today, it takes more tax dollars to provide a safe and legal \nabortion for military personnel than it would under my amendment. If \nanyone is concerned about Federal tax dollars funding abortion, they \nshould support my amendment, as it would require the woman to pay for \nthe procedure with private funds where she is stationed rather than \nflying her home to the United States.\n  Supporters of the ban may also claim that military medical personnel \nshould not be trained to perform or counsel on abortion-related \nservices. I remind my colleagues, however, current law provides \ncoverage for abortions in the case of rape, incest, or to protect the \nlife of the woman. Doctors must now be trained, regardless of what \nhappens here today.\n  Let me respond as well to statements that insist that this amendment \nwould require any doctor to perform an elective abortion, regardless of \ntheir own personal objections. This amendment does not change or impact \ncurrent DOD policy which clearly spells out that health care providers \nwho, as a matter of conscience or moral principle, do not wish to \nperform elective abortions, shall not be required to do so. The DOD\n\n[[Page S7154]]\n\npolicy and the conscience clause enforced by all four branches of the \nservice have worked. There have been no reported cases of a military \ndoctor being forced to perform an elective abortion despite their moral \nor ethical objections.\n\n  Mr. President, like all of our service personnel, women in the \nmilitary deserve our utmost respect, honor, and gratitude. They \ncertainly do not deserve to be told that they must check their \nconstitutional rights at the door when they are stationed overseas. \nThis amendment protects their precious rights and ensures their safe \naccess to quality medical services.\n  Like all military personnel, women should be guaranteed access to \nquality and safe medical services. The current ban on abortion services \nat DOD facilities could force women to seek unsafe, back-alley \nabortions in a foreign country. Without adequate care, an abortion can \nbe life-threatening or permanently disabling.\n  Mr. President, we often have Members come to the floor to advocate \nfor women's health issues. I remind my colleagues that forcing a woman \nto delay an abortion could further jeopardize her health. Every week a \nwoman has to wait increases the health risks. It is simply wrong to \njeopardize the health and well-being of our military personnel.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Murray-Snowe amendment and to \ngive every woman in the military the same rights, the same rights, that \nare afforded every other American woman. This is our chance to show \nwomen in the military and dependents serving overseas that we do care \nand that we appreciate their contributions to protecting our national \nsecurity.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield whatever time the Senator from \nIdaho desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. President, I am the new chairman of the Military Personnel \nSubcommittee, and in the 12 months I have served in that capacity I \nhave learned the subcommittee itself cuts a wide swath on all the \nissues that we deal with. This subcommittee resolves issues that are at \nthe forefront of our national debate. We cope with the issues of values \ntaught to our young people who volunteer for the armed services. We \ndeal with the issues involving gender-based training, sexual harassment \nin the workplace, drug and alcohol abuse, and now, as a result of this \namendment before the Senate, the very sensitive issue of abortion.\n  I make it very clear at the outset what this issue in this particular \namendment is not about. It is not about whether you are pro-life or \npro-choice. This amendment is about where those abortions may be \nperformed and whether they are paid for at Federal Government expense. \nThis amendment would repeal the prohibition on using Department of \nDefense facilities for abortions and allow prepaid abortions to be \nperformed in these taxpayer-funded facilities and by Federal medical \npersonnel at these facilities.\n  The sponsors of this amendment argue that without this amendment, \nwomen in the Armed Forces stationed overseas may find it difficult to \nhave access to a safe abortion. As a result, this interferes with their \nconstitutional right to an abortion, so they contend.\n  I want to acknowledge that women who are in the Armed Forces and are \nstationed overseas in countries where abortion is not legal, are faced \nwith complex emotional and difficult decisions. I note for the record, \nhowever, that a woman with a pregnancy who is in the armed services who \nis overseas and that pregnancy is medically life-threatening or the \nresult of rape or incest, under current policy, can receive an abortion \nat a U.S. military hospital.\n  So the issue before the Senate is, what is the right abortion policy \nthat our military hospitals should follow in cases where the life of \nthe mother is not at stake or rape and incest is not involved?\n  After reading last year's debate and listening to the debate today, I \noffer these observations. While women in this country still have a \nconstitutional right to have abortions, our national policy as a result \nof the Hyde amendment is that taxpayers should not be required to pay \nfor abortions except in the circumstance where the life of the mother \nis at risk or in instances of rape and incest. In other words, except \nin rare instances, Federal funds should not pay for abortions.\n  But there is no getting around the fact that the Department of \nDefense military hospitals are paid with 100 percent taxpayer dollars. \nThe medical facility is paid for with taxpayer money. The doctors and \nthe nurses are Federal employees, paid with taxpayer dollars. So is the \nequipment, the overhead, the operating rooms, et cetera.\n  Even though the pending amendment contemplates that women will be \nallowed to use personal funds to pay for an abortion, there is no \ngetting around the fact that taxpayer dollars could still directly or \nindirectly pay for an abortion. So this amendment, if adopted, could \nlead to situations where taxpayers are paying for abortions, which is \ncontrary to our national policy as outlined in the Hyde amendment. That \nis inconsistent with our national policy and with my personal belief, \nand therefore I oppose the pending amendment for those reasons.\n\n  Mr. President, like so many issues this subcommittee handles, this \none is one of the sensitive ones. I want to commend the Senator from \nIndiana, who had been the chairman of the Subcommittee on Military \nPersonnel for a number of years, who has dealt in a sensitive fashion \nwith this issue in the past. I appreciate the approach that he has \ntaken. I look forward to his comments as he gives us insight on this \nparticular issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield myself a couple of minutes.\n  I appreciate the comments from my colleague from Idaho, chairman of \nthe Personnel Subcommittee. This is not an easy issue to deal with. We \nhave dealt with it on numerous occasions here on the Senate floor. We \nare attempting to maintain a consistent Federal policy relative to \nabortion. That policy, known as the Hyde amendment, essentially says \nthat taxpayers' money should not be used against the wishes of \ntaxpayers for elective abortions except in some very, very limited \ncircumstances. Separation of that has been accepted on a consensus, at \nleast a majority, basis now for a couple of decades. We are trying to \nmaintain that. We do not want to make an exception in this instance \nbecause we do not think an exception needs to be made.\n  There has been no demonstration that women who find themselves with \nunwanted pregnancies in the military are denied the right to have an \nabortion. They have that right. They can exercise that right. We are \nsimply saying we do not think we should compel the American taxpayer to \npay for it. That is something that has been the subject of debate and \ndiscussion ever since I've been in Congress and even before that. By a \nmajority vote, time after time after time, upheld by this Congress, we \nhave disallowed the use of Federal funds for abortions except in cases \nwhere the life of the mother is threatened or in cases of rape or \nincest. We are trying to maintain that standard, consistent throughout \nall Federal agencies, including the military.\n  In one sense, really, in a very real sense, this is a solution, this \namendment offered by the Senator from Washington is a solution in \nsearch of a problem. We simply have not had any problems with allowing \nwomen to obtain abortions at the place of station if it is allowable in \nthat country, and if it is not allowable in that country overseas, to \nfind military transport, not at their cost, but military transport back \nto any place in the United States that they choose for the performance \nof that particular abortion.\n  In doing so, we allow the woman to exercise--even though it is not a \nright, I agree--a right guaranteed by the Supreme Court at this \nparticular time, and she is not denied the opportunity to have an \nabortion. The question before the Senate is, will we maintain a \nconsistent policy that says that taxpayers' money should not be used if \nit goes against their moral beliefs, their religious beliefs? \nTaxpayers' money should not be used for the performance of elective \nabortions except in very limited circumstances.\n  I yield back, reserving the time.\n\n[[Page S7155]]\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield such time as she may consume to \nmy cosponsor, the Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I want to thank the Senator from Washington for taking the initiative \nand leadership in offering this amendment to the DOD authorization bill \nbecause it is a very important issue. I remind this body that we voted \nto repeal this ban on abortions in military hospitals overseas last \nyear, and I hope my colleagues would do the same again this year.\n  Mr. President, year after year, debate after debate, Congress \nrevisits the issues concerning women's reproductive freedoms by seeking \nto restrict, limit, and eliminate a woman's right to choose. This ban \non abortions in overseas military hospitals, reinstated last year, \nrepresents just more of the same.\n  I point out that these efforts to turn back the clock on women's \nreproductive rights will never erase the fact that the highest Court in \nthe land reaffirmed, time after time, in decision after decision, a \nwoman's fundamental right to a safe and legal abortion.\n  This whole issue of banning abortions in overseas military hospitals \nrepresents another frontal assault on a woman's right to choose. It \nalso represents a frontal assault on a woman's dignity. This ban denies \na woman's right to choose for female military personnel and their \ndependents. It denies those women, who have voluntarily decided to \nserve their country in the Armed Forces, a safe and legal medical \nprocedure. Because they were assigned to duty in other countries, it \ndenies them equal protection under the law. What kind of reward is that \nfor a woman who has made a decision to serve her country but denying \nher the rights that are guaranteed to her under the Constitution?\n  It certainly didn't occur to me that women's constitutional rights \nwere territorial. It certainly didn't occur to me that American women, \nwhen they go abroad serving our country, are leaving their \nconstitutional rights behind. Between 1979 and 1988, women could use \ntheir own personal funds to pay for the medical care that they needed. \nAnd in 1988, we know that the Reagan administration announced a new \npolicy prohibiting the performance of any abortions at military \nhospitals--even if that procedure was paid for by a woman's personal \nfunds.\n  In January 1993, President Clinton issued an Executive order removing \nthat prohibition. But the point is that that Executive order did not \nchange existing law in prohibiting the use of Federal funds to pay for \nthat procedure. That is the issue here today. The issue isn't whether \nor not we are going to use Federal funds for abortions in overseas \nmilitary hospitals; it is a question of whether or not a woman is \nentitled to have access to a safe, legal, and constitutional medical \nprocedure with the use of her own personal funds.\n  Removing this ban doesn't require medical providers to perform \nabortions. All three branches of Government have a conscience clause. \nIt would not require medical personnel to perform that procedure if \nthey have moral, religious, or ethical objections to doing so, and that \nis reasonable. But the ban prohibiting women from having access to the \nright to choose with her own personal funds is creating a level of \nsubstandard care.\n  What kind of choice does a woman have who is serving her country \noverseas? What are her choices? To fly back to the United States? Well, \nwe know the cost involved, let alone whether or not she would have the \ntime in order to do so. She could possibly endanger her own health by \nseeking care in some of the foreign hospitals, whose quality of care \ncannot compare to ours. That is why we have our own separate medical \nfacilities on military installations abroad. That is the whole point: \nto ensure that our military personnel have the best quality care \navailable that they are entitled to and indeed that they deserve. Or we \ncould require a woman to fly to another country to receive care. But \nthe bottom line is that what we are imposing on a woman who serves in \nthe military are some very dangerous and stark choices.\n  Mr. President, the Supreme Court, in 1992, in a case called Planned \nParenthood versus Casey, said that the Government regulation of \nabortion may not constitute an undue burden on the right to choose. An \nundue burden is defined as having the ``purpose or effect of placing a \nsubstantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion.'' When \nyou consider the hurdles that a military woman seeking abortion faces--\nlengthy travel, serious delay, high cost to fly home, or elsewhere, \nsubstandard medical care and options--there is no doubt that this ban \nunconstitutionally places an undue burden on a woman's right to choose; \nbut, most important, prohibiting women from using their own funds to \nobtain abortion services at overseas military hospitals endangers their \nhealth. That is the jeopardy in which we are placing women, because in \nbeing stationed overseas there are often areas where local facilities \nare inadequate or provide substandard care and just do not meet the \nstandards that our medical facilities do. That is the purpose of having \nthem there.\n  So this isn't a question of funding, it's a question of fairness, \nit's a question of whether or not the Government is going to dictate \nthe kind of care a woman and her family will have access to if they are \nserving abroad in the military. It is not an issue of pro-life versus \npro-choice; it's a question of whether or not we are going to create a \ndisparate and discriminatory policy when it comes to a woman using her \nown personal funds. That is what this debate is all about.\n  It is an unprecedented intrusion on the part of Government to say how \nan individual can spend their private funds when it comes to a legal, \nconstitutional medical procedure.\n  The amendment that is offered by the Senator from Washington will \nensure and, indeed, safeguard us from creating a two-tiered system in \nthis country--one for a woman who reside in the United States and \nserves in the military and another for those women who choose to serve \ntheir country in the Armed Forces overseas. I hope that this body will \nreject the ban that is included in the DOD authorization and accept the \namendment that has been offered here today by Senator Murray, because \nfailure to do otherwise is punitive for American women and for their \nfamilies. I hope that we will follow the example that we established in \nthe last Congress by voting to repeal the ban.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I support Senator Murray's amendment \nto repeal the provision of current law that prohibits a woman in the \narmed services from using her own funds to pay for an abortion in an \noverseas U.S. military facility. I support this amendment for several \nreasons.\n  First, under several Supreme Court decisions, a woman clearly has a \nright to choose. A woman does not give up that right or it is not \nobliterated because she serves in the U.S. military or is married to a \nU.S. servicemember.\n  Second, women based in the United States and using a military \nfacility in this country are not prohibited from using their own funds \nto pay for an abortion. Barring the use of U.S. military facilities \noverseas creates a double standard for military women and an undue \nhardship on women servicemembers stationed overseas.\n  Third, women may not have ready access to private facilities in other \ncountries. Abortion is illegal in some foreign countries, like the \nPhilippines. A woman stationed in that country or the spouse of a \nservicemember would need to fly to the United States or to another \ncountry--at her own expense--to obtain an abortion. Most servicemembers \ncannot easily bear the expense of jetting off to Switzerland for \nmedical treatment.\n  Fourth, if women do not have access to military facilities or to \nprivate facilities in the country where they are stationed, they could \nendanger their own health by the time it takes to get to a facility in \nanother country or by being forced to get treatment by someone other \nthan a licensed physician.\n  We know from personal experience in this country that when abortion \nis illegal, desperate women resort to unsafe and life-threatening \nmethods. If it were your wife, or your daughter, would you want her in \nthe hands of an untrained, unknown person on the back streets of Manila \nor Cordoba, Argentina? Or would you prefer that she be treated by a \ntrained physician in a U.S. military facility?\n  These women would have to put themselves at great risk by the \nobstacles involved, by the possibility of\n\n[[Page S7156]]\n\nusing an untrained, unlicensed person and sometimes by a lack of \nknowledge of the seriousness of their condition.\n  People who serve our country agree to put their lives at risk to \ndefend their country. They do not agree to put their health at risk \nwith unknown medical facilities that may not meet U.S. standards. With \nthis ban, we are asking these women to risk their lives doublefold.\n  Current law does not force any military physician to perform an \nabortion against his or her will. All branches have a conscience clause \nthat permits medical personnel to choose not to perform the procedure. \nWhat we are talking about today is providing equal access to U.S. \nmilitary medical facilities, wherever they are located, for a legal \nprocedure paid for with one's own money.\n  Abortion is legal for American women. To deny American military women \naccess to medical treatment they can trust is wrong. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly urge the Senate to support the \namendment offered by Senator Murray. This provision would take the long \noverdue step of repealing the current ban on privately funded abortions \nat U.S. military facilities abroad. This measure will ensure that women \nin the Armed Forces serving overseas can exercise their \nconstitutionally guaranteed right to choose safe abortion services.\n  This is an issue of fairness to the women who make significant \nsacrifices to serve the Nation. They are assigned to military bases \naround the world to protect our freedoms, and they serve with great \ndistinction. But when they get there, they are denied access to the \nkind of medical care available to all women in the United States. \nMilitary women should be able to depend on their base hospitals for all \ntheir medical services. This amendment gives them access to the same \nrange and quality of health care services that they could obtain in the \nUnited States.\n  It is not fair for Congress to force women who serve the Nation \noverseas to face the choice of accepting medical care that may be below \nthe quality they can obtain in the United States, or else returning to \nthe United States for care in a nonmilitary facility. Without a \nsufficient level of care, abortion can be a life-threatening or \npermanently disabling procedure. This danger is an unacceptable burden \nfor us to impose on the Nation's servicewomen.\n  Congress has a responsibility to provide safe options in these \nsituations. Opponents of this amendment are exposing servicewomen to \nsubstantial risks of infection, illness, infertility, and even death. \nThe amendment does not ask that these procedures be paid for with \nFederal funds. It simply asks that the appropriate care be made \navailable. It is the only responsible thing to do.\n  In addition to the health risks of the current policy, there is a \nsignificant financial penalty on servicewomen and their families who \nhave arrived at the difficult conclusion to seek an abortion. The cost \nof returning to the United States from far-off bases in other parts of \nthe world to obtain adequate health care can often involve significant \nfinancial hardship for young enlisted women. Yet, this is a cost that \nservicewomen based in the United States do not have to bear, since \nnonmilitary facilities are readily available.\n  If our military personnel do not have the financial means to travel \nprivately to the United States for an abortion, they will face \nsignificant delays waiting for military transportation. The health \nrisks increase each week, and if the delays in military flights are \nlong, the women may well be forced to rely on questionable medical \nfacilities in their host countries. As a practical matter, women in \nuniform are being denied their constitutionally protected right to \nchoose.\n  A women's decision on abortion is a very difficult and extremely \npersonal one. It is unfair to increase the burden on the women who \nproudly serve our country overseas.\n  Every woman in America has a constitutionally guaranteed right to \nchoose to terminate her pregnancy. It is time for Congress to stop \ndenying this right to military women serving abroad. It is time for \nCongress to stop treating these women as second-class citizens. I urge \nthe Senate to support the Murray amendment and end this flagrant \ninjustice under current law.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I join my colleagues Senators \nMurray and Snowe in sponsoring this amendment to allow women serving in \nthe U.S. military overseas and dependents of U.S. military personnel \nserving overseas to obtain privately funded abortions at overseas \nmilitary hospitals.\n  Women serving overseas are fighting to protect democracy and freedom. \nThese women should not be denied the basic, constitutionally protected \nrights enjoyed by women in the United States. One of those rights is \nthe right to make decisions regarding one's personal reproductive \nhealth.\n  This amendment repeals a ban that was put in place during the 104th \nCongress. That ban unnecessarily endangers the health of U.S. \nservicewomen and the dependents of service personnel overseas, and \ncreates an additional and unnecessary hazard to military service for \nwomen in this country. This is unconscionable.\n  It is important to remember that many of these women are not in \ncountries with first rate medical care. The U.S. military has a \npresence in many countries where hospitals are woefully inadequate. In \naddition, in some of these countries women do not have the right to \nchoose to terminate a pregnancy and so legal, safe abortions are not an \noption.\n  Under this amendment, no doctor has to perform an abortion if he or \nshe has a moral, ethical, or religious objection. That is a choice, \nhowever, for the doctor to make, not for the United States Government. \nAfter all, in our country the right to choose family planning and \npregnancy termination services is constitutionally protected.\n  The Department of Defense would not be required to pay for any \nabortion services provided in overseas military hospitals. This \namendment would require that private funds be used to pay for the \nservices.\n  The basic facts are that this amendment protects the life and health \nof U.S. servicewomen and the dependents of military service personnel \nstationed overseas. Quality medical care, commensurate with that \nprovided in the United States, where possible, is not too much for our \nArmed Forces to expect and to receive.\n  I thank my colleagues, Senator Murray and Senator Snowe, for offering \nthis amendment and for taking leadership in trying to preserve basic \nconstitutional rights of our service personnel overseas. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Murray/Snowe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, how much time is available?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has 19 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from Washington has 11 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COATS. I yield to the Senator from Arkansas such time as he may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from Arkansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Indiana for \nhis leadership on this issue and for yielding his time.\n  I rise today in strong opposition to the Murray amendment. During the \nReagan and Bush administrations, abortions were prohibited at overseas \nDepartment of Defense medical treatment facilities, except in the cases \nof rape, incest, or if the mother's life should be in danger. In 1993, \njust 2 days after taking office, President Clinton issued an Executive \norder to the Secretary of Defense that reversed this previous ban on \nabortions, which had been supported, which was reflective of our \nnational priorities and our national policy of not using taxpayers' \nfunds to provide abortions.\n  So the President, President Clinton, issued that Executive order \nreversing the previous ban. This attempt to legislate by Executive \norder was soon met with fierce resistance, not only by Members of \nCongress who were greatly concerned about this reversal of position, \nbut by the military's own doctors.\n  After the administration's reversal, there were a number of articles \nthat appeared, but two specifically from major media outlets \nchallenging the President's Executive order. ``The Pentagon confirmed, \nall 44 military doctors in Europe have decided against\n\n[[Page S7157]]\n\ndoing the procedure on moral and religious grounds.'' I think that is a \ntribute to our military doctors and a reflection of their own moral \nconcerns about this practice and their support for the traditional \nposition that had been in place for many years.\n  Additionally, one Air Force commander stated that all 10 \nobstetricians under his command expressed an ``unwillingness on a \npersonal or moral basis'' to perform abortions and, furthermore, that \nhe was not surprised at the doctors' response.\n  Military treatment centers--which are, always have been, and should \nbe dedicated to healing and nurturing life--should not be forced to \nfacilitate the taking of the most innocent of human life: the child in \nthe womb.\n  We have a policy that has worked. It is a policy that is supported by \nour military doctors. It is a policy that is reflective of the position \nthat we have held as a Nation, even during this era in which Roe versus \nWade has sustained a woman's right to choose abortion--that policy that \nwe will not ask Americans who morally and religiously object to the \npractice of abortion to subsidize that practice with their tax dollars. \nThis is a law that has worked; it is a law that is effective.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in opposing the Murray amendment and \nsustaining our existing policy and existing law, consistent with what \nwe as a Nation have held and what our current policy is. I thank the \nSenator from Indiana.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Washington yield 5 \nminutes to the Senator from Michigan?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support the Murray amendment for a number \nof reasons. Before I get to them, let me just say that I think all of \nus recognize that the issue of abortion can stir so many emotions so \nquickly that it is important for us to understand what any amendment \nbefore us does and what it does not do. It is important to really focus \non both. What does it do and what doesn't it do?\n  This amendment would allow a woman seeking an abortion to pay for it \nfrom her own funds at a military hospital overseas. That is what it \ndoes. There has been a prohibition on this use of military hospitals \nsince the 1996 Defense Authorization Act was enacted. This amendment \nwould repeal that prohibition. In doing so, the amendment would allow a \nwoman serving in our Armed Forces overseas who chooses to have an \nabortion to have that abortion performed in a modern American medical \nfacility by well-trained doctors who have volunteered for that duty, \nprovided that all costs and fees associated with the abortion are paid \nin advance, using private funds.\n  This amendment would give the female service members stationed \noverseas the same access to the high standards of medical hygiene, \ntechnology, and medical care that is enjoyed by other female service \nmembers stationed in the United States under the same standards of \nmedical care enjoyed by the women of America who have not chosen to \nserve their country in the military. And to establish that equitable \naccess this amendment would permit the Department of Defense to \nreinstate a policy that existed prior to 1988 which was reinstated by \nthe President in 1993 but was prohibited by Congress in 1996. Under \nthat policy that would be reinstated should this amendment become law, \nas I believe it should, military women stationed overseas, as well as \nadult female dependents of male or female service members living \noverseas, would be able to exercise their right to have access to a \nsafe abortion procedure without being put at risk by having to rely on \nthe medical facilities available on the local economy which may not be \nup to the same high standards found in American hospitals. That is a \nconstitutional right that we are talking about here. Many would \ndisagree that it should be, and I think we should respect that.\n\n  There is disagreement over this issue as to whether or not that right \nwhich would be protected by this amendment should be protected by the \nConstitution. Surely people who are of good faith disagree on that \nquestion. But it is a constitutional right. Women who exercise that \nright would be required to pay the full cost for an abortion near their \nduty station by well-trained doctors who have volunteered for such \nwork.\n  What does the amendment not do? It does not provide the taxpayer \ndollars to pay for the abortion because the woman must pay the full \ncost. The Defense Department would be required to compute that. I don't \nthink that really is the issue here, although it has been raised. The \nwords ``taxpayers funds'' have been raised here. I don't think that is \nreally the issue. Because I think if the opponents of this amendment \nwere satisfied that there is no even indirect cost which would not be \npaid for that their opposition would end. And it is the intent of the \namendment, if it is law, that the full cost be paid by the woman in \nadvance and the responsibility is on the Defense Department to compute \nthose costs.\n  So, again I repeat. I don't think that is really the issue. The real \nissue is the underlying issue of whether or not an abortion, even if \npaid for fully by the woman, should be performed in a hospital \noverseas.\n  Another thing the amendment does not do is require military doctors \nto perform abortions nor allow their careers to be affected if they \nchoose not to perform abortions. It protects the right of doctors in \nthe military not to perform abortions and protects their careers, if \nthey choose not to perform an abortion.\n  The amendment does not provide free abortions in military hospitals. \nThe current prohibition on the use of Federal funds for abortion \nremains in effect. It is an important point. There is a prohibition on \nthe use of Federal funds on abortions which remains in effect under \nthis amendment. All costs associated with an abortion would be the \nresponsibility of the patient.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would avoid placing women who serve our \ncountry overseas in an inequitable position relative to women who have \nchosen not to serve our Nation, and I hope this amendment is adopted.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, how much time is available on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has 15 minutes and 38 \nseconds remaining. The Senator from Washington has 4 minutes and 36 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, let me address some of the questions that \nhave been raised here.\n  First, on the question of denial of constitutional right, that is not \nan issue. Whether we agree that a woman ought to have a constitutional \nright to an abortion or disagree, that is not the issue here because no \nwoman is being denied her constitutional right, whether that woman is \nin the military or not, or whether that woman is in the military \nserving in the United States or in the military serving overseas. That \nright is not taken away from that woman.\n  So the issue here that will be debated, and has been debated, and \nwill be debated in the future over a constitutional right to an \nabortion is not the issue that we are debating today. The issue that we \nare debating today is whether that abortion that is sought by a \nmilitary woman ought to be performed in the military hospital.\n  The proponents of the amendment say that we can avoid the Federal \nprohibition against use of Federal taxpayer dollars if the woman \nherself pays for the abortion. But that ignores the fact that the \nmilitary hospital was constructed with Federal funds, is equipped with \nFederal funds, that the salaries of the doctors and the nurses and the \nstaff in that hospital are paid 100 percent with Federal funds, and \nthat it will be an accounting nightmare as identified by the Department \nof Defense to try to separate out the two.\n  But again let me go back to what is more fundamental. That is this \ninequality of treatment. There is no inequality of treatment. A woman \ntoday\n\n[[Page S7158]]\n\nwho serves in the military in the United States can only get an \nabortion in a military hospital if the life of the mother is in \njeopardy, or the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest. That same \nstandard applies to women in the military serving overseas. So the \nstandard is exactly the same.\n\n  If the woman serves in the military and is based in the United States \nand does not fall under the category of exception, that woman, of \ncourse, could get an abortion at a nonmilitary hospital in the United \nStates. If a woman is serving overseas and seeks an abortion and it \ndoesn't fall within the exception, she also can receive an abortion, \neither in a hospital in the country in which she is serving, or, if \nthat country has a prohibition against an abortion, she can take a \nmilitary transport at no additional cost back to the States, to Great \nBritain, or to some other country at which an abortion is performed.\n  It is a legitimate question to raise as to whether or not that woman \nis being denied access to a hospital. Say she is serving in the \nmilitary in a country that by law prohibits abortions and, therefore, a \nhospital is not available to that woman. Does the military in any way \ndeny that woman the opportunity to have an abortion at some other \nplace?\n  I specifically inquired of the Department of Defense as to what was \nthe answer. Their reply to me in a letter from the Assistant Secretary \nof Defense is that there have been no military people to their \nknowledge that have requested an abortion that has not been provided \nthe opportunity to have an abortion, that has not been provided \nmilitary transport to have that abortion at a place where that abortion \nis legally performed.\n  I asked the question. Has the department had any difficulty in \nimplementing the policy that abortions can only be performed in \nmilitary hospitals in cases of rape, incest, or life of the mother?\n  Their answer: ``No. We have had no difficulty on that.''\n  Have any formal complaints been filed concerning this policy?\n  ``No. No formal complaints have been filed.''\n  Have any legal challenges been instituted concerning the policy?\n  ``No.'' Again, have any members or their dependents been denied \naccess to an abortion as a result of this policy?''\n  The answer again was no.\n  Have any members or dependents been denied access to military \ntransport for the purpose of procuring an abortion?\n  The answer was no.\n  Then I asked the question relative to the mixing of taxpayer funds, \ndoctor salaries, nurse salaries, equipment purchased with taxpayers' \nfunds, and they said it would be impossible to separate all of that \nout. It would be an accounting nightmare.\n  So what we have here is simply a proposal by the Senator from \nWashington that addresses a problem that does not exist. The Senator \nfrom Washington would have a legitimate point, if there was a problem \nthat existed. But no women are being denied constitutional rights to \nhave an abortion. There is no unequal treatment. There is not any \ntreatment available to a woman serving in the military in the United \nStates in a military hospital that is any different from a woman \nserving overseas. The only difference is that if they happen to be \nserving in a country which prohibits abortion in that country, they \nhave to go out of the country to have the abortion. But the military \nhas never had a case where they have denied military transport--not \ncommercial transport paid for by the military personnel but military \ntransport available for that person for the purpose of securing \nabortion.\n  So there is no problem. There is no constitutional problem. There is \nno equal access problem. There is no denial of constitutional rights. \nAnd there is no case presented to us out of difficulty in this \nparticular instance on this particular problem.\n  So that while the amendment may be well intended by the Senator from \nWashington it is clearly a solution in search of a problem. I \nunderstand the philosophical difference that exists between Members of \nthe Senate relative to abortion. That is a debate that we have had \nbefore. We will have it again. But it doesn't apply to this in this \nparticular instance.\n  The President clearly in 1993 shortly after he took office was \nphilosophically advancing his position relative to abortion. I happen \nto disagree with that position. The President has the right to hold his \nposition. Those of us who oppose it obviously have the right to hold \nours, and we debate that. But this amendment doesn't go to that debate. \nIt doesn't go to that issue.\n  For that reason, I hope the Senate will reject the Murray amendment.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COATS. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I ask the Senator from Indiana: Is it accurate to \nstate that our national policy as embodied in the Hyde amendment in \nessence states that we will not use Federal taxpayer money for abortion \nexcept in the case of rape, incest, or the life of the mother?\n  Mr. COATS. That is our national policy as adopted by this Congress \nand signed into law.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Is it also accurate to state that in 1980 there was a \nSupreme Court case which I believe was called Harris versus McRae in \nwhich the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Hyde \namendment?\n  Mr. COATS. That is also correct. The Supreme Court has upheld the \nconstitutionality of the Hyde amendment, and the Hyde amendment has \nbeen adopted time after time and reasserted time after time by the \nCongress on a bipartisan basis and signed by Presidents of both \nparties.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Therefore, based upon that action by Congress, by the \nexecutive branch as affirmed by the judicial branch, the Supreme Court, \nwe are bound by a national policy that we not use Federal money except \nin those cases that I cited.\n  Mr. COATS. That is correct.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. The Senator also referenced the DOD in their own \nanalysis where they said it would be an accounting nightmare to go \nthrough to determine the true cost of having an abortion performed in a \nU.S. medical facility when the facility is 100 percent taxpayer funded. \nAll of the personnel are paid for by the taxpayers, and all of the \nequipment.\n  Is that accurate?\n  Mr. COATS. That is accurate.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Is it also then, as we follow this, accurate to say \nthat in order to deal with the effect of that that there is provision \nfor a female member of the military service, in the event she chooses \nto have an abortion that she can have access to military transportation \nso that she can go to a facility of her choice and exercise her \nconstitutional right?\n  Mr. COATS. That is correct. Any military personnel has access to \nmilitary transport on a space-available basis. The DOD has never had an \ninstance where a woman who is seeking access on a space-available basis \non military transport has been denied that because the purpose of her \ntransport was for an abortion.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. This is probably not necessary. But in the event \nthere was a problem with space available but that the situation was \nlife-threatening to the woman, would she not be allowed to have a \nprocedure done at a U.S. military hospital overseas where she is?\n  Mr. COATS. Absolutely. She would be.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Let me make this very clear again. Today, if a woman serving \noverseas--whether she is in Bosnia or Saudi Arabia--would like to have \nhealth services, she would have to go through a commanding officer and \nrequest permission to come home to the United States to have that \nprocedure take place, and at the taxpayers' expense they would fly her \nhome. Under my amendment she would be allowed to use her own money to \npay for abortion-related services in a military hospital overseas.\n  I think that is a reasonable request for those women that we ask to \nserve in a country far away from home.\n  Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to my colleague from California.\n\n[[Page S7159]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague from Washington for yielding and for \nher leadership, and I thank our ranking member, Senator Levin, for his \nvery strong statement in behalf of women in the military.\n  Mr. President, my colleague from Indiana says this is about \nphilosophy, but I could not disagree with him more. This is about how \nwe treat our military personnel who happen to be women.\n  Now, my colleague from Idaho says taxpayer money should not be used \nin any abortion and therefore this policy ought to be kept. The fact is \nthe women, who have the right to choose under American law, would make \nthat choice and pay the bill, including the overhead, at the military \nhospital.\n  Mr. President, it is very hard to ever repay our men and women in the \nmilitary for the sacrifices they make every single day. They have no \nidea at what moment they are going to be called upon to put their very \nlife on the line. Their families live in fear that that could happen \nany moment, whether they are stationed in Bosnia, as many are now, \nwhether they are stationed in Saudi Arabia, as many are now.\n  How would you like to be a female stationed in one of those \ncountries, knowing what their attitude is and their philosophy is about \na woman's right to choose, and be forced into one of those hospitals? \nOh, you can get on a plane in an as-available situation. What if it is \nnot available? What if it means you have to take a tremendous amount of \nleave time and that complicates your life? This is a decision a woman \nmakes--perhaps my colleagues are unaware, if a woman decides to \nexercise her right to choose, this is not a light decision. This is \nsomething she has come to grips with, and it is her right in this \ncountry until they have the votes to overturn it, and I hope I never \nsee that day in the Senate.\n  So, Mr. President, we can never repay the men and women in the \nmilitary, so what do we do in this policy since this Congress changed \nhands and a President's policy was overturned? This is how we repay the \nwomen in the military? We tell them that we will not allow them their \nconstitutional right to choose a safe, legal abortion in a military \nhospital even if they pay every single cent for their procedure.\n  Now, we know that no level of pay could adequately compensate our men \nand women in the military. There is no price you can put on the \npatriotism that is involved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let us not slap the women in the military. Let us support \nthe Murray-Snowe amendment.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, may I inquire of the time remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana has 5 minutes 26 \nseconds, the Senator from Washington has 47 seconds.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, let me just address a question that has \nbeen raised by the Senator from California. I think the Senator \nmisunderstood what I said or perhaps I did not say it right. I said \nthat while there is a philosophical debate among Members of Congress as \nto the constitutional right of a woman to have an abortion, I said we \nhave debated that at other times and we will debate it at other times \nin the future. But what I thought I had said is that that is not what \nis at issue here. There are no constitutional rights of any woman being \ndenied under this current policy and so that is not at issue here. \nPerhaps my remarks were misunderstood.\n  Second, let me just say that this is not a policy that divides \nnecessarily Republicans and Democrats. Congress changing hands had \nnothing to do with the change in this policy. The policy was changed by \nthe President of the United States. This Congress has consistently \nvoted, whether it was led by Democrats or led by Republicans, to uphold \nthe Hyde amendment which prohibited the use of taxpayers' dollars \nexcept in cases of life of the mother, rape and incest. That has gained \nsupport from Republicans, gained support from Democrats. When the \nDemocrats were in charge of this Senate, that policy was enforced. And \nwhen the Republicans were in charge of the Congress, that policy was \nenforced. So it really is not something that necessarily drives a \nstake, a lane down between Republicans and Democrats.\n  Then the question raised by the Senator from Washington about the \ncost of military transport. Military transport is available to women on \na space-available basis. Those who have had the privilege of serving in \nthe military, as I and others have, realize the military is constantly \nflying planes back and forth not only to the United States but various \nbases within the theater of operations.\n  If you are in Korea, there are flights on a regular basis and a \nvoluminous number between the various bases in Asia. If you are in \nEurope, the same takes place. Women who cannot have an abortion because \nthey are stationed in a country that prohibits that abortion have easy \naccess not all the way back to the United States--there if they \nchoose--but easy access to countries in Europe where we have other \nbases or other countries where they can go to get that abortion.\n  So what we are saying here today has nothing to do with a woman's \nright to an abortion. It has everything to do with whether or not we \nwill uphold, consistently support a policy and uphold a policy that \nsays we cannot and should not force taxpayers who have a moral or \nreligious basis to oppose abortion, to use their tax dollars to pay for \nthose abortions.\n  That is what is at issue here. We are simply trying to uphold the \nstandard that this Congress has adopted that is currently law, law \nwhich, by the way, despite his own personal feelings, was signed into \nlaw by the President of the United States.\n  There are no instances of any woman in the military who has been \ndenied access to an abortion. So let us make sure that we understand \nthe nature of this amendment, the nature of the issue that is before us \nand what we are voting on.\n  Those who come down to this floor and vote on the basis that a \nwoman's right to an abortion is being denied have not understood the \nnature of the current policy. I urge Members to uphold the Hyde \nlanguage which allows abortions for life of the mother, rape or incest, \nto uphold the current Department of Defense policy which gives women \nthe access to abortions if they serve overseas but cannot have it \nperformed in that country. But let us not open up military hospitals \nthat are constructed with Federal funds and equipped with Federal \nfunds, let us not open up military hospitals whose doctors and nurses \nare paid with taxpayer funds. Let us maintain the current policy. It \nmakes sense. It does not deny women opportunity to have an abortion if \nthey want that abortion.\n  We can have the debate about the constitutionality of abortion or \nwhat restrictions we ought to put on those abortions as we have had on \npartial-birth abortion and as we will have in the future, but that is \nnot what is at issue today. I urge rejection of the amendment of the \nSenator from Washington.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Let me just end this debate by reiterating for my \ncolleagues that today a woman who seeks reproductive health services \nhas to ask her commanding officer and be flown home at taxpayer expense \non one of our transports in order to receive reproductive health \nservices. Under my amendment, she will be able to pay for it at her own \ncost in a safe military hospital overseas. The bottom line is this is \nabout the basic rights of those women whom we are asking to serve in \nremote locations to protect this democracy and fight for our country \nand for other countries overseas to be given the right to reproductive \nhealth care services.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n593 offered by the Senator from Washington. The yeas and nays have been \nordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S7160]]\n\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was rejected, and I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah. The Senator will \nsuspend. The Senate will please come to order.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 794, As Modified\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk on behalf \nof Senator Gramm of Texas and myself.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Point of inquiry. Did we have an order of amendments \nwe had agreed to?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator from Utah will clarify that, is \nthat an amendment to the pending second-degree amendment?\n  Mr. HATCH. This is a modification of the amendment to the Levin \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object. Mr. President, what is the \norder? I thought the order of business was the Wellstone amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending second-degree amendment is the \namendment of the Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm, to the Levin \namendment. The Senator from Utah sent up a modification to the Gramm \nsecond-degree amendment to the Levin amendment. Is there objection to \nthe modification? Without objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Strike all in amendment numbered 778 and insert in lieu \n     thereof the following:\n       ``The Department of Defense and Federal Prison Industries \n     shall conduct jointly a study of existing procurement \n     procedures regulations, and statutes which now govern \n     procurement transactions between the Department of Defense \n     and Federal Prison Industries.\n       ``A report describing the findings of the study and \n     containing recommendations on the means to improve the \n     efficiency and reduce the cost of such transactions shall be \n     submitted to the U.S. Senate committees on Armed Services and \n     the Judiciary no later than 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this act.''\n\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there now \nbe 1 hour for debate on the Wellstone amendment No. 668 equally divided \nin the usual form, and following that debate time, the amendment be \nlaid aside and the Senate resume consideration of the Gramm amendment \nNo. 794, with 30 minutes for debate equally divided in the usual form.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following that debate, the \namendment be temporarily set aside and Senator Boxer then be recognized \nto offer an amendment regarding executive compensation, with a time \nlimitation of 1 hour and 20 minutes equally divided in the usual form.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following that debate, Senator \nBingaman be recognized to offer an amendment regarding space-based \nlaser.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that there be 2 minutes equally \ndivided in the usual form prior to each vote ordered in the stacked \nsequence and that at 6 p.m. today, the Senate proceed to vote on, or in \nrelation to, the Wellstone amendment No. 668, to be followed by a vote \non, or in relation to, the Gramm amendment No. 794, to be followed by a \nvote on, or in relation to, the Levin amendment No. 778, as amended, if \namended, to be followed by a vote on, or in relation to, the Boxer \namendment regarding compensation.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that no second-degree \namendments be in order to any of the above-mentioned amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 668, As Modified\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. I think we are now on our \namendment. I believe it is No. 668. Mr. President, I am going to just \ntake 5 minutes. I am proud to be joined by my colleague from Iowa, \nSenator Harkin.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Daschle and Senator Kerry from \nMassachusetts be added as original cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I, again, want to stress support from \nthree organizations that have had a chance to really take a look at \nthis. I think there is broad support from the veterans community--I \nreally hope that we will get a strong vote for this amendment--from the \nDisabled American Veterans, from the Vietnam Veterans of America, and \nfrom the Paralyzed Veterans of America. Earlier I asked unanimous \nconsent that letters of their support be printed in the Record.\n  What we do here is we just simply give the Secretary of Defense \ndiscretion authority to transfer $400 million to the VA to restore VA \nfunding for health care. This was cut in the budget resolution.\n  Again, I want to make it real clear to my colleagues that I don't \nthink any of us really understood that we were going to have these kind \nof deep cuts in the VA health care budget. I want to, in a couple of \nminutes, make the point that we are not just talking about abstract \nnumbers and statistics, we are talking about people's lives. In \nparticular, I want to talk about what the VA health care system is \ndealing with.\n  First of all, the Persian Gulf veterans. When we had testimony in the \nVeterans' Committee, it was very, very important that when General \nSchwarzkopf came in, one of the points he made was one commitment we \ncan make to the gulf war veterans, I say to my colleague from Iowa, is \nto make sure we do the research as to what happened to them, and, \nsecond of all, we make sure that those veterans get the health care \nthat they need.\n  Mr. President, this has everything in the world to do with defense. \nThey were there supporting our country, and, in addition, let me point \nout that the Department of Defense, I think if there was any one agency \nin Government that would be more than willing to transfer a little bit \nof funding to make sure those veterans get health care, it certainly \nwould be the Department of Defense and the Secretary of Defense.\n  So it is a mild amendment. It does not ask for much. It just simply \nsays we shouldn't have cut this $400 million. I want to make it real \nclear on the Senate floor, that if we don't win today--and I hope we \nwill--my colleague and I are, one way or another, absolutely committed \nto restoring this funding.\n  You can be talking about the gulf war veterans, you can be talking \nabout the Vietnam veterans, you can be talking about post-traumatic \nstress syndrome, you can be talking about World War II and Korean war \nveterans who\n\n[[Page S7161]]\n\nare now older and need the care as well. Mr. President, by the year \n2000, one out of every three veterans is going to be 65 years of age or \nolder, and 63 percent of all American males over the age of 65 will be \nveterans. These are the demographics.\n  So there is nothing more important we can do than to make sure that \nwe live up to our contract to provide these veterans with the support \nthat they need.\n\n  What is going to happen if we don't restore the funds? This is my \nconclusion. It is a simple argument we are making. If we don't restore \nthe $400 million this year, what is going to happen is we are going to \naccelerate closure of inpatient care, we are going to offer fewer \nambulatory services, we are going to reduce long-term care, and we are \ngoing to treat fewer veterans. That is what is going to happen. That is \nwrong. If we want to help veterans, this is an opportunity to do so.\n  We all love to be in the parades, we all speak at the veterans' \ngatherings, we all say it is a sacred contract, we all say that we \nsupport veterans. Well, Mr. President, we cut $400 million, and my \ncolleagues can ask any veteran in any of your States, and they didn't \nknow about it.\n  Now is the time to rectify this mistake. Now is the time to take a \nsmall amount of money, $400 million, out of $2.6 billion more than the \nPentagon asked for and at least give the Secretary of Defense the \nauthority to transfer this funding. I am sure this will happen if we \nvote for it, and I hope that we get a very strong vote.\n  This amendment is a justice amendment. We should not be cutting \nhealth care services for veterans. The demand is increasing for that \ncare, and we ought to, as U.S. Senators, Democrats and Republicans \nalike, respond to veterans, we ought to support veterans, and the right \nthing to do is to vote for this amendment.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank my colleague from Iowa for all of his \nsupport.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield to the Senator from Iowa the remainder of our \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Senator from Minnesota. How much time do I \nhave, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-four minutes and forty-eight seconds.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague, my friend from \nMinnesota for offering this amendment. I join with him, as he said, in \noffering it.\n  He has laid out the case for veterans. We have shortchanged them. I \nheard someone ask earlier: ``This is the defense bill, this is defense \nauthorization. Later on there will be a veterans bill we can deal with. \nWe deal with veterans later. Why does it belong here?''\n  It belongs here because, Mr. President, I submit you cannot defend \nthis country unless we first defend our veterans, and that is what the \nSenator from Minnesota is saying in this amendment. He is right, we \nhave given the Pentagon $2.6 billion more than they even asked for and, \nat the same time, turned around and cut our veterans health care \nprogram by $400 million. What kind of signal does that send to our \nyoung men and women in uniform today about their prospects in the \nfuture for having their health care needs taken care of if, in fact, \nthey should find themselves in an enclave like those veterans found in \nVietnam or the gulf war or Korea or World War II.\n  Mr. President, there may be those who say if we take this $400 \nmillion out of defense, it is going to really hurt our readiness; we \ncan't afford to cut our defense budget for something like this. I would \nlike to take some time to refute that argument and to say, in fact, the \nmilitary budget that we have today is far too bloated to meet the \nthreats or potential threats that confront our country at this time.\n  No one disputes that the cold war is over, but some in this body \nwould like to continue funding the Department of Defense as if it never \nended. I know the world is still a dangerous place, but we must ask \nourselves, is our current defense budget justified by the dangers faced \nby the United States? I don't believe they are justified.\n  The fact is, military spending is so high that it can be lowered \nwithout endangering national security. Even with the elimination of the \nSoviet Union, defense spending is still much larger than cold war \nspending levels. And what is all this money for? What enemy are we \ngoing to fight? Is it Cuba who spends less than 1 percent on its \nmilitary budget? Or Libya, Iraq, Iran or North Korea or Syria? Or are \nwe just going to spend $268 billion next year simply to have a large \nmilitary? So let's look at some of the figures and take a comparison.\n  U.S. military spending right now is three times--and look at this \nchart--our U.S. military spending. Here is the pie chart showing in \nbillions of dollars the amount of money spent by various countries on \ndefense. The United States spends three times more than China, India, \nPakistan, Russia, and Vietnam all combined. It is more than double all \nof our NATO Allies combined. It is larger than the military budgets of \nthe countries with the seven largest standing armies. Most important, \nthe United States will spend nearly twice what all of our potential \nenemies spend on defense all combined. So if you add up all of our \npotential enemies, we will spend twice what they will spend on defense, \nall of them combined.\n  Some have pointed out we should continue high levels of military \nspending because we don't know what our potential enemies are. A threat \ncould come from anywhere. Let's assume this is true, for argument's \nsake. Let's break the world down by countries then, and see what we are \ntalking about in terms of potential threats.\n  Let us break it down by continents. What if every nation on the most \npowerful continent besides North America ganged up on the United \nStates? By this, I mean all of Europe. Let us say that all of Europe--\nGermany and France and Spain and Great Britain and Italy and all these \ncountries that are our friends--what if they all ganged up on us? Very \nremote, but if they did, we still outspend this potential threat by a \ngreat deal, by almost $60 billion. You might say that is ridiculous, in \nEurope we have our allies, they are in NATO. They are not going to \nattack us. OK.\n  What if every power in Africa joined in? Here is Africa down here, \nremote possibility, but they are only spending about $14 billion a \nyear.\n  In fact, if you add up all the military expenses of all of Europe, \nAfrica, and South America, combined--let us say that all of the \ncountries of Europe, South America, and Africa all combined together to \nattack us--we still spend more in defense than all of those three \ncontinents all put together.\n  So I ask again, why are we spending so much money? This is the world. \nWe are spending more than all of these continents all put together.\n  There is another aspect to our defense. As it stands right now, such \na large portion of our discretionary budget goes for defense that we \nare actually endangering our national security. Our citizens are \nthreatened, the life and health of our country is threatened. Every \nextra dollar we spend on defense that we do not need to is a dollar \nless for education, for putting police on the streets, for stopping the \ndrug epidemic, and feeding hungry children.\n  In fact, the amount of discretionary funding spent on defense totals \nover 50 percent of the discretionary budget. That means that the \nportion of the total budget that we actually decide on where it goes \noverwhelmingly goes for defense. For every dollar that we spend out of \nthis body, over 50 cents goes to defense--not education, not health \ncare, not breakfast feeding for kids in schools, not for flood victims, \nbut for the military.\n  Here again is a pie chart. Look at it. This is our discretionary \ndollar that we spend. So 51.5 cents for military; all the rest for \neverything else. Justice gets 4 cents; housing assistance gets 3 cents; \nhealth gets 4.8 cents, transportation 2.7 cents. You wonder why our \nhighways are going to pot and with potholes? You wonder why our \nrailroads are deficient?\n  Here is energy, less than 1 penny; education, 6 cents; 51.5 cents for \nthe military. Six cents on education. You wonder why our schools are \ncrumbling? You wonder why we are not getting the best possible \nteachers? Well, we are only spending that much money in education.\n\n[[Page S7162]]\n\n  Natural resources and environment, 4 cents.\n  So I think this really graphically shows where our money goes. Over \nhalf for defense; less than half for everything else that goes to make \nus a strong nation.\n  Some who argue for increased defense spending point out the defense \nspending has gone down from 1985. I heard that argument early today. A \nSenator on the floor said, ``Oh, my gosh, the defense budget has been \ncut by something like 30 percent since 1985.'' OK. Why do you use 1985? \nWhy do we start with 1985, when 1985 was the peak of military spending, \nthe buildup during the Reagan years? So, yes, you can measure it from \n1985.\n  Why don't we measure it from 1980? Let us take the height of the cold \nwar, 1980, when we faced the Soviet Union. Well, our spending today is \njust about the same, actually maybe just a little bit more than it was \nin 1980. Yes, we have come down from 1985. But I submit, Mr. President, \nthose who say that we have cut our defense spending are using an \narbitrary point. They are using the point at which we had the highest \nmilitary spending since the war. I say what we ought to use is a \nbaseline like 1980 or 1970. And if we look at those base years, we get \na much different level.\n  So why are we comparing today's spending levels to 1985? The world \ntoday is not the world of 1980 or 1985 or 1990. We should be discussing \nthe defense budget in terms of today's threats, that is, unless we plan \nto take the United States Army and our defense back in time to 1985 and \nhave them fight the Soviet Union. But we will not do that because there \nis no Soviet Union.\n  Why does it matter so much what we spent in 1985 when the Soviet \nUnion was a threat? We should look at today's threats and potential \nthreats, match our spending to meet them, not the threats of 1985.\n  Aside from all that, the Wellstone amendment seeks, as we know, to \nshift $400 million out of $268 billion. We are saying, take $400 \nmillion, shift it over to veterans health care. As the Senator pointed \nout, we have $2.6 billion more than what the Pentagon asked for. Will \nwe really harm our readiness if we take $400 million out for veterans \nhealth? I submit not. Why are we giving the Defense Department more \nmoney when they cannot even keep track of the money they have already \nspent and they are wasting billions on buying equipment they do not \nneed?\n  Mr. President, in February of this year, I released a General \nAccounting Office report requested by myself, Congressman DeFazio, \nSenator Durbin, and Congresswoman Maloney. This study revealed that \nover half of the Department of Defense inventory of procured items is \noverstock; in other words, waste. Of the $67 billion of goods in DOD \nwarehouses, the GAO estimates that $41 billion is unneeded. What do you \nmean by unneeded? By unneeded, this means the military would never need \nor use the items even during wartime. Let me repeat that. Of the $67 \nbillion in goods in DOD warehouses, GAO estimated that $41 billion is \nunneeded even in wartime.\n\n  That is not all. Again, here is the inventory. This is what this \nchart shows. Total inventory is $67 billion. About $41 billion, or 61 \npercent, of it is in excess of what is needed for operational \nrequirements or for reserve requirements. The needed inventory is about \n$25.8 billion. So we have all this waste out there that we do not need, \nand yet you would think it would end. But, it never seems to end. It \njust continues going on and on and on.\n  The GAO identified more than $1.1 billion worth of goods--11,000 \ndifferent items--for which there is a 100-year supply. Imagine that. Do \nwe expect our Army to fight with something 100 years from now that was \nbuilt today? Bring back the horse cavalry. Maybe that is what today's \nArmy needs, what we used 100 years ago. So 100 years, with 11,000 \ndifferent items, totaling $1.1 billion.\n  But that is not all. The GAO also uncovered millions of dollars in \nDOD inventory items for which there is more than a 20-year supply. Yet, \nthe Pentagon continues to buy more. The justification by the Pentagon \nfor not canceling many of these orders actually border on the bizarre. \nSome were not canceled because termination ``was not cost-effective'' \nfor any purchase less than $10,000.\n  Other items are automatically ordered without review or regard to \nneed. The computer just keeps ordering them. As a result, we do not \njust have warehouses of waste, I call them arsenals of bureaucracy. \nWhat we have is Sergeant Bilko manning the warehouse, Beetle Bailey \nrunning procurement, and Gomer Pyle checking the list twice.\n  This photo here shows just one item that was uncovered called a \ndirect linear valve used on a hydraulic pump used on aircraft carriers. \nThe Pentagon has more than a 20-year supply on this item. Although only \n8 of those in stock were needed, an additional 66 were on order in \n1995. Only 8 were needed, but an additional 66 were ordered.\n  Again, we asked why the Navy did not cancel the order. Well, they \nsaid, termination was not ``cost-effective for any purchase less than \n$10,000.'' So if it costs less than $10,000, it is cheaper for the \ntaxpayers to buy it. Please, someone, make sense of that for me. If it \ncosts less than $10,000, keep buying it, keep stocking it because it \ncosts more to cancel it. Try selling that to your constituents back \nhome.\n  Here is another one. This is a circuit board, aircraft circuit board. \nIn 1995, 10 were on order. The only problem was that the Navy had 27 of \nthese, but only 2 were needed for operational and wartime reserve.\n  That is not the last of it. This is a 1972 state-of-the-art \nelectronic item. So we asked, why did they keep ordering them? Well, \naccording to the item manager, the Navy supply system computer \nautomatically ordered the item and no one bothered to review the order. \nBut not to worry. After the 10 new assemblies of these circuit boards--\nat more than $1,000 each--were delivered in May, they were \nautomatically routed for disposal. What does that mean? They ordered \nthem; they came in; someone stamped them, shoved them out the backdoor \nto throw away.\n  So do not tell me that taking $400 million for veterans health care \nis going to somehow hurt our readiness or hurt our ability to defend \nthis country from any threats that exist today or any potential threats \nin the foreseeable future.\n  But what this $400 million will mean is that those veterans who put \nthemselves in harm's way, who were there to sacrifice life and limb for \ntheir country, who were in the gulf war or in Haiti or in Bosnia, \nVietnam, Korea, World War II, or even peacetime--I do not mean just to \nfocus on our veterans who were in wartime. What is that saying? It is \nnot just those who are in battle, but those who support those in \nbattle, our peacetime army, our peacetime military.\n  My brother was a SAC pilot in the Strategic Air Command for 5 years \ncarrying nuclear weapons. None were ever dropped, but this was our \nfront line of defense. This is what kept the Soviet bear in check. So \nthese, too, these veterans also have to be responded to in terms of \ntheir health care needs.\n  So I am talking about all veterans, not just those who have been in \nactual war but those who were willing, if the orders came, to fight and \nto perhaps die for their country.\n  I believe we have an absolute obligation to support our troops not \nonly in time of battle but also at home when the battle ends. I believe \nwe have a special obligation to those in our Armed Forces who were \ndisabled in the service of our country. Veterans programs too often \nsuffer inadequate funding and misguided policies.\n\n  As Senator Wellstone pointed out, our veterans population is aging \nrapidly, and the hospital system is stretched to its limits. The \nproposed cuts to the VA budget, which is already inadequate for the \nmedical needs of veterans, is an unacceptable way to try to balance the \nbudget. These cuts will have a drastic and severe effect on the health \nof our Nation's veterans, especially those veterans who were disabled \nin the service of our country.\n  So what our amendment seeks to do is to alleviate these unfair cuts \nin the veterans discretionary funding by transferring $400 million from \nthe Department of Defense budget to VA. We can do it. The money is \nthere. If the Department of Defense will just cut down a little bit on \ntheir waste and inefficiencies, if we will begin to gear our thinking \ntowards the threats of today\n\n[[Page S7163]]\n\nand tomorrow instead of what the world was like 10 and 20 years ago, if \nwe do that, there is plenty of money in the defense budget to make sure \nthat we meet our obligation to our veterans.\n  I do not think this Senate should do anything less than that. This \namendment should be adopted overwhelmingly to send a strong signal not \nonly to our veterans but to those who are serving today that when their \ntime of need comes and they need health care through the veterans \nsystem, that this country will stand behind them when they are veterans \njust as it stands behind them when they are serving in active duty.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  How much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 5 minutes 27 \nseconds.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the amendments \noffered by Senator Wellstone and any other amendment which lowers \ndefense spending below the level set in the budget agreement. We have a \nbudget agreement with the administration that we should not disregard--\nan agreement that was widely supported by this body and the \nadministration--and frankly, Mr. President, this agreement itself may \nnot provide enough funding for defense.\n  Mr. President, our military forces are beginning to show the stress \nof constrained budget and too many deployments. Funding for \nmodernization and quality of life initiatives is continually diverted \nto fund current operations with promises to fix the modernization \nproblem in the future. This is no longer acceptable. It should not be \nacceptable to any of the Members of this body.\n  The Department of Defense is continuing their downsizing. This year's \ndefense budget request represents lowest percent of our GDP in the last \n57 years. Force levels have shrunk from 2.1 million service members at \nthe end of the cold war to 1.4 million today. Annual spending in the \nDepartment of Defense has decreased in the last 10 years from $375 to \n$250 billion in inflation adjusted dollars. Even at the level of \nfunding proposed in the budget agreement, the Quadrennial Defense \nReview is recommending force structure reductions up to 130,000 \nmilitary personnel as well as reductions in key modernization programs.\n  Mr. President, I believe that a mismatch is developing between \nstrategy and actual force capability. GAO and CBO have both given \nestimates to the underfunding of the modernization accounts. The budget \nagreement does not fully fund defense. It does represent what funds are \navailable. Funding defense at the levels proposed by these amendments \nwill have serious impacts on the readiness and quality of life of our \nservice personnel.\n  Command Sergeants Major Alley, U.S. Forces Command, has summed it \npretty well when he stated.\n\n       Our soldiers do not ask for much. What they do ask for is \n     stability in deployments, adequate housing, quality-of-life \n     programs, and adequate compensation.\n\n  Mr. President, if this body allows these amendments or other \namendments to lower defense spending below what was agreed to--I \nrepeat, was agreed to--in the budget agreement, we will be responsible \nfor the impacts on the readiness of our forces, we will increase the \ntempo of our operating forces, and we will not be able to provide the \nquality of life programs, our service members deserve.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum and I ask unanimous consent that \nthe time be equally divided between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment of the \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning \nbusiness for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Grassley pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1003 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 794, As Modified\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is the Gramm amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak again in opposition to the Levin \namendment, and in support of the Gramm second degree amendment. The \nLevin amendment, if enacted, would cripple Federal Prison Industries, \nby essentially eliminating the only market for its products. FPI is not \npermitted to compete for sales in the private market. It may only sell \nto the Federal Government, and then only if it can meet price, quality, \nand delivery requirements. I do not believe that Senator Levin is \nsuggesting that we change the law and allow FPI to compete for business \nin the general market place. Yet, if we effectively eliminate the \nGovernment market for FPI goods, and FPI cannot sell its products to \nthe public, who will its customers be?\n  Those advocating elimination of the FPI's Government procurement \npreference suggest that their goal is only a level playing field, and \ncomplain the FPI wages ensure unfair competition. Yet, they do not \nmention the tremendous costs and inefficiencies inherent in operating a \nmanufacturing operation behind bars. FPI endures security and work \nforce challenges few private plant managers can even imagine.\n  FPI puts 100 percent of its revenues back into the private sector. \nThousands of private sector jobs depend on supplying FPI with materials \nand services. My colleagues should ask themselves, if FPI is forced to \nclose its factories, what will replace those private sector jobs?\n  FPI is also an essential prison management and rehabilitation tool. \nAny corrections officer will tell you, the most dangerous inmate is the \nidle inmate. Idleness breeds frustration, and provides ample time to \nplan mischief--a volatile combination. Yet, despite the references to \nthe costs imposed by FPI by my colleagues who support this amendment, I \nhave heard no one suggest how the taxpayers will pay for the new prison \nprograms and the additional prison guards that might be needed if FPI \nfactories are forced to close.\n  Either we want Federal inmates to work, or we do not. I believe that \nwe do want inmates to work, and therefor I must oppose this amendment. \nI say to my colleagues, if you believe in maintaining good order and \ndiscipline in prisons, or if you believe in the rehabilitation of \ninmates when possible, you should be opposed to this amendment.\n  The Gramm amendment provides a better approach, by requiring a study \nand report to Congress on FPI and FPI's market needs and impact. As \nChairman of the Judiciary Committee, I have a strong interest in this \nissue. I would note that my colleagues who support the Levin amendment \nhave not approached me about addressing this issue in the Committee.\n\n[[Page S7164]]\n\n  Congress should consider this issue carefully before effectively \neliminating a prison program that has served the Nation well for 60 \nyears. This is particularly the case, as my friend from Texas has \npointed out, that Congress allows no other market for prison-made goods \nand services. If we are going to consider eliminating the government \nsales preference, I believe it appropriate for us to also consider \npermitting prison goods to be sold on the open market as well.\n  However, even then they may not be competitive because of the \ndifferences of efficiency between those who are about a quarter as much \nproductive as the private sector workers are.\n  Prison security and prisoner rehabilitation are too important matters \nto risk hurried action based on emotion. I urge my colleagues to reject \nthe Levin proposal and adopt the Gramm substitute amendment.\n  Mr. President, this is an important issue. I hope our colleagues will \npay attention to it. I would hate to see what would happen to our \nprisons if we didn't have this privilege of helping these people to do \nmeaningful work and have the opportunity of selling their goods and \nservices that will be from a quality and price standpoint and delivery \nstandpoint competitive with the private sector.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  I understand the distinguished Senator from Texas will be here later. \nI would like him to have the remaining part of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes in support of my \namendment which is cosponsored by Senators Abraham, Robb, Helms, \nKempthorne, Daschle, and Burns.\n  The issue really is the opportunity to sell goods and services. That \nis, indeed, the issue. The question is whether or not the private \nsector ought to have the opportunity to sell its goods and services \nwhen its price is better than the price of Federal Prison Industries. \nThat is the issue.\n  The national performance review had as one of its reforms in \nprocurement that we should require Federal Prison Industries to compete \ncommercially for Federal agency business. That is what we are talking \nabout--whether they ought to have a monopoly so that even though their \ngoods are higher in price, Federal Prison Industries is able to say \nthat an agency must buy their product. That wasn't the intent of the \nFederal Prison Industries law. The intent was that they are supposed to \nbe competitive. They have all kinds of advantages.\n  The labor prices in prisons, needless to say, range from something \nlike 23 cents an hour to $1.15 an hour. They don't pay income tax, no \nmedical benefits, no retirement, and no benefits, obviously. So they \nhave tremendous economic advantage to begin with. Nonetheless, with all \nof those advantages, what we have said is, if they can produce \nsomething more cheaply than the private sector, that the Federal \nagencies ought to be able to buy that product, and they should. What \nthis amendment simply says is that if the private sector, despite all \nof the advantages that Federal Prison Industries has in terms of cheap \nlabor--no income tax, no medical costs, and so forth charged to the \nproduct --if, despite all of that, a business can produce a product \nmore cheaply that it ought to be able to sell that product to its \nGovernment.\n  So the issue is exactly the opportunity to sell goods. But it is the \nopportunity for business people in the private sector to sell goods to \ntheir Government. The frustration level is very high here. We get \nletters from people--veterans who write us, who say, ``Is it justice \nthat Federal Prison Industries would step in and take business away \nfrom a disabled Vietnam vet twice wounded fighting for the country \neffectively destroying and bankrupting that hero's business which the \nVeterans' Administration suggested he enter?''\n  This is a man who can't bid. He is not allowed to bid on a product \nhis own Government is buying.\n  Here is a letter that comes in from Colorado from Access Products of \nColorado. The award in this case went to Federal Prison Industries, \nalthough the charge to the Air Force was $45 for this particular unit. \nThis private sector guy was offering it at $22 per unit. So the \ntaxpayers are paying twice as much, and he is not allowed to sell a \nproduct that he makes on the outside to his Air Force.\n  The private sector is very deeply involved in my amendment, and very \nstrongly supportive of it. The NFIB strongly supports it. The chamber \nof commerce strongly supports the Levin-Abraham amendment. The National \nAssociation of Manufacturers strongly support this amendment. The \nreason they support it is because of the principle that it embodies--\nthe principle of competition. That principle is that people who are in \nbusiness struggling to make a living wanting to sell to their \nGovernment ought to at least be allowed to bid competitively against \nFederal Prison Industries which has tremendous advantage and does \nfrequently underbid the private sector because of those advantages in \nterms of labor costs and all the other advantages they have.\n  That frequently happens, that their prices are much lower than the \nprivate sector because of all those advantages. But when the private \nsector is able to produce a product, be it clothing or furniture, or \nwhatever, more cheaply than Federal Prison Industries, it ought to be \nallowed to sell to its Government. And that is why this issue is so \nimportant to the private sector.\n  My time is up. I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, while I am on my feet, let me just yield \nmyself 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wish to introduce a letter from a coalition called the \nCompetition in Contracting Act Coalition. I want to read this letter \nbecause it is short and it states our case, I think, very well.\n  The coalition is made up of 28 organizations, 204 businesses that \nsupport the Levin-Abraham amendment relative to the mandatory source \nstatus of Prison Industries. And this is what the letter goes on to \nsay:\n\n       Your legislation would allow businesses to compete with the \n     FPI for Federal contracts. Today they are prohibited from \n     doing so. If a product is made in a Federal prison and \n     Federal agencies are forced to buy that product, the only way \n     around the requirement is for an agency to seek a waiver from \n     FPI . . . Your bill would implement a recommendation of the \n     National Performance Review which stated that our Government \n     should ``take away the Federal Prison Industries status as a \n     mandatory source of Federal supply and require it to compete \n     commercially for Federal agencies' business.''\n       This solution would help manufacturers by eliminating the \n     barrier to competition and allowing the bid process to take \n     place. It would help Government agencies by allowing them to \n     compare price and quality from a broad array of sources.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, if this letter is not already \nmade part of the Record, it be made part of the Record, including the \nlist of 204 businesses that are part of this coalition that come, I \nthink, from just about every one of our States.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                The Competition in\n\n\n                                    Contracting Act Coalition,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 1997.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: Our national coalition of 28 \n     organizations and 204 businesses is known as the Competition \n     in Contracting Act Coalition. We are in full support of your \n     effort to reform Federal Prison Industries, Inc. (FPI) by \n     ending its mandatory source status.\n       Your legislation, S. 339, would allow businesses to compete \n     with FPI for federal contracts. Today, they are prohibited \n     from doing so. If a product is made in a federal prison, then \n     federal agencies are forced to buy that product. The only way \n     around the requirement is for an agency to seek a waiver from \n     FPI, also known as UNICOR.\n       S. 339 would implement a recommendation of the National \n     Performance Review which stated that our government should \n     ``Take away the Federal Prison Industries' status as a \n     mandatory source of federal supplies and require it to \n     compete commercially for federal agencies' business.'' This \n     solution would help manufacturers by eliminating the barrier \n     to competition and allowing the bid process to take place. It \n     would help government agencies by allowing them to compare\n\n[[Page S7165]]\n\n     price and quality from a broad array of sources.\n       The damage being done to our private sector economy by \n     federal prison factories is getting worse every year. \n     Attached is a copy of our coalition membership list, all of \n     whom support your effort to save private sector jobs and \n     bring fairness to companies trying to work with the federal \n     government.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Brad Miller,\n         Manager of Government Affairs, BIFMA International and \n           Contact Person, Competition in Contracting Act \n           Coalition.\n\n\n                      members as of June 19, 1997\n\n       Abbey Business Interiors, Fresno, California.\n       Abear Construction Ltdc Co., Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n       ABCO Office Furniture, Florence, Alabama.\n       Access Products, Colorado Springs, Colorado.\n       Adden Furniture, Inc., Alexandria, Virginia.\n       ADM International, Inc., Chicago, Illinois.\n       AGI, High Point, North Carolina.\n       Alexander Patterson Group, Inc., Dayton, Ohio.\n       All Makes Office Equipment Company, Omaha, Nebraska.\n       American Apparel Manufacturer's Association, Arlington, \n     Virginia.\n       American Furniture Manufacturer's Association, High Point, \n     North Carolina.\n       American Seating company, Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n       American Society of Interior Designers, Washington, D.C.\n       American Traffic Safety Services Association, \n     Fredericksburg, Virginia.\n       American Space Planners, Inc., Baltimore, Maryland.\n       ANADAC, Arlington, Virginia.\n       Apex Office Supply & Deskin, Inc., Oak Ridge, Tennessee.\n       Architectural Woodwork Institute, Reston, Virginia.\n       Arkwright Mills, Spartanburg, South Carolina.\n       ASC Office Furniture, Alexandria, Virginia.\n       Aspects, Inc., Redlands, California.\n       Automation Products, Inc., Newport News, Virginia.\n       Batty & Hoyt, Inc., Rochester, New York.\n       Bayer Corporation, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n       Bernhardt Contract, Lenoir, North Carolina.\n       Bevis Furniture, Florence, Alabama.\n       BIFMA International, Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n       BKM Total Office, San Diego, California.\n       BKM Total Office of Texas, Dallas, Texas.\n       Blount Associates, Laguna Beach, California.\n       Boring Business Equipment, Lakeland, Florida.\n       BPI, Inc., Kent, Washington.\n       Brenner Tours, Hopkins, Michigan.\n       Brent Industries, Inc., Brent, Alabama.\n       Bristol Industries, Inc., Mentone, California.\n       The Buckstaff Company, Oshkosh, Wisconsin.\n       Business Accessories/Colecraft, Lancaster, New York.\n       Business Coalition for Fair Competition, Annandale, \n     Virginia.\n       Business Environments, Albuquerque, New Mexico.\n       Business Interiors, Inc., Denver, Colorado.\n       Business Products Industry Association, Alexandria, \n     Virginia.\n       Business Resource Group, San Antonio, Texas.\n       Business & Associations for a Strong Economy, Lansing, \n     Michigan.\n       California Business Interiors, Sante Fe Springs, \n     California.\n       Carolina Business Furniture, Archdale, North Carolina.\n       Capitol Furniture Distributing Company, Fort Lauderdale, \n     Florida.\n       Jack Cartwright, Inc., High Point, North Carolina.\n       CDM Contract Furnishings, Inc., Austin Texas.\n       Cedar Crest Banquet Centre, Marshall, Michigan.\n       Centercore Group, Plainfield, New Jersey.\n       Coalition for Government Procurement, Washington, D.C.\n       CONCO, Inc., Louisville, Kentucky.\n       Contract Interiors, Columbia, South Carolina.\n       Comfortage Industries, Gurnee, Illinois.\n       Computing Technology Industry Association, Lombard, \n     Illinois.\n       Contemporary Galleries of WV, Charleston, West Virginia.\n       Contract Marketing Group, Inc., Chicago, Illinois.\n       Country Manor Real Estate & Rentals, Onondacia, Michigan.\n       Creative Apparel, Associates, Belmont, Maine.\n       Creative Office Pavilion, Boston, Massachusetts.\n       Creative Office Seating, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.\n       CYSI, Washington, D.C.\n       Danco Resource Group, Grand Rapids, Michigan.\n       Dehler Mfg.

Finally, Mr. President, I want to just make reference to \ntwo examples, two Federal agencies that believe the current system is \ntotally inefficient and wasteful.\n  First, the Veterans Administration has sought the repeal of the \nmandatory preference on several occasions because Federal Prison \nIndustries pricing for textiles, furniture and other products is \nroutinely higher. The VA officials estimate that the repeal of the \npreference will save $18 million over a 4-year period for their agency \nalone, making that money available for veterans services.\n  Mr. President, the estimate that we have received based on testimony \nfrom the deputy director of Defense Logistics in a 1996 letter to the \nHouse of Representatives is that Federal Prison Industries has a 42-\npercent delinquency rate. This is the deputy commander of the Defense \nLogistics Agency. He says that FPI has a 42-percent delinquency rate \ncompared to a 6-percent delinquency rate for commercial industry--7 \ntimes the delinquency rate. And for that record of poor performance, \nFederal Prison Industries prices were an average of 13 percent higher \nthan commercial prices.\n  I yield 1 additional minute to complete my statement here, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Some years earlier, the DOD inspector general had made a similar \nassessment and reached a conclusion that FPI contracts were more \nexpensive than contracts for comparable commercial products by an \naverage of 15 percent.\n  So here you have the Defense Logistics Agency in 1996 saying that the \nprices were 13 percent higher than commercial prices. The DOD inspector \ngeneral a few years earlier in a study said comparable commercial \nprices are 15 percent cheaper than Federal Prison Industries.\n  We are not suggesting in any way that Federal Prison Industries not \nbe allowed to compete. Quite the opposite. It is fine that they \ncompete, and it is fine that people are working. But it is also fine \nthat people work on the outside and they should not lose their jobs on \nthe outside when they can produce something more cheaply with all the \nadvantages that people have on the inside in terms of cheap labor. If \npeople working on the outside can produce a product more cheaply, for \nheaven's sake, it seems to me fundamental fairness is that the person \nnot in prison be allowed to sell to his own Government a product that \nhe can produce more cheaply than can be produced inside of that prison.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we have heard an interesting debate here \nabout competition when there is no competition. I would like to remind \nmy colleagues that prior to the Great Depression, we had the model \nprison labor system in America. Prior to the Great Depression, \nprisoners in America worked 10 hours a day 7 days a week. They paid for \nsubstantial parts of their incarceration by working. They produced \ngoods and services that were sold, and people from all over the world \ncame to look at our prison system to try to model theirs after it.\n  In the Great Depression, special interest groups took control of this \nissue and in three bills, the Hawes-Cooper Act of 1929, the Sumners-\nAshurst Act of 1935, and the Walsh-Healey Act of 1936, we, No. 1, \nremoved the interstate commerce protections for prison-made goods; No. \n2, made illegal the interstate transportation of goods produced by \nprison labor; and, finally, we prohibited the use of inmate labor. In \nother words, in the Great Depression we criminalized prison labor in \nAmerica. As a result, we have the absurd situation that today we have \n1,100,000 prisoners, State and Federal, most of whom are young men, \nphysically vigorous, on whom we are spending $22,000 a year to keep, \nthose who are in the Federal penitentiary, in the Federal penitentiary, \nand yet it is illegal for us to require them to work when the average \ntaxpayer pays $200 a year for the cost of keeping them in prison.\n  All these people who are talking about competition are the very \npeople who oppose letting us have a system where prison labor works to \nproduce something of value that can be sold to\n\n[[Page S7167]]\n\npay for their cost of incarceration. In fact, so much have we limited \nprison labor in America that the only thing Federal prisoners are \nallowed to do is to produce goods to sell to the Government, and, as a \nresult, hundreds of thousands of them sit idle watching color \ntelevision in air-conditioning while the back of working men and women \nin America is broken in paying for them to be in prison.\n  We have an amendment that comes along now and says the only work \nrequirement we have is producing things for the Government and let us \nend it. All of this business about competition would be believable if \nthere were a proposal here to let prison labor compete in the \nmarketplace, but that has already been eliminated. This is a final \neffort to end prison labor in America.\n  Let me touch on a few of these issues. First of all, there is a big \ndispute about the facts here, a big dispute about the facts, which is \nwhy I have offered a second-degree amendment. If we listen to Senator \nLevin, we get the idea that everybody is unhappy with the products \nproduced by prison labor, that they are noncompetitive in price, and \nthat everybody would like to have an alternative.\n  The facts are that during fiscal year 1996, Federal Prison Industries \nreceived more than $446 million in waiver requests. These are \nGovernment agencies that say we do not want to use prisonmade goods. We \nwant to go into the private sector. Of those requests, 92 percent or \n$410 million were granted, and those contracts went into the private \nsector. And the average amount of time that it took to get those \nrequests approved was 4 days.\n  So something is wrong here. Either these figures from the Bureau of \nPrisons are wrong or Senator Levin is wrong. The problem is I have \ngreat confidence in both, and what I have done is offer an amendment to \nget the facts, to do a study that would involve the Bureau of Prisons \nand their work program and the Defense Department so that we can know \nexactly what the facts are.\n  Here is how the system works. The current system works in that the \nGovernment uses prison labor where the Government agrees on the price \nand where Government is given the ability to not use prison labor by \napplying for a waiver, and in 92 percent of the cases that waiver was \ngranted.\n  What do we do with the money that comes from prison labor?\n  One of the things we do is we pay for victim restitution. By making \nprisoners work, we earn money that goes to victim restitution.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter opposing the Levin amendment \nfrom the National Victims Center be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                        National Victim Center\n\n                                     Arlington, VA, July 10, 1997.\n     Senator Phil Gramm,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: On behalf of the National Victim Center \n     and the 40 million Americans victimized by crime each year, I \n     write to express our strong opposition to Senator Carl \n     Levin's amendment (S. Amdt. No. 778) to be offered to S. 936, \n     the defense authorization bill, concerning purchases from \n     federal prison industries.\n       This amendment raises a panoply of concerns at both the \n     federal and state levels, and will literally take away \n     desperately needed funds for victims of crime who are trying \n     to piece their lives back together in the aftermath of \n     violence.\n       At the state level, many states require a percentage of \n     money deposited into inmate accounts--including inmate \n     earnings from prison industries--to be collected to support \n     statewide funds for crime victim assistance programs as well \n     as to satisfy court-ordered restitution for victims. For \n     example, in California, during fiscal 1995-1996, the state \n     Prison Industry Authority (PIA) deducted 20% of the inmate \n     wages and transfers (or the balance of victim restitution \n     orders or court-ordered fines, whichever was less) to pay for \n     crime victim assistance programs and restitution orders. The \n     total PIA payroll for inmates during that year was $6.4 \n     million 20% of which was authorized to be swept up by the \n     State of California to assist crime victims. To take away \n     those desperately needed victim assistance funds is a slap in \n     the face of the already wounded.\n       At the federal level, we are deeply concerned that the \n     Levin amendment would thwart the Federal Bureau of Prisons' \n     (BOP) efforts to collect an estimated $4-5 million from \n     prison industries each year, funds that are directly \n     deposited to the Crime Victims Fund, money that funds \n     thousands of victim services programs across the country, as \n     well as used to satisfy victim restitution orders.\n       We also have strong concerns that removing the federal \n     prison industries (sole-source) procurement requirement will \n     lead to increased prison idleness, affecting security issues \n     in prison and for all us. The Levin amendment, by introducing \n     competitive bidding into the procurement process, will not \n     increase prison work, but it will reduce prison work. The \n     amendment poses too great a risk that prison industries will \n     be unable to compete effectively. If the prison industries \n     cannot compete, corrections systems will have less money \n     coming into the prisons to fund expansion or additional \n     prison programs including prison industries, leading to \n     prison idleness and increased security risks.\n       Our concerns are shared by Aileen Adams, Director of Office \n     for Victims of Crime; Larry Meachum, Director of the \n     Corrections Office, Office of Justice Programs, Department of \n     Justice; and Dr. Kathleen Hawk, Director, Federal Bureau of \n     Prisons.\n       We strongly urge you to stand up for victims of crime and \n     oppose the Levin Senate Amendment No. 778 to the defense \n     authorization bill.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                     David Beatty,\n                                        Director of Public Policy.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me read two paragraphs from this letter.\n\n       On behalf of the National Victims Center and the 40 million \n     Americans victimized by crime each year, I write to express \n     our strong opposition to Senator Carl Levin's amendment . . .\n       This amendment . . . will literally take away desperately \n     needed funds for victims of crime who are trying to piece \n     their lives back together in the aftermath of violence.\n\n  In other words, the money earned by having prisoners work we are \nusing in part to compensate victims. And the National Victims Center is \nopposed to the Levin amendment because they are concerned about the \nloss of restitution.\n  Let me also remind my colleagues that working prisoners is critically \nimportant, and let me read you a couple of sentences from a letter we \nreceived from the Assistant Attorney General.\n\n       Federal Prison Industries is the Bureau of Prisons' most \n     important, efficient and cost-effective tool for managing \n     inmates. It keeps inmates productively occupied and reduces \n     inmate idleness and the violence and disruptive behavior \n     associated with it. Thus, it is essential to the security of \n     Federal prisons and the communities in which they are located \n     and is essential to the safety of the Bureau of Prisons' \n     staff and inmates.\n\n  They go on to say that the findings are overwhelming that where we \nmake prisoners work and where they acquire skills in working, the \nprobability that they will get out of prison and go back and commit \nother crimes falls dramatically.\n  I went through these numbers earlier today, but let me do it again. \nIn the State of South Carolina, ably represented by the chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, those prisoners who participate in work in \nprison industries have a probability of recommitting crimes that put \nthem back in prison of 2 percent. Those who do not work in prison \nindustries have a probability of ending up back in prison of 35 \npercent. Those numbers in Florida are an 11 percent recidivism rate, \nthat is, probability of ending up back in prison again after they get \nout, for those who work in prison industries; 27 percent for those who \ndo not. In Wisconsin, it is 11 percent versus 22 percent; in Kentucky, \nit is 36 versus 65 percent.\n  So, basically, this is not an issue of procurement efficiency. This \nis an issue of whether or not we are going to end the last vestige of \nprison labor in America. We ought to be debating opening up to allow \nprison labor to produce component parts, to manufacture items that we \nare currently importing, to produce things without glutting local \nmarkets and driving down prices.\n  We ought to have a goal of putting prisoners to work 10 hours a day, \n6 days a week, with a goal of having them fund at least half of their \ncost of incarceration. That is what we ought to be debating. In fact, 2 \nyears ago, we did debate it when I, as chairman of the subcommittee \nwith jurisdiction over the appropriations for prisons, tried to make \nthat change. And yet the same special interest groups, labor unions, \nand manufacturers, who today want to kill the last vestige of prison \nlabor, said, ``no,'' let the average taxpayer spend $200 a year keeping \npeople in prison but don't let the inmates work and produce anything of \nvalue and sell it.\n  I think this is a ridiculous position to be in. I think it hurts our \ncriminal\n\n[[Page S7168]]\n\njustice system. I think it increases recidivism, where people get out \nof prison and they don't have the discipline of having worked, they \ndon't have any skills, and they go out and recommit crimes.\n  So, what the Levin amendment would do is say let's stop prison labor \nso there is then nothing left of a system that once had virtually every \nperson in prison working. I think this is a bad amendment. I have \noffered a second-degree amendment to get the facts, and I reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). Who yields time? The Senator from \nMichigan has 5 minutes 8 seconds.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the 5 minutes 8 seconds to my dear colleague.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. May I ask how much time is left on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has exactly 1 minute \nremaining.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I want to be very explicit about both my \nposition on the issue of prisoners working as well as what the intent \nof this amendment is that I am a cosponsor of. First of all, I believe \nprisoners should work. I am not for a no work policy. I support many of \nthe ideas that are embraced by the Senator from Texas in his previous \nefforts to expand the type of work that prisoners do.\n  Second, this amendment is not a prisoners-don't-work amendment. The \nonly conditions where prisoners stop working would be if the Federal \nPrison Industries are operating at an uncompetitively high level of \nprice for the products that they produce. If that is true, then what it \nmeans is that the taxpayers are subsidizing the work of the Federal \nPrison Industries by allowing that operation to basically function at \nan above-market cost.\n  If that is true, then the Senator from Texas should be on our side \nwith respect to this amendment because it would mean that not only are \nthe taxpayers paying for the costs of running prisons and the \nincarceration, it would mean they are also paying extra for these \nproducts that are manufactured in the prisons. They are paying both \nthrough the front door and through the back door. If our goal here is \nto not have the taxpayers continue to subsidize at such a significant \nlevel the efforts and activities of those in prison, it would seem to \nme the direction we are seeking to move makes a lot of sense because it \nwill drive down the cost to the taxpayers of the goods and services \nproduced by the Federal Prison Industries or by others who would \ncompete with them. In fact, if we are going to go ahead and subsidize \nthe work done in the prisons, at least we ought to take a step of \nsubsidizing work that doesn't compete with that performed already by \npeople in the private sector in this country.\n  All we are asking for with this amendment is a level playing field to \nallow manufacturers to compete with the Federal Prison Industries for \nGovernment contracts. I think it would be incongruous for us to go in a \ndirection in which we would continue to subsidize, through taxpayer \nmoneys, products that are overpriced. It just does not make sense. We \ntalk here all the time about trying to save money. This is one way that \nwe would, I think, generate the kind of lower cost of Government that \nwe all profess to support.\n  My point is very simple. I am not opposed to the broad concepts that \nthe Senator from Texas has outlined. I am very comfortable with them. I \nthink prisoners should work. I think we should find ways to make the \nindustries in the prisons focus on areas that do not compete with the \nprivate sector in our States. But what really is very hard for me to \nexplain to my constituents is why they should send their tax dollars to \nWashington to then be spent in support of the Federal Prison Industries \nto buy the goods and the services of the prison industries, to then put \nthem out of jobs. That seems to me to be the least sensible course for \nus to take.\n  So I strongly support this amendment. I have no trouble with the \nnotion of getting more facts, but I think that really is just an effort \nto delay this.\n  I think we may have another speaker here, so I am going to yield the \nfloor. I appreciate the efforts of those who are pressing for the Levin \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Senator Kempthorne has the remainder of our \ntime. How much is that?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho will have 1 minute 20 \nseconds.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I listened to the very good remarks of \nthe Senator from Texas and I agree wholeheartedly with the Senator from \nTexas when he says we ought to open up Prison Industries to further \nopportunities. I will join the Senator from Texas in seeking every \nopportunity to do that, because prisoners should be working.\n  These prisoners that he referenced should not be sitting in the air-\nconditioned cells watching color TV all day with three square meals and \neverything else given to them while they are giving nothing back as far \nas contributing to society. So we should have these opportunities.\n  But the key word that is left out is competition. They ought to do it \ncompetitively. There is no reason in the world why we should have these \njobs being done in the prisons and the product produced that then has \nto be subsidized. I think we have the intelligence within our prison \nmanagement that we can have them produce that product but it can still \nbe competitive in the marketplace. I know that is something the Senator \nfrom Texas understands, is good competition.\n  So I support the amendment offered by Senators Levin and Abraham, and \nwill support them, but will also look for those opportunities with the \nSenator from Texas to find ways of expanding Prison Industries so we \ncan have more jobs among prisoners.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time under the control of the Senator from \nMichigan has expired. The Senator from Texas has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me first say I appreciate our colleague \nfrom Idaho. I don't doubt what he says is true. But as a person who has \nnow fought for 13 years to change laws that prohibit prison labor, let \nme assure you that special interest groups in America are not about to \nlet that happen. What we are about to do here in the name of good \ngovernment is to end what little prison labor we have left.\n  It is true that it is inefficient to work prisoners. It is also true \nthat we pay them virtually nothing. But with the money they get by \nworking, they are able to pay restitution to victims, we are able to \nrecoup some of our costs, and the bottom line is, whether we like it or \nwe don't like it, we have 1,100,000 people in prison who basically have \nnothing to do because we have made it illegal for them to work. What \nthis amendment is going to do is destroy the last Federal system where \nwe are able to work prisoners in America. We hear all these horror \nstories, but the plain truth is the law requires that prisons do this \ncompetitively. We have a system where you can ask for waivers if you \ndon't want to buy from prisons, and 92 percent of those waivers are \ngranted.\n  What we are seeing here is not any protest from the Defense \nDepartment. We are seeing those who want to end this system so that \nthey can expand their businesses. Those are good and noble objectives, \nbut we want to work prisoners and we want to have restitution to people \nwho are victims of crime. So I urge my colleagues to vote down this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on this amendment.\n  Under the previous unanimous consent agreement, the amendment will be \ntemporarily set aside. The Senator from California, Senator Boxer, will \nbe recognized to offer an amendment regarding the effect of executive \ncompensation. The time is 1 hour 20 minutes equally divided in the \nusual form.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if the Senator from California will yield for a \nunanimous-consent request?\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Michael \nFranken, a legislative fellow in Senator Kennedy's office, be granted \nthe privilege of the floor during the remainder of the consideration of \nthe defense authorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S7169]]\n\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, if the Senator will withhold, I then \nask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak for up to 4 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 644\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I would just like to draw attention to \nsomething I think is very significant that happened last night among \nthis body. That is, by a voice vote this Senate of the United States \nhas continued to correct something in history that should have been \ncorrected long ago.\n  As you know, in January of this year, seven Americans were recognized \nfor their heroic efforts in World War II, but it had been 50 years \nbefore the Government acknowledged those heroic deeds and 50 years for \nthose individuals to have to wait until they were given the \nCongressional Medal of Honor.\n  Senator Craig and I attended the White House ceremony in January of \nthis year, where the names of those seven were announced. I say the \nnames because they were not all there. In fact, the only living \nindividual that was there was Vernon Baker, of St. Maries, ID, who was \na lieutenant at the time in World War II.\n  The effort that we undertook yesterday, which was significant and \nwhich is cosponsored by Senators Craig, Torricelli, Thomas, and Enzi, \nprovides Lt. Vernon Baker and the surviving spouse and/or children of \nS. Sgt. Edward A. Carter, Jr. and Maj. Charles L. Thomas with the \nfinancial benefits normally given to recipients of the Congressional \nMedal of Honor. The other Medal of Honor recipients, S. Sgt. Ruben \nRivers, 1st Lt. John R. Fox, Pfc. Willy F. James, Jr., and Pvt. George \nWatson were all killed in action performing acts of heroism and had no \nsurviving family members.\n  All seven of these Americans, these seven who for 50 years the \nGovernment did not acknowledge their heroic acts by bestowing upon them \nthe Congressional Medal of Honor, were African-Americans. No African-\nAmerican had received the Congressional Medal of Honor in World War II. \nThat has now been rectified; rightfully so.\n  At the ceremony, as they called the names of those individuals that \nhad been killed in action, I remember what effect it had upon me that \nthere was no living relative there to receive the award in their \nbehalf. Then I realized, for those who were killed in action, many were \nso young, teenagers--each performing that act where he sacrificed his \nlife--they didn't have time to be married and they certainly didn't \nhave time, therefore, to have a family, raise a family. They sacrificed \nnot only their own lives for their Nation, but they sacrificed the \npotential of a family for this Nation.\n  Mr. Vernon Baker is just a tremendous individual. To meet him is an \nhonor. He is one of the most genuine people you will ever meet. His \nactions on the mountains of Italy taking strategic positions, \nrepeatedly risking his life to save the lives of others, is really the \nessence of what this is all about. So, the amendment that we passed \nlast night again simply states that those individuals will receive the \nstipend that goes to Congressional Medal of Honor winners after they \nretire from the military service. The history of World War II was not \ncomplete, and it was not correct, until these heroes were rightfully \nhonored and the next step taken of providing them what they have earned \nthrough their bravery and the blood that they gave to this Nation.\n  That has now been corrected. History can now be complete and correct \nin this regard as to World War II.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, before the Senator from Idaho leaves, I \nwant to thank him for the leadership which he showed in bringing this \namendment to the floor. It was the right thing to do. It was a \nsensitive thing to do, and as chairman of our Personnel Subcommittee \nwhere he does such tremendous work on the Armed Services Committee, he \nhas shown these qualities in many, many ways before and will as long as \nhe is in the Senate.\n  I think we are all in his debt for bringing to our attention the fact \nthat these particular heroes had not been recognized in this way until \nlast night, and it was because of Senator Kempthorne's efforts that \nthat recognition so long deserved was finally given. I know I am \nspeaking for all the Members in this body in thanking him for that \nleadership.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank the Senator from Michigan for those kind \nremarks.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you. I was very pleased to yield to \nmy friend from Idaho, and I appreciate his remarks.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 636\n\n(Purpose: To amend title 10, United States Code, to make reimbursement \n   of contractors for costs of excessive amounts of compensation for \ncontractor personnel unallowable under Department of Defense contracts \n                          and other contracts)\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 636.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer], for herself, Mr. \n     Grassley, and Mr. Harkin, proposes an amendment numbered 636.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike out section 804, and insert in lieu thereof the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 804. REIMBURSEMENT FOR EXCESSIVE COMPENSATION OF DEFENSE \n                   CONTRACTOR PERSONNEL PROHIBITED.\n\n       (a) Excessive Compensation as Not Allowable as Contract \n     Costs.--Subsection (e)(1) of section 2324 of title 10, United \n     States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(P) Costs of compensation paid with respect to the \n     services of any one individual, to the extent that the total \n     amount of the compensation paid in a fiscal year exceeds the \n     rate of pay provided by law for the President.''.\n       (b) Definitions.--Subsection (l) of such section is amended \n     by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(4) The term `compensation', for a fiscal year, means the \n     total amount of wages, salary, bonuses and deferred \n     compensation for the fiscal year, whether paid, earned, or \n     otherwise accruing, as recorded in an employer's cost \n     accounting records for the fiscal year.\n       (b) Certain Compensation Not Allowable as Costs Under Non-\n     Defense Contracts.--(1) Subsection (e)(1) of section 306 of \n     the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 \n     (41 U.S.C. 256) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(P) Costs of compensation paid with respect to the \n     services of any one individual, to the extent that the total \n     amount of the compensation paid in a fiscal year exceeds the \n     rate of pay provided by law for the President.''.\n       (2) Such section is further amended by adding at the end \n     the following:\n       ``(m) Other Definitions.--In this section:\n       ``(1) The term `compensation', for a fiscal year, means the \n     total amount of wages, salary, bonuses and deferred \n     compensation for the fiscal year, whether paid, earned, or \n     otherwise accruing, as recorded in an employer's cost \n     accounting records for the fiscal year.\n       (c) Effective Date.--(1) The amendments made by this \n     section shall take effect on the date that is 90 days after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act and shall apply with \n     respect to payments that become due from the United States \n     after that date under covered contracts entered into before, \n     on, or after that date.\n       (2) In paragraph (1), the term ``covered contract'' has the \n     meaning given such term in section 2324(l) of title 10, \n     United States Code, and section 306(l) of the Federal \n     Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. \n     256(l)).\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am offering an amendment today, and I am \nvery proud it is coauthored by the two Senators from Iowa, Senator \nGrassley and Senator Harkin. This amendment, I think, is a good-\ngovernment amendment. It is, in many ways, a reform amendment, and it \nnot only applies to the Defense Department but it would apply \nGovernmentwide.\n  What we do is permanently cap taxpayer-funded compensation, in other \nwords, taxpayers' funds that go to pay the salaries of contractors, at \nthe same amount as the salary of the President of the United States.\n  I want to repeat that. Right now, because of loopholes in past \namendments we have brought before the Senate, executives and companies \nwho contract with this Government have no limit on\n\n[[Page S7170]]\n\nwhat they can get from the Government. So taxpayers are funding \nsalaries of $500,000 a year, $800,000 a year, $1 million a year. As a \nmatter of fact, we have one report of one company which spread around \n$33 million in compensation to its executives.\n  This amendment will ensure that taxpayers are no longer forced to \nfoot the bill for exorbitant salaries of contractor executives.\n  It is important to understand what the bill does not do. Our \namendment does not limit the salaries of contractor executives. It only \nlimits the taxpayer portion of their salaries. So if there is a \ncontractor executive, whether it is defense or anywhere else in the \nFederal Government, who is contracting with the Federal Government, we \nare saying in 1 year, the maximum pay they can get from Federal \ntaxpayers is equal to that pay of the President of the United States, \nor $200,000. But if they have business from the private sector and they \nwant to pay their executive any level, that is fine with us. We are \njust saying no more than $200,000 a year for a contractor executive.\n  Our amendment has been endorsed by Taxpayers for Common Sense, and \ntoday I placed a letter on the desks of Senators. I want to read from \nit.\n  The letter goes to all Senators, and it says:\n\n       Support the Boxer-Grassley-Harkin amendment. Taxpayers for \n     Common Sense supports the Boxer-Grassley-Harkin amendment to \n     the DOD authorization bill to limit taxpayer reimbursement \n     for defense contractors executive compensation. Passage of \n     this amendment would provide a consistent and uniform \n     standard to defense contractors on executive compensation. \n     Since Fiscal Year '95, the issue of executive pay has seen \n     much legislative action. In '95, Congress limited the \n     reimbursable compensation on some contracts. The DOD \n     Appropriations Act of Fiscal Year '96 limited some \n     compensation but only for the final third of the fiscal year.\n\n  And so what they say to us in this letter is that the GAO report \nrevealed that one contractor paid its top executives more than $33 \nmillion in compensation over the $250,000 limit because there were \nloopholes within the legislation.\n\n       Taxpayers for Common Sense urges all Members of the Senate \n     to support the Boxer-Grassley-Harkin amendment to limit this \n     compensation. It is a step toward fiscal responsibility.\n\n  Mr. President, we certainly know that one of our proudest \naccomplishments as a Congress is bringing down this Federal deficit, \nand we do it in many ways. One of the ways we have done it, frankly, is \nthat we have been pretty tough on Federal pay. We have wonderful men \nand women working for the Federal Government, and many of them, doing \nthe work of private sector executives and private sector workers, get \nmuch less. They love their jobs, they work hard, and they have had to \nmake some sacrifices. But somehow, it seems to me, we ought to ask \nthose who contract with the Federal Government to make a little \nsacrifice. Frankly, I don't think it is bad to get the same pay as the \nPresident of the United States. I think that is pretty good pay, and \nthat is what the Boxer-Grassley-Harkin amendment does.\n  So Congress has, in fact, scrutinized this issue before. We have been \noutraged about it before, but we haven't resolved this problem. We keep \npassing limited caps, and they are not working. We took them as first \ngood steps, but they were sporadic. We suspected their effectiveness \nwould be very limited, and the GAO report confirmed our worst fears.\n\n  We already talked about one major contractor who paid its top \nexecutives more than $33 million over the then $250,000 limit. The GAO \nconcluded that that particular billing was allowable because the 1995 \ncap had so many loopholes. In fact, less than 1 percent of all \ncontracts were covered by the 1995 caps. It seems to me, as we look \nback on what we did, it sounded good, but it didn't work, and we tried \nto control executive pay for these contractors, but we didn't succeed. \nWe believe that the Boxer-Grassley-Harkin amendment will close that \nloophole very, very clearly, and that is why we received support from \nTaxpayers for Common Sense. We need a clear and consistent uniform \nstandard on executive compensation, and that is exactly what our \namendment would do.\n  I commend the Senate Armed Services Committee for its good-faith \neffort to address this issue in the DOD authorization bill. The \ncommittee acknowledged that the current system doesn't work, and it \nwisely rejected an administration compensation proposal that would \ncontinue to permit millions of dollars for executive pay. However, I \nsuggest that the committee's approach, while moving in the right \ndirection, doesn't go far enough.\n  The committee proposal would limit reimbursable compensation to the \nmedium level of pay for all senior executives at large public \ncompanies. I don't think we should tie the pay of executives who get \npaid by taxpayers to the pay of executives who get paid in the private \nsector. Where is the common sense on that? I think we are going to hear \narguments such as, ``Well, these Federal contractors are not Federal \nemployees; after all, they could go to a private sector company.'' \nFine, so could Federal employees. That is no argument. This is about \ntaxpayer money, Mr. President. This is about fiscal discipline. This is \nabout trying to balance the budget and not doing it on the backs of \njust one group of people. This isn't right. The sacrifices have to be \nshared.\n  So the committee proposal sets what they call reasonable executive \ncompensation through a formula based on the salaries of other wealthy \nprivate sector executives. I just think that is a faulty approach, and \nit is business as usual.\n  It makes more sense to use public sector salaries, Federal Government \nsalaries to set the compensation from taxpayers. After all, for their \nwork on Government projects, contractors become, in effect, Government \nemployees, and I can't imagine how we could rationalize paying them \nmore than the President of the United States.\n  A second problem with the committee proposal is that it is limited to \nthe five highest ranking executives of each contractor. First, it has a \nlevel of pay that is way more--way more--than the President of the \nUnited States and, second, it places no limits on the other senior \nexecutives, just five in each contractor. So there are ways to get \naround it.\n  Under the committee bill, a high ranking executive could continue to \nbill multimillion-dollar salaries and bonuses to the taxpayer if he or \nshe was not named as one of the five most senior at the company. You \ncan see that game being played.\n  Our amendment is simple, it is clear. It says in one fiscal year, \ntaxpayers can't pay a salary higher to the contractor than it pays to \nthe President of the United States. I think that is a pretty good \nlinkage for these contractors to be hooked to the salary of the \nPresident of the United States.\n  Again, we don't limit the total an executive can make, only the total \nthey can make from taxpayers. If there are two sides to their business \nand they are working for taxpayers and they have other projects, they \ncan get paid whatever the company decides to pay them, but not the \nportion from the taxpayers.\n  I am very proud to be working with my friend, Senator Grassley. When \nI was in the House and he came over to the Senate, he and I teamed up \non many occasions on procurement reform. We worked together on spare \nparts that were costing a fortune, those days of the $7,000 coffee pots \nand the $400 hammers and the $600 toilet seats. We worked very hard on \nthose issues. We worked very hard to stamp out taxpayer fraud.\n\n  So it is just with great joy that I work with him, again, on this. I \nthink it is a good, solid amendment. We are proud of the support we are \ngetting. I yield as much time as he might consume to my friend, the \nSenator from Iowa [Senator Grassley].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank you very much. I ask if the Presiding Officer \nwould remind me when I have used 20 minutes so I don't use too much \ntime.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a member of \nmy staff, Mr. Charles H. Murphy, be granted privilege of the floor \nduring consideration of this defense authorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor this amendment \nwith my friend from California, Senator Boxer. Over the years, as she \nhas\n\n[[Page S7171]]\n\nalready indicated, we have worked together as a watchdog of the \nPentagon, and being a watchdog of that agency is not an easy job. \nWhether Republicans or Democrats are running this place, it is always \ntough when we tangle with the Pentagon. It is not a very popular thing \nto do.\n  Senator Boxer has always been a reliable person to fight to get the \nmost bang for the taxpayers' dollars in defense. And I compliment her \non that.\n\n  In today's political environment, reliable defense reform allies are \nhard to come by. They are somewhat of an endangered species today \ncompared to 10 years ago. Organizations like the Center for Strategic \nand Budget Assessments used to support our cause. Not anymore. That \norganization is now bankrolled by the industry and by the Defense \nDepartment itself. So we are kind of teaming up with less outside \nsupport than we have had in the past. But we still have the same \nchallenges to meet, and we are going to meet those.\n  So I am happy to once again team up with Senator Boxer, this time on \na specific provision, very targeted, very easy to understand, but one \nthat is very important that we accomplish. That is the executive \ncompensation issue. We worked together on this in years past. And I am \nglad to do it. We have also my colleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin, as \na cosponsor. I am glad to have him on board as well. So this is very \nmuch a team effort.\n  Mr. President, there are four separate executive compensation caps in \nlaw today.\n  I have a table that provides details on each of these caps.\n  I ask unanimous consent that that be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 RELEVANT DOD COMPENSATION CAPS PROVIDED IN LAW                                 \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Fiscal                                                                                                        \n   year               Act               Cap        type contract         Compensation       FAR/DFARS reference \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1995......

The Armed Services Committee is trying very hard in \nthis legislation to blow the lid right off the caps with section 804 of \nthe bill. The committee wants to reach deeper into the taxpayers' \npockets by doing this. I do not understand why, and I want to know why. \nWhat is the basis for the decision? I know during this debate we are \ngoing to find that out. I know sincere people on the other side of the \naisle are going to tell us the justification for it, but I want to tell \nmy colleagues why I think the legislation is wrong.\n  Because before we give executives a pay raise, we should know how \nmuch public money they get in the first place. That is where this \ndebate should begin. That is taking us right back to square one. We \ncannot figure out where we need to go until we know where we are. And \nwe do not know where we are on this subject of executive pay.\n  The committee made the decision to lift the caps and, I think, \nwithout the facts. The committee needs to answer a key question. How \nmuch is the Department of Defense paying industry executives today? The \ncommittee does not have the answer to that question.\n  Back in January, Senator Boxer and I tried to get that answer. We \nasked the General Accounting Office to answer three questions. How much \nis the Pentagon paying the top 50 industry executives today? How well \nare the caps working?\n  I ask unanimous consent that our letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 28, 1997.\n     Mr. James F. Hinchman,\n     Acting Comptroller General, U.S. General Accounting Office, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Hinchman: We are writing to request specific \n     information on executive compensation provided under \n     Department of Defense (DOD) contracts.\n       On April 28, 1995, we asked the Inspector General, Ms. \n     Eleanor Hill, for specific information on payments to \n     Lockheed-Martin executives following the merger of these two \n     industry giants. We wanted to know exactly how much each \n     executive would get under the merger deal. Finally, on June \n     14, 1996, after repeated requests and the passage of over a \n     year's time, we received a partial but unsatisfactory \n     response to our question. It does not provide the specifics \n     we requested. A copy of her response is attached for your \n     information.\n       We have two concerns about Ms. Hill's response.\n       First, she reports that Lockheed Martin Corporation \n     maintains that individual compensation data is ``confidential \n     proprietary and management sensitive,'' and she agrees. We \n     agree that a company's internal pay structure should be \n     treated as sensitive, propriety information--if that is \n     company policy. However, when money is drawn from the U.S. \n     Treasury to pay certain industry executives, those payments \n     should not be drawn under that protective cover. A private \n     company should never be allowed to take public money \n     specifically earmarked for executive pay and stamp it \n     ``proprietary.'' If these individuals are on the public \n     payroll, then the citizens of this country have a right to \n     know how much of their tax money each one is receiving.\n       Second, we were also told that the $16.3 million paid to \n     the Martin Marietta executives was not salary. These are \n     retirement benefits. We were told that their salaries were \n     paid out of another ``DOD pool of money.'' How many pools of \n     money does DOD have for the corporate executives? We need to \n     know. We need a complete and accurate accounting that tells \n     us exactly how the department goes about paying these \n     executives all this money.\n       Toward that end, we ask that you tell us exactly how much \n     the department paid to the top 50 defense industry executives \n     during calendar year 1996.\n       For each executive, we ask for the full name, title and \n     employer, and the total compensation received from DOD, \n     including salary, bonuses, and other incentives and benefits, \n     from all sources. If commercial or foreign military sales \n     dollars are involved, those should also be reflected in the \n     requested totals.\n       An interim response is requested by March 1, 1997.\n       Your cooperation in this matter would be appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n     Charles E. Grassley,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Barbara Boxer,\n       U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We need the answers to these questions, and the answers \nare not easy to get. We got some answers in June, but not the answers \nthat we expected, Mr. President. The General Accounting Office reports \nthe caps are having ``no significant effect on limiting executive \ncompensation.''\n  The General Accounting Office did take a close look at one company, \nMcDonnell Douglas. The top executives at McDonnell Douglas got $33 \nmillion over and above the $250,000 cap that is in law. That is, of \ncourse, all from the U.S. Treasury and all for 1 year. Only $313,000 of \nthe McDonnell Douglas executive pay--that is less than 1 percent--was \nblocked or affected by the cap.\n  I ask unanimous consent that that General Accounting Office report be \nprinted in the Record so my colleagues can read it for themselves and \nnot just take my word for it.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                U.S. General Accounting Office\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 8, 1997.\n     Hon.

Tom Harkin,\n     U.S. Senate.\n\n     Subject: Impact of legislative compensation caps on DOD \n         contracts.\n\n       In response to your request, we have developed information \n     on the extent to which legislative caps have affected \n     executive compensation allowable under Department of Defense \n     (DOD) contracts. Specifically, we obtained compensation costs \n     from the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) for McDonnell \n     Douglas Corporation for 1995, the latest year of a completed \n     DCAA incurred cost audit. We also obtained from DCAA nine \n     other contractors' estimates of the impact of legislative \n     compensation caps on their companies. On June 3, 1997, we \n     briefed your staff on the results of our work. This report \n     summarizes the information provided at that briefing.\n\n[[Page S7172]]\n\n                               background\n\n       The Congress has placed various limitations on the amount \n     of compensation costs that may be allowed on defense \n     contracts.\n       The fiscal year 1995 DOD Appropriations Act (P.L. 103-335) \n     provided that ``After April 15, 1995, none of the funds \n     provided in this act may be obligated for payment on new \n     contracts on which allowable costs charged to the government \n     include payments for individual compensation at a rate in \n     excess of $250,000 per year.''\n       The fiscal year 1996 DOD Appropriations Act (P.L. 104-61) \n     provided that, ``None of the funds provided in this Act may \n     be obligated for payment on new contracts on which allowable \n     costs charged to the government include payments for \n     individual compensation at a rate in excess of $200,000 per \n     year after July 1, 1996 . . . ''\n       The fiscal year 1997 DOD Appropriations Act (P.L. 104-208) \n     provided that, ``None of the funds provided in this Act may \n     be obligated for payment on new contracts on which allowable \n     costs charged to the government include payments for \n     individual compensation at a rate in excess of $250,000 per \n     year.'' \\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ A statutory compensation limitation was also imposed by \n     the Fiscal Year 1997 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. \n     104-201) on both DOD and civilian government agencies, but \n     this limitation affected fewer executives than that imposed \n     by the Fiscal Year 1997 DOD Appropriations Act.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                            RESULTS IN BRIEF\n\n       The information we collected on McDonnell Douglas \n     Corporation and nine other contractors indicated that the \n     compensation cap imposed on DOD contractors for fiscal year \n     1995, had no significant effect on limiting executive \n     compensation charged to defense contracts for 1995. For \n     McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which had about $33.7 million \n     in executive compensation in excess of $250,000, only about \n     $313,000, or less than 1 percent, is estimated to be limited \n     by the fiscal year 1995 compensation cap. Estimates by the \n     nine other defense contractors of excess compensation costs \n     subject to the fiscal year 1995 compensation cap range from \n     0.14 to 3 percent. The limited impact of the legislative \n     compensation cap was primarily due to the short period the \n     cap was in effect during 1995 (5\\1/2\\ months) and the small \n     amount of costs associated with new contracts entered into \n     during this period using fiscal year 1995 appropriations.\n       For some of the same reasons, the amount of executive \n     compensation charged to defense contracts in fiscal year 1996 \n     will not be significantly affected, although the amount \n     determined to be unallowable will increase because both the \n     fiscal year 1995 and 1996 limitations were in effect. \n     McDonnell Douglas Corporation estimates that only about 3 \n     percent of 1996 executive compensation in excess of the cap \n     will be subject to the fiscal year 1995 and 1996 compensation \n     caps. Aggregated data on the effect of the 1997 cap was not \n     available at the time of our review. Enclosure I contains \n     more information on our findings.\n\n\n                   AGENCY COMMENTS AND OUR EVALUATION\n\n       DOD provided written comments on a draft of this report. \n     DOD took no exception to the information provided in the \n     report regarding the allowable cost impact of the statutory \n     compensation caps. However, it commented on the substantial \n     administrative burden imposed on both DOD personnel and \n     defense contractors by the inconsistencies between the four \n     different compensation caps enacted by the Congress over the \n     past 3 years.\n       The nature and extent of the administrative burden was not \n     the focus of our review. However, DOD identifies a pertinent \n     issue. Generally speaking, it seems reasonable that more \n     consistent treatment of compensation caps could ease \n     implementation problems. DOD's comments are provided in \n     enclosure II.\n       We are providing copies of this correspondence to the \n     Secretary of Defense, the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget, and other appropriate congressional \n     committees and members. We will also make copies available to \n     others on request.\n       Please contact me at (202) 512-4587 if you or your staff \n     have any questions concerning this briefing report.

14,860,045    13,610,045    9,273,382\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. One of the General Accounting Office tables shows how \nmuch the Department of Defense paid the top executives at McDonnell \nDouglas. The Department of Defense paid them a total of $9,273,382. The \ntop executive got $2,713,308. And I have the chart here so that you can \nsee that the cap is $250,000. We have the executive that I just \nreferred to as executive No. 1, because obviously we are not here to \nembarrass anybody. It is proprietary information. The name does not \nmatter, but the point is, executive No. 1 got paid $2.7 million; \nexecutive No. 2 got paid $2,646,773; the third executive got paid \n$2,046,481; and the fourth executive got paid $1,833,604--all when \nthere is a cap of $250,000.\n  So that cap was designed to limit the size of the Department of \nDefense paycheck that was sent to McDonnell Douglas for executive pay, \nand yet we find the cap did not work.\n  Now, every citizen would like to get a paycheck like this from Uncle \nSam. This chart shows so obviously I do not even need to say it that \nthe existing caps are not working very well.\n  In fact, you would have to say they are leaking like a sieve. They \nare riddled with loopholes the size you can drive a Mack truck through. \nMaybe they were not meant to be that way. Maybe this was just a big \ngame that somebody is playing with the taxpayers. But we should not be \nplaying these games. And if these caps are not going to work, they \nshould not be in the law. That is what the committee would rather have. \nI say they ought to be in the law, and I say they ought to work. If the \ncaps are being busted with regularity, we are here to fix them, and \nthat is what the Boxer-Grassley-Harkin amendment is all about.\n  Is the problem unique with McDonnell Douglas or are the caps leaking \neverywhere? We do not know. The Department of Defense does not know. \nThe committee does not know. And, of course, to the taxpayers of this \ncountry, that is just not acceptable. It happens to be the same old \nstory. The Department of Defense is paying bills for services rendered, \nbut it does not know what the services cost.\n  How could the Department of Defense watchdog the caps if it does not \nknow what each executive gets? There are a lot of questions, and there \nare no answers.\n  Mr. President, the Department of Defense has a responsibility to the \ntaxpayers to answer four questions that I am going to bring out. First, \nhow much does it pay out each year for executive compensation? \nSecondly, how many executives receive those payments? What are their \nnames? And how much does each one get?\n  I asked the Department of Defense these questions on June 20, 1997. \nThe Department of Defense response came back 4 days later, June 21 of \nthis year. And guess what the answer is? The Department of Defense does \nnot collect that kind of information. The Department of Defense does \nnot have it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record those letters.\n\n[[Page S7173]]\n\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 20, 1997.\n     Mr. Lawrence P.

What is the \n     total estimated annual cost of those payments? How many \n     executives would be covered by such payments? How many \n     companies would receive those payments? Is this information \n     readily available, or is it very difficult to obtain? If so, \n     why? A ballpark estimate will be acceptable--if that's the \n     best you can do on short notice.\n       A response to these questions is requested by June 24, \n     1997.\n       Your cooperation in this matter would be appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles E.

Charles E. Grassley,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Grassley: In your June 20, 1997 letter to me \n     you asked the following questions:\n       How much does the Department of Defense (DoD) pay out each \n     year to the defense industry to cover the costs of executive \n     compensation?\n       What is the total estimated annual cost of those payments?\n       How many executives are covered by such payments?\n       How many companies receive those payments?\n       Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) does not accumulate \n     statistics on the overall compensation paid to DoD contractor \n     executives or on any other individual element of overhead \n     because such statistics are unnecessary to determine cost \n     allowability under the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). \n     The FAR specifies that certain types of compensation costs \n     are expressly unallowable; e.g., stock options, stock \n     appreciation rights, and golden parachutes. These unallowable \n     types of compensation are never paid by DoD and are not \n     considered in judging reasonableness of compensation levels. \n     The FAR criteria for evaluating reasonableness of executive \n     compensation follows:\n       ``Among others, factors which may be relevant include \n     general conformity with the compensation practices of other \n     firms of the same size, the compensation practices of other \n     firms in the same industry, the compensation practices of \n     firms in the same geographic area, the compensation practices \n     of firms engaged in predominantly non-Government work, and \n     the cost of comparable services obtainable from outside \n     sources. The appropriate factors for evaluating the \n     reasonableness of compensation depend on the degree to which \n     those factors are representative of the labor market for the \n     job being evaluated. The relative significance of factors \n     will vary according to circumstances.'' (Emphasis added.)\n       Since the determination of the reasonableness of \n     compensation costs requires a case-by-case assessment of many \n     factors, it would serve no useful purpose to routinely gather \n     DoD-wide data. Accumulating DoD-wide statistics would be \n     time-consuming and expensive because the precise dollar \n     reimbursement for each contractor is dependent upon many \n     company specific factors including:\n       The percentage of government business at each contractor \n     segment.\n       The mix of contract types (fixed price, cost-type, flexibly \n     priced) at each segment.\n       The status of contracts (e.g., salaries allocated to \n     contracts which have costs exceeding a ceiling price would \n     not be reimbursed).\n       The varying number of personnel that might be considered \n     ``executives'' by each contractor.\n       The value of contracts subject to the compensation caps \n     included in recent DoD Appropriation and Authorization Acts.\n       Another key reason for not routinely gathering DoD-wide \n     compensation data is the FAR specifically requires comparison \n     of compensation levels of firms engaged in predominately non-\n     government work. DCAA uses commercial compensation surveys \n     that include companies engaged in non-government work. \n     Attached are letters to Dr. Steven Kelman, Administrator, \n     Office of Federal Procurement Policy and Mr. Peter Levine, \n     Counsel, Senate Armed Services Committee, that show various \n     average and median executive compensation levels based on a \n     commercial survey.\n       In sum, the routine gathering of DoD-wide compensation \n     statistics would be costly and not add value to the audit \n     process. Because we do not gather this data, we are unable to \n     answer your questions on such short notice. If you or your \n     staff have any additional questions, please call me at (703) \n     767-3280.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                        Lawrence P. Uhlfelder,\n\n                                               Assistant Director,\n                                                 Policy and Plans.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, maybe the Department of Defense does not \nwant to know the answer. The size of those paychecks might be \nembarrassing to the Department. Then again, maybe the Department of \nDefense does know. I suspect that they do know. I think there is a \nsecret list hidden in someone's safe over at the Pentagon somewhere \nwith this information.\n  I have an audit report that tells me that the Department of Defense \nmay know. This is a Defense Contracting Audit Agency report entitled \n``Audit of Corporate Offices, Overhead Expenses 1995.'' Here it is. It \nis dated March 31 of this year.\n  Now, Mr. President, I would like to place this report in the Record, \nbut I have been warned that it may contain proprietary company \ninformation so I am not going to do that. It tells me exactly who is on \nthe Department of Defense payroll at McDonnell Douglas and how much \neach person gets.\n  There must be reports like this on other companies as well. Taken \ntogether, all these reports would give us the information that we need. \nThese executives are on the public payroll. They take public money. The \npublic should know who they are and how much they get. A company has no \nright to take public money earmarked for executive pay and stamp it \n``proprietary and confidential.''\n  Strictly, that is Pentagon baloney. That is something that if \nsomebody here on the Senate floor tries to justify, then it becomes \nSenate baloney as far as I am concerned. The Congress has the \nresponsibility to obtain that information.\n  There are two ways to get it. We could put a provision in the bill. \nIt would call for a one-time report.\n  I have an amendment, No. 603, that would get that information we \nneed, or the committee, hopefully, is interested in this information, \nletting the Sun shine in. Where the Sun shines in on Government \nbusiness, there is never going to be any mold, Mr. President. As an \noversight responsibility for the taxpayers, I hope that the committee \nwould be interested in requesting that information, not by my \namendment, but simply a letter sent to the Department of Defense to get \nthat information. I would hope that the committee would be willing to \nsend such a letter. Then the committee would hopefully be willing to \nshare this information to the taxpayers of this country.\n  I do not think that we should lift that cap without this information. \nThe bill lifts that cap. If the caps are not working, then we should \nplug the leaks. And, of course, the Grassley-Boxer-Harkin legislation \nplugs those leaks so that you do not have a situation like this, a cap \nat $250,000 meant to restrict pay, but you have one executive with $2.7 \nmillion, a second executive with $2.6 million, a third executive with \n$2.0 million, and a fourth executive with $1.8 million.\n  So I think we have made a case, first of all, that what we have done \nhas not worked. What we are going to do now should work. And the Boxer-\nGrassley amendment does that.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the balance of the time for our side.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I am controlling the time for the \nmajority on this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Let me just say first in response to the Senator from Iowa's comments \nabout the compensation levels of certain executives, No. 1, the \nGrassley previous amendment only applied to cost-type contracts; it did \nnot apply to fixed-price contracts. When you negotiate a contract and \nsay, here is the price we are going to pay you, it is a fixed price, \nand you produce the product for this price, we do not really care who \nyou pay or how much you pay, just as long as you give us the product at \nthis price. So they can pay their executives anything out of that as \nlong as they deliver the product as per the price.\n  Also these companies that have been listed by the Senator from Iowa, \nmany have very large and substantial commercial entities who are not \nlimited at\n\n[[Page S7174]]\n\nall to what they pay their executives on that. So to suggest that there \nis some error here, some problem here, I just do not think is accurate. \nI think it is accurate to suggest that this approach does not work and \nis wrong, and I will go through as to why I believe it is. But to \nsuggest that there is something funny going on here, I think is simply \nnot accurate.\n  Let me first start by saying what the Subcommittee on Acquisition and \nTechnology did when it was presented with this issue. Last year, in the \nauthorization bill, we requested the administration to come up with a \nsuggestion on how to deal with this issue because the Congress every \nyear seems to deal with this issue of setting levels of caps on \ncompensation for, quote, ``executives.''\n  The administration came back with a suggestion. The suggestion had \nfour parts. No. 1 was to limit the reimbursement of senior executive \nsalaries to the median salary of executives in companies of similar \nsize. Now, what does that mean? They take the large corporations and \nthey figure out--they take the median salary of the large corporations, \nthen the medium size and the small, and they have different \ncompensation levels. The problem with that is that the committee saw \nthat for some corporations, the large ones, the average median \ncompensation was $4 million. To set a cost cap at $4 million does not \nappear to be much of a cost cap, even to this Member who does not \nparticularly agree with the Senator from Iowa on compensation levels.\n  So we decided to go back and relook at that. They did do some things \nthat we adopted. No. 1, they defined executive compensation, which had \nnot been done before, and we have adopted that definition in the \ncommittee's mark. I believe the Grassley-Boxer or Boxer-Grassley \namendment adopted that definition of compensation. So on that we agree.\n\n  We also disagree on the people that it should apply to. The \nadministration has suggested just the top five most highly paid \nexecutives of the contractors should be limited here. The Boxer-\nGrassley amendment covers everybody. I will explain later why I think \nthat is a problem.\n  Senator Lieberman and I, the ranking member on the subcommittee, \nworked on what we thought was a compromise, something that was workable \nand took care of the concerns that I will enumerate in a few minutes. \nThe compromise was to take the median salary of all companies who have \nsales over $50 million. So if you have sales over $50 million and you \ntake the median salary from those executives, we came with a figure of \n$340,000. So $340,000 would be the cap under ours. Now the \nadministration opposes this cap. The administration believes this is \ntoo low. Now, what Senator Boxer and Senator Grassley are suggesting is \neven going below what the administration believes is too low. But we \nbelieve this is a reasonable level to go.\n  Now, why? Let me just explain what I believe is sort of the reality \nof what this amendment is. This is a huge antismall business amendment. \nWhy? As you saw from Senator Grassley's chart, the big corporations do \nnot have any problem paying their executives, particularly ones that \nare diversified, because they have price-type contracts, they have \ncommercial business, so they can pay their executives from a variety of \nsources. The folks that really get nailed by this are the small \nbusinesses who do primarily defense work. They are the ones whose \ncompensation is effectively capped at the level we set here.\n  You say, what is the big deal? The big deal is these small businesses \nare in a very competitive industry and, yes, they are competing for \nhigh-priced talent, not just in managerial, and we limit it to \nmanagerial, the top five executives--but they compete even more \nfervently. Remember, what are we moving to in the Defense Department? \nWe want high technology. We are drawing down our defense. We hope to be \ninvesting more and more into high technology. We want our vendors to be \nmore efficient, more high technology.\n  I will read from the Information Technology Association, what they \nsuggest this amendment will do to, I believe, small contractors in \nparticular, and I will quote from a July 2 letter from the Information \nTechnology Association of America to the Chairman, Strom Thurmond.\n\n       It will limit the government's ability to contract for \n     personnel with specialty technology skills. A recently \n     completed Information Technology Association of America study \n     found that there are approximately 190,000 unfilled \n     technology positions nationwide, with almost 20,000 unfilled \n     positions just in the Washington metropolitan area. The \n     shortage is even more acute for people with cutting edge \n     skills who command far more than $200,000 in wage and \n     benefits in the marketplace.\n\n  What I am suggesting here that this amendment will do is it will not \nhurt McDonnell Douglas, it will not hurt Boeing, it will hurt the local \norganization in your community, the small business who is competing for \ndefense contracting work, trying to get the best technology available, \nthe highly skilled people who are in very competitive prices, and they \nwill not be able to employ them. They will not be able to keep them. I \nam surprised some of the big businesses do not love this, that they are \nnot supporting the Grassley-Boxer amendment. This is a boon to big \nbusiness because it lets them cherry pick all these skilled people to \nemploy them at their business because the small contractors simply \ncannot do it under this amendment.\n  Now we improve things a little bit. We allow them to go up to \n$340,000. You hear $200,000 is the salary of the President. Well, \n$200,000 is about one-quarter what a shortstop hitting .190 for the \nBaltimore Orioles makes. If we are going to compare worth here, who is \nmore important to the future of our country--someone who will redesign \nthe air traffic control system in this country to make it safer and use \nthe high technology and the skills they have, or someone hitting .190 \nfor the Pirates? I think the answer is pretty clear. But on this floor, \nthey are saying that guy hitting .190, we can pay him anything we want, \nbut the guy who has high technology skills, the guy who has the skills \nthat can add to the national security of this country, we cannot have. \nThey will go off to Hollywood and make movies. That is where they go. \nThey go to Hollywood and they make action pictures instead of \nredesigning systems to make our Nation more secure for the future.\n  This is an unwise piece of legislation. This really does strike at \nthe core of what the future is for our country. I will be honest. I \nfrankly do not care if the CEO's of some companies do not make a lot of \nmoney. What I do care about is that we have the scientific expertise \nemployed in the defense industry to move our country forward, to stay \nahead. This amendment will hurt national security. This amendment will \nlimit our ability to get the best and the brightest into the defense \nindustry and keep them there, particularly for the small \nentrepreneurial companies and the small companies that get involved in \nthe defense industry. So this hurts national security. It devastates \nsmall business' ability to compete. Just for those two reasons alone we \nshould be against this amendment.\n\n  I hope we do not get blinded by what appears to be populist. It looks \npopulist to say we should only pay certain people who get paid from the \nGovernment a certain amount of money, except for the fact that when you \ndo that, you lose good people and you hurt small business, both of \nwhich are vital to the national security of this country.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it was interesting to see the Senator from \nPennsylvania get very emotional about the fact that we would--Senator \nGrassley and I and Senator Harkin--limit the taxpayer payments to \nindividual executives who are Federal contractors to the pay of the \nPresident of the United States.\n  First of all, I am not sure he understands our amendment. We only \nlimit the taxpayer portion of their pay. If they work in the private \nsector, that is up to the shareholders to determine, No. 1.\n  No. 2, the Senator from Pennsylvania says, ``My God, if we cannot get \nthese executives into these defense firms, these high-paid executives, \nour national security is at stake. We better pay them more, much more \nthan the President of the United States.'' Let me just say, what about \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff? He is a Federal employee. I \ndo not hear people coming in here and recommending that\n\n[[Page S7175]]\n\nhis pay be raised. What about the person who is the head of the FAA? \nWhat about the air traffic controllers?\n  We have people in the Federal Government who risk life and limb, but \nwe are here today hearing the committee defend executives in fancy \noffices in big firms who contract with the Federal Government.\n  I ask the Senator from Iowa a question.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to yield on the time of the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I am happy to take it off my time.\n  Does your amendment limit the cap just to executives?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Executive pay.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Your amendment limits it just to executives?\n  Mrs. BOXER. It is any contractor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. It does not limit just to executives?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let me just say, since it is a $200,000 cap, it is hard \nto imagine line workers making that much, but it affects anyone who is \nworking for the Federal Government as a contractor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Again I ask the question, does it apply to people who \nare scientists, who, as the Information Technology Association of \nAmerica said, people with highly technical skills? Do they apply to \nthis cap?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Anyone who contracts with the Federal Government--let me \nfinish--would be limited----\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The answer is yes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Limited to receive in 1 year the amount that the \nPresident of the United States receives from taxpayers, but it could be \nunlimited if they have private sector work. We do not take on their \nentire pay. That is up to the shareholders of the company.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Is the Senator aware there are many businesses that \ncontract with defense and other Government agencies that do primarily, \nalmost exclusively, Government work? Are you aware that there are many \ncompanies involved that do that?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my colleague, I have visited companies all over \nCalifornia, many of whom do nearly 90 percent of their work with the \nFederal Government, but that is their option, just as it is the option \nof someone who works for the Federal Government to work for the private \nsector.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. You then accept the fact that by limiting the \ncompensation to everybody, particularly those firms that do 90 or even \nmore percentage of their work with the Federal Government, you in \neffect put a salary cap on everybody at that firm, even the scientists, \nwho they have to go out and compete for?\n  Mrs. BOXER. We are capping the amount of Federal taxpayer payments to \none individual, to that of the President of the United States, that is \ncorrect.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. The answer is yes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, on my time, I ask the Senator from Iowa a \nquestion.\n  As my friend noted in his opening statement, the GAO did a study and \nthis study was astounding.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this printed in the Record, Mr. \nPresident.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            GAO/MDC 1995 COMPENSATION FOR TOP FIVE EXECUTIVES           \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                      Executive \\1\\                         Amount \\2\\  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.......................................................      $4,012,833\n2.......................................................       3,920,559\n3.......................................................       2,383,974\n4.......................................................       2,303,713\n5.......................................................       2,238,966\n                                                         ---------------\n    Total...............................................      14,860,045\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Because these amounts differ from Securities and Exchange Commission\n  filings, MDC requested that the names of the executives not be        \n  disclosed.                                                            \n\\2\\ These amounts represent compensation as defined by the FAR and      \n  differ from compensation reported in Securities and Exchange          \n  Commission filings.                                                   \n\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. We thought we put a cap in place, I say to my friend, and \nyet we know in one company, executive No. 1--and we will not identify \nthat individual--in one defense company, earned $4 million in 1 year, \nnearly all from taxpayers. Executive No. 2, $3.9 million, executive No. \n3, $2.3 million, executive No. 4, $2.3 million, executive No. 5, $2.2 \nmillion, for a total among those five executives of $14.8 million.\n  I ask my friend from Iowa how he thinks the people in Iowa would \nreact when they learn that 1 executive got over $4 million in one \ncalendar year, in a year when, by the way, there were layoffs in that \ncompany; if he could answer that. And also talk to me, if he would, \nabout the committee's proposal which they say would limit pay to \n$350,000--if the Senator agrees with that.\n  If he could give me the reaction and then his opinion on the \ncommittee's plan.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. First of all, my constituents would expect that if \nthere is a cap in the law of the most that we will pay out of the \nFederal Treasury to an executive of a major defense corporation, they \nwould expect that salary limit to be adhered to. Not as this chart \ndemonstrates--$250,000 cap, you end up with $2.7 million, $2.6 million, \n$2 million and $1.8 million, and you gave figures for another \ncorporation that are higher than this. They would expect that cap to \nwork.\n  It is obvious that it is not working. If it is obvious it is not \nworking, the very committee that put the cap in place, they would \nexpect that oversight committee to fulfill its constitutional \nresponsibility and make sure that the law is abided by.\n  Also, your question gives me an opportunity to point out to our \nfriend from Pennsylvania, when he raised the question of this amount of \nmoney, that we could expect executives to make this amount of money.\n  The point is this is just a portion of their salary that comes out of \ntaxpayers' dollars. He raised that question, and I want to clarify that \nthe $2.7 million, $2.6 million, $2 million, and $1.8 million is just \nthat portion of that executive salary out of tax money, out of Defense \nDepartment money. As he indicated, they could get paid more, they get \nthat out of other sources of income for the corporation. The point is \nthis is just money from the taxpayers.\n  Lastly, my constituents raised the same questions as your \nconstituents might raise that it is a more moral and ethical issue here \nof the extent to which we are having executives get big salaries and \npeople that are working and producing for that corporation on the \nassembly line or someplace else, that there is a gigantic spread that \nhas developed within corporate America between what the blue-collar \nworker might be getting paid or other lower paid professional people \nversus what the executive is getting. I think there is a legitimate \nquestion raised whether or not that is a justified gap. I think this \nemphasizes that there is that gap over a long period of time. \nExecutives getting big pay raises and people lower down are just hardly \nkeeping up with inflation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to my friend, he makes a very important point. I am \ntroubled by the committee suggesting that their new policy would cap \npay at $350,000. I understand that my colleague has a chart which shows \ndifferent analyses of that, because I greatly question it. Last year, \nwe thought we were capping it at $250,000, and people got $4 million. I \nwonder if my friend can share with us that chart, which shows opinions \nother than the committee's opinion on where these caps will actually \nfall--not at $350,000, but more into the millions.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Well, this chart refers to the figure that has been \ngiven to us as the cap that might be effectively in place as a result \nof section 804, $340,000.\n  In a practical world of paying executives, we have three estimates, \nand these are very recent estimates from various publications just this \nspring. The Wall Street Journal, for instance, had an average salary of \ncorporate executives of $1.5 million. The Forbes publication had an \naverage salary in their survey of $1.9 million. Business Week had an \naverage salary of $2.3 million. This would be total compensation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the CRS memo be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the memo was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7176]]\n\n   [Transmittal from the Congressional Research Service, Library of \n                        Congress, June 20, 1997]\n\n     To: Hon. Charles Grassley.\n     Attn: Charles Murphy.\n     From: Pat Ayers, Business Team, Congressional Reference \n         Division, Tel: 7-7492.\n     Re: Average Pay Statistics.\n       To summarize our telephone conversation of this morning, we \n     are unaware of any federal statistics which compile data on \n     corporate executive compensation by size of the business \n     establishment. There are several private organizations which \n     do survey the larger public corporations for executive \n     compensation data, including surveys by Business Week, \n     Forbes, and Fortune, which cover 800 to 1,000 of the largest \n     firms in the U.S. There is also no one set definition of what \n     constitutes a ``small business'', another impediment.\n       We have enclosed a brief CRS report which provides data \n     contrasting executive compensation with average worker pay, \n     which may give some insight. To update these figures, for \n     1996 the median annual earnings for CEOs was $1,471,250 (Wall \n     St. Journal-April 19, 1997), $1.9 million (Forbes-May 19, \n     1997) and $2.3 million (Business Week-April 27, 1997.) Median \n     annual earnings for full-time wage and salary workers in the \n     private nonfarm sector for 1996 is $24,500 (BLS-Employment & \n     Earnings: January 1997.)\n       We also searched our various news databases and did not \n     find any ``estimates'' offered. The National Federation of \n     Independent Business stated that they did not collect such \n     data from their membership.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. It would be unrelated to the issue we have before us of \nthe defense industry, but it does tell me that the figure that the \ncommittee feels will somehow be a cap for this year--and we want to \nremember that it is suggested that this cap is going to go up from year \nto year--that it is not going to be a very effective way of controlling \nmoney leaving the Defense Department to the executives, as the \ncommittee has intended. I think they are going to find this just as \nineffective as the cap that has been in the law, as I have demonstrated \nin a previous chart that I have.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to say to my friend that I \nreally appreciate his coming up with those charts because taxpayers \nthought a year ago that all this was taken care of. They honestly \nthought a $250,000 cap would work. Now we see executives making $2 \nmillion, $3 million, $4 million, as if we didn't have a budget crisis \naround this place. It is unreal.\n  Now we are told that the new committee policy will lead to a $350,000 \ncap by some fancy magic computation. I think what the Senator from Iowa \nhas shown us is a warning here. We don't want to come back next year \nwith more of these charts that say to our friends: You miscalculated it \nand executives are getting $2 million a year from taxpayers. This is \nwrong.\n  So I want to, again, thank my colleague very much for coauthoring \nthis amendment. I retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from \nVirginia may need.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will just use 2 minutes for the purpose \nof posing a question. I pose the question to the sponsors of this \namendment.\n  First, having worked on the committee some 18 years, this is an issue \nthat has been visited and revisited very carefully through the years. I \nam not here to criticize, but I assure you that the Armed Services \nCommittee reviews this matter with great care each year. But the \nbenefit to the American defense system is for a lot of small, \nindependent private-sector companies to come to the marketplace and \noffer what is known as their best practices. I feel that this is going \nto be a disincentive. I am sure my distinguished colleague from \nPennsylvania, the chairman of the subcommittee, is going to touch on \nthis. I ask this question of you because I am going to ask it of him. \nWould this not be a disincentive and thereby deprive the Department of \nDefense, and the overall American defense system, of some of the best \ntechnology and best management practices being offered?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. For myself, I will answer that question very shortly \nthis way. First of all, we are only talking about the portion that is \ngoing to come from the taxpayers. Second, we in no way in our amendment \nlimit executive salaries for corporations. In fact, it is none of our \nbusiness to do that. That is a market decision. We want that to be a \nmarket decision, and nothing in our amendment keeps that from \nhappening.\n  The point is, how much should be paid out of the Treasury and how \nmuch should be paid out of other income? That is a stockholders versus \nCEO business relationship that we will not infringe upon. Our amendment \ndoes not; we don't intend to. Both of us would say it would be wrong \nfor us to do that.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may need. \nI want to respond very briefly. The Senator from Iowa says it is a \nmarket decision on how much people should be compensated. They use the \nterm ``executive compensation.'' This is not a limitation on that; it \nis a limitation on anyone's compensation. They do not designate certain \nexecutives, as we do in our underlying bill. We designate the top five \nexecutives. They limit it to every person in the company, including \nmaybe that guy who sits in the cubical and doesn't come out very much \nand drinks a lot of coffee, who makes the place run because he has all \nthe ideas. He may not be the executive, but he is the brains behind all \nthe research going on in that company. They limit him, too. Let's \nunderstand that.\n\n  They said it is a market decision. Well, it is only a market decision \nas to what you pay your people if you have other markets, because if \nyou are just in the defense market and have cost-type contracts, the \ndecision is made by the Senator from Iowa, not by the company, because \nthe Senator from Iowa will say, if your company does defense work and \nyou have cost-type contracts, you can only get paid this amount, no \nmatter whether everybody else--those brilliant technologists--get paid \na lot more somewhere else, like in Hollywood, which is where they will \ngo. It is not a market decision. It is in some cases, but not always, \nand those are the cases I am most worried about.\n  The Senator from California is suggesting that I was concerned about \nhow much executives got paid. I said during my statement, and I will \nrepeat it, that I don't care how much executives get paid. I care about \nkeeping the best and brightest, particularly the people with the \ntechnology and the skills, those needed skills, to work in the sector \nthat does work particularly for national security.\n  When we limit compensation--at least that is what is being \nsuggested--to those individuals who are out there on the leading edge \nof technology and we drive them out of the Government procurement \narea--particularly in the area of national security--we have hurt the \nnational security of this country. I know it wasn't deliberately \nintended to do that, but that is exactly what this does. I would, in \nfact, change the name. I think our underlying bill is an executive \ncompensation amendment or provision. The Boxer-Grassley amendment is a \nscientist compensation limitation amendment. Let's call it what it is \nbecause it doesn't just limit executives. In particular, it gets \nscientists compensation who work for defense contractors or for \ncontractors in the national security area. That is a very serious \ndecision this Senate is going to make today as to whether we are going \nto go out and drive the leading-edge technology people in this country \nout of national security issues and put them--maybe there is a motive \nhere, to send them out to California to work for the movie industry. \nMaybe that is what is involved. I say that tongue-in-cheek, but that is \nexactly what will happen, and that is not right. That is not in the \nbest interest of this country.\n  As the Senator from Iowa points out so eloquently, these caps on \nexecutives for the big companies don't work. Why? Well, quite aside \nfrom any claim of fraud or not telling us the real numbers is that a \nlot of the contracts that these corporations have are not cost-type \ncontracts. They are fixed-price contracts. So the executives can get \npaid anything they want on fixed-price contracts, because as long as \nthey deliver the item being procured at a certain price, they can pay \nanybody in the organization anything, and they do. That is OK as long \nas they give it to us for what we agreed to pay them for it.\n  So to suggest that somehow this cap works on lowering the \ncompensation of high-priced executives in big corporations, it doesn't \nwork; it will never work. We will come back every year\n\n[[Page S7177]]\n\nwith these charts because we don't do all cost-type contracts, nor \nshould we. In fact, it goes against one of the things we have been \npushing for in reform of our acquisition in defense. Instead of just \nlooking at low cost, we look at best value. We look at the best value \nfor the taxpayer--not just cost, but value. And so what I think we are \ngoing to increasingly see is that this amendment is, in a sense, \nirrelevant for the large companies, but incredibly relevant for the \nsmall defense contractors who are leading-edge, doing leading-edge \ntechnology, many of whom are in California, I might add, and some of \nwhom are in Pennsylvania, I am proud to say. But we are going to lose \nthose people--the best and the brightest in the science fields--to \nindustries other than national security, and that would be the crime if \nthis amendment would succeed.\n\n  I yield to the chairman for such time as he may consume.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nrequire.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by my \ngood friends, Senator Boxer and Senator Grassley.\n  Mr. President, I acknowledge that some executive salaries are \nexorbitant, but section 804 of our defense bill is a sound middle \nground on the very controversial issue of payment of executive \ncompensation under cost-type contracts with Federal agencies, including \nthe Department of Defense. The section in our bill recognizes that the \nindustries supplying goods and services to the Federal Government do \nnot do so in isolation from the rest of the economy. They must compete \nwith similar companies in the private sector for the limited pool of \nthe most qualified technical and management people. Salaries for such \npeople are not determined by a Government agency; they are set in the \nmarketplace. Section 804 would provide a framework for ensuring that we \ncan bring the best private sector talent to bear to support our \nnational defense.\n  At the same time, section 804 would not permit the Federal Government \nto reimburse exorbitant salaries or other forms of compensation. The \nmaximum allowable limit for executive compensation covered under this \nprovision would not exceed $340,000, according to the Defense Contract \nAudit Agency, based on surveys conducted in 1995. In fact, the \nadministration opposes section 804 because it provides too great a \nlimitation on compensation, in their view. The administration wants to \npay more, but we limit this to $340,000 in our defense bill.\n  Mr. President, section 804 is a sound means to settle executive \ncompensation issues once and for all. It protects the interests of the \ntaxpayer, both in the limits it places on reimbursement under cost-type \ncontracts and by recognizing the relationship between compensation \npractices in the industries supporting defense and those in the \ncommercial sector. I urge the rejection of Boxer-Grassley amendment.\n  We feel that our defense provision here covers it adequately and is \nin the best interest of the Government.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield the Senator from Virginia whatever time he \nneeds.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will take 3 or 4 minutes to pose \nquestions to the Senator. It seems like here in the legislative bodies, \nwhether it is tax, capital gains, or anything else, we are out to \npenalize a certain class of individuals who, by and large, have worked \nhard all their life, beginning in the educational system, to equip \nthemselves with the knowledge, through a series of degrees, to take on \nthe responsibilities of leading our corporate structure.\n  Whether they are scientists or financial managers, or whether they \nare just entrepreneurs, they make sacrifices often to start these \nbusinesses with their personal funds working long hours and giving up \nvacations.\n  So here we go again. But I would like to just sort of sketch a \nprofile of a company that, say, is doing $100 million worth of \nbusiness, and, say, 80 percent of it is pure private sector--nothing to \ndo with Uncle Sam. But Uncle Sam would like to have a piece of the \nbrain trust in this company, and, therefore, it comes around and the \ncontract is theirs. In the first place, say that CEO is making $500,000 \na year; well deserved. If he gets caught up in the indirect costs he is \nbanged into the Boxer-Grassley cap, is he not?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is correct. The amount of money that will be \nallocated to defense contracts would limit his salary to a percentage \nwhich would be probably below what he would be paid otherwise.\n  Mr. WARNER. Then he will sit down. And he has to decide. ``Do I apply \nmy brain power?'' Suppose he somehow is able to draw a firewall in the \ncompany, and the CEO and a lot of the other top people stay out of the \ncontract. Does that not deprive the government of the benefit of the \nexperience and the brain trust at the top salaries?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. What would happen is a couple of things. According to \nthe Grassley amendment, it is my understanding they would be roped in \nno matter whether they did any work or not. They would be covered under \nthis because their company is. It doesn't limit it just to people \ninvolved in defense contracts. It is anybody in the country.\n  That is No. 1.\n  No. 2, it would shift the cost of paying those salaries away from the \ndefense contract to the private sector, which would make them less \ncompetitive out there in the private commercial sector, which would \nthen probably say, Look, we can't be as competitive out there in the \nprivate sector. We are just going to walk away from this defense \ncontract.\n  Mr. WARNER. One word: Disincentive.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Therefore, the board of directors and the CEO of this \ncompany are going to say, We are doing fine with 80 percent private \nsector. Too bad, national security. You are on your own. Of course, I \nrecognize in most instances for patriotic reasons they will step into \nit. But nevertheless I think this is the wrong approach.\n  I say that with a great deal of empathy for my distinguished \ncolleague with whom I have worked these many years. He is sort of a \nwatchdog. I commend him for such innovation. But I suggest that our \ncommittee has done its work, and I strongly urge the Senate to back the \nsolution to this problem as devised by our distinguished colleague from \nPennsylvania for the Armed Services Committee.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I would agree with the Senator from Virginia. The \nSenator from Iowa has been a dogged--I don't mean to use metaphor--\ndogged in his watchdog of the Federal Treasury. But he is chasing----\n  Mr. WARNER. If the Senator will yield, he is our inspector general.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. He is chasing the wrong--in this case, the dog is \nchasing the wrong person. What you end up chasing is chasing very \nskilled technical people and very highly competent managers of people \nout of the business who want to be more and more competitive.\n  Again, I chair the subcommittee on Acquisition and Technology. My \nreal concern here in the committee is the technological advances. What \nwe are hearing in the testimony is more and more we will have to go out \ninto the commercial sector and get the technology that is being put \ntogether in the commercial sector to bring that into the defense area \nat a lower cost that is more efficient and more effective. If we limit \nthe compensation, we are just simply not going to get those commercial \nentities involved in the defense industry. That is a real crime. We are \ngiving up resources and talent and capability by limiting it, as we are \nhere, to a salary of one-quarter of what a shortstop of the Pittsburgh \nPirates makes who bats--actually the shortstop is batting over .200, \nbut not much over .200 right now. That is not right. And I think it is \ncounterproductive for national security.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THURMOND. I yield such time as I may require.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Can I ask how much \ntime the Senator from Pennsylvania has remaining and the Senator from \nCalifornia has remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 11 minutes \nand 41 seconds. The Senator from California has 5 minutes and 25 \nseconds.\n\n[[Page S7178]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will be happy to withhold.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield to the Senator from South Carolina such time as \nhe may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I want to commend Senator Santorum, the \nable chairman of the subcommittee that handled this matter, for all the \ngood work he did on that subcommittee.\n  I also wish to commend the able Senator from Virginia for his \nexplanatory remarks on this subject.\n  I think this matter is so clear that no other conclusion could be \nreached than the position taken by the able chairman of the \nsubcommittee, Senator Santorum, and the able Senator from Virginia, and \nothers who have taken that position.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, sometimes I feel like Alice in Wonderland. \nAnd this is one of those moments.\n  The Senator from Virginia says this is an innovative idea--the \namendment by myself and the Senator from Iowa. Mr. President, this is \nthe same idea that this body voted for unanimously 2 years ago except \nwe set a cap at $250,000. Now we set it at the level of the pay of the \nPresident of the United States. So this isn't innovation. This is \ntightening the loophole.\n  Every Member of this body went along with this notion of capping the \namount that taxpayers would pay in 1 fiscal year to a Federal \ncontractor from taxpayer funds. They want to get millions of dollars \nfrom the private sector. God bless them. But we believe it is the \nappropriate thing to do when you look after the taxpayers' purse to put \na reasonable limit.\n  I wish that I had heard the same passion that I heard today from the \nSenator from Pennsylvania when we debated the minimum wage.\n  I will tell you. The Senator from Pennsylvania says, what about a new \nfirm starting out and they know they can only make $200,000 a year \nrather than the Federal Government? Wouldn't that inhibit them? I think \nfor a new firm starting out that is not a bad salary. Maybe in \nPennsylvania $200,000 a year isn't a lot of money, but where I come \nfrom it is a lot of money. And we don't limit what people can make \noutside of the Federal Government.\n  Then the Senator from Pennsylvania says he doesn't care what \nexecutives get. He doesn't care. Well, he should care, if five \nexecutives in one company pull down $4 million, $3 million, $2 million, \n$2 million, $2 million respectively in 1 year when we thought we had a \n$250,000 cap in place.\n  So I would ask my friend from Iowa if he would like to sum up because \nwe are getting to the end of this debate. I don't quite understand why \nour proposal is being looked at as something brand new when in fact we \nthought the $250,000 cap was in place, and now what we are all trying \nto do is tighten down the hatches and make sure people do not take \nadvantage of taxpayers, and we are treating this as if we have come up \nwith some new idea. If he would care to comment on that and perhaps \nclose the debate, I would be happy to yield him any remaining time.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I think that is what is at stake here \nwith the debate on our amendment as well as the debate on what has \nactually been taking place when there has been a cap in the law for the \nlast year or so, and that is that the caps aren't working. But also the \nprinciple of a cap has been the policy of this Congress for a long \nperiod of time. We want to continue that policy. We want that to be an \neffective policy. We want a committee that is charged with the \noversight responsibility for a law that this body passes to make sure \nthat that policy is followed to a ``t'' by the Defense Department. We \nsee all of that at issue here in our amendment. This isn't just an \nissue of $200,000 versus $250,000 or a new suggested limit of $340,000. \nIt is the integrity of this body making public policy on defense, and \nis the Congress of the United States going to be followed by the agency \nexecuting our laws?\n  We are finding out that Congress wants a cap. We are finding out even \non a reconsideration of that law that the Armed Services Committee \nargues for a cap. We want it to be an effective cap. There might be an \nargument about $200,000 versus $340,000. I will buy either limit. But \nwhat I want is a limit that is enforced. I want the committee to know \nhow much money we are paying out.\n  We are told that they don't even know. They ought to know where the \ntaxpayer dollars are going, the names of the people receiving them, and \nhow much is going out.\n  That is the issue with this amendment as much as whether it is \n$200,000, $250,000, or $340,000. Let's get this principle established \nfirmly by voting for this amendment, and let's see that the cap is \nenforced.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I have sympathy for what the Senator \nfrom Iowa is saying. The fact of the matter is the amendment doesn't \naccomplish what he wants to accomplish. We will be back here next year, \nif the Senator's amendment passes, with the same because all the \nSenator's amendment does is limit cost-type contracts. It does not \nlimit those contracts in which we purchase things from contractors for \na fixed price. We tell them when we purchase it for a fixed price, You \ncan pay whoever you want. You can pay whatever you want for the \nmaterial. You can pay the executives anything as long as you deliver \nthe product at this price. So they allocate some substantial portion or \nwhat looks like at least some portion of these contract dollars. That \nis perfectly legal.\n  If the Senator wants to say that we should not do any fixed-price \ncontracts, come with an amendment that says that. If he comes with \namendment that says we don't limit fixed contracts --I don't think he \nwould support it, but the Senator from California supports it--then we \ncan deal with this issue. But if all you are going to deal with is one \ntype of contract which is cost, then go out and show compensation \nlevels that include moneys from fixed-pricing contracts. That is what \nthey have done.\n  So for all of the passion--and I believe in the passion of the \nSenator from Iowa, and the Senator from California--it doesn't solve \nthe problem; at least what they perceive as the problem. What I \nperceive as the problem with their amendment is it does hurt since \ntechnology and the highly competent people we need to be in the \nnational security area. And, frankly, not just national security but in \nall areas of Government, if we can get them.\n  As I mentioned before, wouldn't it be nice if we had a more modern \nupgraded air traffic control system? And we have the ability to pay \nscientists the amount of money in contracts to be able to design those. \nUnder this amendment we could not get the best and the brightest to do \nthat.\n  So what this executive compensation amendment really effectively does \nis limit the amount of money that we can pay people in the high-\ntechnology field, the scientists and the information specialists that \nwe need to move the national security front forward.\n  So for that reason alone it should be soundly defeated. We cannot \nafford, as we draw down defense, as we reduce our troop levels, as we \ncontinue to rely more and more not only on high-tech--which is \ncertainly something we rely more upon, high technology but on \ncommercial technology and commercial contracts--contracts with \ncommercial organizations who will steer clear of Government contracts, \nif they are going to be limited in how much they can reimburse their \nscientists and other personnel through their technology that they are \nsharing, because if they limit it they have to pass that cost on to \ntheir private sector clients which makes them uncompetitive. So they \nwill choose not to compete in the defense area. So we lose valuable \ncommercial technology.\n  So we are not only losing the scientists. We are losing the \nopportunity in the commercial area. We are creating a disincentive for \npeople to be involved. And, even with all of that, if we adopt the \namendment, it wouldn't work. So it accomplishes all those negative \nthings, and the one positive thing they choose to accomplish it does \nnot accomplish because it does not limit anybody's salary except those \nsmall\n\n[[Page S7179]]\n\nbusinesses that have primarily cost-type contracts. Those small \nbusinesses, 80, 90 percent of the contractors that have principally \ncost-type contracts, they get nailed by this amendment. All the big \nguys it does not bother. It nails the small companies and their ability \nto compete, to get compensated for the technology that they are \ninventing in many cases and to get good people to work in those \nbusinesses in towns all across America.\n\n  This is a dangerous amendment for national security. It is an \namendment that I hope is overwhelmingly rejected. It is an amendment \nthat I know the Senator from Connecticut, the ranking member, opposes \nand I know the ranking member on the full committee, Senator Levin, \nopposes. They support the underlying committee decision which, I would \nadd, is opposed by the White House because they believe our cap is too \nlow.\n  I know that this amendment has passed in the past, and the Senator \nfrom California said it was passed overwhelmingly, but I would implore \nthat the Senate come to its senses in this case and realize its impact.\n  I now yield the remaining part of my time to the Senator, the ranking \nmember, from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. I was concerned that my friend and \ncolleague from Pennsylvania, the chairman of the subcommittee, thought \nI was missing in action on a controversial matter. I apologize. I was \ninvolved in a Government Affairs campaign finance investigation.\n  I stand solidly and strongly with the chairman of our subcommittee. \nIt is my privilege to be his ranking Democratic member in fashioning \nthe proposal on compensation of executive salary which is in the DOD \nAuthorization Act before us. We compromised and, as I believe I just \nheard the Senator from Pennsylvania say, we specifically rejected a \nproposal from the administration that would have permitted \nreimbursement of salaries as high as $4 million a year for some senior \nexecutives in the largest corporations.\n  To tell you the truth, they had a plausible argument in terms of \ngetting the best people to do the job for our defense needs, but it \nwas, we thought, an untenable argument so we came up with this modest \nincrease in the cap. The cap is rationally based. In fact, in some ways \nit is tighter than any of the limitations in law today for the simple \nreason that, unlike those limitations, our provision would apply to all \ncosts charged on all defense and nondefense contracts regardless of \nwhen the contracts may have been entered.\n  The flexibility provided by our approach, which is to say to base the \nlimitation on a median private sector salary, is likely to be \nparticularly important to small companies that rely on Department of \nDefense business. Unlike the larger and diversified companies that can \neat the larger executive salaries, many smaller businesses, \nparticularly the high-technology businesses that are the source of so \nmuch growth around our country, are not in a position to pay their \nexecutives what the market requires and absorb or, to use the phrase I \nused before, ``eat'' any unreimbursed amounts. If the cap that we set \nis too low, some of these businesses are going to have difficulty \nattracting and retaining qualified personnel.\n  Mr. President, the proposed amendment, which would lower the cap to \n$200,000, is, in my opinion, not necessary to protect the taxpayers \nfrom excessive executive salaries. If a contractor pays an executive, \nfor instance, the $4 million a year that might have been allowed under \nthe Pentagon proposal, the provision in the underlying bill would \ndisallow $3,660,000 of that salary. The proposed amendment would save \nan additional $140,000. That is a difference of less than 4 percent, \nand the cost of it in terms of lost opportunity is much larger.\n  What we will lose by going after that additional amount is far more \nsignificant than the amount of money that will be gained. We are going \nto lose the flexibility for small businesses that are dependent on \nGovernment contracts to pay what the market requires to attract the \nskilled professionals that they need to provide the quality products \nand services that we need to maintain our national security. We risk \ndriving such experts out of companies that work for the Government and \nreducing the expertise available to our Government, the Pentagon and \nother Federal agencies, and, most important I believe, we risk driving \nsome small businesses that are highly reliant on such experts out of \ndoing business with the Government at all.\n  Mr. President, the amendment before us, of course, is an easy \namendment to vote for. We can say we took a whack at high salaries of \nexecutives of companies. What I am suggesting is the difference between \nthe amendment and the underlying bill is minimal and the consequences \nfor a lot of people, for a lot of companies, for a lot of areas of our \ncountry where those companies exist, for our Government itself in \nobtaining the highest quality, most cost-efficient products is much, \nmuch greater.\n\n  So it is not an easy vote. But, of course, that is not why the Senate \nis here. This is the right vote. I urge my colleagues to reject this \namendment and stand by the very reasonable proposal in the underlying \nbill.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have 12 seconds; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. OK.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the cap in the committee bill is so full \nof loopholes, it is not going to work, just like the last one did not. \nPeople brought down $4 million from Federal taxpayers in 1 year.\n  Support the Boxer-Grassley amendment. Let us do what we said we would \ndo 2 years ago.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has 1 minute 13 \nseconds.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. How much time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A minute and 12 seconds.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I cannot be any more eloquent than the Senator from \nConnecticut in defending this position. I urge the Members to look at \nthis issue and to stay away from this populist appeal and look at the \nimpact, as the Senator from Connecticut said, on small business and on \nhigh-technology firms that desperately need to get out there and \ncompete in the marketplace.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from New \nMexico is recognized to offer an amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 799\n\n(Purpose: To increase the funding for Navy and Air Force flying hours, \n  and to offset the increase by reducing the amount authorized to be \nappropriated for the Space-Based Laser program in excess of the amount \n                      requested by the President)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I understand we are \ngoing to have some votes at 6 o'clock. So I will take a few minutes \nhere to explain the amendment that I am offering. Senator Dorgan also \nwishes to speak in favor of the amendment. I believe the Senator from \nNew Hampshire, Senator Smith, wishes to speak in opposition to it and \nmaybe some others on both sides.\n  Let me start by describing what the issue is. The administration has \nrequested $29 million in this next fiscal year for the space-based \nlaser program which is operated under the Ballistic Missile Defense \nOffice. This is the same funding request level as we have had for the \npast 2 years. It is the same level that is planned for each of the next \nseveral years. This essentially is money to continue the research and \ndevelopment part of this program, which the administration supports, \nwhich I support. But the bill which has come to the Senate floor, which \nthe committee has passed out, adds an additional $118 million in this \nnext fiscal year for a total of about $148 million. The amendment that \nwe are offering here will bring the funding level back to what the \nadministration requested. That is $29 million. It shifts the $118 \nmillion that the committee added to this space-based laser program to \nincrease the flying hours for the Air Force and\n\n[[Page S7180]]\n\nthe Navy both, $59 million for the Air Force and $59 million for the \nNavy.\n  Mr. President, with that short description, let me send this \namendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 799.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1009. INCREASED AMOUNTS FOR AIR FORCE AND NAVY FLYING \n                   HOURS.\n\n       (A) Increase.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act, the amount authorized to be appropriated under section \n     301(2) is hereby increased by $59,000,000, and the amount \n     authorized under section 301(4) is hereby increased by \n     $59,000,000.\n       (b) Decrease.--Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act, the total amount authorized to be appropriated to be \n     appropriated under section 201(4) is hereby decreased by \n     $118,000,000.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, as I indicated, the bill that we have \nbefore us adds $118 million to what is called the space-based laser \nreadiness demonstrator program. That funding level represents 5 years' \nworth of the planned space-based laser funding--planned by the \nPentagon. In order to sustain the program at this increased level, \nwhich the committee has reported here, would require an additional \nexpenditure of somewhere between $200 million and $300 million a year, \nwhich is more than 10 times what is planned for future budgets.\n  Mr. President, let me try to demonstrate the difference that I am \ntalking about with this chart.\n  This chart tries to lay out between now and the year 2005 the current \nrate--which is in green here on this chart--the current rate of \nfunding, cumulative funding, that is requested for this space-based \nlaser activity by the Pentagon, and the yellow in this chart is what \nthe committee would propose to begin adding.\n  Now, we do not do all of that. This is a 1-year defense authorization \nbill. We just add $118 million to the $29 million that the Pentagon \nrequested the first year. But if you take the best figures that have \nbeen given us and say we are going to have an additional $200 million a \nyear added, so you put the cumulative amount there, you can see that \nthe total amount by the year 2005 is a very substantial figure.\n  The larger context for considering this space-based laser program \ninvolves four basic questions. Let me briefly go through each of those. \nFirst of all, what is a space-based laser? People need to understand \nsomething about that, and I will try to explain it. Second, how would a \nspace-based laser fit into the U.S. plan for a national missile \ndefense? Third, is there a threat that warrants or justifies developing \nand deploying a space-based laser? And finally, No. 4, would it be \naffordable for us to do so? Would it be cost effective for us to do so?\n  Let me try to explain first what a space-based laser is and then \nanswer each of these other questions.\n  Mr. President, the space-based laser, which is the subject of this \namendment, is technology that was born in the early days of the \nStrategic Defense Initiative, SDI. For those who have followed this set \nof issues over the last decade or so, they will remember the star wars \nproposals that we debated on the floor. The crown jewel of that star \nwars program was the space-based laser. It held out the promise of tens \nof satellites constantly orbiting the Earth ready to zap the hundreds \nupon hundreds of Soviet nuclear ballistic missiles that were launched \nfrom land and sea both.\n  The idea behind the space-based laser is that we would orbit a group \nof perhaps 20 or perhaps more very large satellites. Each satellite \nwould be in the range of 80,000 pounds and each of them would be \nequipped with a chemical laser on the satellite. The chemical laser \nwould produce a beam of very high-energy laser light that would then be \nfocused very carefully with a very huge mirror so that the laser beam \ncould be focused on missiles when they were first launched. That was \nthe idea of getting up in space, so that you could zap a missile when \nthey first launched it. You didn't have to wait until the missile \nactually came near your territory.\n  This would require having equipment on the satellite capable of \ndetecting and tracking and pointing the laser at a relatively small \nobject some 1,300 kilometers away over a long enough period of time to \npermit the laser energy to destroy the missile.\n  The satellites are so large, the satellites contemplated in this \nprogram of space-based lasers are so large and so heavy, we would have \nto design and build an entire new series of heavy space-launch vehicles \nwith enough lifting power to get one of these huge payloads, 40 tons, \ninto space--80,000 pounds, 40 tons. There is today no rocket, there is \nno space-launch vehicle currently in our inventory that can boost such \na large payload into space. The cost of building such a booster would \nrepresent a significant part of the cost of any space-based laser \nsystem. The space-based laser readiness demonstrator which we would \nfund or begin to fund with the $118 million provided in the bill is \nmeant to demonstrate that the many technologies that are required in \norder to accomplish what I have just described can be met and overcome. \nThe demonstrator would be a reduced size system with all the necessary \ntechnology and parts to make all the components work together at the \nsame time.\n\n  This would presumably cost several billion dollars to find out the \nanswers to these questions. The money does not exist anywhere in the \nPentagon's budget plan for this coming year or the next 5 years, or the \nout years even after that. So, clearly that money would have to come \nfrom other defense programs.\n  I should point out that this chart, which takes us through the year \n2005, does not get us to actual deployment, or development even of a \nspace-based laser. This only gets us to the development of this \ndemonstrator, which I think, as I indicated, is a half-size replica of \nwhat we would actually be talking about developing at some future date.\n  The second question I mentioned, which needs to be dealt with, is, \nhow does this space-based laser fit into our National Missile Defense \nProgram? The United States is developing a National Missile Defense \nSystem to defend against a small Third World nation ICBM program, an \nintercontinental ballistic missile program that has not emerged yet and \nis not, in fact, expected to emerge for another 15 years. But we are \ndeveloping that program. The National Missile Defense Program is \ndesigned to be compliant with the ABM Treaty, although it remains to be \nseen whether we might need to change or propose changes or withdraw \nfrom that treaty at some time in the future.\n  There is no U.S. plan to deploy a space-based laser system, and we \nknow of no justification today for doing so. That is why the Pentagon \nhas asked merely to continue with research and development funding in \nthis area.\n  Furthermore, the cost of deploying such a system would be enormous. \nThe existing National Missile Defense System Program involves \ndeveloping a ground-based missile interceptor capability which is very \ndifferent from a space-based laser. The ground-based defense system \njust had its development cost increased from $2.3 to $4.6 billion. The \nadministration requested that increase.\n  Our committee is proposing that the Senate go along with that \nincrease. We are adding $474 million to this year's defense bill in \norder to do that, and nothing in our amendment that I am talking about \nhere would affect that at all. But the cost to deploy the National \nMissile Defense System last year was pegged at about $10 billion. When \nyou add to that the space and missile tracking system, you get another \n$5-or-so billion. So we are already planning on paying something in the \norder of $17 billion for the limited National Missile Defense System \nthat is designed to stop a handful of rogue missiles coming into this \ncountry. As I said before, we have no plan, however, to pay the \nadditional tens of billions of dollars to actually develop and deploy a \nspace-based laser.\n  The third question that I cited when I began my comments is, is there \na threat that this country faces to our\n\n[[Page S7181]]\n\nnational security, a threat that would justify developing and deploying \nthe space-based laser? The National Missile Defense System that we are \ndeveloping today that I just described is meant to defend against a \nhandful of these ICBM's that might be launched at some future date by \nsome rogue nation, if they develop the capability to do that. According \nto the administration, there is no significant ballistic missile threat \nbeing faced by the United States today.\n  North Korea is the only nation considered to be actively trying to \ndevelop such a missile. But the North Korean economy is in terrible \nshape. Their own military, according to the best information we have, \nis going hungry in some cases. The Defense Intelligence Agency publicly \nstated that their country is--I believe they used the phrase ``probably \nterminal.'' Neither Russian nor Chinese strategic missiles are \nconsidered a threat today because neither nation has a plausible reason \nto attack the United States. And, of course, we maintain an \noverwhelming nuclear deterrent capability, which we should maintain.\n  The United States and Russia have detargeted their ICBM's and their \nSLBM's, which means that no accidental launch could be expected from \neither territory toward the other country. So this is not a threat \nsituation that requires a space-based laser. This is not a threat \nsituation that requires rapid and expensive development of this so-\ncalled readiness demonstrator, as this accelerated program is referred \nto.\n  The final issue I wanted to mention is the issue of cost. Is the \nspace-based laser either affordable or cost effective? Last year's \nDefend America Act, as proposed but not as enacted, included a \nrequirement for space-based lasers. That was a primary factor that led \nthe Congressional Budget Office to estimate the cost of the system at \nup to $60 billion to procure and up to an additional $120 billion to \noperate it over the next 30 years.\n  The Department of Defense stated recently that CBO's cost estimates \nmay have been too low and that the cost of building and launching a \nspace-based laser system is almost certainly higher than those figures. \nOne reason for the high cost, as I mentioned in describing a space-\nbased laser, is the cost of launching the heavy laser systems into \nspace. We need a heavy-lift booster that does not exist today. It would \nbe very expensive to develop. The cost of such a system is totally \noutside the realm of the current budget or the planned defense budgets. \nThis would not be affordable, and it is not likely that it is cost \neffective against the limited emerging ballistic missile threat. The \ncurrent program is designed to handle any foreseeable limited ballistic \nmissile attack from a rogue nation.\n  The Department of Defense has recently doubled the cost estimate for \nthe development program, as I mentioned, and there is no plan to deploy \neven that ground-based missile interceptor system today unless and \nuntil a real threat emerges. If such a deployment is warranted, \nobviously we will have to spend substantially more. But none of the \ndeployment funds are planned in any future defense budget even for the \nground-based missile defense system, the missile interceptor system \nthat I described.\n  DOD has no plans to fund the space-based laser program at the much \nhigher levels that are proposed in this defense bill. DOD clearly has \nhigher priorities. We need to protect those higher priorities and not \npass a bill here which commits us or which starts us down the road \ntoward spending money on programs that the Department of Defense has \nnot requested.\n  The bottom line is that we are nowhere near deploying a space-based \nlaser. There is no need for us to do so. The administration already has \na very expensive National Missile Defense Development Program underway. \nAnd unless this amendment that we are offering here this evening is \nadopted, the Senate will be putting five times as much money into the \nspace-based laser program as the administration has requested in 1998, \nand we will be starting down the road to developing a demonstrator and \neventually a space-based laser program that will be hugely expensive \nand of very marginal value to our national security.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. At this point, I \nyield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum, if there is nobody \nelse wishing to speak at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just add a couple of items that I \noverlooked, since we have just another couple of minutes here before \nthe vote occurs.\n  As I indicated in describing the amendment, we are suggesting that \nthe $118 million which we are trying to delete from the bill for the \nspace-based laser program be, instead, transferred over for Air Force \nand Navy flying hours. The reason I have offered that suggestion is a \nletter from the Secretary of Defense to Senator Levin, and I am sure \nSenator Thurmond also received a copy of it. The letter is dated the \n23d of May. Former Senator Cohen, now Secretary Cohen, stated in this \nletter:\n\n       In addition to adjustments reflective of the Quadrennial \n     Defense Review, I recommend a fact-of-life adjustment \n     concerning flying hour costs. The Navy and the Air Force are \n     both experiencing greater costs per flying hour than \n     anticipated in their budgets. We are currently analyzing the \n     causes of this increase, but the preliminary indications are \n     that the increase is caused by greater spare parts \n     requirements per flying hour than were experienced in the \n     past. We estimate the impact of these increases to be $350 \n     million for the Navy and $200 million for the Air Force.\n\n  So he has requested that we add the total of $550 million to the \ncombined flying hours for the Air Force and the Navy. This amendment \nadds $59 million to the Air Force and $59 million to the Navy. \nObviously, it does not meet the entire requirement as stated by the \nSecretary of Defense, but it moves us in the right direction.\n  So I do think this is a better use of the funds. It is a use that the \nPentagon itself and the Secretary of Defense have indicated they \nsupport. For that reason, that is what we are suggesting be done with \nthe funds.\n  Mr. President, let me also, before I yield the floor again, ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Dorgan be added as a cosponsor of this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment offered \nby my friend from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, which would cut the \n$118 million added to the bill for the space-based laser [SBL] program.\n  As my colleagues are aware, I have long supported development of a \nnational missile defense system to protect our Nation from the threat \nof a limited accidental or unauthorized ICBM launch from an established \nnuclear power, and from the threat of attack from a rogue state, such \nas North Korea, Libya, and Iraq. To ensure that our NMD program makes \ngood fiscal and national security sense, I believe that the system we \ndevelop must meet the common sense criteria of affordability, \ncompatibility with our arms control treaties, and utilization of \nexisting technology. These key tests provide a reliable guide for \ndeveloping an affordable, responsible, and reliable means of countering \nthe limited threat we will face early in the next century.\n  Although sometime in the next century we may do the NMD and theater \nmissile defense missions from space, I do not believe that this is the \ntime to invest $118 million in the SBL. This money would be much better \nspent if invested in promising missile defense systems we are very \nclose to having today, such as the Minuteman-based NMD option, and the \nAirborne Laser TMD program of the U.S. Air Force.\n  I also do not believe we need to start a funding stream that would \nobligate us to spend more than $1 billion over the next 7 years to \nfield only a single SBL demonstrator satellite. With the Minuteman and \nABL systems becoming available, there is simply no reason to put us on \na slippery slope toward an unnecessary operational SBL deployment that \nwill surely cost tens of billions of dollars.\n  In addition to failing the affordability test, pressing forward with \nthe\n\n[[Page S7182]]\n\nSBL today represents a clear threat to arms control. As my colleagues \nmay be aware, the ABM Treaty explicitly prohibits space-based missile \ndefense systems, and the Russians have stated clearly their belief that \ndevelopment of such a capability by the United States would lead to a \nrenewed arms race.\n  It is true that the $118 million in question would go toward \ndevelopment of a demonstrator SBL satellite, and that the ABM Treaty \npermits development of missile defense systems that would not be treaty \ncompliant if operationally deployed. Nevertheless, development of such \na capability would logically increase the likelihood of deployment of \nspace weapons before they are necessary or wise. In light of the near-\nterm, treaty-friendly NMD and TMD capability offered by the Minuteman \nand ABL systems, we would needlessly be putting our Nation on course to \nviolate the ABM Treaty and re-ignite the arms race.\n  Finally, Mr. President, aggressive SBL development today fails the \nthird key test I outlined earlier--utilization of existing technology. \nAlthough the SBL would leverage research done on the ABL, the SBL is \nstill new, untested technology. We know much more about how lasers \nperform in our atmosphere than in space. We have also never deployed \nweapons in space.\n  Because of these considerations, we could expect costs to grow, \ntesting and deployment schedules to slip, and reliability to be highly \nquestionable. I hope my colleagues would agree that the ABL is a much \nbetter investment in laser-based missile defense systems. It will \nprovide the same boost-phase intercept capability as the SBL nearer-\nterm, at a lower cost, and without endangering our arms control \nagreements.\n  Before closing, Mr. President, I would also note on the subject of \ntechnology that even if we were to construct an SBL capability, its \nsatellites would be too massive for any existing U.S. booster rocket to \nloft into orbit. The one American rocket that could have gotten the job \ndone--the Saturn V that sent the Apollo astronauts to the Moon--was \nretired over two decades ago. As it stands, the only alternative to \ninvesting millions or billions more in a new heavy booster would be \nusing Russian's Proton rocket. The fact that the SBL represents a clear \nthreat to the ABM Treaty leads me to believe that our Russian friends \nwould be far from eager to help us in this regard.\n  Mr. President, the SBL is a fascinating technology, and I commend the \ncommittee for their interest in what could several decades from now be \nthe right answer to our missile defense needs. However, this is not the \ntime for the SBL. The Minuteman and ABL systems are not only near-term, \nbut meet the commonsense criteria of affordability, compatibility with \nour arms control agreements, and utilization of existing technology to \nan extent the SBL simply cannot. For this reason, I support the \nBingaman amendment striking funding for the SBL, and urge my colleagues \nto support its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 668, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are 2 minutes \nequally divided on debate preceding the motion to table the Senator's \namendment. Does the Senator wish to proceed under that order?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 2 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Inquiry, Mr. President. Is it 2 minutes time equally \ndivided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Chair is \ncorrected. The Senator is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment, which I offered on \nbehalf of myself, Senator Harkin, Senator Daschle, and Senator Kerry of \nMassachusetts, is very simple and straightforward. It simply would \nauthorize the Secretary of Defense to be able to transfer $400 million \nto veterans health care.\n  In the budget resolution, we cut $400 million out of the health care \nbudget of veterans. We have more Persian Gulf veterans who are seeking \ncare. We have more and more veterans who are living to be 65 and living \nto be 85. We have veterans who are struggling with PTSD. This is a huge \nmistake. We should not be doing this. This gives us an opportunity to \nreally be there for veterans.\n  There are three wonderful letters from Paralyzed Veterans of America, \nVietnam Veterans of America, and Disabled Veterans of America, all of \nwhich strongly support this amendment. I hope we will have a good, \nstrong vote. I hope we will win on this. I say to colleagues, one way \nor the other, we have to restore these cuts in veterans health care.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, if this body allows these amendments, or \nother amendments, to lower defense spending below what was agreed to in \nthe budget agreement, we will be responsible for the impact on the \nreadiness of our forces. We will increase the tempo of our operating \nforces and will not be able to provide the quality-of-life programs our \nservice members deserve.\n  Mr. President, there are all kinds of amendments here that take money \naway from defense and give it to other things. Why don't they find some \nother way to do it and not take it away from defense. Defense needs \nevery dollar that we have here, and I oppose the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 15 seconds.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having expired, the question is on \nagreeing to the motion to lay on the table amendment No. 668, as \nmodified. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

We have \npassed laws in Congress banning them from working to sell anything in \nthe private sector. The last place we can force them to work in is to \nproduce goods to be sold to the Government.\n  The Levin amendment will end prison labor in America.

The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. This is a very serious amendment. What the Gramm amendment \ndoes is it provides for a study in the procurement program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend.\n  The Senate is not in order. The Chair cannot hear the Senator from \nUtah.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. The only hope we have to rehabilitate these prisoners is \nto get them to work. The only work they do is Federal Prison Industries \nwork. Basically, they can only sell their products to a Federal \nprocurement program, and they have to be products of quality and \nproducts of price and products of distribution that work. So if we take \nthis away from them, we take away one of the most important aspects of \nrehabilitation of criminals. So I hope people will vote for the Gramm \namendment and vote down the Levin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired for the proponents. The \nSenator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we obviously want people in prison to work, \nbut we also want people who are out of prison to have an opportunity to \ncompete. The current Federal Prison Industries approach will not permit \npeople to compete even when their prices are lower than the Federal \nPrison Industries price. That is not fair to all the small businesses \nin this country. Hundreds of them have banded together in a Competition \nin Contracting Act Coalition. Small businesses in all of our States \njust want the right to compete when their prices are lower.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Abraham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  This amendment that Senator Levin and myself, Senator Kempthorne and \nothers offered will not end work in prisons. It will not prevent \nprisoners from, through rehabilitation, learning skills. It just levels \nthe playing field to allow private companies to compete with prison \nlabor for these contracts that are now exclusively given to Federal \nPrison Industries offered at a significant cost to the taxpayers from \nwhat would exist if we had a level playing field in competition. The \ntaxpayers should not have to pay extra for these materials and products \nsupplied through Federal Prison Industries.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

If we can get this agreed to, we would \nhave this remaining 10-minute vote and then we would go on to debate on \nthe amendments we have identified, with the votes to occur in the \nmorning on these issues at 9:45.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that, following the stacked votes, Senator \nBingaman be recognized to modify his amendment No. 799, and that there \nbe 30 minutes of debate, equally divided in the usual form, and that no \nsecond-degree amendments be in order and, following the expiration or \nyielding back of time, a vote occur on or in relation to the Bingaman \namendment at 9:45 on Friday.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, can I \njust clarify something? If we can have that half hour of debate \nbeginning at 9:15 tomorrow right before the vote, that would be ideal.\n  Mr. LOTT. Part of what we are trying to do is to get an agreement to \nhave debates tonight so we can have votes in the morning at 9:30 or \n9:45. I thought there was a need just to have a vote at 9:45. Our \nintent is to finish the defense authorization bill tomorrow. In order \nto do that--we understand that, other than the three amendments we may \nget agreement on tonight, there may be three amendments or so tomorrow. \nWe are going to try to identify those and get time agreements and have \nthe votes so that we can, hopefully, get out of here by 12:30 tomorrow.\n  So if the Senator would be willing, we could have the debate tonight \nand then if you want to, in the morning, come in at 9:30 and have 15 \nminutes more of the time equally divided, in addition to the 30 minutes \ntonight, and have the vote at 9:45 because of other considerations, I \nthink that would be a good arrangement.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. That would be fine if we could have 15 minutes tomorrow \nmorning before the vote, equally divided.\n  Mr. LOTT. I understand.\n  Mr. WARNER. Reserving the right to object. The distinguished Senator \nfrom Texas and the Senator from Virginia have an amendment relating to \nour policy in Bosnia--the United States policy in Bosnia--particularly \nwith respect to the mission of capturing alleged war criminals. I would \nlike to\n\n[[Page S7184]]\n\nhave the opportunity to have that debated at whatever time is \nconvenient for the managers of the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I was going to get the agreement on the \nBingaman amendment and then we would go on through some other \ninformation here.\n  Mr. WARNER. I withdraw that.\n  Mr. LOTT. We would like to have debate on three identifiable \namendments tonight, with three votes occurring in the morning, stacked, \nat 9:45. This can be one of those three that we would like to have \ndebated tonight and voted on first thing in the morning.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, may I ask the majority leader this question? \nI simply want to withdraw two amendments and substitute versions that \nhave been cleared on both sides. I wonder if I might do that before the \nBingaman amendment is discussed this evening.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let's get the unanimous-consent request, and \nI believe the Senator could do it right at that point before we go to \nthe vote.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me clarify what it is, since it has been changed.\n  The request is that we have 30 minutes of debate tonight after the \nstacked votes on the Bingaman amendment, that there be no second-degree \namendments in order, that when we come in at 9:30, we will have 15 \nminutes, equally divided, on the Bingaman amendment, with the vote \nbeginning at or about 9:45. So that is the first part of the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I further ask unanimous consent that the amendment by \nSenator Warner and Senator Hutchison be next in order tonight. How much \ntime will be needed?\n  Mr. WARNER. Thirty minutes a side.\n  Mr. LOTT. With 30 minutes, equally divided, on that----\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we have not \nseen that amendment yet, as far as I can tell from staff. Before we can \nagree to that time limit, we would like to see the amendment. We \nthought you were referring to a different amendment relative to Bosnia \nthat we think may be able to be worked out without a rollcall; we are \nnot sure. If this is a different amendment, we would like to see it.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will revise it to this extent. Next would be the Warner-\nHutchison amendment. We won't lock in a time agreement now, but it \nwould be the second vote in order stacked in the morning at 9:45.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Well, that amounts to a time limit. May we see that \namendment before the UC is propounded?\n  Mr. WARNER. Of course, it can be examined. I suggest that the Senator \nfrom Michigan might agree to the UC, with the understanding that it \nwould be reopened if you took the initiative.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We would like to see the amendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Wisconsin in the \nChamber. I understood he had an amendment he might like to offer. We \ndon't know what the disposition would be, but I ask unanimous consent \nthat the third amendment to come up be the Feingold amendment on or in \nrelation to Bosnia, and any vote thereon, if needed, would be at 9:45 \nin the stacked sequence, also.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I understand that there may be as many as four or five \nadditional issues to be resolved on this bill. I encourage all Members \nwho have amendments that they really are serious about identify those \nto the managers of the legislation tonight, and any votes ordered on \nthose will be stacked. We will try to get a unanimous-consent agreement \non the time on those remaining amendments when we come in, in the \nmorning.\n  So there will be no further votes this evening, with the first votes \nto begin tomorrow morning at 9:45. We really need the Senators' \ncooperation so we can complete this legislation. I thank the Senator \nfrom South Dakota for his assistance in this effort.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I could just encourage our colleagues \non this side of the aisle. We have a number of amendments that may not \nrequire rollcalls, but there are two or three that will. I would like \nvery much to be able to work out time agreements tonight on those, so \nwe can announce them tomorrow.\n  There is a desire on the part of both sides, I think, to try to \nfinish at the target time of about noon tomorrow. So we have to work \nvery carefully on these remaining amendments and get time agreements \nthat will accommodate that schedule. So if you have a rollcall, let's \ntry to work out the time agreement tonight before we leave.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, further reserving the right to object----\n  Mr. LOTT. I don't think the request was made. I yield to the Senator \nfrom Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask the leadership to address the following. On the \namendment relating to Bosnia by the distinguished Senator from \nWisconsin, I would like to reserve the right to have the second-degree \namendment.\n  Mr. LOTT. Certainly; we did not prohibit that. You would have that \nright. I would like to ask our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nbe very cautious about amendments we do at this time with regard to \nBosnia. Our troops are there on the ground. I had the occasion, with a \nbipartisan delegation, to be there last week. We have some very \nsensitive circumstances that have evolved there just in the last 24 \nhours. I don't even know what the amendments are, but I hope we will \nuse the maximum amount of discretion in what we do in this area right \nnow. Please be very careful what you do on Bosnia on this bill. I \nrealize there may be some merits to them. I know the Senators will be \nvery careful, and I urge them to do so.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the majority leader yield on that point?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes, I would be happy to.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to support the statement of the \nmajority leader. I don't know what is in these Bosnia amendments, but \nthis is obviously always a difficult and sensitive issue. You know, we \nare locking in now procedure to try to produce this bill, which I am \nsupportive of. I don't think we ought to put into that mix perhaps \nacting precipitously on a very complicated issue. I think the majority \nleader has made a very strong point.\n  Mr. LOTT. We are going to get a chance to look at the amendments. The \nSenator from Wisconsin, I believe, is going to talk to the managers of \nthe bill. But without prejudicing anybody's position, I just wanted to \nadd an admonition.\n  Mr. STEVENS. If the Senator will yield, did the leader say we must \nbring forth the amendment tonight and file it or something? Did I \nmisunderstand?\n  Mr. LOTT. If you have an amendment you really would like to have \nconsidered, particularly if it may require a vote, we would really like \nto know about that amendment and then get an agreement on some time \nlimit in the morning if at all possible.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We don't have to file them tonight?\n  Mr. LOTT. I assume you would have already filed it probably, but you \ndon't have to. We are not looking for amendments, by the way. We are \ndiscouraging them, I might say to the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Well, I might have a few.\n  Mr. LOTT. I see that you have your bright tie on tonight. Maybe \ntomorrow you will feel differently.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if it would be wise to attempt to get an \nagreement that amendments that will be offered will be filed tonight.\n  Mr. LOTT. The Senator from South Dakota and I have found that when we \ndo that, it tends to invite amendments. We are not urging or inviting \namendments.\n  Mr. LEVIN. For the reason stated, I withdraw my suggestion.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor so we can begin the vote.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 636\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there are now 2 \nminutes equally divided on the Boxer amendment.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to divide my time with the \nSenator from Iowa, Senator Grassley.\n  My colleagues, last year corporate executives got paid millions of \ndollars each from taxpayers. One got $4 million, according to a \nscandalous GAO report--all this, while we thought we had a cap in \nplace. It didn't work, and the\n\n[[Page S7185]]\n\nBoxer-Grassley bill fixes it. That is why we have strong support from \npeople who want to see reform. I yield to my colleague and hope he will \nsupport us.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the issue here is whether or not we are \ngoing to stand by and let the Pentagon thumb its nose at the U.S. \nSenate. We have had salary caps for the last 3 years. The Defense \nDepartment has found a way, by $33 million, just with McDonnell Douglas \ngetting over that salary cap. We need an effective salary cap. We \nhaven't had one. This will guarantee an effective salary cap so that \nthe Pentagon will have to execute the laws the way Congress intended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the proponents of the amendment \nhas expired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, Senator Lieberman, who is on the \nsubcommittee, looked at this issue and asked the administration last \nyear to come up with a proposal. They came up with a cap of $4 million. \nWe didn't think that was particularly salable on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate. So we came up with a different calculation that put the cap at \n$340,000. That is the median salary of the executives of companies that \nhave sales of over $50 million.\n\n  What this amendment does is lower that cap to $200,000, and in so \ndoing it applies to not just executives but scientists--people who are \nin demand, who are going to be taken away from high-technology firms \nand national defense and are going to other places where they can make \na lot more money because they are going to be capped under this \namendment.\n  This is a bad amendment. It is going to hurt national security. It \nalso hurts small businesses, because those are the businesses that are \nprimarily defense businesses that are not going to have the opportunity \nto compensate their employees from other sources like commercial \nentities.\n  I encourage a strong no vote on this.\n  I yield the remaining time to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I agree with the Senator.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I move to table the Boxer amendment, and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion of \nthe Senator from South Carolina to lay on the table the amendment of \nthe Senator from California. On this question, the yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 83, nays 16, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 170 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--83\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--16\n\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Grassley\n     Harkin\n     Hutchison\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Leahy\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Reed\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Mikulski\n       \n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 636) was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Mr. President, on the last vote, rollcall vote No. \n170, I ask unanimous consent to change my vote. I voted ``no'' and \nmeant to vote ``aye.'' This will in no way change the outcome of the \nvote. I mistakenly thought it was an up or down instead of tabling.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, what is the pending business now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Bingaman amendment numbered 799.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to speak on that amendment, but I \nwill withhold while Senator Kyl asks for a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. KYL. I appreciate that.\n\n\n   Amendment No. 605, As Modified and Amendment No. 607, As Modified \n                                Further\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw \namendments numbered 605 and 607 and substitute for them versions of \namendments 605 and 607 which have been cleared by both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Without objection, the amendments are so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 605), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 347, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1075. ADVICE TO THE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS REGARDING THE \n                   SAFETY, SECURITY, AND RELIABILITY OF UNITED \n                   STATES NUCLEAR WEAPONS STOCKPILE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Nuclear weapons are the most destructive weapons on \n     earth. The United States and its allies continue to rely on \n     nuclear weapons to deter potential adversaries from using \n     weapons of mass destruction. The safety and reliability of \n     the nuclear stockpile are essential to ensure its credibility \n     as a deterrent.\n       (2) On September 24, 1996, President Clinton signed the \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n       (3) Effective as of September 30, 1996, the United States \n     is prohibited by section 507 of the Energy and Water \n     Development Appropriations Act, 1993 (Public Law 102-377; 42 \n     U.S.C. 2121 note) from conducting underground nuclear tests \n     ``unless a foreign state conducts a nuclear test after this \n     date, at which time the prohibition on United States nuclear \n     testing is lifted''.\n       (4) Section 1436(b) of the National Defense Authorization \n     Act, Fiscal Year 1989 (Public Law 100-456; 42 U.S.C. 2121 \n     note) requires the Secretary of Energy to ``establish and \n     support a program to assure that the United States is in a \n     position to maintain the reliability, safety, and continued \n     deterrent effect of its stockpile of existing nuclear weapons \n     designs in the event that a low-threshold or comprehensive \n     test ban on nuclear explosive testing is negotiated and \n     ratified.''.\n       (5) Section 3138(d) of the National Defense Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Public Law 103-160; 42 U.S.C. 2121 \n     note) requires the President to submit an annual report to \n     Congress which sets forth ``any concerns with respect to the \n     safety, security, effectiveness, or reliability of existing \n     United States nuclear weapons raised by the Stockpile \n     Stewardship Program of the Department of Energy''.\n       (6) President Clinton declared in July 1993 that ``to \n     assure that our nuclear deterrent remains unquestioned under \n     a test ban, we will explore other means of maintaining our \n     confidence in the safety, reliability, and the performance of \n     our weapons''. This decision was codified in a Presidential \n     Directive.\n       (7) Section 3138 of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 1994 also requires that the Secretary of \n     Energy establish a ``stewardship program to ensure the \n     preservation of the core intellectual and technical \n     competencies of the United States in nuclear weapons''.\n       (8) The plan of the Department of Energy to maintain the \n     safety and reliability of the United States nuclear stockpile \n     is known as the Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program. \n     The ability of the United States to maintain warheads without \n     testing will require development of new and sophisticated \n     diagnostic technologies, methods, and procedures. Current \n     diagnostic technologies and laboratory testing techniques are \n     insufficient to certify the future safety and reliability of \n     the United States nuclear stockpile. In the past these \n     laboratory and diagnostic tools were used in conjunction with \n     nuclear testing.\n       (9) On August 11, 1995, President Clinton directed ``the \n     establishment of a new annual reporting and certification \n     requirement [to] ensure that our nuclear weapons remain safe \n     and reliable under a comprehensive test ban''.\n\n[[Page S7186]]\n\n       (10) On the same day, the President noted that the \n     Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy have the \n     responsibility, after being ``advised by the Nuclear Weapons \n     Council, the Directors of DOE's nuclear weapons laboratories, \n     and the Commander of United States Strategic Command'', to \n     provide the President with the information to make the \n     certification referred to in paragraph (9).\n       (11) The Joint Nuclear Weapons Council established by \n     section 179 of title 10, United States Code, is responsible \n     for providing advice to the Secretary of Energy and Secretary \n     of Defense regarding nuclear weapons issues, including \n     ``considering safety, security, and control issues for \n     existing weapons''. The Council plays a critical role in \n     advising Congress in matters relating to nuclear weapons.\n       (12) It is essential that the President receive well-\n     informed, objective, and honest opinions from his advisors \n     and technical experts regarding the safety, security, and \n     reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile.\n       (b) Policy.--\n       (1) In general.--It is the policy of the United States--\n       (A) to maintain a safe, secure, and reliable nuclear \n     weapons stockpile; and\n       (B) as long as other nations covet or control nuclear \n     weapons or other weapons of mass destruction, to retain a \n     credible nuclear deterrent.\n       (2) Nuclear weapons stockpile.--It is in the security \n     interest of the United States to sustain the United States \n     nuclear weapons stockpile through programs relating to \n     stockpile stewardship, subcritical experiments, maintenance \n     of the weapons laboratories, and protection of the \n     infrastructure of the weapons complex.\n       (3) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (A) the United States should retain a triad of strategic \n     nuclear forces sufficient to deter any future hostile foreign \n     leadership with access to strategic nuclear forces from \n     acting against our vital interests;\n       (B) the United States should continue to maintain nuclear \n     forces of sufficient size and capability to hold at risk a \n     broad range of assets valued by such political and military \n     leaders; and\n       (C) the advice of the persons required to provide the \n     President and Congress with assurances of the safety, \n     security and reliability of the nuclear weapons force should \n     be scientifically based, without regard for politics, and of \n     the highest quality and integrity.\n       (c) Advice and Opinions Regarding Nuclear Weapons \n     Stockpile.--Any director of a nuclear weapons laboratory or \n     member of the Joint Nuclear Weapons Council, or the Commander \n     of United States Strategic Command, may submit to the \n     President or Congress advice or opinion in disagreement with, \n     or in addition to, the advice presented by the Secretary of \n     Energy or Secretary of Defense to the President, the National \n     Security Council, or Congress, as the case may be, regarding \n     the safety, security, and reliability of the nuclear weapons \n     stockpile.\n       (d) Expression of Individual Views.--A representative of \n     the President may not take any action against, or otherwise \n     constrain, a director of a nuclear weapons laboratory, a \n     member of the Joint Nuclear Weapons Council, or the Commander \n     of United States Strategic Command for presenting individual \n     views to the President, the National Security Council, or \n     Congress regarding the safety, security, and reliability of \n     the nuclear weapons stockpile.\n       (e) Definitions.--\n       (1) Representative of the president.--The term \n     ``representative of the President'' means the following:\n       (A) Any official of the Department of Defense, the \n     Department of Energy, or the Office of Management and Budget \n     who is appointed by the President.\n       (B) Any member of the National Security Council.\n       (C) Any member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n       (2) Nuclear weapons laboratory.--The term ``nuclear weapons \n     laboratory'' means any of the following:\n       (A) Los Alamos National Laboratory.\n       (B) Livermore National Laboratory.\n       (C) Sandia National Laboratories.\n\n  The amendment (No. 607), as modified further, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle E of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1075. LIMITATION ON USE OF COOPERATIVE THREAT REDUCTION \n                   FUNDS FOR DESTRUCTION OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS.\n\n       (a) Limitation.--No funds authorized to be appropriated \n     under this or any other Act for fiscal year 1998 for \n     Cooperative Threat Reduction programs may be obligated or \n     expended for chemical weapons destruction activities, \n     including for the planning, design, or construction of a \n     chemical weapons destruction facility or for the \n     dismantlement of an existing chemical weapons production \n     facility, until the President submits to Congress a written \n     certification under subsection (b).\n       (b) Presidential Certification.--A certification under this \n     subsection is either of the following certifications:\n       (1) A certification that--\n       (A) Russia is making reasonable progress toward the \n     implementation of the Bilateral Destruction Agreement;\n       (B) the United States and Russia have made substantial \n     progress toward the resolution, to the satisfaction of the \n     United States, of outstanding compliance issues under the \n     Wyoming Memorandum of Understanding and the Bilateral \n     Destruction Agreement; and\n       (C) Russia has fully and accurately declared all \n     information regarding its unitary and binary chemical \n     weapons, chemical weapons facilities, and other facilities \n     associated with chemical weapons.\n       (2) A certification that the national security interests of \n     the United States could be undermined by a United States \n     policy not to carry out chemical weapons destruction \n     activities under the Cooperative Threat Reduction programs \n     for which funds are authorized to be appropriated under this \n     or any other Act for fiscal year 1998.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) The term ``Bilateral Destruction Agreement'' means the \n     Agreement Between the United States of America and the Union \n     of Soviet Socialist Republics on Destruction and \n     Nonproduction of Chemical Weapons and on Measures to \n     Facilitate the Multilateral Convention on Banning Chemical \n     Weapons, signed on June 1, 1990.\n       (2) The term ``Chemical Weapons Convention'' means the \n     Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, \n     Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their \n     Destruction, opened for signature on January 13, 1993.\n       (3) The term ``Cooperative Threat Reduction program'' means \n     a program specified in section 1501(b) of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 (Public Law \n     104-201: 110 Stat. 2731; 50 U.S.C. 2362 note).\n       (4) The term ``Wyoming Memorandum of Understanding'' means \n     the Memorandum of Understanding Between the Government of the \n     United States of America and the Government of the Union of \n     Soviet Socialist Republics Regarding a Bilateral Verification \n     Experiment and Data Exchange Related to Prohibition on \n     Chemical Weapons, signed at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on \n     September 23, 1989.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 799\n\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could be recognized to speak on this amendment.\n  Does the Senator from New Mexico wish to modify his amendment? I \nwould like to make sure I am speaking on the amendment that is before \nthe body before I speak on this amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, yes, I do intend to modify the \namendment, so that it strikes $118 million that was added by the \ncommittee for the space-based laser, and I will delete the portion of \nthe earlier amendment that I offered which allocated those funds to the \nAir Force and the Navy flying hours.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could ask the Senator to respond to this question: \nWould that knock out the entire funding for the space-based laser?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, that does not. It leaves the funding at \nthe level the administration requested, which is $29 million, but it \nwould delete the initial $118 million that was added by the committee.\n  Mr. LOTT. So in the bill now there is about $145 million?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, $148 million in the bill at the present \ntime, and this gets it back to the administration requested level of \n$49.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, just so the Members will understand fully \nwhat the Senator from New Mexico is doing, his amendment, as I \nunderstand it, would knock out $118 million, leaving only $28.8 million \nto be available for the space-based laser program.\n  I rise to offer my support for this space-based laser and to oppose \nthe amendment to strike funding of this important program. Clearly, one \nof the most serious threats facing us today is that of ballistic \nmissiles. As rogue nations or terrorist organizations have the ability \nto develop more sophisticated means to deploy weapons of mass \ndestruction, it is incumbent upon us, then, to develop the wherewithal \nto render those threats ineffective. Increasing funding for other \nprograms, as the Senator originally intended, by taking it out of the \nspace-based laser would have been a mistake, and I think to have this \nkind of cutback down to only $28 million reduces our ability to really \ndevelop the sophistication and the degree of the development of the \nprogram that we have the capability to reach.\n  It is time that we actually do something on this now. We have talked \nabout it, we have had funding, we have had progress made, there has \nbeen real development capability reached, yet we continue to sort of \nshove it off and say, ``Someday. Right now this threat is not serious \nenough.'' I maintain it is very serious.\n\n[[Page S7187]]\n\n  We currently have no effective defense to counter the ballistic \nmissile threat, particularly in the early launch phases when defensive \nmeasures are the most effective. I think the American people would be \nalarmed if they had an opportunity to stop and think about this, the \nfact that we have not developed this effective defense to this threat.\n  Space-based laser offers potentially one of the most effective \nsolutions to this threat, utilizing relatively mature technologies for \nboost phase missile defense because we have been working on this, \nbecause we have expended funds in this area. So not only does this \ncapability provide an effective protective blanket, but it also serves \nas a strong deterrent against the launch in the first place, as the \nboost phase interceptor ensures a destroyed missile falls within the \nshort range of the launch site. So that is a very important factor. It \nwould be a deterrent to launching in the first place, if you knew it \nmight, as a matter of fact, land generally in the area or in the \ncountry that fired such a missile.\n  This inherent capability offers the initial and most effective \ndefense against ballistic missiles. Coupled with terminal and midcourse \ndefenses that we are now procuring, it provides an architecture that is \nrobust to a wide variety of threats.\n  Moreover, the program is achievable, it is achievable, within current \ntechnical and political constraints. The program received a very \npositive endorsement from the Ballistic Missile Defense Office \nIndependent Review Team which has assessed the program as low risk and \ncapable of achieving a 2005 launch goal, yet it is fully compliant with \nthe ABM Treaty. It in no way commits to us an operational system, but \nit is absolutely essential to the research and development efforts that \npreserve our option for such a program in the future.\n  Space-based laser is clearly the future national missile defense \nsystem of choice. It affords us the opportunity to protect the Nation, \nour military forces and our allies against the ever-growing threat for \nballistic missile-deployed weapons of mass destruction. In fact, I \nthink it is the greatest threat that we face today in the world. We \ncannot ignore it. We should not delay taking actions any further.\n  The early boost phase negation potential that spaced-based lasers can \nprovide is essential. It is a critical component of our future national \ndefense. We must ensure that the space-based option is carried forward \nwith vigor and a sense of priority. If we cut it down to only $28 \nmillion, or something short of $29 million, we are not going to be able \nto go forward with this mature program in a vigorous way in one that \ngives it priority.\n\n  By the way, the people we have running this program now are very good \nand they are doing a good job. They have gotten the Secretary of \nDefense's attention to this program. So as this technology matures, I \nthink it is clear that we now are at the point where we should build a \ndemonstrator and show that, in fact, it will work.\n  I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for the work he has done on \nthis, both in the committee and on the floor. Senator Smith is prepared \nto debate this issue further. Without his efforts, without his \nattention, this program would not be where it is today and we would not \nbe able to go forward with it in the way we need to now.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment to cut the bulk \nof the funding for the space laser program.\n  Mr. President, I thank the chairman again for his support in this \narea. This is something we clearly should be doing. I hope the \namendment will be defeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Dr. Robert \nSimon, who is detailed to my staff from the Department of Energy, be \npermitted privileges of the floor for the duration of the debate and \nduring any votes occurring on that bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 799, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I send a modified version of the \namendment to the desk and ask that it be so modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 799), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1009. DECREASED AMOUNTS FOR SPACE BASED LASER PROGRAM.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the total \n     amount authorized to be appropriated under section 201(4) for \n     the space based laser program shall be reduced by \n     $118,000,000, and not more than $28,800,000 shall be \n     available for the space based laser program.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 647\n\n   (Purpose: (Relating to the participation of the national security \n    activities of the Department of Energy in the Hispanic Outreach \n                     Initiative of the Department)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent it be in order \nfor me to offer an amendment numbered 647. I think it has been cleared \non both sides. I will describe it once the clerk has reported the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 647.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 458, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 3159. PARTICIPATION OF NATIONAL SECURITY ACTIVITIES IN \n                   HISPANIC OUTREACH INITIATIVE OF THE DEPARTMENT \n                   OF ENERGY.\n\n       The Secretary of Energy shall take appropriate actions, \n     including the allocation of funds, to ensure the \n     participation of the national security activities of the \n     Department of Energy in the Hispanic Outreach Initiative of \n     the Department of Energy.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, this amendment authorizes the Secretary \nof Energy to ensure full participation of the Department of Energy in \nthe very successful Hispanic Outreach Program that that department has \nhad.\n  In September 1995, the Secretary of Energy announced a strategic plan \nto address the needs, talents and capabilities of the nation's Hispanic \ncommunity.\n  This strategic plan calls for the Department to take effective steps \nto further the participation of DOE in educational programs, \nparticularly in the fields of science and technology that serve \nHispanic students.\n  In fiscal year 1996 the DOE set a goal of $20 million for funding \nHispanic Service Educational Institutions and Initiatives. This level \nof investment provides significant dividends to the Hispanic community \nas well as to the Department of Energy.\n  Other programs are included within the Hispanic Outreach Initiative \nto encourage improved investment, training, and placement for Hispanic \npopulation in business using the internet and the Hispanic Radio \nNetwork.\n  As a result of such initiatives, Hispanic employment at the \nDepartment of Energy has increased at all grade levels during the past \nfour years.\n  The amendment I am offering today directs the Secretary of Energy to \nensure that all components of the Department participate fully in this \ninitiative in order to achieve the widest possible impact.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment as an \neffective means to benefit the taxpayer and improve opportunities for \nthe Hispanic community.\n  I believe we can take action on the amendment at this point. I know \nof no Senator that wishes to speak in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 647) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask we lay aside the pending business \nand consider amendment 657.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I object. I wish to speak on the \namendment that is before the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Reserving the right to object, if the \nSenator wishes to speak for a couple of minutes on another matter, I \nask unanimous consent that the Senator's time does not come out of the \ntime allocated for this amendment.\n\n[[Page S7188]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would not.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I have no objection.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 657\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for increased burdensharing by United States \n                                allies)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 657.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle E of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1075. DEFENSE BURDENSHARING.\n\n       (a) Efforts To Increase Allied Burdensharing.--The \n     President shall seek to have each nation that has cooperative \n     military relations with the United States (including security \n     agreements, basing arrangements, or mutual participation in \n     multinational military organizations or operations) take one \n     or more of the following actions:\n       (1) For any nation in which United States military \n     personnel are assigned to permanent duty ashore, increase its \n     financial contributions to the payment of the nonpersonnel \n     costs incurred by the United States Government for stationing \n     United States military personnel in that nation, with a goal \n     of achieving by September 30, 2000, 75 percent of such costs. \n     An increase in financial contributions by any nation under \n     this paragraph may include the elimination of taxes, fees, or \n     other charges levied on United States military personnel, \n     equipment, or facilities stationed in that nation.\n       (2) Increase its annual budgetary outlays for national \n     defense as a percentage of its gross domestic product by 10 \n     percent or at least to a level commensurate to that of the \n     United States by September 30, 1998.\n       (3) Increase its annual budgetary outlays for foreign \n     assistance (to promote democratization, economic \n     stabilization, transparency arrangements, defense economic \n     conversion, respect for the rule of law, and internationally \n     recognized human rights) by 10 percent or at least to a level \n     commensurate to that of the United States by September 30, \n     1998.\n       (4) Increase the amount of military assets (including \n     personnel, equipment, logistics, support and other resources) \n     that it contributes, or would be prepared to contribute, to \n     multinational military activities worldwide.\n       (b) Authorities To Encourage Actions by United States \n     Allies.--In seeking the actions described in subsection (a) \n     with respect to any nation, or in response to a failure by \n     any nation to undertake one or more of such actions, the \n     President may take any of the following measures to the \n     extent otherwise authorized by law:\n       (1) Reduce the end strength level of members of the Armed \n     Forces assigned to permanent duty ashore in that nation.\n       (2) Impose on that nation fees or other charges similar to \n     those that such nation imposes on United States forces \n     stationed in that nation.\n       (3) Reduce (through rescission, impoundment, or other \n     appropriate procedures as authorized by law) the amount the \n     United States contributes to the NATO Civil Budget, Military \n     Budget, or Security Investment Program.\n       (4) Suspend, modify, or terminate any bilateral security \n     agreement the United States has with that nation, consistent \n     with the terms of such agreement.\n       (5) Reduce (through rescission, impoundment or other \n     appropriate procedures as authorized by law) any United \n     States bilateral assistance appropriated for that nation.\n       (6) Take any other action the President determines to be \n     appropriate as authorized by law.\n       (c) Report on Progress in Increasing Allied \n     Burdensharing.--Not later than March 1, 1998, the Secretary \n     of Defense shall submit to Congress a report on--\n       (1) steps taken by other nations to complete the actions \n     described in subsection (a);\n       (2) all measures taken by the President, including those \n     authorized in subsection (b), to achieve the actions \n     described in subsection (a);\n       (3) the difference between the amount allocated by other \n     nations for each of the actions described in subsection (a) \n     during the period beginning on March 1, 1996, and ending on \n     February 28, 1997, and during the period beginning on March \n     1, 1997, and ending on February 28, 1998; and\n       (4) the budgetary savings to the United States that are \n     expected to accrue as a result of the steps described under \n     paragraph (1).\n       (d) Report on National Security Bases for Forward \n     Deployment and Burdensharing Relationships.--(1) In order to \n     ensure the best allocation of budgetary resources, the \n     President shall undertake a review of the status of elements \n     of the United States Armed Forces that are permanently \n     stationed outside the United States.

The report shall be submitted not \n     later than March 1, 1998, in classified and unclassified \n     form.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this amendment has been reviewed by both \nsides. Senator Thurmond, as chairman of the committee, and Senator \nLevin, as the ranking minority member, have accepted this amendment. It \nrelates to the issue of burdensharing. It is an amendment which would \nnot withdraw any troops, but would ask that our allies assume greater \nresponsibility in helping to defray the expenses of the American troops \nwhich have been positioned overseas.\n  The amendment, I think, accurately reflects the postcold-war \nenvironment and the budget challenges which we face.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 657) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 799, As Modified\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President how much time remains on \nour side on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes and 30 seconds.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the \nBingaman amendment which would cut funding for the space-based laser \nprogram--not just cuts it, it devastates the program.\n  In its markup of the DOD authorization bill, the committee increased \nthe funding for the program by $118 million. During the committee's \nmarkup, the Senator from New Mexico did offer an amendment to delete \nthe increase. This was defeated in committee on a bipartisan basis. It \nwas not a party-line vote. It is my sincere hope, Mr. President, that \nthe Senate will follow suit as the committee did and defeat this \namendment today or tomorrow when we vote.\n  Mr. President, let me explain why additional funds are needed for \nthis very important program. The President's budget request included \nonly $30 million for the space-based laser. This is insufficient \nfunding for the program to continue making the technical progress that \nit has been making.\n  The Department of Defense is currently considering ways to increase \nthis level of funding in the outyears, but there is a major deficit now \nfor the Fiscal Year 1998. This program, the space-based laser, is the \nlast remaining space-based laser missile defense left. The last one. If \nwe allow the program to die, then we will have wasted well over $1 \nbillion in investment, literally wasted. We will not see the fruits of \nthat investment and we will have given up the option of deploying the \nmost effective national and theater boost phase missile defense system \nknown to man.\n  The space-based laser program has been one of the best managed \nprograms in the history of our ballistic missile\n\n[[Page S7189]]\n\ndefense efforts. It is not always the case that we can stand here and \nsay that a program has been well managed. For over 10 years it has \ncontinued to make remarkable technical progress while remaining on \nschedule and within cost. How many other programs in DOD, or, indeed, \nin the U.S. Government, can we say that about? Not too many.\n\n  Mr. President, could I have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please come to order.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, if we do not allow the \nspace-based laser program to proceed, we are going to erode the Defense \nDepartment's expertise in laser technology. There are other laser \nprograms in DOD. The SBL, the space-based laser, represents a \nsignificant proportion of DOD's corporate knowledge about lasers and \nall of DOD's knowledge about space-based lasers. All this knowledge, \nall of this technology will simply be thrown out the window if we gut \nthis program.\n  This program has strong bipartisan support. It has had it for over \nmany years. The Armed Services Committee has increased funding for this \nprogram in each of the last two fiscal years. In fiscal year 1997, for \nexample, the committee recommended and the Congress and the President \napproved an increase of $70 million. DOD acknowledges that the \nadditional funding is necessary if the program is to continue making \nthe technical progress that it is making.\n  Therefore, the bill before the Senate today, the bill in its current \nform, the DOD bill, includes an increase of $118 million for that \nprogram. This amendment offered by the Senator from New Mexico will \ntake that $118 billion out and basically stop the program in process.\n  I must say, every year, year after year, in all the 7 years that I \nhave been on the Armed Services Committee here in the Senate, somebody \ncomes out and tries to cut this program. Every year I am standing up \nhere defending it, trying to make people aware of the importance of \nthis program.\n  Let me explain why this specific funding level was chosen. The SBL \nprogram will complete its current development phase this year. The next \nlogical step for a space-based laser is to develop and launch a \ntechnology readiness demonstrator. This is, in fact, the recommendation \nof an independent review team, the IRT, that was established by the \ndirector of the ballistic missile defense organization earlier this \nyear to study the future of the SBL program.\n  The IRT recommended proceeding with a space demonstrator in fiscal \nyear 1998 that could be launched in the year 2005. The funding increase \nin the pending bill is the same amount as that recommended by BMDO, \nBallistic Missile Defense Office's independent review team--no more, no \nless. Such an SBL technology demonstrator would be compliant with the \nABM Treaty. For those who are concerned about that, it is treaty \ncompliant. And both Secretary of Defense Cohen and officials from the \nNational Security Council have confirmed that an SBL readiness \ndemonstrator would be treaty compliant as long as it is not an \noperational system prototype.\n  Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please come to order. The \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Additionally, the Department of Defense \ncompliance review group has previously reviewed the SBL readiness \ndemonstrator and deemed such a program compliant with the ABM Treaty. \nSo the Air Force and BMDO have signed a memorandum of agreement to \nproceed with the SBL program. The Air Force and BMDO endorsed the \ndevelopment of an SBL readiness demonstrator and have done the \npreliminary work on how to proceed with such a program, and the Air \nForce has said if such a program proceeds, they will establish this \nprogram management office at the Philips lab at Kirkland Air Force base \nin New Mexico.\n  The bottom line is, a readiness demonstrator is the next logical step \nfor SBL. It doesn't commit the United States to deployment or \ndevelopment of an operational SBL system, but it preserves the option \nfor that decision after the year 2005. If the Bingaman amendment were \nto be agreed to, this option would be precluded and we would be left \nwith a space-based laser program lacking focus and lacking any logical \ndirection. It is one of those situations where if we do take the focus \nand take the direction away, it makes all the money we have spent in \nthe past, all the $1 billion, wasted, down the drain, when we are now \non the threshold of being able to see it all come to fruition and see \nthe space-based laser program take its proper place in the defense \narsenal of the United States.\n  So I urge my colleagues tomorrow, when we vote, to oppose this \namendment as we have done year after year after year, to oppose the \namendment of the Senator from New Mexico and defeat the amendment, and \nallow the space-based laser program to continue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 9 a.m. on \nFriday, Senator Feingold be recognized to offer an amendment, re: Air \nForce jets, and there be 30 minutes for debate, 20 minutes under the \ncontrol of Senator Feingold, 10 minutes under the control of Senator \nThurmond, and no amendments be in order to the Feingold amendment. My \nunderstanding is it has been cleared on the other side.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. At 9:30 a.m., the Senate will resume the Bingaman \namendment, with 15 minutes remaining for debate and a vote occurring at \n9:45 a.m. on Friday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, it is my understanding the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona and the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nwill engage in a debate on a matter that is related to the underlying \nmeasure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, a number of us will be proceeding, \nmomentarily, on an amendment with respect to Cambodia. I am just \nwaiting for the language to arrive.\n  Mr. President, I understand, under parliamentary procedure, the time \nis controlled?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, how much time--\n  Mr. McCAIN. I believe the parliamentary situation is an amendment by \nSenator Warner and Senator Hutchison. Could I ask for the parliamentary \nsituation, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the Bingaman amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think we would then lay that aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 14 minutes for Senator Bingaman and \n1 minute, 49 seconds in opposition.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. Under the previous \nunanimous consent request just propounded by the Senator from Virginia \non behalf of the distinguished leader, Mr. Lott, and the chairman, Mr. \nThurmond, I would have thought that would have handled this situation. \nAm I incorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That does handle the situation in the morning, \nbut we still have this time remaining tonight.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, is it appropriate at this point --I ask \nunanimous consent that we temporarily set aside the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Parliamentary inquiry. That then preserves that amount of \ntime left to each side tonight, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, are we now open to amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, we are.\n  Mr. KERRY. I understand there is no controlled time at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n[[Page S7190]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 800\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as I mentioned, Senator Hagel, Senator Bob \nKerrey, Senator Chuck Robb, Senator Max Cleland, Senator John McCain \nand myself are joining together to introduce a resolution with respect \nto Cambodia. At this point, I will yield the floor. Senator McCain will \nlead off.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Massachusetts will shortly be \nintroducing a amendment. That amendment very briefly, condemns what has \nhappened in Cambodia. It calls for the United States to take action, \nincluding cutting off any assistance that is being provided to \nCambodia. It calls on ASEAN nations in the region to cooperate in \ntaking every step that is possible to restore democracy and a rule of \nlaw in Cambodia.\n  Mr. President, as I said, the Senator from Massachusetts will be \nshortly sending that sense-of-the-Senate amendment to the desk. For the \nsake of time, I would like to comment on it at this time because, as \nthe Senator from Massachusetts mentioned, there are four others besides \nthe Senator from Massachusetts and I who want to speak on this issue. I \nwill be relatively brief.\n  A terrible thing has happened in a country that deserves far, far \nbetter; a country that has been put through, in the opinion of many, \nthe worst genocide in this century; a country that had a large \npercentage, some estimate as high as 20 to 30 percent of its population \nexecuted by the infamous Khmer Rouge led by Pol Pot. I need not remind \nmy colleagues that at great expense, some $3 billion, the United \nNations, with the full cooperation and efforts of the United States, \nwas able to conduct what was judged to be a free and fair election \nin Cambodia. The result of that election was a democratically elected \ngovernment which had two co-prime ministers: Mr. Hun Sen and Prince \nRanariddh, the son of Prince Norodom Sihanouk.\n\n  Mr. President, I give this background because those of us who were \ninvolved in that effort had high hopes, high hopes 4 years ago after \nthat election, which was conducted by and supervised by many nations \nthroughout the world. Now a terrible tragedy has again befallen \nCambodia. Hun Sen, using the philosophy that unfortunately he has \nadhered to for some time that power is the flower that blossoms from \nthe barrel of a gun, has begun killing people, imprisoning people, and \nhas taken over the government of the country.\n  I grieve for the people of Cambodia. I grieve for those very gentle \nKhmer people who deserve far, far better than they are getting today.\n  Should the United States send the military into Cambodia? Obviously \nnot. Should the United States advocate some military action? I don't \nthink that's possible. But I believe that the United States of America \nmust bring every possible pressure to bear on Cambodia to restore, as \nsoon as possible, democracy and the rule of law. We have every right to \nexpect our neighbors and friends in the region to lead as well as \nfollow the United States in this effort.\n  Mr. President, if we allow this to happen, it is a tremendous setback \nfor democracy and freedom, not only in that tragic little country but \nfor the entire region. If Hun Sen is able to get away with this \nunpunished and if this situation goes unrectified, then I fear for \nother areas of the world, including Burma, including others where \ndemocracy has a very tenuous hold.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to join with Senator Hagel, Senator Kerrey \nof Nebraska, as well as Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, Senator \nCleland, and Senator Robb, in decrying this situation and urging that \nall steps be taken to rectify it, because all of us have the \ncommonality of service in Vietnam, its neighbor. I believe if there is \nany potency to our remarks, I hope that it is because of our collective \nview, on both sides of the aisle, that urges us and impels us to come \nforward and speak in this emotional and strong fashion.\n  Mr. President, yesterday I addressed the situation in Cambodia. I \nfocused my remarks on the tragedy befallen a strife-torn country that \nsaw the flickering light of democracy suddenly and violently \nextinguished. Today, I join with a number of my colleagues to introduce \na resolution expressing the sense of Congress that the violence must \nstop, that the United States should call an emergency meeting of the \nUnited Nations Security Council to consider all options to restore the \npeace, to work with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to \nrestore the rule of law, to suspend financial assistance to the \nGovernment of Cambodia, and to urge other donor nations to do likewise.\n  Congress and the administration must not minimize the gravity of the \nsituation in Cambodia. One of the century's most horrific chapters took \nplace less than 20 years ago in a nation once known for tranquility. \nThe end of Cambodia's holocaust did not bring peace; it brought 12 \nyears of civil war. The culmination of an exhaustive diplomatic effort \nwas the 1991 Paris Accord and the 1993 election that installed the \ncoalition that governed until 2 days ago.\n  The coup d'etat instigated by Second Prime Minister Hun Sen has \nseriously set back the cause of peace and freedom in Cambodia. The \ndeliberate and brutal campaign to locate and imprison or execute \nmembers of FUNCINPEC loyal to ousted First Prime Minister Prince \nRanarridh illuminates all too well the nature of a regime dominated by \nHun Sen. A forceful and feared individual, Hun Sen will respond only if \nthe message is conveyed in the strongest terms that the international \ncommunity, led, if necessary, by the United States, will accept nothing \nless than the cessation of violence and the initiation of serious \nnegotiations aimed at restoring a democratic form of government.\n  The Cambodian people demonstrated by their overwhelming response to \nthe 1993 elections that they truly desire to live under the rule of \nlaw. They left no doubt that they understand and appreciate democracy. \nThey deserve better than to see an elected government removed by force \nand replaced by the very regime that harshly ruled for years until the \n1991 peace accord. We introduce this amendment because the time to act \nis now. The administration must respond in the strongest terms to the \ncoup d'etat and resulting violence. Congress as an institution must go \non record as strenuously opposing the recent developments in Cambodia. \nWe must let the world know that we stand as one in our conviction to \nsee democracy restored in Cambodia.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I, too, rise to support the amendment that \nwill be offered shortly by the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \n[Senator Kerry]. First of all, we must, here in this Senate, be alert \nto the risk to lives of Americans in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. That is the \nfirst order of business of this resolution. We have lives at risk \nthere. An Ambassador and his family's lives are at risk.\n  Second, though, what we are saying here is, now is not the time to \nquit in Cambodia.\n  For all the reasons cited by Senator McCain of Arizona, all the \nreasons that he has cited about the terrible suffering that has gone on \nin Cambodia for the last 30 years, in addition to that, we have a \ntoehold of democracy there. The rule of law is at stake. An agreement \nwas signed in Paris in 1991, and an election with 90 percent of the \npopulation voting in 1993, we have a great success possible in \nCambodia, and now is not the time for us to say, ``Well, it's Cambodia, \nit's a long ways away, it is not important.'' It is important.\n  America needs to go to the Security Council of the United Nations and \nsay that we want to consider all options to make certain that the rule \nof law and democracy survive inside Cambodia.\n  We need to do the same thing with our allies in ASEAN to make certain \nthat the rule of law and democracy survive. We need to send with this \nresolution a strong message to the people of Cambodia that we are not \ngoing to back out, we are not going to walk away, we are not going to \ngive up, that we believe that democracy can survive in Cambodia, that \nthe rule of law can be preserved in Cambodia and that the United States \nof America is prepared to lead the international community in ensuring \nthat effort.\n  We have come a long ways in Cambodia. Only in the U.S. Congress is it \npossible for us to say we want to change something in the world and\n\n[[Page S7191]]\n\nthen take action and have it happen. That is what happened in Cambodia \nwith this agreement at a time in 1991 when almost nobody thought it was \npossible, and then the election in 1993 that even fewer thought was \npossible.\n  There is a lot at stake here for the United States of America. As we \ntalk to China about democracy, we do not want them to say, ``Look what \nhappened in Cambodia,'' or Vietnam similarly. We are a Nation that has \nbeen successful because we have been a defender of democracy and the \nrule of law, and we have to defend that principle inside the nation of \nCambodia.\n  I am pleased to join with the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts [Senator Kerry], and others who are cosponsoring this \nresolution. It is a terribly important resolution, and I am hopeful and \nbelieve, in fact, that the administration will take it seriously and \nwill act upon it. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, the Senator from \nArizona and the Senator from Nebraska, and I see the Senator from \nGeorgia is here, and he will speak momentarily. And the junior Senator \nfrom Nebraska, Senator Hagel is also here.\n  Mr. President, each of us invested a portion of our youth in \nSoutheast Asia, and each of us are now investing a considerable amount \nof our concern as U.S. Senators of both parties with events as they \ncontinue in Southeast Asia. All of us remain convinced that this is a \nregion that is vital to our international security interests. It is an \narea where we have a great deal at stake, and nowhere more so, really, \nthan in Cambodia.\n  As everybody knows, as a matter of history, the United States played \na critical role in the 1970's in events in Cambodia. And ever since \nthen, the Cambodian people have been reaping the harvest of much of \nwhat has gone on in the region as a whole--the invasion by Vietnam, the \ninfluence of China and, most important, the terrible, terrible acts of \nthe Khmer Rouge, the ``killing fields'' as we came to know them in this \ncountry.\n\n  It is ironic that at the very moment when the Khmer Rouge is at its \nweakest in recent years, when Pol Pot appears to be a prisoner and when \nthe leadership has defected, when the army, as a whole, has decided to \ncome into the system, that the system is now itself in convulsions and \nrejecting the process that so many people in the international \ncommunity have invested so much in over the last years.\n  More than $2 billion has been invested in Cambodia by the \ninternational community. We have put shy of $200 million into Cambodia, \nbut we have invested enormously in the notion that democracy can work \nin a region where it is important to prove that democracy can work. It \nis very important to all of us in the U.S. Senate and to the United \nNations to guarantee that we are not now going to stand by and watch or \nrefuse to be engaged or to take sufficient diplomatic steps to, once \nagain, summon the energy of the world to try to help restore in this \ncritical moment the rule of law and democracy in Cambodia.\n  The amendment that we offer sets forth a set of specific steps that \nwe think should be taken by the administration and others in order to \ntry to guarantee that we do restore peace and democracy to Cambodia.\n  Those steps are, first of all, that the parties should immediately \ncease the use of violence in Cambodia; second, that the United States \nshould take all immediate necessary steps to ensure the safety of \nAmericans in Cambodia; third, that the United States should call an \nemergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council to consider \nall options that are available to us in order to restore peace in \nCambodia; fourth, that the United States and ASEAN together should try \nto take all steps necessary to restore democracy and the rule of law in \nCambodia; fifth, that United States assistance to the Government of \nCambodia should remain suspended until violence ends the democratically \nelected government is restored to power, and necessary steps have been \ntaken to ensure that the elections scheduled for 1998 are going to be \nheld; and finally, that the United States should take all necessary \nsteps to encourage other donor nations to stop their assistance as part \nof a multinational effort.\n  Mr. President, I have traveled to Cambodia on a number of different \noccasions, together with Senator Smith when we were doing the work of \nthe POW-MIA Committee, and I have traveled other than on those \njourneys. I met at great length with Prime Minister Hun Sen, perhaps \nfor a longer period of time and on more occasions than anyone in the \nSenate, and I can say to my colleagues that he is a tough and hard \nbargainer and, clearly, a survivor of the wars of that region. But he \nis an intelligent person who, ultimately, I believe, will be committed \nto the restoration of the fundamentals of the process that we invested \nin in Paris. It would be my hope and plea that Second Prime Minister \nHun Sen would respect all of the investment of outside nations and all \nof the energies of those nations over the years in order to try to \nsustain the extraordinarily important effort that we have engaged in to \ntry to provide democracy for this region.\n  In 1993, 90 percent of the eligible voters of Cambodia went to the \npolls and expressed their wish to have an elected government, and that \nelected government has now been rejected by violence in the last few \ndays. There is no other word to use but to use the word ``coup.'' I \nknow our Government has hesitated to do that, but for the last 3 days, \nthat is what has existed. Certainly, one would hope that will not be \nwhat remains there, and there is time yet to prove to the world that \nthis was not a successful coup if the international community \nundertakes an emergency momentary effort to restore order and the long-\nterm capacity of the Cambodian People's Party and FUNCINPEC to \ncooperate with each other as well as with incipient new parties that \nwant to express their political views in a democratic Cambodia.\n  But what is clear, Mr. President, is that absent massive, urgent \ndiplomatic energy expended by the United States and by those countries \nthat have already invested so much, this moment could slip by, and the \ngreat tragedy would be that as the Khmer Rouge have come out of the \njungle, as Cambodia has been accepted into ASEAN, as we have suddenly \nextended most-favored-nation status, as it has moved into this new \neconomic acceptance and new era of possibilities, it will have \nreverted, by some inexorable and unexplainable force, to the very \nviolence that characterized it for so long.\n  That doesn't have to happen, and this amendment is an effort to \nguarantee that it will not happen. So my hope is that the thrust of \nthis effort will be heard, not just in Cambodia, but in the United \nNations and in our own State Department and among those nations that \nhave already committed so much energy. We cannot and we must not allow \nthese events to go unattended. It is my hope this expression of our \nviews will act as a catalyst to prevent that from happening.\n  I understand that my colleagues also would like to speak.\n  Mr. President, I send the amendment to the desk, and I ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the pending \namendment will be set aside. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kerry], for himself, \n     Mr. McCain, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Robb, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Cleland and \n     Mr. Biden, proposes an amendment numbered 800.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, add the following new \n     section:\n\n     SEC.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that:\n       (1) during the 1970s and 1980s Cambodia was wracked by \n     political conflict, war and violence, including genocide \n     perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge from 1975 to 1979;\n       (2) the 1991 Paris Agreements on a Comprehensive Political \n     Settlement of the Cambodia Conflict set the stage for a \n     process of political accommodation and national \n     reconciliation among Cambodia's warring parties;\n       (3) the international community engaged in a massive, more \n     than $2 billion effort to ensure peace, democracy and \n     prosperity in Cambodia following the Paris Accords;\n\n[[Page S7192]]\n\n       (4) the Cambodian people clearly demonstrated their support \n     for democracy when 90 percent of eligible Cambodian voters \n     participated in UN-sponsored elections in 1993;\n       (5) since the 1993 elections, Cambodia has made economic \n     progress, as evidenced by the decision last month of the \n     Association of Southeast Asian Nations to extend membership \n     to Cambodia;\n       (6) tensions within the ruling Cambodian coalition have \n     erupted into violence in recent months as both parties \n     solicit support from former Khmer Rouge elements, which had \n     been increasingly marginalized in Cambodian politics;\n       (7) in March, 19 Cambodians were killed and more than 100 \n     were wounded in a grenade attack on political demonstrators \n     supportive of the Funcinpec and the Khmer Nation Party;\n       (8) during June fighting erupted in Phnom Penh between \n     forces loyal to First Prime Minister Prince Ranariddh and \n     second Prime Minister Hun Sen;\n       (9) on July 5, Second Prime Minister Hun Sen deposed the \n     First Prime Minister in a violent coup d'etat;\n       (10) forces loyal to Hun Sen have executed former Interior \n     Minister Ho Sok, and targeted other political opponents loyal \n     to Prince Ranariddh;\n       (11) democracy and stability in Cambodia are threatened by \n     the continued use of violence to resolve political tensions;\n       (12) the Administration has suspended assistance for one \n     month in response to the deteriorating situation in Cambodia;\n       (13) the Association of Southeast Asian Nations has decided \n     to delay indefinitely Cambodian membership.\n       (b) Sense of Congress--It is the sense of Congress that:\n       (1) the parties should immediately cease the use of \n     violence in Cambodia;\n       (2) the United States should take all necessary steps to \n     ensure the safety of American citizens in Cambodia;\n       (3) the United States should call an emergency meeting of \n     the United Nations Security Council to consider all options \n     to restore peace in Cambodia;\n       (4) the United States and ASEAN should work together to \n     take immediate steps to restore democracy and the rule of law \n     in Cambodia;\n       (5) U.S. assistance to the government of Cambodia should \n     remain suspended until violence ends, the democratically \n     elected government is restored to power, and the necessary \n     steps have been taken to ensure that the elections scheduled \n     for 1998 take place;\n       (6) the United States should take all necessary steps to \n     encourage other donor nations to suspend assistance as part \n     of a multinational effort\n\n  Mr. CLELAND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts. The United States is the \nleader of the free world. As the world's foremost democracy, it is our \nduty to take the lead in support of democratic efforts around the \nworld. This amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that the United \nStates should work with the U.N. Security Council and the ASEAN nations \nin an effort to return Cambodia to the path towards democracy that it \nwas on.\n  The First Prime Minister of Cambodia, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, has \nasked the U.N. Security Council for help. Cambodian Co-Premier Hun Sen \nseized power on Saturday. In light of the terrible tragedies the \nCambodian people have seen over the past several decades, it would be a \ncomplete shame to allow outstanding progress toward democracy to be \ndestroyed in one weekend of violence.\n  It is very important to restore the constitutional government to \nCambodia. Cambodia is scheduled to have elections in May of 1998. It is \nfear of the democratic process which I believe has led to this coup. \nOpponents of the coup have already been killed. We cannot allow \ndemocracy to fail to take root in this nation. The United States must \ntake the lead in this matter.\n  I urge, in the strongest terms, the Senate adopt this amendment. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am pleased to join the other five Senators \nwho are the original cosponsors of this particular amendment/sense-of-\nthe-Senate resolution. I join in the gravity that they have already \nexpressed and underlined about the situation that exists now in \nCambodia. All of us have spent time in the region. Many of us have \nspent time in Cambodia dealing with the principal figures that are \ninvolved in this particular incident. I myself have visited Phnom Penh \non a number of occasions. I have met in Cambodia with First Prime \nMinister Ranariddh, as well as Co- or Second Prime Minister Hun Sen on \na number of occasions there and on at least one occasion here. I am \nfamiliar with the difficulties. I watched the process evolve. I \nobserved the time period when the United Nations forces were there \nhelping to try to restore a semblance of stability and to try to \ndevelop some respect for the rule of law. We saw elections. Ninety \npercent of the people in Cambodia voted in those elections. We know the \ndifficulties that existed from the very outset.\n  As my colleagues who fought in Vietnam have already suggested, we \nhave a clash of leadership. Co-Premier Hun Sen is a strong and forceful \nleader. All of us who have met with him understand that. This, in \neffect, internationally is an appeal for him to understand that the \nUnited States cannot abide the conduct that he has been associated with \nor that has been carried out in his name in the last few days. We \ncannot stand by and allow additional genocide, additional violence, \nwhich is beyond the rule of law, to be condoned.\n  I happened to be the sponsor of a resolution several years ago that \nprovided for the collection of information that would be essential to \nany international tribunal that may deal with the atrocities that were \ncommitted by the Khmer Rouge in that terrible period under the \nleadership of Pol Pot and others who were involved in that particular \nperiod of genocide in Cambodia. Much progress has been made on that \nfront.\n  Much progress was being made in terms of understanding in Cambodia \nfor the rule of law and some essential elements of peace. All of this \nrepresents a setback. It is essential, as this resolution suggests, \nthat the United States exercise its leadership, working with ASEAN, \ngetting ASEAN to get involved as it is at least demonstrating some \ninitial signs of doing even though it is not a military organization, \nand the international community to speak with one voice and say to \nthose who would purport to represent the violent approach to taking and \nseizing power that is not obtained through the ballot, that the \ninternational community will not support you.\n  That is what this resolution that the six of us who fought in Vietnam \nare saying to our Government, please take a leadership role in \nmobilizing the international community to send a very strong message to \nHun Sen and those who follow his lead and send a message to the rest of \nthe international community to fall behind the progress that has \nalready been made in Cambodia and not to step back with the actions \nthat have been taken in the last few days.\n  We want to tell Hun Sen and others who might follow that lead that \nnot only we cannot support that, we are going to be actively opposing \nthat and hope that the rule of law and some degree of political \npluralism and respect for the principles of peace and democracy could \nbe restored.\n  With that, Mr. President, recognizing the presence on the floor of my \ncolleague from Nebraska, the junior Senator, Senator Hagel, and in \njoining with Senator McCain from Arizona, Senator Kerry from \nMassachusetts, Senator Kerrey from Nebraska, and Senator Cleland from \nGeorgia, I am pleased to support this particular amendment in the form \nof a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. I ask all of our colleagues to do \nlikewise.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HAGEL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President. Could I just ask my colleague's indulgence \nfor one moment?\n  Mr. HAGEL. Yes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Helms be added as a \ncosponsor. I believe you have Senator Biden on there as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise this evening to support and \ncosponsor the amendment that has been brought to the floor by my \ndistinguished friend and colleague from Massachusetts, representing the \nsix Vietnam veterans serving in the U.S. Senate with our view of what \nhas happened in Cambodia as well as now the distinguished Senator from \nNorth Carolina, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations\n\n[[Page S7193]]\n\nCommittee. And I hope that all of our colleagues join in supporting \nthis resolution.\n  I echo, Mr. President, and very much support what my colleagues have \nsaid tonight about the tragedy that has befallen Cambodia. I would only \nadd, Mr. President, that at a time in our world when we are reaching \nout to secure more freedom for peoples around the world, secure more \nstability, that we have talked about and will debate in detail NATO \nexpansion, and we are currently involved in Bosnia, we must not forget \nthe other corners of the globe. Certainly what we as a free country, \nthe leader of the free world, have invested in Cambodia, in that part \nof the world, is very important.\n  This is a serious matter, Mr. President. It is serious not just for \nCambodia, but it is serious for that part of the world because \ninstability in that part of the world leads to great tragedy. We know \nthat firsthand, some of us in this body. It is very important. It is \nessential that the leadership of this Nation be brought foursquare. We \nenlist the ASEAN nations and other nations to support our efforts to be \nable to lead Cambodia back to a time when there is the rule of law and \nthere is security and there is stability.\n  Hopefully, this resolution presented tonight will be a good \nbeginning. I add as well, Mr. President, the administration has taken \naction today. The ASEAN nations have taken action. But we need more.\n  I only add this as a summary statement to what we are doing this \nevening. It is critical, as we enter this new century, that all that \nhas been invested in southeast Asia in blood and treasure, not just \nAmericans, but our friends from Australia, South Korea, all over that \narea, to make sure that we do not slip back into a morass of tyranny \nand lose progress that we have so diligently fought for over the years.\n  Mr. President, I very much hope that all of our colleagues will \nstrongly support this resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to condemn the coup that \noccurred in Cambodia this past Sunday.\n  I want to put special emphasis on the word ``coup'' because the \nUnited States State Department has been reluctant to use this term to \ndescribe the events in Phnom Penh. The facts, however, leave no doubt.\n  On Sunday, troops loyal to Hun Sen, Cambodia's second prime minister, \nattacked the forces of Prince Norodom Ranariddh, Cambodia's first prime \nminister and leader of the royalist party known as FUNCINPEC. According \nto news reports, Hun Sen's army is currently rounding up political \nopponents. Already, at least one senior royalist official has been \nexecuted. As an added insult to the Cambodian people, Hun Sen's forces \nhave been looting shops in the capital.\n  I am sure my colleagues will agree that Hun Sen's use of military \nforce to oust his rivals and take sole control of Cambodia's government \nis, by definition, a coup d'etat.\n  Hun Sen is a man who has always preferred the gun over the ballot. In \n1993, his party was defeated by the royalists in the United Nations-\nsponsored elections. Nearly 90 percent of eligible voters participated \nin that historic event. Even though he lost the election, Hun Sen \nthreatened to restart Cambodia's civil war unless he was named as a \nsecond prime minister alongside Prince Ranariddh. In an effort to avoid \nfurther bloodshed, the U.N. agreed to let the two factions govern \ntogether.\n  After uneasily sharing power for 4 years, this clumsy coalition \nfinally began to unravel this year. On March 30, 20 people were \nmurdered in Phnom Penh when gunmen fired grenades into a peaceful \nopposition rally. Investigations have linked Hun Sen's troops to this \ncowardly attack. The political violence in Cambodia has only grown \nworse in the weeks since that tragic event.\n  The only good news to emerge from Cambodia in recent weeks was the \ncapture of Pol Pot, the genocidal leader of the Khmer Rouge. The ruler \nof Cambodia between 1975 and 1979, Pol Pot is responsible for the \ndeaths of as many as one million people. This notorious war criminal \nwas taken prisoner by Khmer Rouge defectors who indicated a willingess \nto turn him over to the government. Hun Sen's takeover, however, may \njeopardize efforts to have Pol Pot brought to Phnom Pehn and eventually \nextradited to an international tribunal.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an editorial from the \nJuly 9 edition of the Washington Post be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Calling a Coup a Coup\n\n       To many Americans, the latest combat in Cambodia's capital \n     may seem like inexplicable infighting among equally tainted \n     political factions. It's not. It's basically a coup d'etat.\n       Cambodia's tragic history leads some diplomats and others \n     to consider hopeless the cause of democracy there. Certainly \n     the Southeast Asian nation has had more than its share of \n     seemingly mortal blows--above all the unspeakable Khmer Rough \n     genocide. And none of Cambodia's factions is untainted by the \n     bloody past. Yet few observers considered democracy hopeless \n     in 1993, when an astonishing 89 percent of voters went to the \n     polls despite threats of violence and actual attacks. A \n     United Nations-led transition was hailed as a model for \n     democracy-building.\n       Almost from the start, though, those courageous voters did \n     not get the international support they needed. Hun Sen, the \n     Vietnamese-installed ruler from 1979 to 1993, and his \n     People's Party unexpectedly lost the election, despite a \n     campaign of intimidation against other parties. Yet, again \n     through coercion and threat of force, he was permitted to \n     muscle into the government as co-prime minister, essentially \n     negating the election results.\n       Since then, the United States and its allies have given \n     Cambodia substantial amounts of aid. But they have not \n     conditioned it on further democratization, such as the \n     establishment of independent courts, election commission and \n     other institutions. There was little protest when Hun Sen's \n     party began forcing independent voices out of the government, \n     refusing to register new political parties and otherwise \n     moving to reimpose one-party ruler.\n       This weekend military forces loyal to Hun Sen attacked and, \n     at least in the capital, defeated forces loyal to the other \n     co-prime minister. Prince Norodom Ranariddh, who has fled to \n     Paris. Now Hun Sen's troops are said to be rounding up \n     political enemies; at lease one senior offical from the \n     losing side is reported to have been executed. In the \n     countryside, a civil war may be resuming.\n       Yesterday U.S. officials properly condemned Hun Sen's use \n     of force, while still declining to label it a coup--becasue \n     then the law would require a cutoff of aid. The international \n     community needs to do more. Before all hope is lost of \n     getting Cambodia democratization back on tract, the United \n     States as well as Cambodia's neighbor in ASEAN should make \n     clear that they will not recognize a government installed by \n     coup d'etat, that they will not keep giving aid to an \n     illegitimate regime and that they won't accept any phony \n     elections organized in an effort to pretty up the coup. \n     Anything less is a disservice to these 89 percent.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the editorial, ``Calling a Coup a \nCoup,'' argues that the United States and the international community \nshould condemn Hun Sen's actions as a coup and halt aid to his \ngovernment.\n  Mr. President, I agree. I believe the administration should \nofficially recognize Hun Sen's actions as a coup. This is the right \npolicy. While nobody wants to increase the suffering of the Cambodian \npeople, the United States cannot legitimize Hun Sen's actions by \nmaintaining the current flow of aid and development assistance.\n  As we all know, the United Nations spent over $2 billion in 1993 to \nbring peace and democracy to Cambodia. We made a large investment, but \nan important one. Now, even though this long-suffering nation appears \nto be slipping back into a civil war, we should not conclude that the \nefforts of the United States and the international community have been \nin vain. In 1993, Cambodia's citizens overwhelmingly rejected tyranny, \nand they will do so again.\n  U.S. support for democracy, though, will seem shallow if we do not \ntake action against the use of violence. Like the military dictators of \nBurma, the Hun Sen regime too should be subject to the toughest \nsanctions. The United States must do all it can to insure that Hun Sen \ndoes not become the next Cambodian dictator.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I do not believe there is any further \ndebate on the amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I commend Senator Kerry and the other \nsponsors of this amendment. They have served this Nation with \ntremendous courage in so many ways. And again\n\n[[Page S7194]]\n\nthey serve the Nation tonight and the world tonight by bringing to our \nattention, for our action as they propose, the situation in Cambodia.\n  I just want to simply say that not only does this Senator support \nthem, but I believe that I am speaking for every Senator in this body \nthat we feel strongly that not only have these Senators given so much \nin the past, but again they are reflecting the best of this democracy \nin speaking out against what is happening now in Cambodia. I just \nsimply want to thank them and say how much this Senator supports their \nwork, how much we appreciate the dedication and the values of this \nNation reflected in this resolution.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I wish to associate myself with the remarks of my \ndistinguished colleague from Michigan. The Senate is indeed fortunate \nto have these three men who have proven themselves on the field of \ncombat and who now bring that same wealth of experience to bear on this \ncritical issue.\n  In many respects, in the Senate, because of just simply the times, \nthe demographics, fewer and fewer in number have served in uniform in \nfarflung areas of the world to gain that firsthand experience which is \nso vital to bring to bear on critical issues of this kind.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from California, \nSenator Feinstein, be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. If there is no further debate, I suggest we now move to a \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 800) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  Under the previous order, my understanding is that the Senator from \nWisconsin will be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Let me also associate myself with the remarks by the \nSenator from Michigan and the Senator from Virginia about the \nresolution that we just passed regarding Cambodia.\n  Let me also say just how grateful I am, and I know all Members of \nthis body are, for the extremely distinguished service of the Senators \nin that group in the war in Vietnam.\n  Let me also associate myself with regard to the situation in \nCambodia. I have placed my own brief statement in the Record with the \nhope that we can get back on the road to democracy and progress in \nCambodia. I am honored to have been here to hear their remarks with \nregard to that issue.\n  In that regard, Mr. President, and in regard to a current situation \nwhere American men and women are serving overseas in the Bosnia \nsituation, I am prepared to offer an amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending business be \nset aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 759\n\n(Purpose: To limit the use of funds for deployment of ground forces of \n the Armed Forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina after June 30, 1998, or a \n               date fixed by statute, whichever is later)\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I call up my amendment, Mr. President, No. 759, which \nis at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Feingold] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 759.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle E of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1075. LIMITATION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR DEPLOYMENT OF \n                   GROUND FORCES IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA.\n\n       (a) Limitation.--Funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available for the Department of Defense may not be obligated \n     for the deployment of any ground elements of the Armed Forces \n     of the United States in Bosnia and Herzegovina after the \n     later of--\n       (1) June 30, 1998; or\n       (2) a date that is specified for such purpose (pursuant to \n     a request of the President or otherwise) in a law enacted \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Exceptions.--The limitation in subsection (a) shall not \n     apply--\n       (1) to the support of--\n       (A) members of the Armed Forces of the United States \n     deployed in Bosnia and Herzegovina in a number that is \n     sufficient only to protect United States diplomatic \n     facilities in that country as of the date of the enactment of \n     this Act; and\n       (B) noncombat personnel of the Armed Forces of the United \n     States deployed in Bosnia and Herzegovina only to advise \n     commanders of forces engaged in North Atlantic. Treaty \n     Organization peacekeeping operations in that country; or\n       (2) to restrict the authority of the President under the \n     Constitution to protect the lives of United States citizens.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to S. \n936, the Department of Defense authorization bill for fiscal year 1998. \nThis amendment simply would prohibit the use of funds within the bill \nfor the deployment of any ground forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina after \nJune 30, 1998.\n  As we all know that is the date that the President has said now \nUnited States troops would be out of Bosnia. My amendment would simply \ncodify this goal. This amendment would allow appropriate exceptions, \nhowever, for Armed Forces personnel deployed in Bosnia to protect \nUnited States diplomatic facilities or noncombat personnel to advise \nNATO commanders. It would also not affect the President's \nconstitutional authority to protect the lives of American citizens.\n  Mr. President, this is similar to an amendment I introduced in May to \nthe supplemental appropriations bill. That amendment, which applied \nonly to the approximately $1.5 billion worth of ``emergency'' \nappropriations included in that bill, prohibited the use of fiscal year \n1997 funds after the date of December 30, 1997. In order to accommodate \nthe views of several other Members of this body, I did agree to accept \nan amendment by the Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, that changed \nthat date to June 30, 1998.\n  I was pleased that on that occasion the Senate unanimously chose to \naccept the modified version of my amendment on that bill. Although it \nwas eventually dropped in the conference committee, I was pleased that \nthe conferees included language in their report expressing the concern \nof the Congress regarding the Bosnia deployment and requiring the \nPresident to provide regular reports to Congress on the deployment \nitself as well as on the cumulative costs stemming from various United \nStates efforts associated with Bosnia.\n  So here today, Mr. President, we now have an opportunity again to go \non record regarding the continuation of the Bosnian operation beyond \nnext June.\n  I have held strong reservations about United States troop deployment \nin Bosnia ever since it was announced in 1995. These doubts were so \nstrong that I ended up being the only Democrat in the Congress to vote \nagainst deployment of United States men and women to support the Dayton \naccord.\n  It was a hard vote, but I voted no because I felt that the \nadministration's promises to bring our men and women home after just 1 \nyear were simply not plausible. Now, here we are in July of 1997--\nnearly 2 years later--our troops are still in Bosnia, and it is already \nclear that at a minimum we will remain there at least until the middle \nof 1998.\n  Mr. President, my concerns about our involvement in Bosnia have not \nchanged since that first ``no'' vote.\n  I will be the first to acknowledge, though, that the international \nintervention in Bosnia has had some positive benefits. The Dayton \naccord and the deployment of the NATO-led implementation force, IFOR, \nput an end to\n\n[[Page S7195]]\n\nthe bloodshed of the 3-year Bosnian war. In this sense, Mr. President, \nthe IFOR mission in Bosnia was a success.\n  There also can be no argument about the bravery and professionalism \nof the United States personnel who served in IFOR and are still in \nBosnia as a part of the stabilization force, SFOR. Amazingly, there \nhave been virtually no casualties even though there have been as many \nas 27,700 United States troops in the theater at one time. These men \nand women work through harsh conditions in a complex and often unstable \nenvironment. Although there have been passionate debates about whether \nour military should stay in Bosnia, admiration for the outstanding \nperformance of our troops has been unanimous.\n  Mr. President, my problem is with the seemingly endless duration of \nthis mission.\n  When in late 1995, the President first announced he would be sending \nUnited States forces to Europe to participate in the IFOR mission, he \npromised the Congress and the American people that the IFOR mission \nwould be over within 1 year. This promise was reiterated by the \nPresident on several occasions and continually backed up by senior \nAmerican military and diplomatic officials in public statements and in \ntestimony before Congress. I think we all understood that promise. I \nthink we all understood that promise to mean that our military men and \nwomen would be withdrawn from the region by December 1996, or at least \nvery shortly thereafter.\n\n  But in November 1996 the President announced that he would extend the \nU.S. mission for an additional 18 months, through June 1998, for \nparticipation in the NATO force now known as SFOR. Mr. President, \ndespite this new acronym, SFOR really represents nothing more than an \nextension of the original IFOR mandate, albeit somewhat more limited in \nscope.\n  Mr. President, I am afraid that there is still no clear end to our \nmission. The main factions in Bosnia are not making progress toward \ncreating a viable nation that can survive without the presence of the \ninternational force. Although the IFOR and SFOR deployment has \ncertainly halted the wide-scale fighting, there has been little \nprogress on the political front. According to a May report by the \nGeneral Accounting Office, the united governments Parliamentary \nAssembly has met just once and has yet to pass any legislation. The \nunified Council of Ministers has no authority, no funding, and no \noffice space.\n  So long as SFOR maintains an indefinite commitment to serve as \nreferee in Bosnia, I don't think we can expect any movement by the \nthree Bosnian factions to build the institutions that will be needed, \nonce the NATO force pulls out. So unless we set a deadline for our \ninvolvement to end, Mr. President, I believe there will be little to no \nincentive for the three sides to create a lasting political solution to \nthe conflict.\n  Mr. President, Bosnia's problems are still immense. Authoritarian \nrulers from all sides are hampering democracy. Many refugees are still \nunable to turn to their homes, and acts of ethnic violence occur on a \ndaily basis. In short, Mr. President, there will never be a good time \nto pull out of Bosnia. If we stay in Bosnia until the Croats and Serbs \nand Bosnians learn to live together, then we may never leave.\n  At the heart of the conflict is the fact that the strategic political \ngoals of the warring factions remain unchanged. There are many \nobservers who believe that the presence of the U.S. troops alone, \ninstead of helping in some way, actually serves to harden rather than \nsoften ethnic tensions in the area. The longer the Muslim refugees are \nprevented from returning to their homes the more determined they are to \nfight for their right to do so. At the same time, the Serbs are \nthwarting resettlement efforts and ignoring indictments from the War \nCrimes Tribunal against their own leadership. I believe that the open-\nendedness of this mission is helping to keep the warring parties from \ntruly fulfilling their commitments under the Dayton accord.\n  Mr. President, I have a second concern, as well. It really is the \ncrux of this amendment. It relates to the bill that the United States \ntaxpayer is expected to bear to support this Bosnia operation. The \nCongress and the American people, Mr. President, were originally told \nthe Bosnia mission would cost the U.S. taxpayers approximately $2 \nbillion. Sometime in 1996 that estimate was revised to $3 billion. \nThen, subsequent to the President's November announcement extending the \ndeadline for troop withdrawal, we learned that the cost estimate had \nbeen revised upward again, and really revised upward to a staggering \n$6.5 billion after the initial figure of $2 billion had been used. Six \nmonths later now, the May 1997 GAO report estimates this mission will \ncost $7.7 billion for military and civilian support for fiscal years \n1996 through 1998.\n  Mr. President, this latest figure is nearly four times as great as \nthe administration's original estimate. To put this in perspective, the \nUnited States, over the course of 30 months in Bosnia, expects to spend \nan amount equivalent to over just half of the entire foreign operations \nbudget for the current fiscal year for the whole world.\n  Mr. President, as I said during the debate over the supplemental \nappropriations bill, what we now have with United States involvement in \nthe Bosnia operation is not mission creep, it has become dollars creep \nfor the U.S. Congress and for the American people. At the very time we \nare straining so hard to eliminate the Federal deficit, we need to plug \nup the ever-enlarging hole in the Treasury through which funds continue \nto pour into the Bosnia operation.\n  Mr. President, by setting a hard date, by prohibiting the use of \nfunds after June 30, 1998, my amendment establishes an end date for the \ndeployment of ground troops in Bosnia. This is the only hope we have to \nplug this hole in the Treasury.\n  Mr. President, by establishing an end date for the funding of the \ndeployment of U.S. troops, my amendment, I hope, serves the dual \npurpose of preventing both mission creep and dollars creep in the \nBosnia situation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 802 to Amendment No. 759\n\n    (Purpose: To substitute an expression of the sense of Congress \n        regarding a follow-on force for Bosnia and Herzegovina)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. What rights does \nthe Senator from Virginia, acting for the majority, have with respect \nto not having this accepted? I object to this being accepted.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senator from Michigan will not be pressing for the \ndisposition of this amendment tonight, following my conversation with \nmy friend from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. That does not preclude, subsequent to sending it to the \ndesk, an objection being interposed by the majority or any other \nSenator.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Anybody could move to table this or vote no on this, \nbecause I am not going to be pressing for disposition of this tonight, \nand if there are other amendments to dispose of tonight, we will have \nto set aside this second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Chair kindly respond to the question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will not be disposed of until \nall debate has concluded on the amendment this evening.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for himself, Mr. \n     Reed, and Mr. McCain, proposes an amendment numbered 802 to \n     Amendment No. 759.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike out the section heading and all that follows and \n     insert in lieu thereof the following:\n\n     SEC. 1075. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING A FOLLOW-ON FORCE FOR \n                   BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n\n[[Page S7196]]\n\n       (1) United States ground combat forces should not \n     participate in a follow-on force in Bosnia and Herzegovina \n     after June 1998;\n       (2) the European Security and Defense Identity, which, as \n     facilitated by the Combined Joint Task Forces concept, \n     enables the Western European Union, with the consent of the \n     North Atlantic Alliance, to assume political control and \n     strategic direction of NATO assets made available by the \n     Alliance, is an ideal instrument for a follow-on force for \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n       (3) if the European Security and Defense Identity is not \n     sufficiently developed or is otherwise deemed inappropriate \n     for such a mission, a NATO-led force without the \n     participation of United States ground combat forces in \n     Bosnia, may be suitable for a follow-on force for Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina;\n       (4) the United States may decide to appropriately provide \n     support to a Western European Union-led or NATO-led follow-on \n     force, including command and control, intelligence, \n     logistics, and, if necessary, a ready reserve force in a \n     neighboring country; and\n       (5) the President should inform our European NATO allies of \n     this expression of the sense of Congress and should strongly \n     urge them to undertake preparations for a Western European \n     Union-led or NATO-led force as a follow-on force to the NATO-\n     led Stabilization Force if needed to maintain peace and \n     stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Wisconsin has offered an \namendment, which has as its purpose sending a very clear sign to our \nfriends in Europe, our allies, to the administration, and to the people \nof America that it is our intention that our forces be out of Bosnia by \nthe middle of next year. And I happen to share that goal. I think it is \nimportant that if we are going to be credible militarily, that when we \nhave a mission and we set an end point for that mission, as we have, \nand particularly where the military side of that mission has now been \naccomplished--the military side--that for our military to be credible, \nwe should live up to the mission's shape, the mission's description.\n  Now, part of this mission--and it was stated when these troops were \nsent in--was that they would complete their mission by the middle of \nnext year, and they were given certain other tasks and, militarily, \nthose tasks have been assigned. The civilian side of the Dayton accords \nhave not been fulfilled, surely. And it is my clear belief that the \ncivilian side of the Dayton accords are not going to be completed by \nthe middle of next year. There are going to be many years before those \ncivilian goals in Dayton can be achieved.\n  It is my own personal belief that there is going to need to be a \nfollow-on force in Bosnia if the gains which have been made are not \ngoing to be lost. There have been some significant gains. I also \nbelieve that the Europeans should take a greater responsibility for \nthat follow-on force, and they should know now that it is the intention \nof the Congress that a follow-on force, which is likely to be \nnecessary, or may be necessary, is going to be one that will not have \nAmerican ground combat troops.\n  That is goal 1 of this second-degree amendment. It is to state the \nsense of the Congress that American forces leave Bosnia by the middle \nof next year, as planned, as scheduled, as part of the mission.\n  But there is another part to the second-degree amendment. That part \nis a reference to the Europeans, as providing a follow-on force, if \nnecessary, through something called the European Security and Defense \nInitiative, which is an initiative inside of NATO, using NATO's assets, \nwhich has been approved by NATO, but which is connected to the western \nEuropean Union. It is an effort to get greater European initiative in \nEuropean affairs. It is a way of saying we will support the Europeans \nin taking that initiative through the use of NATO assets, but without \nhaving Americans in the lead everywhere that NATO operates.\n  It is something the Europeans have said they want many, many times. \nIt is their initiative inside NATO. It has been approved by NATO. NATO, \nin January 1994, gave its full support to the development of a European \nSecurity and Defense Initiative to strengthen the European pillar of \nthe alliance, and in order to allow our European allies to take greater \nresponsibility for the common security in their common defense. It was \ndesigned to enable, as I said, the western European Union to carry out \noperations using NATO assets and capabilities. That is the other part \nof this sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  So I want to commend the Senator from Wisconsin, and many others in \nthis body, who want to keep us to the mission statement, the mission \ngoal, part of which is that our troops would be removed by the middle \nof next year. Again, I emphasize the military part of the Dayton \naccords have been completed. Our military has done a spectacular job. \nWe should be supporting our military, and we are. This second-degree \namendment avoids the excessive statement that is made when one says \nthere is going to be a cutoff in funding, but at the same time sends a \nstrong message that it is Congress' intent that there not be United \nStates forces on the ground in Bosnia after next year. It gives a \nlittle greater flexibility.\n  A funding cutoff, under these circumstances, when our military is \nthere now, successfully, is too blunt an instrument. It is just too \ninflexible an instrument. It will take away bargaining power that \ncurrently exists both with our allies and with some of the negative \nregressive forces inside of Bosnia. We are going to have plenty of time \nto act to cut off funds, should that be necessary and should the \ncircumstances dictate. But we should not commit ourselves a year in \nadvance to cutting off funds when there is sufficient time at a later \ntime to do so.\n  So this second-degree amendment sends a strong message, which is the \nintent of the Senator from Wisconsin--an intent that I happen to \nshare--but it does so without either undermining the morale of our \ntroops, or without harming our chances for further progress in Bosnia.\n  So, Mr. President, I basically have reached a number of conclusions \nthat are reflected in this amendment, which is cosponsored by Senator \nReed of Rhode Island and Senator McCain of Arizona. These are the \nconclusions that I believe are accurate, based on a lot of personal \nvisits to Bosnia and a lot of study.\n  One, there is an absence of war in Bosnia, and that situation is \nlikely to remain as long as there is an outside armed force in Bosnia.\n\n  Two, the civilian implementation of the Dayton accords is lagging far \nbehind military implementation.\n  Three, central governing institutions are developing in Bosnia, but \nthere is a long way to go. The Bosnian Serbs have not yet decided even \nthat it is in their best interest to cooperate.\n  Four, reconciliation among the Bosnian factions has barely begun.\n  Fifth, the central role played by the United States has reinvigorated \nthe NATO alliance and re-established America's leadership.\n  Six, the United States should continue its leadership role and remain \ninvolved in Bosnia.\n  Seven, our European NATO allies have sought to become less reliant on \nthe United States, and mechanisms including the European security and \ndefense initiative are being developed to allow them to play a larger \nrole.\n  Next, either a Western European-led force, with its core made up of \nthe forces of our European NATO alliance, or a NATO-led force, without \na U.S. ground combat presence, should be ready to provide a follow-on \nforce if an armed outside force is necessary to keep the peace in \nBosnia after S. 4 completes its mission in June of 1998.\n  Mr. President, that is the thrust of this amendment. It is aimed at \nmaking a strong statement in terms of congressional intent, but it is \nalso aimed at avoiding too blunt or too inflexible an instrument a year \nin advance of when the American troops should be removed from Bosnia.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 802, As Modified\n\n  Mr. President, I send a technical modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to modify the \namendment. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 802), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after ``Sec.'' and insert in lieu thereof the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 1075. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING A FOLLOW-ON FORCE FOR \n                   BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) United States ground combat forces should not \n     participate in a follow-on force in Bosnia and Herzegovina \n     after June 1998;\n       (2) the European Security and Defense Identity, which, as \n     facilitated by the Combined Joint Task Forces concept, \n     enables the Western European Union, with the consent of the \n     North Atlantic Alliance, to assume political control and \n     strategic direction of\n\n[[Page S7197]]\n\n     NATO assets made available by the Alliance, is an ideal \n     instrument for a follow-on force for Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n       (3) if the European Security and Defense Identity is not \n     sufficiently developed or is otherwise deemed inappropriate \n     for such a mission, a NATO-led force without the \n     participation of United States ground combat forces in \n     Bosnia, may be suitable for a follow-on force for Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina.\n       (4) the United States may decide to appropriately provide \n     support to a Western European Union-led or NATO-led follow-on \n     force, including command and control, intelligence, \n     logistics, and, if necessary, a ready reserve force in a \n     neighboring country; and\n       (5) the President should inform our European NATO allies of \n     this expression of the sense of Congress and should strongly \n     urge them to undertake preparations for a Western European \n     Union-led or NATO-led force as a follow-on force to the NATO-\n     led Stabilization Force if needed to maintain peace and \n     stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I find myself in something of an awkward \nposition. I will address it in greater detail momentarily because I \nhave been opposed to the utilization of our ground troops in this \nregion of the world, namely Bosnia, for many years. I have so spoken \nand I have voted that way. Only once was I faced with a vote that had I \nnot supported it would have been construed as not supporting the \ntroops, did I cast a vote which could be construed, in any way, as \nsupporting the use of ground forces in this region. But at this time I \nam acting on behalf of the distinguished majority leader and the \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee, and in that capacity I send \nto the desk an amendment in the second degree in the nature of a \nperfecting amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan sent an amendment to \nthe desk which was a modifying amendment, and it became a perfecting \namendment. Consequently another second-degree perfecting amendment is \nnot in order at this time.\n  Mr. WARNER. Very well, Mr. President. We will see what we can do to \nuntangle this situation in the morning.\n  So, for the moment I will just speak to the amendment offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from Wisconsin and the second-degree amendment of \nmy good friend and colleague, the distinguished ranking member of the \nArmed Services Committee, the Senator from Michigan.\n  My concern is as follows. It is twofold.\n  One, there is a long history of the President exercising his role as \nCommander in Chief and the Congress exercising its role primarily \nthrough the power of the purse. And for the 18 years I have been \nprivileged to serve in this body I have participated in many, many \ndebates on this issue. Now we are confronted with the fact that the \nAmerican taxpayers have invested up to $7 billion, I am told, in this \nconflict in this very troubled part of the world, a part of the world \nin which historically troubles have existed from almost the beginning \nof mankind. I have always been of the opinion that it can never be \nsettled. I have made many trips to this region. As a matter of fact, I \nwas the first Member of the U.S. Senate to go into Sarajevo--my \nrecollection is about 3\\1/2\\ years ago. I have been back on a number of \ntrips with other colleagues. And the underlying problem of these people \nin terms of their ethnic conflicts and religious conflicts is just \nbeyond me to comprehend. I have seen ravages of this war firsthand both \non people and property. But I am going to put that to one side for the \nmoment.\n  Two things concern me: one, the President has the right as Commander \nin Chief to give the orders to the troops to go in, and really we \nauthorize as the Congress to give him every right to decide when those \ntroops are to be withdrawn. I fully recognize that in this debate. \nParticularly over the last 6 or 7 months there have been many signals \nfrom the administration that this general timeframe of June 1998 is \nwhen the ground elements are to be pulled out.\n  Indeed, when the Secretaries of State and Defense appeared before the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, I think one of the first times, if not \nthe first time in history, my recollection is that I asked the question \nthat prompted the answer from Secretary Cohen that he stood firmly \nbehind the policy to pull the ground elements out in June of 1998.\n  It has been interesting to observe since that time the posturing, \nparticularly by the Secretary of State, and to some degree by the \nPresident, in my judgment, trying to distance themselves from that \nstatement by our former colleague, and, indeed, my good friend of many \nyears, the current Secretary of Defense.\n  I anticipate that the President and his Cabinet officials and others \nwill soon come to the Congress to try and explore the common ground in \nwhich we can recognize that the President under his constitutional \npowers should be given the maximum latitude in deciding when to bring \ntroops, whether it is ground, air, or otherwise, out of the situation \ninto which they have been deployed.\n\n  I footnote my remarks again by saying I voted against it. I was \nopposed to it. I do not think today, or yesterday, or, indeed, I don't \nthink I will ever be convinced that this part of the world is in the \nvital national security interests of the United States. But \nnevertheless the President has the power under the Constitution as to \nwhen to deploy. I think that power also is the power to determine when \nto extract. And I am one that wants to give the maximum latitude to any \nPresident to exercise rightfully his constitutional powers.\n  I also recognize that we have, as I said, invested upwards of $7 \nbillion.\n  I want to ask my good friend when he returns here momentarily, could \nnot such a statement as we are debating tonight--although it is the \nsense of the Senate, sometimes those communications as they cross the \nocean are misinterpreted or not fully understood. And how can we have \nasked the American taxpayers, even though I and others voted against, \nto have contributed this extraordinary sum of money? And, indeed, this \nsum of money has been taken from the procurement accounts, from the \nreadiness account, and the R accounts. It has literally starved the \ndefense budget. And those effects are being felt today.\n  Nevertheless, how can we jeopardize that investment with stating that \nno matter what happens--this says, ``United States ground forces should \nnot participate in a follow-on force in Bosnia and Herzegovina after \nJune 1998.'' It doesn't really have any contingencies. Just today we \nlearned that elements of the NATO forces went in to try to capture war \ncriminals. I have great concern--perhaps next week after I receive a \nbriefing, and hopefully so will other Senators--on exactly what was the \nchange of policy. What was intended to be done? Here we are, Mr. \nPresident. We are looking at a rapidly changing situation. If we are \ngoing to allow the NATO forces to go out after some 50 war criminals--\nthese were low-level in terms of the hierarchy--I think in a geographic \nlocation where certainly it is less troublesome to have a military \noperation get them than many of the others, the principal ones.\n  But my point is this is a changing situation. And to say that June \n1998 all ground forces must be withdrawn, in my judgment, is unwise \nfrom a constitutional standpoint. And I question whether or not we have \nacted in good faith with the American people to say now we are going to \nput that arbitrary limitation on our President.\n  Then I ask of my colleagues--and I hope that they take the floor and \nperhaps ponder my questions. And I will direct them in a moment. Our \nallies have said, ``You pull out, we are pulling out the next day. You \npull out, we will pull out.'' So this is going to trigger a precipitous \nwithdrawal of those forces which have basically secured this situation. \nSo that there has been a situation of comparative peace now for some \nconsiderable time.\n  So I would like to ask first of my distinguished colleague from \nMichigan, what is likely to be the allied reaction to a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution by the Congress of the United States that we think \nthese troops--no matter what the situation--that maybe our ground \nforces should be withdrawn no later than June of 1998?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think they would see it in two ways.\n  First, I think they would see that we are supporting the \nadministration which has stated its position that our troops would be \nout of there. The administration position is that our troops will be \nout by the middle of next year. So I think they would see the Senate as \ngoing on record as supporting that position of the administration.\n\n[[Page S7198]]\n\nSo they would see some unity in that respect.\n  But they also, I think, would see in this second-degree resolution \nsomething which is very important. This amendment says that the \nEuropeans and we in NATO talked about greater European initiative. We \nhave now put one in place, and it is being implemented as we speak.\n  I checked with General Shalikashvili and I have checked with our \nleadership in Europe. This European security and defense initiative in \nNATO adopted by NATO with our support to give the Europeans--not only \ngive them assets to carry out greater European initiatives but to \nencourage European initiatives. And this is what this amendment also \ndoes. It says we support the administration's position that these \ntroops be out. We are going to let you know a year in advance. We are \nnot going to have the funds cut off. It is too inflexible. It is too \nrigid. That is not part of this sense-of-the-Congress resolution. They \nwill see that as avoiding that kind of inflexibility and rigidity \nbecause a lot of things can change possibly.\n  On the other hand, it is important that we send that signal that we \nlet the Europeans know that that is our plan, and that is our \nintention, and that is the administration policy.\n  I have visited a number of European capitals, and I have heard the \nsame things which my good friend from Virginia has heard about a number \nof Europeans saying, ``We are pulling out if you pull out.'' But I have \nalso heard European leadership say maybe there is a way--maybe there is \na way that, if the United States plays a more supporting role but not \nnecessarily troops there on the ground, but a more supporting role in \nsome other form that maybe, maybe, it is possible that a follow-on \nforce made up of European forces can stay there. Just the way the \nBritish today took that initiative with our help, and at some risk, as \nwe know. There were some casualties.\n\n  So a follow-on force could show that kind of greater European \ninitiative with our support, but without our ground forces being on the \nground.\n  So I think there are a couple of messages that are involved in the \nsecond-degree amendment. And it has the kind of balance which I know my \ngood friend from Virginia is struggling to do which is not to pull the \nrug out from under, not to have an absolute funding cutoff, but, on the \nother hand, expressing some clear message that the policy under current \nplans of having our troops leave in the middle of next year as \nscheduled is something that we intend at this time to happen.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I value the views of my good friend. We \nhave served together side by side for the 18 years that we have been \nhere together. We made many trips together. As a matter of fact, Mr. \nPresident, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee entrusted us \nwith doing the official report for the committee as it related to \nSomalia.\n  The Senator spoke of the NATO forces today who tried to apprehend--I \nthink in one instance did apprehend one, and a second alleged criminal \nwas killed. I am all in favor of somehow capturing these criminals. But \nI want to visit it another day at another time about how that is to be \ndone. Because I, drawing on the lessons of Somalia, which the Senator \nand I experienced and wrote about in some detail, I am very concerned \nwhen the United States in this type of situation is involved in nation \nbuilding and going into situations like this; but another day; another \ntime.\n  But I come back to the Senator's statement about the Dayton accords. \nThat was a historic achievement. It really was. As a matter of fact, I \nwas pleased to see the Armed Services Committee and the Senate back the \nrapid promotion of one of our members, General Clark, to the position \nof NATO Commander. He was deputy to Ambassador Holbrooke throughout \nthat period. And true, that framework, no matter how we valued it, is \nnot being accepted today by the parties and really enforced in the \nmanner we had anticipated, and certainly not on the timetable.\n  If we send a message that we are going home June of 1998, what does \nthat do to induce them to finish it? I think it could be just the \nreverse. Those opposed to following through on the accords will dig in \nand will say, ``Wait them out. Wait them out. Let them go, and then we \ncan take this situation perhaps into our own hands.'' Who would come \ninto the vacuum? What nations, what troops, what forces could come into \nthat vacuum at that time?\n  It seems to me that it is not right in the first place to go in there \nwith these ground forces. But that is history. Now the American \ntaxpayers and our brave servicepersons have gone over there and have \ntaken a great deal of personal risk. And they have made the Dayton \naccords as it relates to the security policy work.\n  To jeopardize that whole thing, put it up for failure, it just to me \nis a very risky and unwise course of action. As I look through the \namendment, which I forwarded, and now regrettably the tree is \ncompleted, I hope tomorrow morning in the dawn of a new day we can work \nit out so those on our side who hold views possibly which are parallel \nin many respects to the distinguished Senator from Michigan and the \nSenator from Wisconsin can sit down and work out a common position \nwhich can be reviewed by the Senate and voted on by the Senate. In all \nlikelihood, this Senator would vote against it, but that is not a \ncontrolling fact.\n  But I would be interested in the Senator's view on the Dayton \naccords. The Senator said that they were not being fulfilled. How does \nthis policy, in the Senator's judgment, prompt a greater degree of \ncompliance?\n  Mr. LEVIN. The amendment which I have introduced along with Senator \nReed and Senator McCain states that it is likely there is going to be a \nneed for a follow-on force for the very reasons the Senator from \nVirginia states. The Dayton accords civilian goals have not been \nachieved, and I do not see any prospect that they will be achieved by \nthe middle of next year. I do not see any realistic prospect that we \nare going to see a million plus refugees resettled, war criminals \ncaptured, all the new arrangements, civilian arrangements that have \nbeen magnificently provided for in the Dayton accords achieved by the \nmiddle of next year.\n  I just do not see that happening. But I do not want to see an open-\nended commitment of American troops. I think we undermine the \ncredibility of the use of military force when we set a date, as we \nhave; set military missions, which we have; see those missions \nachieved, which they have been, the military mission achieved, which \nthey have been, and still leave our military there. That turns them \ninto a police force for which I do not think they should be used. I \nthink for the credibility of military forces, if you have a mission, if \nit is clear, achieve it and leave.\n  Well, we had a clear mission militarily. It has been achieved. We \nhave a date for departure, and I think under current circumstances we \nought to say it is our intention that we are going to depart as \nplanned. But to have a funding cutoff, it seems to me, goes too far. It \nis too rigid, too inflexible, too far in advance.\n  How do you balance those goals? How do we send a signal to the \nEuropeans that, look, we probably are going to need a follow-on force \non the civilian side and you folks have indicated your willingness to \ntake greater initiative in your own backyard. We are willing to help. \nBut we also have a mission which has been accomplished there \nmilitarily. We are militarily spread all over this world. We have to \nhave some kind of end points to military missions which have succeeded, \nand that is the balance which is set forth in this second-degree \namendment--to end the open-ended commitment and to, I think, make \ncredible the use of military force by setting a clear mission, seeing \nit achieved and then departing as scheduled.\n  So it is somewhat different from the good Senator from Wisconsin, but \nI have to tell you that the direction he is moving in, sending some \nkind of a signal a year in advance, I think is very helpful, providing \nit is accompanied with this awareness of the likelihood of the need for \na follow-on force and our willingness to be supportive of it while we \nare not with combat forces there on the ground. That is the balance in \nthis second-degree amendment, avoiding some of the concerns, I think, \nor meeting some of the concerns at least, that the Senator from \nVirginia has discussed about not wanting to pull the\n\n[[Page S7199]]\n\nrug out from under in an inflexible, rigid way but nonetheless saying \nto our European friends: Folks, it is time for you to take some greater \ninitiative. We will be there to help, but it is time for you to show \nsome leadership as well.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I could address another point here. Let \nus look at section (4):\n\n       The United States may decide to appropriately provide \n     support to a Western European Union-led or NATO-led follow-on \n     force including command, control, intelligence, logistics, \n     and, if necessary, a ready reserve force in a neighboring \n     country.\n\n  Is that ready reserve force ground troops? I think it is.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It could be.\n  Mr. WARNER. What do we gain by simply picking them up out of their \npresent positions and moving them 50 miles across the border or \nwhatever the distance may be? What do we gain? It is pure symbolism. \nAnd then they rush back at a telephone call?\n  Mr. LEVIN. There are two things that are gained. First of all--this \nsuggestion, by the way, is General Shalikashvili's. I put a lot of \nstock in the kind of suggestions he makes. It can very well be a \nsmaller force, and it is less of a target. American troops, as I think \nthe Senator from Virginia would acknowledge, have been the target of \nchoice too often. Not having American troops there as targets, it seems \nto me, would be a plus. Having a smaller number nearby makes them less \nof a target and, on the other hand, does provide some deterrence as \nwell as accomplish some significant cost savings. So there are both \ncost savings involved as well as reducing the risks and the threat to \nAmerican forces.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, Mr. President, the Senator says they are a target, \nand I share that with the Senator, and I am concerned now as a \nconsequence of this mission to capture the war criminals that there is \nprobably going to be a heightened alert and a heightened degree of \nrisk.\n  So the Senator seems to think that if they are moved some distance \nacross a border into another country--I do not doubt that there would \nbe diminished personal risk to those troops. What does that say to the \ntroops that are left back there from other European nations? The United \nStates has withdrawn to a safe haven, yet we are left out here to take \nthe risk.\n  I somehow find this all incongruous. I really do, Mr. President. If \nwe are a part of NATO, we are going to pull our share, and that is \nfinancially, it is in terms of risk, it is in every other way. That is \nthe way NATO was set up. We are proud to be the leader of NATO. We have \nas the senior officer, an American officer as the commanding general of \nNATO forces, and yet you are going to say we will now have a policy \nwhen there is a risk, our people are going to a safe haven some \ndistance away in another land and let the chaps and ladies or whatever \nthe composition of that force may be stay in harm's way in Bosnia. I \nfind this all very difficult.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If the Senator will yield just on that point.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. NATO has adopted a policy where the Europeans will take \ngreater initiative without American presence. It is called the European \nSecurity and Defense Initiative. It was adopted in January of 1994. It \nis a NATO policy.\n  So, yes, we are a big part of NATO, and we do more than our fair \nshare. I know the Senator would agree with that. We do more than carry \nour load, and we have more than enough of our personnel around the \nworld at risk. It is time that the Europeans in their own neighborhood \ntake on a greater share of the risk. This is a way of achieving that \nbalance. But it is a NATO initiative. This European Security and \nDefense Initiative is a NATO initiative, approved by NATO. That is what \nis referred to in the second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, Mr. President, if there are others who wish to \nspeak, I will be happy to yield the floor. But I want to return--I am \nfamiliar with the European Security Defense Initiative, and I am not so \nsure that I am here tonight prepared to go into all the ramifications. \nBut we are the leader of NATO, and I think if there is going to be a \npattern where we do not get involved and share the risk, I question how \nlong we can retain that leadership role.\n  I seem to be in opposition to a number of things. I am not in favor \nof the expansion of NATO. It seems to me that the actions taken in \nMadrid are not in the best interests in the long term of NATO.\n  I have gone back and read the debates. Remember 10, 12, 14 years ago \nwhen there were tremendous debates in the Chamber of the Senate: Bring \nthem home--debates before we arrived led by the very able majority \nleader, the Democratic leader of the Senate, the distinguished Mike \nMansfield of Montana--bring them home; NATO has finished its mission.\n  There may be a degree to which our tinkering with NATO and changing \nit in concept could begin to undermine American public support, and I \nthink that would be a terrible loss--NATO, the greatest alliance in the \nhistory of mankind, the most effective, the alliance that fulfilled its \ngoals, exceeding every expectation of those who laid down the original \ncharter. Indeed, NATO should be credited, rightfully, for such \nvictories as we attained during the cold war period for the demise of \nthe Soviet Union. NATO was instrumental. We will debate that another \nday. I see other Senators wishing to speak, so for the moment I will \nyield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. REED addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Chair. I rise to support the second-degree \namendment offered by the Senator from Michigan on my behalf and on \nbehalf of Senator McCain.\n  I, too, compliment the Senator from Wisconsin for his amendment. One \nof the great frustrations in watching this policy evolve concerning \nBosnia is that I fear we are wasting precious time in taking concrete \nsteps so that we can effectively depart that country in June of 1998. \nThe Senator's amendment has focused this debate and, I hope, gives \nfurther impetus to efforts by the administration to take these steps so \nthat the withdrawal of our troops in June of 1998 will be a reality and \nnot a situation where we are victims of a fait accompli and must stay \nlonger.\n  Like my colleague from Michigan, I share the Senator's goal. I \nbelieve that we should withdraw our troops by June of 1998. As the \nSenator from Wisconsin said, there are no good times to leave. In a \ntumultuous situation like Bosnia, with ethnic rivalries, with violence, \nwith a history of centuries of violence, there are no good times to \nleave, but we must leave because, as my colleague from Virginia has \npointed out, we have already spent $7 billion, and after June 30, 1998, \nthe cost does not go to zero. The costs continue to accumulate. These \ncosts are not just in terms of appropriations for our military forces. \nThey are also in terms of the stress and strain placed on our military \nforces. There is discussion about mission creep, but I think the first \nsymptom emerging from Bosnia is mission exhaustion as our troops will \nbe forced to be rotated back to that country from their positions in \nGermany and outside of Bosnia.\n\n  So for all of these reasons and more, I believe that we should have \nthe requirement to return our troops to their home stations by June of \n1998. I just believe that the Feingold amendment is the wrong approach \nto this situation. It would impose severe conditions on this announced \ndeparture date by cutting off funding for the deployment of any ground \nelements of the Armed Forces except guards at our diplomatic facilities \nand noncombatant advisers to NATO forces, and this arbitrary \nrestriction could play havoc with our mission and with our troops' \nability to carry out that mission.\n  As one consequence, if this provision would pass, it could \nimmediately begin to demoralize our troops. Even though we have set as \nour objective our departure by June of 1998, passage of this bill \ncutting off funds would, I think, send a signal that we are not only \nrequesting them to leave but in some respects abandoning them in their \noperations. I think that is the wrong signal.\n  I know, as the Senator from Wisconsin pointed out, that he, too, \nshares with me the esteem that we have for the performance of these \nremarkable soldiers in this operation.\n  Second, I believe that this amendment would weaken the resolve of our \nNATO colleagues to participate in this mission. I know it has been said \non this floor this evening that the Europeans\n\n[[Page S7200]]\n\nhave declared, if you go, we will go. But if we pass this amendment \ntoday, any possibility of constructive dialog and engagement to \nencourage them to stay beyond June will, I think, be totally lost, and \nthat would be a severe gesture.\n  I believe we have to keep this active dialog alive with our European \ncolleagues, and with this amendment tonight, the Feingold amendment, we \ncould very well cut off such dialog. In addition, the Feingold \namendment contemplates leaving in place a few Embassy guards and some \nadvisers to NATO. First, if we do construct a follow-on force and if \nthat force is not NATO, this legislation could technically preclude any \nassistance to a follow-on force, and in that respect I think we are \ndoing ourselves a great disservice, hampering the flexibility of the \nadministration to construct a follow-on force, a constructive military \nposture in Bosnia after June of 1998.\n  Furthermore, I believe there is a possibility that those forces left \nbehind, Embassy guards or noncombatant advisers, would be placed in a \nvery frustrating position.\n  We are going through a situation where we have significant combat \npower in-country, with robust rules of engagement, suddenly to a \nposition where American troops are merely, in a way, passive bodyguards \nfor our own military personnel. Their safety could be jeopardized. And, \nin addition, they would be in the frustrating position of perhaps \nstanding by helplessly when civilians, which we previously protected, \ncould fall victim to the ethnic rivalries which we know exist in that \ncountry.\n  I think also one of the detriments and deficiencies in the amendment \nis it obscures what I think should be the focus of the debate today. We \nall agree June of 1998 is the appropriate departure date. What we \nshould be debating today on this floor is what steps we must take \nbeginning today to ensure that we can safely and appropriately withdraw \nour troops by June of 1998. I believe there are several steps that must \nbe taken.\n  Like my colleague from Michigan, I believe we should constitute a \nfollow-on force, but a follow-on force that is not composed of American \nground troops. As the Senator from Michigan pointed out, we have the \ncapability through NATO, or through the European security defense \nidentity which would use NATO assets, to provide this follow-on force.\n  Indeed, I think we have to remind Europeans of their brave words back \nin 1992 in Lisbon when the leaders of the European nations declared \nthat assisting the people of former Yugoslavia in their quest for peace \nwas a test of their ability to establish and maintain peace and \nsecurity on the Continent of Europe. It is not inappropriate--in fact, \nI think it is most appropriate--that this situation be returned \nprimarily to the European forces after the intervention of NATO \nsuccessfully to suppress violence and give them a second chance, give \nthem a second chance to maintain the peace and stability in that \nregion.\n  As we all know, for many years it was a primarily European-led United \nNations force, United Nations-protected force that operated within \nBosnia. That force was inadequate, but I believe with the intervention \nof NATO, with the steps we have already taken, a European force could, \nin fact, and should, in fact, carry out this follow-on mission. I also \nbelieve that to augment the European force within the former \nYugoslavia, we should, in fact, create a residual force in a nearby \ncountry or in the Adriatic, which could respond in a crisis to the \nlegitimate requirements for assistance for this force.\n  In doing those two things, I believe we would, in fact, create a \nfollow-on capability that would preserve the gains we have made in the \nformer Yugoslavia. I believe it is also very important that our \nadministration speak with a very clear voice and a single voice about \nour intention to depart in June of 1998. It is frustrating when the \nSecretary of Defense clearly states that deadline, but his words are \nsometimes confused by ambiguous statements from other leaders of our \nNational Government. I believe we should have one voice, and that one \nvoice should declare that we are leaving in June of 1998.\n  While we go about our military preparations to depart, we have to \naddress the concerns of economic development, and we can do that in a \nway which favors those parties within the former Yugoslavia, within \nBosnia, who are trying to assist in an evolution to a democratic, \npeaceful society. If we do these things--reconstitute a follow-on \nforce, provide for a residual American force outside of the country \nthat can assist the follow-on force, and begin to support the economic \nand political development of the people of Bosnia--then I believe that \nwhen June of 1998 arrives we can and will successfully remove our \nforces. But the challenge we face today is not to arbitrarily cut off \nand terminate funding at this juncture. The challenge we face is to use \nthe intervening months that we have to fashion a policy which will \nallow us to leave peacefully from the former Yugoslavia, and leave it \nin a condition where there is hope that the gains we made will be \nsustained and will be permanent within that country.\n  As a result, I urge my colleagues to support the second-degree \namendment and, in doing so, not only send a signal that we are serious \nabout our departure, a signal that will be sent to the capitals of \nEurope and to the capitals of the former Yugoslavia that we will be \nserious about our departure date, but we will not be arbitrary and \ninflexible. And that, in the interim, we will build a structure of \npeace and security that will carry on the efforts that were so \nmagnificently undertaken and continue today by our military forces in \nthe former Yugoslavia.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for \nhis commitment to this issue and his leadership in this debate and very \nclear explanation of the situation. I will not oppose the second-degree \namendment that he and the Senator from Rhode Island and the Senator \nfrom Arizona have proposed. I also wish to compliment the Senator from \nRhode Island on his comments, which I think were very appropriate with \nregard, especially, to the issue of making it absolutely clear \nthroughout all aspects of our Government that it really is \nour intention to be out of this situation in terms of our ground troops \nby the end of June 1998.\n\n  As Senator Levin has described, his second-degree amendment expresses \nthe sense of the Congress that United States ground troops should not \nparticipate in a follow-on force in Bosnia and Herzegovina after June \nof 1998. Of course, I heartily agree with that premise. I believe we \nhave to have a firm end date to our mission in Bosnia. Without it, many \nof us have said it here on the floor tonight, the mission absolutely \nrisks continuing for who knows how long. There simply is no sign or \nclue as to when our involvement would end.\n  Of course, I would have preferred my own hard mandate in my own \namendment, which would have cut the purse strings of the Bosnia mission \nafter June 30, 1998. This would have absolutely ensured that United \nStates ground troops would be out of Bosnia by that date. But I am \nwilling to not oppose the change offered by the Senator from Michigan \nbecause not only is there more support for the amendment in this form, \nbut because it, again, puts the U.S. Senate on record with respect to \nits concern about the Bosnia mission.\n  I am particularly pleased that the Levin amendment includes language \nurging the President to inform our European allies of this expression \nof the sense of Congress. This may well be the most important point. It \nis pretty clear that our allies in the region, our NATO partners, have \nbecome dependent on the active participation of the United States in \nthis peacekeeping operation. If I were them, I would not want to do it \nalone either. But it is my view that if President Clinton lets our \nallies know immediately and with all candor that U.S. troops will not \nparticipate in the mission after next June, then they will begin to \nthink creatively about what our next steps should be in the region.\n  If the President does not send that message, then our allies and \npartners will have every reason to believe that the United States will, \nof course, remain in Bosnia after that date, as we have done already \nwith regard to a number of other deadlines. Why do I say that? Because \nthe last time we had\n\n[[Page S7201]]\n\na deadline for completing the peacekeeping mission, the December 1996 \nend date for IFOR, the administration was only too quick to let it slip \nwith just a few months left to go on our initial 1-year commitment, the \nmission got rebaptized as SFOR, and U.S. ground troops were stuck there \nfor what is going to be at least an additional 18 months.\n  I am aware of the concerns that have been expressed by people like \nSecretary Albright, Chairman Shalikashvili and Secretary Cohen. In her \nJune 27, 1997 letter to the Senate leadership, Secretary Albright wrote \nthat if legislation mandating a cutoff were to pass, it would ``send \nexactly the wrong signal to our allies, to the signatories to the \nDayton Accords, and to the American people about what American \nleadership in the world should mean.''\n  Mr. President, I don't understand this statement. I don't understand \nthis statement in light of the fact that the United States is already \non record for wanting to end the military mission on June 30, 1998. How \ncan people be so concerned about the statement sending a signal about \nthat date when that is exactly the signal that the President of the \nUnited States has sent?\n  By telling our European allies about the planned withdrawal date, as \nthe Levin second-degree specifically calls upon the President to do, we \ncan make it clear that our leadership role is there but that our \nleadership role has limits. In the event of a follow-on force in the \nregion, the Levin amendment suggests that the United States may decide \nto provide support in the form of command and control, intelligence, \nlogistics and, if necessary, a ready reserve force. I believe this kind \nof support is more appropriate than the deployment of our men and women \nto Bosnia.\n  I am also aware that the Senator from Michigan and the Senator from \nOklahoma, Mr. Inhofe, had made an agreement during the Armed Services \nCommittee markup of the bill to resist the temptation to offer Bosnia \nlanguage in this bill. The issue of when and where we deploy our troops \nis a tough, emotional and controversial one for all of us. Because of \nthat, I know that the members of the Armed Services Committee would all \nlike to see a longer, more thoughtful debate on Bosnia at some point.\n  I, too, would like the Congress to have the opportunity to engage in \na more extensive debate on the issue. But I also believe, as we \nconsider this legislation, we cannot ignore the Bosnia issue in the \nvery bill that authorizes the activities of the Defense Department. So, \nin light of the initial hesitation of the Armed Services Committee, I \nam particularly pleased that Senator Levin and I have been able to work \ntogether on this issue. I think it is vitally important that in a bill \nas important as this one, the Senate go on record regarding our mission \nin Bosnia.\n  Let me just conclude by saying if, in fact, we are able to pass my \namendment, as amended by the Levin amendment, it will mean that both \nthe House and the Senate will be on record on this DOD bill calling for \ntermination of the Bosnia mission no later than June 1998. This should \nguarantee that this issue will not simply disappear in conference.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today in strong \nsupport of the FY98 Defense Authorization bill reported by the Armed \nServices Committee. This is an excellent piece of legislation, and I \nwant to commend the distinguished Chairman of the Committee, Senator \nThurmond, for his tireless efforts to formulate a balanced, \nconstructive defense bill.\n  Mr. President, the bill before us would add $2.6 billion to the \nPresident's budget request for national defense. While I strongly \nsupport this increase, I want to emphasize that it will not address all \nof the deficiencies resulting from the Administration's underfunded \ndefense program. In fact, even with this increase, defense spending in \nFY98 will be $3.3 billion below this year in real terms. However, in \nthe current budget environment, this $2.6 billion increase was all that \nwe were able to achieve.\n  As we did last year, the Armed Services Committee spent a good deal \nof time evaluating our national security requirements and establishing \na set of firm priorities to guide our consideration of defense programs \nfor FY98. These priorities included, among other things: ensuring \nnational security and the status of the United States as the preeminent \nmilitary power; protecting the readiness of our Armed Forces; enhancing \nthe quality of life of military personnel and their families; ensuring \nU.S. military superiority by continuing to fund a more robust, \nprogressive modernization program for the future; accelerating the \ndevelopment and deployment of missile defense systems; and preserving \nthe shipbuilding and submarine industrial bases.\n  Mr. President, as I said, the Armed Services Committee established \nthese priorities to guide our investment strategy in the FY98 \nauthorization bill. I am pleased to report that the bill before us \nembodies these priorities and corrects a number of serious deficiencies \ncontained in the Administration budget request.\n  For the benefit of my colleagues, I would like to highlight some of \nthe important measures contained in this bill.\n  The authorization bill reported by the Armed Services Committee: \nprovides a 2.8 percent pay raise for military personnel; increases by \n$41.5 million spending on research and development for \ncounterproliferation, chemical and biological defense, and counter-\nterrorism programs; increases readiness funding by more than $1 billion \nin areas such as ammunition procurement, flying hours, force \nprotection, cold weather gear, barracks renovation, and depot \nmaintenance; adds $653 million for reserve force modernization \nprograms; adds $720 million for an additional Arleigh Burke class \ndestroyer; approves the Navy's proposed teaming arrangement for design \nand production of the New Attack Submarine; authorizes $345 million to \naccelerate the advance procurement and construction of the next nuclear \naircraft carrier; and adds $90 million to procure an additional V-22 \naircraft in FY98.\n  Mr. President, as Chairman of the Strategic Forces Subcommittee, I \nalso want to take this opportunity to outline for my colleagues some of \nthe important initiatives dealing with missile defense, nuclear forces, \nand Department of Energy programs.\n  As my colleagues know, Secretary Cohen conducted an extensive \nanalysis of all defense programs, including missile defense, as part of \nthe Quadrennial Defense Review. This analysis confirmed what many of us \nhave long argued--that the Administration's National Missile Defense \nprogram is grossly underfunded. In fact, Secretary Cohen determined \nthat the NMD program was underfunded by some $2.3 billion over the \nfuture years defense plan, and by a total of $474 million in FY98 \nalone.\n\n  This shortfall of $474 million for National Missile Defense in FY98 \nproved to be a very big challenge for the Committee to address in its \ndeliberations. And I would be remiss if I did not say to my colleagues \nthat it caused us to have to make some very difficult decisions as we \nweighed the merits and affordability of many requested programs.\n  However, I believe that we formulated a very responsible and forward \nlooking package of initiatives in the Strategic Subcommittee. These \ninitiatives include: increasing funding for the Navy Upper Tier program \nby $80 million; adding $15 million for the Arrow interoperability \nprogram; providing an increase of $118 million for the space based \nlaser program; adding $50 million for the Clementine 2 micro-satellite \nprogram; authorizing $80 million for the kinetic energy anti-satellite \nprogram; increasing funding for cruise missile defense programs by $32 \nmillion; prohibiting the retirement of certain strategic nuclear \ndelivery systems in FY98 unless the START 2 Treaty enters force; \nproviding $4 billion for weapons activities to maintain the reliability \nand safety of the enduring nuclear arsenal; and including $5.1 billion \nfor defense environmental restoration and waste management activities.\n  The bill also includes a provision requiring the Director of Central \nIntelligence to establish a cadre of experts within the Intelligence \nCommunity to work POW/MIA issues. The President has directed that a \nSpecial National Intelligence Estimate be prepared on the POW/MIA \nissue; however, there are no intelligence experts on these issues\n\n[[Page S7202]]\n\ncurrently remaining in the Intelligence Community. This provision does \nnot affect POW/MIA policy or relations with Vietnam. It merely provides \nthe Director of Central Intelligence with total descretion to establish \nan Intelligence Cell within the community.\n  Mr. President, these are but a few of the many important initiatives \nincluded in this bill. In a more general sense, I want to also offer \nsome observations concerning the current state of our Armed Forces and \nthe course that President Clinton has charted for defense in his second \nterm.\n  As my colleagues know, I have been critical of the Clinton \nAdministration's penchant for involving our military forces in \nunorthodox, non-traditional operations. Without question, these \npeacekeeping and humanitarian relief operations are bankrupting the \ndefense budget and undermining the readiness of America's Armed Forces.\n  I have also been critical of the so-called Bottom Up Review that was \nconducted by the Clinton Administration four years ago to guide its \ndefense program. Whether they admit it publicly or not, everyone \nrealizes that this was nothing but a budget driven exercise to tailor \nour defense forces and strategy to meet a pre-established defense \nspending level.\n  I had hoped that in its second term, the Clinton Administration would \ntake a more honest and objective approach to defense programming, and \nbase our national security policy on the threat rather than on budget \nrequirements. Unfortunately, it appears this was wishful thinking.\n  The Quadrennial Defense Review that was recently released falls into \nthe same trap as the Bottom Up Review. Rather than identifying the \nthreats confronting our security and formulating the force structure, \nend strength and strategy necessary to counter these threats, the QDR \nestablishes a baseline for defense spending and tailors our defense \nprogram to fit that baseline.\n  I want to make clear that I do not impugn the motives or patriotism \nof those who worked very hard in the Pentagon to formulate the QDR. \nThey were doing the best they could to balance requirements and \nresources. But the truth is that the resources they were provided were \ninadequate to fund the requirements. As a result, the QDR fails to \ncorrect the deficiencies of the Bottom Up Review and it fails to \nprovide a credible, threat based strategy for our defense program.\n  Mr. President, it is also worth mentioning that the days of the so-\ncalled ``peace dividend'' and the days of Congressional windfalls for \ndefense are over. In the past 3 years, Congress has added approximately \n$20 billion to the requested level for defense. But with the recently \nnegotiated budget deal, Congress and the Administration are now locked \ninto agreed-upon defense numbers. There will be no windfall in future \nyears.\n  In fact, any spending additions requested by members will have to be \noffset with commensurate spending reductions. From here on out, it will \nbe a zero sum game. I hope my colleagues understand this situation \nbecause it will have a very profound effect on the Committee's ability \nto accommodate member interest requests in the future. We have cut \ndefense to the bone. There is no real growth programmed in the future; \nonly further reductions. We have made our bed, now we must lie in it.\n  I want to end with a somber warning for my colleagues. It is very \nsimple and straightforward. Contingency operations are bankrupting our \ndefense budget. If we do not reign in the Clinton Administration and \ncurtail its continuing commitments of U.S. military forces for non-\nmilitary and humanitarian purposes, there will be no money to \nrecapitalize our Armed Forces. There will be no money to purchase DDG-\n51's, or F-22's, or F/A-18's, or Joint Strike Fighters, or Comanche \nhelicopters, or V-22's, or satellites, or ground vehicles.\n  If we continue to allow our Armed Forces to be used as a ``911'' \nemergency force for the United Nations, we will lose our combat \nreadiness, and deplete our investment accounts.\n  The Bosnia example is a particularly instructive, and particularly \ndisturbing, example of this trend. When President Clinton first \ncommitted troops to Bosnia, he assured Congress that the scope of the \noperation would be limited and the cost of operation would be $1.6 \nbillion. Yet, here we are today, with the price tag of the Bosnia \noperation having climbed to $7.3 billion and the Secretary of State \ntalking about keeping troops in Bosnia beyond the June 1998 deadline, \nyet again.\n  Mr. President, the Administration has asked for two additional rounds \nof Base Closures, arguing that these closures will enable us to save a \nfew billion dollars. Under the most optimistic forecasts these closures \nwill not even pay for the Bosnia mission. How on Earth can we justify \nputting America's communities through yet another two rounds of chaos, \nconfusion, anxiety and economic disruption in order to pay the tab for \na mission that a majority of them do not support? We have already had \nfour rounds of base closures in seven years. Where does it end?\n  Let me be frank. I absolutely oppose additional base closures at this \ntime. In 1995, President Clinton completely destroyed the credibility \nof the Base Closure process by injecting subjective politics into an \notherwise objective process. There was no question what the President's \nmotivation was--pure electoral politics. But in the quest to gain more \nelectoral votes, the President disrupted a very fragile consensus. That \nconsensus, in support of shared sacrifice through and objective, \ntransparent process, is now gone. And it is President Clinton who bears \nresponsibility for that.\n  I would hasten to add, however, that even if we were to ignore the \npoliticization of the Base Closure process, the arguments in favor of \nmore closures are specious. It has yet to be demonstrated that we have \nsaved a single penny on the four previous rounds of closures. In fact, \nwe continue to spend exorbitant amounts to close, realign, and \nremediate bases. While the Department assures us that we will save vast \nsums of money one day, that day doesn't seem to be anywhere in the near \nfuture. We are spending a lot more right now to close bases than we are \nrecouping in operations and maintenance savings.\n  Unless and until the President can convince Congress and the American \npeople that politics have been eliminated from the process, and that \nprevious closures are demonstrably producing savings, I will not \nsupport additional base closures. Undoubtedly, this issue will be \ndebated further on the floor and conference, and I look forward to \nplaying an active role in these discussions.\n  Mr. President, I want to close by again thanking the distinguished \nChairman of the Armed Services Committee for his outstanding leadership \nin formulating this bill. I know there has been a great deal of praise \nheaped upon the senior Senator from South Carolina recently in \nconnection with his record for service in the Senate. It is richly \ndeserved. He is a man of utmost integrity and a tremendous inspiration \nto all of us who aspire to have a lasting impact on this institution. I \nam proud to serve with him on the Armed Services Committee, and pleased \nto support this legislation.\n  I thank the Chair, and yield the floor.\n\n\n          U.S. Air Force Reentry Vehicle Applications Program\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, the United States Air Force Reentry Vehicle \nApplications Program has been providing critical technologies required \nfor the manufacture of reentry vehicles and components. Of special note \nis the meaningful program with both the prime and the sub-tier \nsuppliers for the Mark 21 reentry vehicle. Funding for this program has \nadvanced reentry vehicle technologies while sustaining the critical \nindustrial base required to develop such technologies.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I would like to join my \ncolleague, Senator Snowe, in recognizing the work that has been ongoing \nin the Air Force Reentry Vehicle Applications Program. As is the case \nof any technology program, procurement decisions require careful \nanalysis of life-cycle costs and performance tradeoffs to ensure that \nmilitary requirements are met with the funding constraints that face \nthe Department of Defense.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I fully agree with my colleague, Senator \nSmith, and most strongly agree with his view on the Reentry Vehicle \nApplication Program. Unfortunately, quantitative data to support such \ncost and\n\n[[Page S7203]]\n\nperformance tradeoffs are not always readily available. This \ninformation is especially important as the Congress considers funding \nfor this and other programs. I am concerned that sufficient emphasis is \nnot being placed on this critical program to sustain the technology \nbase to conduct advance material studies which will sustain key \ntechnical staff, as well as fabrication capabilities and technologies.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I too am concerned that \nthese technologies be advanced, and suggest that a review of the \ntechnology base of supplier for both the materials and the components, \nsuch as the carbon/carbon nosetips presently used on the Mark 21 \nreentry vehicle, be conducted.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. President, and I thank my colleague from \nNew Hampshire, Senator Smith; for joining me in discussing this issue. \nI urge the conferees for the Fiscal Year 1998 National Defense Bill to \nfurther consider this subject.\n\n\n                    Sexual Harassment Accountability\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, this body has few greater responsibilities \nthan maintaining the effectiveness and accountability of our Nation's \nArmed Forces. This is one of the reasons that reports of widespread \nsexual harassment in our Nation's military deeply concerns us all. With \nDepartment of Defense statistics showing that sexual harassment is \nprevalent throughout the Armed Forces--we must do more than pay lip \nservice to the problem. Mr. President, we must act.\n  Today, with a full understanding that the time has come for serious \naction that is responsible and constructive, a provision that I \nauthored was added to the 1998 defense authorization bill that will \nplace us on the road to solving the crisis of sexual harassment. The \nlegislation attacks the root of the problem--the lack of accountability \nwhen it comes to reporting and investigating incidents of sexual \nharassment.\n  The Department of Defense conducted a survey in 1988 and found that \n64 percent of women reported that they had experienced one or more \nincidents of sexual harassment in the 12 months preceding the survey. \nThe Defense Department conducted another study in 1995 and found that \nthe figure had only improved to 55 percent. I feel very strongly, Mr. \nPresident, that this is not progress. When I look at those statistics, \nI am shocked.\n  On top of this, I have read in DOD statements that many cases of \nsexual harassment go unreported. In the 1995 Defense Department survey, \nonly 24 percent of the victims chose to report their sexual harassment \nexperiences. Is this the kind of environment to which we should subject \nour people? These numbers tell me that women essentially stand a 50-50 \nchance of being harassed. This cannot and should not be tolerated. Add \nto that the fact that over three-fourths of our people do not feel they \ncan report the harassment that occurs and you have a very negative set \nof circumstances. How can you maintain good order and discipline in \nsuch an environment? This situation demands accountability. And it \nrequires action to erase any perception that sexual harassment is \ntolerated in today's Armed Forces. Today, military members do not \nbelieve they can report sexual harassment and have their claims taken \nseriously.\n  During Armed Services Committee markup of the defense authorization \nbill, I offered an amendment that requires the unit commander to report \neach and every sexual harassment incident to their next senior officer \nwithin 72 hours. Once reported, the unit commander appoints an \ninvestigating officer to investigate the complaint of sexual \nharassment. The unit commander has 14 days to report back to their \ncommander with the results of the investigation. If the unit commander \ncannot complete the investigation within 14 days, that commander must \nreport the interim results, every 14 days, until the investigation has \nbeen completed.\n  Today when an incident is reported to a unit commander, the commander \nis not required to report the incident until a preliminary \ninvestigation recommends disciplinary action. This gives the unit \ncommander tremendous latitude as to how the case is handled. In most \ninstances this is a not a problem. But look what we saw at Aberdeen. We \nsaw a company commander who was a bad apple and no bells or whistles to \nalert his superiors that there was a problem. Under the provisions of \nthe national defense authorization bill each incident is immediately \nbrought to the attention of a more senior officer. The most distinct \nadvantage of this provision is that the decibel level of the problem \nrises by elevating the matter to the highest echelons of the services.\n  The provision also requires that the senior officers who receive \nthese reports of sexual harassment forward all the complaints they \nreceive and the results of the investigations of those complaints to \ntheir respective Service Secretary by January 31 of each year, \nelevating the problem another notch within the military to the authors \nof the services' zero tolerance policies where they can be scrutinized. \nThe Service Secretaries are then required to forward this information \nto the Secretary of Defense who in turn must report the information to \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, this provision was unanimously approved by the Armed \nServices Committee and will put us on the road to help end sexual \nharassment in our military. We owe the men and women who serve our \nNation an environment that includes accountability, good order, and \ndiscipline. But we also owe this to our Nation, which relies on our \nmilitary to defend our great country and its interests.\n\n\n                        carbonizable rayon fiber\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to bring my colleagues' \nattention to an issue affecting American jobs and national security \nissues. The Department of Defense uses approximately 500,000 pounds of \ncarbonizable rayon fiber per year in its many missile programs as a \nsolid rocket fuel. The sole domestic supplier of carbonizable rayon \nfiber is the North American Corporation in Elizabethton, Tennessee.\n  It is my fear that if the Department of Defense does not plan for the \nlong-term viability of its domestic supplier of carbonizable rayon the \nNorth American Corp. will simply go out of business and put 400 people \nout of work.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Could I interrupt the Senator from Tennessee and ask \nwhere the Department of Defense would turn for carbonizable rayon fiber \nin the future?\n  Mr. FRIST. If the North American Corp. goes out of business it is my \nunderstanding that the Department of Defense would be forced to depend \non less reliable foreign suppliers, probably in Mexico or Asia. \nFurther, it is my understanding that there is a lengthy and expensive \nprocess to qualify new suppliers that can take at least 3 years and \npossibly cost millions of dollars.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. It is my understanding that the Department of Defense \nhas procured its identified requirement for this material.\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct, but as you know it is always difficult to \nadequately identify future requirements as the lifecycle of our many \ncurrent programs is extended and especially in consideration of the \nemerging technologies where carbonizable rayon fiber could be applied.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. It seems to me that the Senator from Tennessee has \nraised several important concerns. The Department of Defense clearly \nhas a responsibility to fully review each of its programs using \ncarbonizable rayon fiber and make certain it has planned for future \nneeds before allowing the Nation's only domestic supplier to go out of \nbusiness.\n  Mr. FRIST. Thank you, Mr. President, and I thank my colleague for \njoining me in discussing this important issue. I enjoin the conferees \nfor the fiscal year 1998 national defense authorization bill to further \nconsider this subject.\n\n\n            commission on gender integration in the military\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the recent scandals and confusion concerning \ngender relations in our armed forces demonstrate a clear need to review \nthe experiences, practices, regulations and laws regarding these \nmatters as soon as possible. The nation has been treated to a range of \nincidents and official responses, from the cases of abuse of authority \nat the Aberdeen training facility and other military bases in the \nnation, to the controversy over the\n\n[[Page S7204]]\n\ntreatment of Air Force First Lieutenant Kelly Flinn, and that of flag \nofficers in the different services. A comprehensive independent review \nis needed on the full range of these issues, and I am pleased that the \nArmed Service Committee adopted a proposal of mine, which was co-\nauthored by Senators Kempthorne and Cleland, of the personnel \nsubcommittee, and supported by the full Committee, to establish an \nindependent commission to work on this matter.\n  The commission proposal is included as Section 552 of the bill. In \nsummary, the provision establishes an 11 member commission to study \nissues related to gender integration. All of the commission's members \nwould be appointed by the Senate. They would be chosen from among \nprivate citizens with knowledge of these matters--at least two from \nacademia, at least four former military members, and at least two \nmembers of the reserve components. The duties of the Commission include \n(a) reviewing the current practices of the Armed Forces, as well as \nrelevant studies and private sector training concepts regarding gender-\nintegrated training; (2) reviewing the laws, regulations, policies, \ndirectives, and practices that govern personal relationships between \nmen and women in the armed forces; (3) assessing the extent to which \nthose laws, regulations and policies have been applied consistently \nthroughout the Armed Forces without regard to service, grade, or rank \nof the individuals involved; (4) providing an independent assessment of \nthe reports of the various bodies that the Secretary of Defense has \nestablished to look into these matters; and (5) examining the \nexperiences, policies and practices of the armed forces of other \nindustrialized nations regarding gender-integrated training. An initial \nreport of the Commission is due on April 15, 1998, and a final report \nby September 16, 1998, with findings and any legislative and other \nrecommendations the Commission deems necessary. These dates were \nselected to allow the second session of this Congress time to act, if \nit wishes, on any recommendations that the Commission might provide.\n  Mr. President, clearly we are in the middle of a national debate on \ngender relations and on general conduct in the services, and the work \nof this independent commission to review the main issues which have \narisen seems urgent, and I hope will be of use to the Senate and to the \nnation. I also hope that all of us will keep our eye on the goal of \nproducing the most effective, combat-ready, disciplined and tough \nfighting force that the nation can field. I believe that effectiveness, \ndiscipline, unit cohesion and morale must not ever take a second place \nto any other goal, since the premier responsibility of the military is \nthe national security of our nation.\n  I again thank the committee for its strong support of my proposal, \nand I hope that the commission can be put into place as soon as \npossible after the Congress has completed its work on this bill and it \nhas been signed into law.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Thurmond, \nthe chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Levin, the \nranking member of the committee, and our other colleagues who serve on \nthe panel for their hard work and the bipartisan approach they took to \nthe fiscal year 1998 Department of Defense (DOD) Authorization bill. \nAlthough I am generally pleased with the committee's work, there are \nseveral provisions in the defense bill of great concern to me.\n  I am particularly disturbed by the committee's initial decision to \ncut the Cooperative Threat Reduction [CTR] Program as well as the \nDepartment of Energy's [DOE] Materials Protection Control and \nAccounting [MPC] Program and the International Nuclear Safety Program \nby a total of $135 million from the Administration's budget request. \nTogether, these three programs are essential to U.S. non-proliferation \nefforts and are critical to protecting the United States from weapons \nof mass destruction. These vital programs help Russia and other former \nSoviet Republics destroy nuclear, chemical and other weapons of mass \ndestruction. In addition, they assist Russia in developing and \ndeploying security measures to safeguard their remaining nuclear \nmaterials. Moreover, they help make much-needed improvements to Soviet-\ndesigned nuclear powerplants in Russia and the New Independent States.\n  Senators Lugar and Bingaman offered an amendment that will rectify \nwhat I think was a very shortsighted decision. Specifically, the \namendment will restore $60 million to the CTR Program, $25 million to \nthe MPC Program, and $50 million to the International Nuclear Safety \nProgram. These programs have long received bipartisan support, and I am \npleased the Senate adopted the Lugar-Bingaman amendment last night. \nAlthough many Members have already discussed the CTR Program, the MPC \nProgram, and the International Nuclear Safety Program in detail, I \nwould like to explain why I strongly believe each should be fully \nfunded.\n  The CTR Program, which is also known as the Nunn-Lugar program for \nits chief sponsors in the Senate, was established in 1991 in an effort \nto reduce the threat to the United States from weapons of mass \ndestruction. I believe the authors of this important legislation \nrightly concluded that the spread of these weapons represents the \ngreatest threat to U.S. national security in the post-cold war era. \nThrough this program, the United States has provided much-needed \nassistance to Russia and other former Soviet republics to destroy \nnuclear, chemical, and other weapons. In addition, the CTR Program has \nhelped establish verifiable safeguards against proliferation of these \nweapons and fissile materials and to facilitate demilitarization of \ndefense industries and defense conversion activities in the former \nSoviet Union.\n  Since its inception, the CTR Program has significantly helped reduce \nthe threat to the United States from weapons of mass destruction. With \nthis program's assistance, Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakstan became \nnonnuclear states, and approximately 3,400 strategic warheads have been \nwithdrawn from those three New Independent States to Russia. In \naddition, more than 1,500 nuclear warheads have been deactivated, and \napproximately 930 deployed launchers and bombers in Russia, Belarus, \nUkraine and Kazakstan have been destroyed.\n  Despite the CTR Program's many accomplishments, more weapons of mass \ndestruction have yet to be destroyed, and more needs to be done to \nfurther reduce the threat to the United States from these weapons. The \nPresident has requested $382 million for the CTR Program in fiscal year \n1998. This funding will be used for a number of programs, all designed \nto eliminate the threat Russian nuclear weapons pose to the United \nStates.\n  For example, $78 million will support the Russian elimination of \nICBM's, silo launchers, Submarine Launched Ballistic Missile [SLBM] \nlaunchers and bombers and $77 million will be used to assist the \nUkraine eliminate SS-19 ICBM's, silos and launch control facilities. \nSeven million dollars will provide safe and secure storage containers \nfor fissile materials from dismantled nuclear weapons. Thirty-six \nmillion dollars will be used to provide comprehensive security \nenhancements for nuclear weapons storage sites in Russia. And $55 \nmillion will help design and build a chemical weapons destruction \nfacility in Russia. Full funding is critical to U.S. plans to continue \nimplementing these initiatives. Before the Lugar-Bingaman amendment was \naccepted, however, the fiscal year 1998 DOD Authorization bill had \ncalled for the CTR Program to be cut by $60 million in fiscal year \n1998.\n  The Department of Energy's [DOE] Materials Protection Control and \nAccounting Program is a similarly worthy program. It assists Russia, \nthe New Independent States, and the Baltic States in their efforts to \nstrengthen materials protection, control, and accountability of \nmaterials used in nuclear weapons. To date, DOE has helped establish 18 \nsites in Russia, the New Independent States, and the Baltic states to \nsafeguard plutonium and uranium weapons material. Moreover, agreements \nare in place to enhance the safety and security at over 30 additional \nsites. This program is critical to U.S. efforts to prevent the theft of \nweapons-usable fissile materials, plutonium and highly enriched \nuranium.\n\n[[Page S7205]]\n\n  Although DOE has already helped secure hundreds of tons of nuclear \nweapons materials, the overwhelming majority of material is still \npoorly secured. Consequently, the administration is requesting that the \nMPC Program be increased by $25 million in fiscal year 1998. This \nfunding request is necessary for U.S. plans to continue implementing \nthis program. Before the Lugar-Bingaman amendment was accepted, \nhowever, the fiscal year 1998 Defense Authorization bill had called for \nthe MPC Program to continue to be funded only at fiscal year 1997 \nlevels.\n  The administration's budget request also includes $50 million for the \nInternational Nuclear Safety Program. This program, which is also \noperated by DOE, helps to make improvements to Soviet-designed nuclear \npowerplants in Russia and the New Independent States. By helping these \ncountries implement desperately needed safety measures, this program \nhelps reduce the risk of another Chernobyl nuclear power reactor \ndisaster. Again, full funding is critical to U.S. plans to continue \nimplementing these initiatives. Again, before the Lugar-Bingaman \namendment was accepted, the fiscal year 1998 Defense Authorization bill \nwould have prevented the Pentagon from providing any funds to the \nInternational Nuclear Safety Program in fiscal year 1998.\n  The fiscal year 1998 DOD Authorization bill before the Senate \nprovides $268.2 billion in budget authority for the DOD and the \nnational security programs at DOE. This is $2.6 billion beyond the \nlevel the President initially requested. In addition, the bill includes \n$3.6 billion for ballistic missile defense purposes and more than $5 \nbillion for weapons systems not originally requested by the Pentagon. \nConsidering those facts, it is inconceivable to me that the Senate \nwould cut the CTR Program, the MPC Program and the International \nSafety Program by $135 million.\n  Mr. President, these three programs are critical to our efforts to \nprotect the United States from weapons of mass destruction. Unlike \nballistic missile defense, the CTR Program, the MPC Program and the \nInternational Safety Program have already produced results and caused \nthe destruction of Russian nuclear weapons. Simply put, they make our \nworld safer. I am pleased that the Senate adopted the Lugar-Bingaman \namendment last night, and I commend my colleagues on the Senate Armed \nServices Committee for rectifying what would have been a tragic \nmistake.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I think the time has come now that the distinguished \nranking member and myself clear what amendments are cleared on both \nsides. Then I am prepared to proceed to wrap up, and we can close the \nSenate down.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum. I hope this quorum \nwill not exceed 2 to 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/10/senate-section/article/S7145-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I rise to express my deep concern about the \nbrutal subversion of democracy underway in Cambodia. I urge the \nadministration to condemn the action for what it is: A bloody coup \nd'etat perpetrated by co-Prime Minister Hun Sen and his Cambodian \nPeople's Party.\n  The administration today announced it was suspending for 30 days all \nassistance provided to the Cambodian Government. All such assistance, \nincluding loans provided by the World Bank and other international \nfinancial institutions, should remain suspended until the \ndemocratically elected Government of Cambodia is restored.\n  Programs implemented through nongovernmental organizations--efforts \nsupporting the rule of law, public health, prosthetics for mine \nvictims, et cetera--should be reviewed to determine which ones can \ncontinue in light of recent events.\n  I applaud the decision taken by the Association of Southeast Asian \nNations [ASEAN] to delay Cambodia's membership in that organization. \nCambodia's neighbors are under no illusions that Cambodia today is \nprepared to be a responsible member of the international community.\n\n\n                               BACKGROUND\n\n  A few weeks ago, Cambodia seemed poised to close the book on a bloody \nchapter of its history by bringing the genocidal Khmer Rouge Leader Pol \nPot to justice. But now Hun Sen threatens to plunge the country back \ninto darkness and civil war.\n  Dozens of people have been killed. There are reports of mass arrests \nand looting in the Capital of Phnom Penh. Prince Ranariddh's supporters \nhave been expelled from the legislative assembly. Interior Minister, \nand Ranariddh loyalist, Ho Sok reportedly has been executed while in \nthe custody of government troops.\n  For the long-suffering people of Cambodia--victims of ``the killing \nfields''--Hun Sen's unconstitutional action is a painful blow to their \nquest for democracy, reconciliation, and national reconstruction. That \nquest seemed achievable in October 1991 when--after 12 years of civil \nwar--Cambodia's warring factions and all of the foreign parties who had \nplayed a role in the Cambodian conflict signed the Paris peace accords. \nVietnam withdrew its army from Cambodia and the United Nations \nestablished the U.N. Transitional Authority for Cambodia [UNTAC].\n  UNTAC's primary goal was to oversee the creation of a democratic, \ninternationally recognized government in Phnom Penh. UNTAC was the \nlargest, most comprehensive, and most expensive peacekeeping operation \nin the history of the United Nations. More than 12,000 troops, 4,000 \ncivil police, and 20,000 civilian workers and volunteers from more than \n50 countries poured into Cambodia.\n  UNTAC supervised the return of more than 400,000 refugees from \nThailand and the registration of 5 million eligible voters. The \noperation cost more than $1.7 billion, with an additional $2 billion \npledged by international donors to fund reconstruction of the war-torn \ncountry.\n  In May 1993, Cambodia experienced its first free and fair multiparty \nelection. Despite terrorist threats from the Khmer Rouge--who refused \nto participate in the election and shelled some polling places--90 \npercent of registered voters came to the polls.\n  The incredible turnout was a testimony to the enthusiasm of the \nCambodian people for democracy and their desire for peace.\n  Prince Ranariddh's party won those elections. Hun Sen's party came in \nsecond. But when Hun Sen disputed the results and threatened to plunge \nthe country back into civil war, King Sihanouk, with the blessing of \nthe international community, fashioned a compromise.\n  A coalition government was established, with Prince Ranariddh and Hun \nSen serving as co-Prime Ministers. They jointly administered Cambodia \nuntil Hun Sen's coup d'etat last weekend.\n  The coalition was never an easy one. In recent months, relations \nbetween the two Prime Ministers had become increasingly strained as \nboth began jockeying for position in the runup to national elections \nscheduled for 1998.\n  The disintegration of the Khmer Rouge actually exacerbated the \ntension between the two major parties, as each sought the political and \nmilitary support of the breakaway Khmer Rouge elements.\n  Now the tensions have flared into open conflict. The question for the \nfriends of democracy in Cambodia is how to respond.\n  Our first priority must be to ensure the safety of more than 1,000 \nAmerican citizens--including our diplomatic and military personnel.\n  Our very able Ambassador in Phnom Penh, Ken Quinn, has acted with \ncourage and professionalism to provide a\n\n[[Page S7206]]\n\nsafe haven for Americans and to assist those seeking to leave the \ncountry. Thailand has been enormously helpful by providing aircraft to \ntransport Americans and other foreigners out of Cambodia, and I want to \nexpress my personal thanks to the Royal Thai Government and the people \nof Thailand for their asssistance.\n\n\n                          restoring democracy\n\n  Mr. President, I fear that putting Cambodia back on the democratic \npath will prove difficult. The international community is not likely to \nfund a second UNTAC. The future of Cambodia is largely in the hands of \nthe Cambodian people.\n  But the world must not turn its back on Cambodia.\n  At a time when pluralism and democracy are generally expanding in \nAsia, we should not condone the unconstitutional use of force to oust a \nlegitimately elected government. As the world knows from recent \nhistory, political instability in Cambodia threatens the peace and \nsecurity of all of Southeast Asia.\n  It is in the interest of the United States and all of our friends and \nallies in the region to seek a peaceful resolution of the conflict \nconsistent with the spirit of the Paris peace accords. As my colleague, \nSenator McCain urged this body yesterday, we must remain engaged and \nstand ready to do our part.\n  The tragic political violence occurring today in Cambodia is proof \nthat one election does not make a democracy. In many respects, it is \nthe second election--the peaceful transfer of power from one \nadministration to the next--that is the miracle of democratic \ngovernance.\n  In the United States, we have the opportunity to experience that \nmiracle every 4 years. In Cambodia, the second election, scheduled for \n1998, is in jeopardy. The quest of the Cambodian people is endangered.\n  I urge Hun Sen to abandon the path of violence and subordinate his \nown ambitions to the will of the Cambodian people and their dream of \npeace. I hope and pray that Hun Sen and Prince Ranariddh will heed King \nSihanouk's call and find a way to settle their differences through the \nballot box rather than the barrel of a gun.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/10/senate-section/article/S7205-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     NOMINATION OF ERIC H. HOLDER JR. TO BE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it was with concerted effort that Senator \nHatch and I worked to ensure that Eric Holder was reported by the \nJudiciary Committee and ready for Senate confirmation to the important \nposition of Deputy Attorney General of the United States before the \nSenate adjourned 2 weeks ago. The President's nomination of Mr. Holder \nto the second highest position at the Department of Justice was \nreported to the Senate without a single dissent on June 24. This \nnomination could and should have been approved by the Senate before it \nadjourned for the last extended recess. It is strongly supported by \nSenator Hatch, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n  There was and is no Democratic hold on this nomination. The delay on \nthe Republican side in considering this nomination remains unexplained.\n  Eric Holder has proven his dedication to effective law enforcement. \nAs a former prosecutor myself, I appreciate Mr. Holder's distinguished \ncareer in law enforcement.\n  Shortly after his graduation from Columbia Law School, Mr. Holder \njoined the Department of Justice as part of the Attorney General's \nHonors Program. He was assigned to the newly formed Public Integrity \nSection in 1976, where he worked for 12 years investigating and \nprosecuting corruption.\n  While at the Public Integrity Section, Mr. Holder participated in a \nnumber of prosecutions and appeals involving such defendants as the \nState treasurer of Florida, a former Ambassador to the Dominican \nRepublic, a local judge in Philadelphia, an assistant U.S. attorney in \nNew York City, an FBI agent, and a capo in an organized crime family. \nHe received a number of awards for outstanding performance and special \nachievement from the Department of Justice.\n  In 1988, President Reagan nominated and the Senate confirmed Mr. \nHolder to be an Associate Judge of the Superior Court of the District \nof Columbia, where he served for the next 5 years. In his 5 years on \nthe bench, Judge Holder presided over hundreds of criminal trials.\n  In 1993, President Clinton nominated and the Senate confirmed Eric \nHolder to the important post of U.S. Attorney for the District of \nColumbia. As U.S. attorney for one of the largest U.S. Attorney's \noffices in the Nation, Mr. Holder has supervised 300 lawyers involved \nin criminal, civil and appellate cases. He has functioned as both the \nlocal district attorney and the Federal prosecutor.\n  He has been active in community affairs. For more than a decade, he \nhas been a member of Concerned Black Men, an organization seeking to \nhelp young people in the District of Columbia. He is involved in a \nnumber of the group's activities, including the Efficacy Program and \nthe pregnancy prevention effort. He has participated in the D.C. Street \nLaw Program and is active in the See Forever Foundation and the \nNational Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship. He is cochair of \nProject PACT to reduce youth violence and has been instrumental in the \nU.S. attorney's office's outreach efforts to the D.C. community.\n  In 1994, he received the Pioneer Award from the National Black \nProsecutors Association. In 1995, his contributions were recognized \nwhen he received awards from the District of Columbia Bar Association, \nthe Greater Washington Urban League, the American Jewish Congress, and \nPhi Beta Sigma fraternity. Last year, he received awards from the D.C. \nChapter of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement \nExecutives, George Washington University, Columbia College, the \nFederation of Citizens Associations of the District of Columbia, Omega \nPsi Phi fraternity, the Brotherhood of Shiloh Men, McDonald's, and the \nAsian Pacific Bar Association.\n  I urge the Republican leadership to move forward without further \ndelay and confirm the nomination of Eric Holder to be Deputy Attorney \nGeneral.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/10/senate-section/article/S7206-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7206-S7207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           JUDICIAL VACANCIES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I last spoke to the Senate about the crisis \nbeing created by our failure to move forward expeditiously to fill \nlongstanding judicial vacancies on June 26, the day before we left on \nour most recent recess. I pointed out then that we had the opportunity \nliterally to double judicial confirmations for the year from 5 to 10 by \ntaking up and approving the five judicial nominees on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar. In spite of the noncontroversial nature of these \nnominees and their likely confirmation, the Republican leadership \nrefused to consider them.\n  As the Senate returns from another extended recess we enter July \nhaving found time to confirm only 6 Federal judges of the 39 nominees \nthe President has sent to us. That remains a confirmation rate of less \nthan one judge per month. We continue to fall farther and farther \nbehind the pace established by Senator Dole and Senator Hatch in the \nlast Congress. By this time 2 years ago, Senator Hatch had held six \nconfirmation hearings involving 26 judicial nominees and the Senate had \nproceeded to confirm 26 Federal judges by the end of June--during one \nof the busiest periods ever, during the first 100 days of the \nRepublicans' ``Contract with America.''\n  I have spoken often about the crisis being created by the 100 \nvacancies that are being perpetuated on the Federal courts around the \ncountry, as has the Chief Justice of the United States. At the rate \nthat we are currently going more and more vacancies are continuing to \nmount over longer and longer times to the detriment of greater numbers \nof Americans and the national cause of prompt justice.\n  There are four highly-qualified judicial nominees on the Senate \ncalendar, another five district court nominees who were the subject of \na confirmation hearing on June 25 but who have yet to receive attention \nfrom the Judiciary Committee, and another 24 nominees for whom the \ncommittee has yet to schedule a hearing or consideration.\n  That judges were held hostage to the resolution of other nomination \ndisputes was a shame. I had urged the Republican leadership not to use \nthe judiciary as a political pressure point or to\n\n[[Page S7207]]\n\ninvolve the judiciary in disagreement over other matters, but they \nchose to act otherwise.\n  I would hope that the Senate would move to confirm these four \nadditional judges on its calendar without further delay this week. \nThree of them had their confirmation hearing back in early May and have \nbeen on the Senate calendar without action for more than 6 weeks. The \nother had a confirmation hearing back in March, and was reported for a \nsecond time almost 1 month ago.\n  The Republican leadership chose to single out only one judicial \nnominee for a unanimous consent request and approval before the most \nrecent recess. Over the break I took the trouble to review the record \non that nominee to see whether it held a clue regarding why that \nparticular nominee, as opposed to the other qualified nominees, had \nbeen singled out for special attention.\n  Nominated by the President on February 12 of this year, Alan Gold is \nset to fill a vacancy that was created on the District Court for the \nSouthern District of Florida on November 30, 1996, when Judge Gonzalez \ntook senior status. His is the only vacancy remaining on that Court and \nit has existed for less than 7 months. He was included in a \nconfirmation hearing on May 7 and reported by the Judiciary Committee 2 \nweeks later.\n  As I have said before, it should not take more than 4 months to \nconsider a judicial nominee and the Gold nomination and its treatment \nshould serve as the standard by which we measure the Senate's treatment \nof other nominees. Although it should represent the normal process, it \nis the exception this year.\n  He has a commendable background but so do the other nominees for \njudicial appointment. In reviewing the file, I see that Judge Gold was \nrated well qualified by the ABA. Given Senator Hatch's speech \ncondemning the influence of the ABA and its ratings in our confirmation \nprocess, I doubt that explains his prompt confirmation. Eric Clay was \nalso rated well qualified for his Sixth Circuit nomination and he was \nheld back on the calendar. William Fletcher, James Beatty, Margaret \nMeKeown, Marjorie Rendell, Richard Lazzara, Margaret Morrow and others \nhave likewise received the ABA's highest rating and have not seen their \nnominations expedited.\n  In reviewing his confirmation hearing and the answers to the written \nquestions that followed, I see that he singled out for criticism the \ncase of Griswold versus Connecticut, which affirmed a privacy right \nguaranteed by the Constitution, and listed as the book that has most \ninfluenced his view of the law ``The Tempting of America'' by Robert \nBork. My fear is that this confirmation reflects a litmus test being \nimposed by the Republican majority and that is why they singled out \nthis nomination for expedited treatment. I hope that is not so.\n  I hope that nominees are not being forced to swear allegiance to \nRobert Bork instead of the Constitution of the United States in order \nto be confirmed. I hope that a nominee can uphold the important privacy \nrights that the Supreme Court has recognized to be constitutionally \nbased and still be confirmed. I would like to believe that there is a \nneutral, alternative explanation for the treatment of this nomination \nrelative to the others and that no Senator is imposing an ideological \nlitmus test on judicial nominations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/10/senate-section/article/S7206-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of America. \nThe data are undeniable: Individuals from strong families contribute to \nthe society. In an era when nearly half of all couples married today \nwill see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both \ninstructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment \nof ``till death us do part\" seriously, demonstrating successfully the \ntimeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics \nmake our country strong.\n  For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Janice and Bill \nLancaster of Grandview, MO, who on July 23, 1997, will celebrate their \n37th wedding anniversary. My wife, Janet, and I look forward to the day \nwe can celebrate a similar milestone. The Lancasters' commitment to the \nprinciples and values of their marriage deserves to be saluted and \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/10/senate-section/article/S7207-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     RETIREMENT OF BRIGADIER GENERAL DAVID ``BULL'' E. BAKER, USAF\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, ``Patriot'' is a word best grasped through \nexample: a life lived or service rendered in defense of our country's \ninterests and values. I rise today to recognize an Air Force officer \nwhose service to this nation offers us a splendid example of \npatriotism.\n  Brigadier General David ``Bull'' E. Baker will soon retire from the \nU.S. Air Force. Duty and sacrifice have been the standards of an \nexemplary career that has bridged our Nation's most recent conflicts. \nBull Baker flew for his country in the skies over Southeast Asia, \nnorthern Europe and Iraq. Over Cambodia his OV-2A was shot down and he \nwas held a prisoner of war by the Viet Cong. In February 1973, General \nBaker became the only United States Air Force prisoner repatriated from \nCambodia.\n  By all accounts, Bull Baker is an exceptional pilot. He was one of \nthe first F-15 Eagle pilots as well as the flight commander for the Air \nForce's first female jet pilots. During Operation Desert Storm, General \nBaker flew 21 combat missions in the F-15E Strike Eagle.\n  This experience as a pilot and a commander has helped him excel in \nhis current position. As the National Reconnaissance Office's Deputy \nDirector for Military Support, General Baker ensures that our \nintelligence satellites are there to support military commanders. Some \n4,000 flying hours and the force of his personality have proven far \nmore formidable than any bureaucratic obstacle, and he has been able to \nprovide our warfighters a unilateral advantage through timely, critical \nintelligence. Our military forces' ability to successfully execute \ncomplex, simultaneous operations from Bosnia, to the Middle East, and \nto the west coast of Africa is a testament to General Baker's ability \nand dedication.\n  In Bull Baker's career and accomplishments, a word overshadows a \nthousand pictures. He has placed integrity first, offered service \nbefore self, and excelled in all he was called to do. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in recognizing a patriot.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/10/senate-section/article/S7207-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a treaty \nand sundry nominations which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/10/senate-section/article/S7207-4", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S7208]]\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:58 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate.\n\n       H.R. 858.

DOLE UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I have the great pleasure of introducing \nlegislation, along with my colleague, Senator Brownback, to name the \nU.S. Courthouse at 500 State Avenue in Kansas City, KS, as the Robert \nJ. Dole U.S. Courthouse. I think all of our colleagues know that \nalthough our esteemed former colleague has received scores of honors, I \nam pleased to lead the Kansas congressional delegation in naming this \ncourthouse after Bob because it reflects his common sense and honest \nwork in the U.S. Senate not only nationally but also in regard to \nKansas.\n  Senator Dole's career on behalf of the State of Kansas is well-\nknown--State Representative, Russell County attorney, Congressman of \nKansas' big First Congressional District from 1961 to 1969, and Senator \nfrom 1969 to 1996. When Senator Dole stepped down from the Senate last \nyear as Kansas' great senior Senator and longest-serving Republican \nmajority leader, he showed determination and courage in his all-out \neffort to win the 1996 Presidential election.\n  Although being majority leader cast Senator Dole as a national \npolitical figure, forcing him to tackle every single issue before the \nCongress, he never stopped his tireless work on behalf of Kansans in \nall 105 counties. There was no inside the beltway for Bob Dole; it was \ninside the Sunflower State. If you travel into any Kansas community, be \nit Wichita or Wakeeney and ask a resident about Bob Dole, they will \neasily recall his care about their concerns. Kansans will tell you of \ngetting the Social Security check delivered quicker or inserting some \nprovision in legislation for a public works project that made a lot of \nsense and was a taxpayer investment. Whenever national disasters \nstruck, Kansas Senator Dole also alerted the appropriate Federal \ndisaster relief officials and personally tried to alleviate the \nemotional and the physical damage from tornadoes, droughts and floods.\n  Throughout Kansas, Senator Dole was always available. He listened and \nlearned from farmers, soccer moms, businessmen, and children. The \nissues were as diverse as Kansas itself-- economic development needs of \nour State urban areas like Kansas City, or a farmer's desire for higher \ngrain prices and safer roads for drivers and transportation.\n  Mr. President, the Federal courthouse at 500 State Avenue in Kansas \nCity, KS, is an example of Senator Dole's leadership in Kansas. He, \nwith the support of a bipartisan group of local elected officials and \ncommunity leaders, succeeded in keeping the courthouse in downtown \nKansas City, KS. Now, this Federal presence has served to revitalize \nthe neighborhoods. In fact, on Tuesday, another key component of his \ninterest in Kansas City, KS, to this development effort was\n\n[[Page S7211]]\n\nstarted through the groundbreaking of the new Federal building across \nthe street from the courthouse to house the EPA region VII offices.\n  This was very typical of Bob Dole. He reached out to local Democrats, \nRepublicans, and Independents. No matter that Senator Dole was a \nRepublican, Kansas City, KS, and Wyandotte County Democrats deeply \nappreciated his efforts not only on the Federal courthouse but on other \nmatters such as the Federal response to the flood of 1993.\n  Realizing that the former Federal courthouse would be vacated for the \nnew courthouse and would become excess Federal property, Senator Dole \nworked with local officials and the GSA to ensure that the former \ncourthouse would be transferred to Wyandotte County so they could use \nit for additional judicial space. This saved Wyandotte County and the \ntaxpayer a great deal of money.\n  This U.S. courthouse represents the State of Kansas' efficient use of \nland and labor. The building was designed in a contemporary judicial \nstyle and is intended to be a model for future Federal court buildings. \nAs part of this style, cost savings features were used such as precast \nconcrete instead of a natural stone facade, combined with energy \nefficient double-glazed aluminum frame windows. It is clear that \nSenator Dole's perseverance to reduce our Federal spending was applied \nin this courthouse. This design reduced costs and increased efficiency \nunlike other Federal courthouses that have Cadillac courtrooms and \nexceeded their budgets.\n  Mr. President, this Federal courthouse has 165,000 square feet of \noffice space. I am proud to let my colleagues know that its budget was \n$40,868,000. But the finished cost was $34 million. That is right, a \nFederal project was actually finished for less than its budget, $6.7 \nmillion to be exact. While the primary role for this building is for \nthe Federal judicial process, other agencies such as the U.S. Marshal, \nthe Peace Corps and Congressman Vince Snowbarger, also utilize this \noffice space in the courthouse.\n  Mr. President, Senator Brownback joins me in asking that the \nEnvironmental and Public Works Committee act expeditiously on this bill \nbefore the August recess.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the bill printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                                S. 1000\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF ROBERT J. DOLE UNITED STATES \n                   COURTHOUSE\n\n       The United States courthouse at 500 State Avenue in Kansas \n     City, Kansas, shall be known and designated as the ``Robert \n     J.

Dole United States Courthouse''.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I thank the able Senator from Kansas. \nThe name of the courthouse for Bob Dole is purely a Kansas matter, but \nI just want to say that no finer person in the United States deserves a \ncourthouse or any other building named for him than Bob Dole. He is a \ngreat American. He has rendered this country great service. He was an \noutstanding leader here in the Senate for many years. We are all proud \nof him and we will be delighted to have a courthouse named for him.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire (for himself and Mr. Gregg):\n  S. 1001. A bill to amend title 31, United States Code, to address the \nfailure to appropriate sufficient funds to make full payments in lieu \nof taxes under chapter 69, of that title by exempting certain users of \nthe National Forest System from fees imposed in connection with the \nuse; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                   the local forest user fairness act\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I take the floor today to \nintroduce the Local Forest User Fairness Act with my colleague Senator \nGregg. This legislation would allow residents of counties where U.S. \nForest Service land is situated to recreate in the forest without \npaying a user fee. The introduction of this bill was prompted by the \nrecent institution of recreational user fees in certain national \nforests across the country, one of those being the White Mountain \nNational Forest in New Hampshire.\n  While I am not opposed to user fees per se, I do have some concerns \nin this instance because of the potential for double taxation and \ninequitable treatment for local residents. Those areas where the \nFederal Government owns much of the land suffer from a diminished \nproperty tax base to fund schools and other necessary social needs. To \naddress this inequity, Congress passed the Payments in Lieu of Taxes, \nor PILT, program in 1976 which partially reimburses local units of \ngovernment for their loss of property tax revenue due to the U.S. \nForest Service's ownership of local land. Unfortunately, this program \nhas not been fully funded for a number of years.\n  This bill provides that until the PILT program is fully funded to its \nauthorized level, local residents recreating in the forest would be \nexempt from paying user fees. In New Hampshire, this would apply to all \nresidents of Coos, Grafton, and Carroll Counties. For these areas, the \nshortfall in PILT payments for fiscal year 1996 was nearly $250,000, \nproviding only 68 percent of what was owed to them. Because of this \nshortfall, county and municipal governments are forced to find much \nneeded revenue elsewhere, including increased property taxes. It is \nsimply unfair to charge these communities with using the White \nMountains when they are already subsidizing the forest.\n  I believe the Local Forest User Fairness Act provides for a \nreasonable, fair way of dealing with this inequity. Our proposed \nexemption would not be necessary, of course, if the Federal Government \nwere to fully fund the PILT program and provide adequate funding for \nForest Service management--initiatives that I strongly support.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I want to commend my other New \nHampshire colleague, Congressman Bass, for developing and introducing \nthis legislation in the House. Together, I hope we can establish a more \nequitable situation for our constituents who live, work, and play in or \nnear our national forests. I now ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1001\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, we must be sure that we are taking the \nnecessary steps to protect the citizens of our nation by preventing \ndrug traffickers, organized crime and terrorist groups from obtaining \nthe profits of their illegal activities. Much has been done and said \nabout the movement of illegal drugs into the United States or \nterrorists acts against our country. But the opposite side of the \nbusiness--getting the profits from drug sales and other illegal \nenterprises out of the country and back into the hands of the criminal \norganizations--does not get as much publicity and is just as important.\n  In an effort to strike another blow to drug traffickers and criminals \nwho prey on our citizens by their ill-gotten gains, today I, in \nconjunction with Senator D'Amato, am introducing companion legislation \nto H.R. 1756, the Money Laundering and Financial Crimes Strategy Act of \n1997. This legislation will authorize the Secretary of the Treasury, in \nconsultation with the Attorney General and other relevant agencies, to \ncoordinate and implement a national strategy to address the \nexploitation of our Nation's payment systems to facilitate money \nlaundering and related financial crimes. The strategy will enhance and \nexpand the Secretary's authority to ascertain criminal activity \ndirected at our Nation's financial systems, determine the threat posed \nto the integrity of such systems, and develop regulatory and law \nenforcement initiatives to respond. The bill will hit the criminals \nwhere they feel it the most--in their pocketbooks. By implementing a \nstrategy on a national level, hundreds of communities across our \ncountry will no longer be held hostage by these criminal enterprises.\n  As we know, money laundering involves disguising financial assets so \nthey can be used without detection of the illegal activity that \nproduced them. Through money laundering, the criminal transforms the \nmonetary proceeds derived from the criminal activity into funds with an \napparently legal source. Money laundering provides the resources from \ndrug dealers, terrorists, arms dealers, and other criminals to operate \nand expand their criminal enterprises. Today, experts estimate that \nmoney laundering has grown into a $500 billion problem worldwide.\n  A significant component of this strategy will involve defining \nspecific criminal activity affecting geographic areas, payment systems \nand financial institutions, that are considered to have a high \npotential to be abused by criminal organizations. These high risk money \nlaundering zones will then be targeted for specific action, whether it \nis specific law enforcement operations, preventative efforts to \ninsulate entire payment systems, or industry sectors from being \nexploited by criminal elements. This legislation will help provide \nassistance to localities for example, state and local prosecutors and \nlaw enforcement officials in the form of federal financial crimes \ngrants to any area designated as a ``High Risk Money Laundering Zone.''\n  I would also like to thank my colleagues, Senators Dianne Feinstein, \nTed Stevens, Tim Hutchinson, Bob Graham, Chuck Hagel, and Lauch \nFaircloth, for joining in cosponsoring this bi-partisan legislation. \nWorking together, we need to tighten up our financial control \ncapabilities to prevent criminal enterprises from abusing our financial \nand banking systems. I hope this legislation will be the beginning of a \nserious effort by Congress to impact the growing threat of money \nlaundering not only to our Nation, but worldwide.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I have a copy of my \nlegislation printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I would like to add Senator Strom Thurmond as \ncosponsor of that legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1003\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today, I am proud to sponsor a bill which \nattacks drug traffickers by making it harder for these criminals to \nprofit from their illegal windfalls. We have long known of the terrible \nprice our communities pay because of drug abuse; the dashed hopes and \ndreams and the shattered lives of millions of Americans. The Congress, \nand the Administration, have a responsibility to do everything we can \nto restore those dreams and rebuild these communities.\n  Drug kingpins and cartels are destroying our neighborhoods and \npoisoning our children. Unless we put an immediate stop to this \ncriminal behavior, drug lords will continue to penetrate our schools \nand families.\n  Mr. President, through money laundering, drug traffickers are able to \ntake their blood money and launder it clean. These ill-gotten gains are \nthen filtered throughout our economy. Money laundering sustains drug \nand arms dealers, as well as terrorists and other criminals searching \nfor a way to prolong their illegal enterprises. Tax evasions, and trade \nand insurance fraud are the related byproducts of money laundering.\n  Money laundering robs our Nation's financial institutions of their \nmost valuable asset--their integrity. By abusing the Nation's financial \ninstitutions, the launderers increase their wealth and power often by \npurchasing land and buildings with these illicit funds. So it soon \nbecomes impossible to distinguish drug money from wealth earned by hard \nworking taxpayers.\n  Day in, day out, the drug lords relentlessly peddle their products of \ndeath and misery for huge profits. While our police are hampered by \ntheir inability to effectively target large cash transactions. This \nbill sends the message that ``enough is enough.'' It hands our law \nenforcement agencies the tools to hit the criminals where it hurts--in \nthe pocketbook.\n  Mr. President, the bill has three major provisions:\n  First, It requires the Treasury Secretary to create a national money \nlaundering strategy and report to Congress.\n  Second, It allows the Secretary to designate ``high risk zones\" where \nmoney laundering is concentrated.\n  Third, The high risk zones will be eligible for law enforcement \nassistance and technical assistance and antimoney laundering grants.\n  This bill is not based on hypotheticals--it was not drafted out of \nthin air--it is based on hands-on experience of what has worked for our \ndrug enforcement agencies. We have learned that the most effective \nmethod of fighting this problem is for law enforcement agencies to work \ntogether. That is why we have called for a national strategy. And that \nis why the bill directs the Secretary to give special preference to law \nenforcement or prosecutorial agencies that coordinate activities when \nawarding grants to combat money laundering.\n  This approach has proven successful in a recent New York undercover \noperation known as ``El Dorado''. This joint law enforcement effort \nused a Treasury Department tool known as a GTO-Geographic Targeting \nOrder. Under the GTO, designated money remitters were required to \nreport detailed information about all cash transfers to Columbia over \n$750. The results of Operation ``El Dorado'' were phenomenal:\n  Cash transfers by three major remitters plummeted from $67 million to \n$2 million;\n  The overall number of transactions by those same remitters dropped 95 \npercent and the dollar amount dropped 97 percent;\n  There has been $30 million in currency seizures, three arrests and \none conviction.\n  Most importantly, Operation ``El Dorado'' disrupted the profit flow \nfrom the United State to the drug cartels.\n  Operation El Dorado was a huge success--but it was limited by the \nnature of the GTO itself--it is a temporary legal device. We need to \nstop these criminals forever!\n  Our experience in New York demonstrates that only a comprehensive and \ncooperative solution will achieve results. We must take decisive and \nimmediate steps to stop this insidious cancer from rotting away at our \ncountry's legitimate economy and financial system. This bill would \nessentially put in place a permanent GTO in high risk areas.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 1006. A bill to authorize appropriations for the expansion of the \ncolumbarium of the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific; to the \nCommittee on Veterans Affairs.\n\n\n       expansion of the national memorial cemetery of the pacific\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am today introducing a bill which allows \nfor the expansion of the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific, \ncommonly referred to as Punchbowl. I am pleased that my colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Hawaii, Senator Inouye has joined me as a sponsor \nof this measure.\n  This is a very simple bill. It authorizes $1.5 million for the \nconstruction of an additional columbarium at the National Memorial \nCemetery of the Pacific.\n  The cemetery is nearing its capacity and is only open to interment of \ncremains. It is estimated by the year 2002, Punchbowl will no longer be \nopen for any burials. However, while the national cemetery will be \nclosed to burials, Hawaii will begin to experience 5 years of the \ngreatest expected burial needs for our World War II veterans.\n  Currently, 26,000 World War II veterans reside in Hawaii. Based on \npresent columbarium usage at Punchbowl, the Department of Veterans \nAffairs expects 20 percent of these veterans to chose cremation and \ninurnment at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific.\n  The number of Hawaii veterans wishing to be interred at Punchbowl \ndoes not include veterans who reside outside of Hawaii who would like \nto be buried at this facility. Every year, we have veterans who choose \nto return to Hawaii to be buried with their comrades.\n  The bill I am introducing today will allow Punchbowl to accommodate \n5,000 additional veterans and their spouses. This small expansion will \nallow our Nation's veterans, particularly those who served their \ncountry in World War II, to be buried in National Memorial Cemetery of \nthe Pacific.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this fair and reasonable request on \nbehalf of our Nation's veterans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (by request):\n\n[[Page S7215]]\n\n  S. 1007. A bill to amend the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and \nEmergency Assistance Act to reduce the costs of disaster relief and \nemergency assistance, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n       THE DISASTER STREAMLINING AND COSTS REDUCTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr President, in my capacity as chairman of the Committee \non Environment and Public Works, I introduce today the Disaster \nStreamlining and Costs Reduction Act of 1997, on behalf of the \nadministration. This bill amends the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief \nand Emergency Assistance Act with the goal of reducing the costs of \ndisaster relief and emergency assistance provided by the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency [FEMA].\n  This legislation was submitted to the Senate on June 30, 1997, by \nFEMA Director James L. Witt. Submission of the bill fulfills, albeit \nlate, a directive included in the FY 1997 VA, HUD and Independent \nAgencies Appropriations Act.\n  In that act, the distinguished Appropriations subcommittee chairman, \nSenator Bond, and his ranking member, Senator Mikulski, directed FEMA \nto propose methods of reducing the skyrocketing costs of Federal \ndisaster relief aid. I commend Senators Bond, Mikulski and other \nAppropriations Committee members for their initiative.\n  As my colleagues are well aware, the Stafford Act is designed to \nprovide an orderly and continuing means of assistance by the Federal \nGovernment to State and local governments in carrying out their \nresponsibilities to alleviate the suffering and damage which result \nfrom disasters. In recent years, this assistance has grown increasingly \nexpensive and has resulted in the reduction of annual funding levels \nfor other Government programs which must compete directly with it.\n  I believe that the cause for the dramatic increase in disaster \nspending is at least two-fold. First, we are witnessing a period when \nmore and more of our population is being affected by natural and man-\nmade disasters. This might be due to what some say is an increase in \nthe frequency of violent storms--coupled with the fact that a growing \nproportion of our citizens reside in coastal and riverine regions, \ncausing them to be more vulnerable to floods.\n  Second, it is apparent that implementation of the Stafford Act could \nbe conducted in a more fiscally sound manner. Are too many facilities \nor entities eligible for Federal disaster assistance? Is there \nmismanagement of grant moneys? Is there too much red tape at FEMA? \nThese are the questions that have been asked.\n  This legislation purports to address both of these broad items \nbelieved by many to have contributed to increased disaster spending. To \nlessen risk to populations and structures, the administration's bill \nestablishes new hazard mitigation authorities. The bill also reduces \nthe number of public and private nonprofit facilities eligible for aid. \nFinally, the bill includes various management reforms to streamline the \ndelivery of emergency assistance.\n  I have given this legislation a preliminary review and find that much \nin it makes a great deal of sense. Other elements may be problematic. \nBut this is just the first step. This proposal will receive careful \nscrutiny in the Committee on Environment and Public Works and most \nlikely will be modified several times after we have had a chance to \nreceive input from the States and from disaster relief experts from \nacross the country.\n  This is a serious issue involving the lives and property of millions \nof Americans. It also involves billions of taxpayer dollars. While the \nCongress must address these FEMA cost issues swiftly, we must also \npreserve the central mission of the Stafford Act. Toward that end, I \nlook forward to conducting hearings on this bill in the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  With the help of Senator Bond, who is also a member of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, Senator Inhofe, who chairs the \nrelevant subcommittee, and other members, I am confident that we will \nbe able to produce effective reform legislation in timely fashion. I \nalso look forward to working closely with Director Witt and the \nadministration and commend them for their proposal.\n  With that, Mr. President, I send the bill to the desk and ask that it \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1007\n\n       Be it enacted by the senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The most appropriate \n     forms of housing assistance to be provided to disaster \n     victims shall be determined in the President's discretion \n     based upon considerations of cost effectiveness, convenience \n     to disaster victims, and such other factors as the President \n     may deem appropriate. One or more forms of housing assistance \n     may be made available, based on the suitability and \n     availability of the types of assistance to meet the disaster \n     victims' verified needs in the particular disaster situation.\n       ``(1) Housing assistance may be provided to individuals or \n     households to rent alternate housing accommodations or \n     existing rental units, manufactured housing, recreational \n     vehicles, or other readily fabricated dwellings. The \n     President may also directly provide such housing units, \n     acquired by purchase or lease, to individuals or households \n     who, because of lack of available housing resources, would be \n     unable to make use of the assistance provided under this \n     section. Direct assistance shall continue for no longer than \n     18 months after the President's major disaster declaration, \n     unless the President determines that it would be in the \n     public interest to extend this period due to extraordinary \n     circumstances. After 18 months the President may charge fair \n     market rent for the accommodation being provided. The amount \n     of grant assistance shall be based on the fair market rent \n     for the accommodation being furnished plus the cost of any \n     transportation, utility hook-ups, or unit installation not \n     being directly provided by the President.\n       ``(2) Housing assistance may be provided to repair owner-\n     occupied private residences, utilities, and residential \n     infrastructure (such as private access routes) damaged by a \n     major disaster to habitable condition where such assistance \n     cannot be provided by voluntary agency assistance, insurance \n     proceeds, or through disaster loan benefits from the Small \n     Business Administration.\n       ``(b) Certain permanent housing construction.--The \n     President may provide financial assistance or direct \n     assistance to individuals or households to construct \n     permanent housing in remote locations (primarily insular \n     areas outside the continental United States) in cases where \n     no alternative housing resources are available; where the \n     types of temporary housing assistance enumerated above are \n     unavailable, infeasible, or not cost-effective; and where \n     such needs cannot be met by voluntary agency assistance, \n     insurance proceeds, or disaster loan benefits from the Small \n     Business Administration.\n       ``(c) Sites.--Any readily fabricated dwelling provided \n     under this section shall whenever possible be located on a \n     site complete with utilities, and is provided by the disaster \n     victim, or the State or local government, by the owner of the \n     site, or by the occupant who was displaced by the major \n     disaster. Readily fabricated dwellings may be located on \n     sites provided by the President if the President determines \n     that such sites would be more economical or accessible.\n       ``(d) Disposition of units.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, housing units purchased by the President \n     for the purposes of housing disaster victims may be: ``(1) \n     Sold directly to individuals or households who are occupants \n     of temporary housing units if such individuals and households \n     need permanent housing. Such sales shall be accomplished at \n     prices that are fair and equitable, as determined by the \n     President. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     proceeds of sales shall be deposited into the appropriate \n     Disaster Relief Fund account. The President may use the \n     services of the General Services Administration to accomplish \n     the sale.\n       ``(2) If not disposed of under paragraph (d)(1) of this \n     section temporary housing units may be resold in the private \n     market. Temporary housing units may also be sold, \n     transferred, donated, or otherwise made available directly to \n     States, other governmental entities, and voluntary \n     organizations for the sole purpose of providing temporary \n     housing to disaster victims in major disasters and \n     emergencies, Provided That as a condition of such sale, \n     transfer or donation to States, other governmental agencies, \n     or voluntary organizations a covenant to comply with the \n     nondiscrimination provisions of section 308 is agreed to. The \n     State, other governmental agency, or voluntary organization \n     must also agree to obtain and maintain hazard and flood \n     insurance on the transferred housing unit.\n       ``(e) Other needs.--The President is authorized to provide \n     financial assistance to individuals or households adversely \n     affected by a major disaster to meet disaster-related \n     medical, dental, and funeral expenses, where such individuals \n     or households are unable to meet such needs through insurance \n     proceeds or voluntary agency assistance. Financial assistance \n     may also be authorized to address personal property needs, \n     transportation expenses, and other necessary expenses or \n     serious needs resulting from the major disaster where such \n     expenses and needs cannot be met through insurance proceeds, \n     voluntary agency assistance, or through loan assistance from \n     the Small Business Administration.''\n       (c) Section 502(a)(6) of the Robert T.

THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF \n                                 CHINA\n\n  Mr. ROTH submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 38\n\n       Whereas, China resumed sovereignty over Hong Kong on July \n     1, 1997;\n       Whereas, in the Joint Declaration of the United Kingdom and \n     the People's Republic of China, a legally binding document in \n     all its parts and the highest form of commitment between \n     sovereign states, the People's Republic of China pledged that \n     after its resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong, ``The \n     current social and economic systems in Hong Kong will remain \n     unchanged, and so will the life-style. Rights and freedoms, \n     including those of the person, of speech, of the press, of \n     association, of travel, of movement, of correspondence, of \n     strike, of choice of occupation, of academic research and \n     religious belief will be ensured by law in the Hong Kong \n     Special Administrative Region'';\n       Whereas, the People's Republic of China further pledged in \n     the Joint Declaration that the policies of the ``* * * Joint \n     Declaration will be stipulated in a Basic Law of the Hong \n     Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic \n     of China, by the National People's Congress of the People's \n     Republic of China, and they will remain unchanged for 50 \n     years'';\n       Whereas, the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special \n     Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, as \n     adopted on April 4, 1990 by the Seventh National People's \n     Congress of the People's Republic of China, prescribes the \n     systems to be practiced in the Hong Kong Special \n     Administrative Region after China's resumption of \n     sovereignty;\n       Whereas, according to Article 2 of the Basic Law, ``The \n     National People's Congress authorizes the Hong Kong Special \n     Administrative Region to exercise a high degree of autonomy \n     and enjoy executive, legislative and independent judicial \n     power, including that of final adjudication'';\n       Whereas, according to Article 5 of the Basic Law, ``The \n     socialist system and policies [of the People's Republic of \n     China] shall not be practiced in the Hong Kong Special \n     Administrative Region, and the previous capitalist system and \n     way of life shall remain unchanged for 50 years'';\n       Whereas, according to Article 27 of the Basic Law, ``Hong \n     Kong residents shall have freedom of speech, of the press and \n     publication; freedom of association, of assembly, of \n     procession and of demonstration; and the right and freedom to \n     form and join trade unions, and to strike'';\n       Whereas, according to Article 32 of the Basic Law, ``Hong \n     Kong residents shall have freedom of religious belief and \n     freedom to preach and to conduct and participate in religious \n     activities in public'';\n       Whereas, according to Article 34 of the Basic Law, ``Hong \n     Kong residents shall have freedom to engage in academic \n     research, literary and artistic creation, and other cultural \n     activities'';\n       Whereas, according to Article 39 of the Basic Law, ``The \n     provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and \n     Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, \n     Social and Cultural Rights, and international labour \n     conventions as applied to Hong Kong shall remain in force and \n     shall be implemented through the laws of the Hong Kong \n     Special Administrative Region'';\n       Whereas, President Jiang Zemin of China, in his statement \n     of July 1, 1997, at the ceremony in Hong Kong marking the \n     establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region \n     said, ``* * * Hong Kong will enjoy a high degree of autonomy \n     as provided for by the Basic Law, which includes the \n     executive, legislative and independent judicial power, \n     including that of final adjudication'';\n       Whereas, President Jiang further said that the Hong Kong \n     Special Administrative Region has the ``ultimate aim of \n     electing the Chief Executive and the Legislative Council by \n     universal suffrage'';\n       Whereas, President Jiang further said that ``No central \n     department or locality [of the People's Republic of China] \n     may or will be allowed to interfere in the affairs which, \n     under the Basic Law, should be administered by the Hong Kong \n     Special Administrative Region on its own'';\n       Whereas, President Jiang further said that ``the provisions \n     of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, \n     the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural \n     Rights, and international covenants as applied to Hong Kong \n     shall remain in force to be implemented through the laws of \n     Hong Kong's regional legislation'';\n       Whereas, President Jiang further said that adherence to \n     these principles ``serves Hong Kong, serves the [People's \n     Republic of China] and serves the entire nation as well. \n     Therefore there is no reason whatsoever to change them. Here \n     I want to reaffirm that `one country, two systems, Hong Kong \n     administering Hong Kong' and `a high degree of autonomy' will \n     remain unchanged for 50 years'';\n       Whereas, President Jiang, in another statement of July 1, \n     1997, at a rally in Beijing marking the establishment of the \n     Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, said that the \n     People's Republic of China ``will unswervingly carry out the \n     principles of `one country, two systems', `Hong Kong people \n     administering Hong Kong' and `high degree of autonomy', and \n     make sure that the previous socio-economic system and way of \n     life of Hong Kong remain unchanged and that laws previously \n     in force will remain basically unchanged. We will firmly \n     support the Hong Kong SAR in its exercise of the functions \n     and powers bestowed on it by the basic law and the Hong Kong \n     SAR Government in its administration in accordance with \n     law.'';\n       Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the Senate (the House of \n     Representatives concurring), that\n       (1) President Jiang Zemin's statements constitute a welcome \n     reaffirmation of the obligations of the People's Republic of \n     China under the Joint Declaration and the basic law to ensure \n     that Hong Kong remains autonomous, the human rights of the \n     people of Hong Kong remain protected, and the government of \n     the Hong Kong SAR is elected democratically; and\n       (2) China's fulfillment of these obligations under the \n     terms of the Joint Declaration of the United Kingdom and the \n     People's Republic of China and the Basic Law constitute a \n     crucial test of Beijing's ability to play a responsible \n     global role.\n\n  Mr. ROTH, Mr. President, I rise today to submit a sense of the \nCongress Resolution on the obligations of the People's Republic of \nChina under the Joint Declaration and the basic law to ensure that Hong \nKong remains autonomous, the human rights of the people of Hong Kong \nremain protected, and the government of the Hong Kong Special \nAdministrative Region [SAR] is elected democratically.\n  On July 1, 1997, Hong Kong returned peacefully to Chinese sovereignty \nunder terms of the Joint Declaration of the United Kingdom and the \nPeople's Republic of China and the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR. \nAmong other provisions, those two documents commit the People's \nRepublic of China to maintain the current social and economic systems \nof Hong Kong and the rights, freedoms, and lifestyles of the people of \nHong Kong.\n  China's willingness to abide by the terms of those two documents \nconstitutes a crucial test of Beijing's ability to play a responsible \nglobal role. In\n\n[[Page S7219]]\n\ntwo important and welcome statements on July 1--one in Hong Kong and \none in Beijing--President Jiang Zemin reiterated China's commitment to \nabide by those terms.\n  What this concurrent resolution does is list some key provisions of \nthe Joint Declaration and the Basic Law guaranteeing Hong Kong's \nfreedoms and President Jiang's statements reaffirming Beijing's \ncommitments to respect those provisions, and go on to point out that \nChina's willingness to live up to its commitments will be a crucial \ntest of Beijing's ability to play a responsible global role.\n  Because of the importance of Hong Kong's reversion, I urge all my \ncolleagues to join me in making passage of this concurrent resolution \npossible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/10/senate-section/article/S7218-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7219-S7221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1998\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        COATS AMENDMENT NO. 789\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. COATS submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill, S.  936, to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1998 for \nmilitary activities of the Department of Defense, for military \nconstruction, and for defense activities of the Department of Energy, \nto prescribe personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \nForces, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       Beginning with line 3, strike out all through the end of \n     the amendment and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n       (a) Limitations.--(1) Of the funds authorized to be \n     appropriated under section 201(3) for engineering \n     manufacturing and development under the F-22 aircraft \n     program, not more than $1,651,000,000 may be obligated before \n     the Secretary of Defense submits the two analyses required \n     under subsection (b).\n       (2) So much of the funds referred to in subsection (a) that \n     exceed $1,651,000,000 may be obligated (after compliance with \n     the requirements of subsection (b)) only in accordance with \n     subsection (c).\n       (b) Analyses Required.--The Secretary of Defense shall \n     submit to the congressional defense committees two analyses \n     by the Cost Analysis Improvement Group of the Office of the \n     Secretary, as follows:\n       (1) An analysis of the extent to which joint Air Force and \n     contractor cost reduction initiatives for the F-22 aircraft \n     program alter the analysis of costs of the program that has \n     been previously prepared by that group.\n       (2) An analysis of the likelihood that the joint \n     initiatives referred to in paragraph (1) will result in \n     production improvements sufficient to produce the F-22 \n     aircraft at a unit flyaway price of not more than \n     $72,000,000.\n       (c) Incremental Release of Funds Upon Completion of \n     Phases.--(1) When a phase described in paragraph (2) has been \n     successfully completed, the Under Secretary of Defense for \n     Acquisition and Technology shall submit a certification of \n     the successful completion of the phase to the congressional \n     defense committees.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING A FOLLOW-ON FORCE FOR \n                   BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) United States ground combat forces should not \n     participate in a follow-on force in Bosnia and Herzegovina \n     after June 1998;\n       (2) the European Security and Defense Identity, which, as \n     facilitated by the Combined Joint Task Forces concept, \n     enables the Western European Union, with the consent of the \n     North Atlantic Alliance, to assume political control and \n     strategic direction of NATO assets made available by the \n     Alliance, is an ideal instrument for a follow-on force for \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n       (3) if the European Security and Defense Identity is not \n     sufficiently developed or is otherwise deemed inappropriate \n     for such a mission, a NATO-led force without the \n     participation of United States ground combat forces in \n     Bosnia, may be suitable for a follow-on force for Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina;\n       (4) the United States may decide to appropriately provide \n     support to a Western European Union-led or NATO-led follow-on \n     force, including command and control, intelligence, \n     logistics, and, if necessary, a ready reserve force in a \n     neighboring country; and\n       (5) the President should inform our European NATO allies of \n     this expression of the sense of Congress and should strongly \n     urge them to undertake preparations for a Western European \n     Union-led or NATO-led force as a follow-on force to the NATO-\n     led Stabilization Force if needed to maintain peace and \n     stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/10/senate-section/article/S7219-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7221-S7222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARINGS\n\n\n           committee on agriculture, nutrition, and forestry\n\n  Mr. LUGAR.

Mr. President, the headline on the front page of \nthe Business Section in today's Washington Post reads ``Government Said \nTo Move Too Slowly on Year 2000 Computer Problem.'' Mr. President, \nslowly at best.\n  The Federal Government has been outright dilatory in addressing this \nproblem. There are three stages in the process: assessment, renovation, \nand implementation--the third stage takes the longest. According to the \nOMB report released today, of the 4,500 mission critical computer \nsystems in the\n\n[[Page S7223]]\n\nFederal Government, 6 percent have been implemented, 17 percent have \nbeen renovated, and only 65 percent of the systems have even been \nassessed. A spokesman for the GIGA firm of Cambridge MA, that \nspecializes in this issue, said: ``They're not on a time schedule that \nlooks like it's going to be doable.'' I need not remind my colleagues \nthat the clock is ticking.\n  Be assured that in the year 2000, we will be blamed if we have not \naddressed the problem. And rightly so. Cosponsored by six other \nSenators, my bill, S. 22, will create a commission to see that the \nproblem is fixed and increase the lagging private sector awareness of \nthis crisis.\n  I ask that the text of the Washington Post article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The article follows:\n\n    Government Said To Move Too Slowly on Year 2000 Computer Problem\n\n                       (By Rajiv Chandrasekaran)\n\n       The federal government could face a partial computer crash \n     in the year 2000 because it is moving too slowly to fix its \n     machines so they will understand dates that don't begin with \n     ``19,'' according to a growing number of technology \n     specialists.\n       Of the nearly 4,500 ``mission-critical'' computer systems \n     the government needs to repair--which include those that \n     handle defense, air traffic control and income tax \n     functions--only 6 percent have been fixed, according to an \n     Office of Management and Budget report that will be released \n     at a House subcommittee hearing today.\n       About 35 percent of those computers needing repairs have \n     not even undergone a systems analysis, the first and simplest \n     step in the renovation process, the report said.\n       ``They're not on a time schedule that looks like it's going \n     to be doable,'' said Ann K. Coffou, a research director at \n     Giga Information Group, a Cambridge, Mass., industry research \n     firm that specializes in so-called year 2000 issues. \n     ``They're suffering from `analysis paralysis.' There's too \n     much work to be done . . . and at this point in the game, \n     it's very, very distressing.''\n       Most large computer systems use a two-digit dating system \n     that assumes 1 and 9 are the first two digits of the year. \n     Without specialized reprogramming, the systems will think the \n     year 2000--or 00--is 1900, a glitch that is expected to make \n     most of them go haywire unless the problem is fixed.\n       For the government, the year 2000 problem could result in \n     computers that come to a sudden halt and others that generate \n     erroneous data, such as wrong Medicare checks or tax bills, \n     computer experts say. In a worst-case scenario, computers \n     that control military defense systems or sensitive \n     communications between federal agencies could be rendered \n     inoperable, some specialists warn.\n       Thomas D. Oleson, a year 2000 computer analyst at \n     International Data Corp., a consulting firm in Framingham, \n     Mass., characterized the government's situation as ``way \n     behind the eight ball.'' Fixing the government's computers on \n     time, he said, ``is nearing the point of impossibility.''\n       Oleson and other industry analysts expect the federal \n     computer systems that handle the government's most critical \n     functions to be fixed before the Dec. 31, 1999, deadline. \n     But many other systems, including some that perform \n     significant tasks for federal employees and ordinary \n     people, could still be in the electronic repair shop in \n     2000, they warn.\n       ``It's become increasingly clear that agencies are not \n     going to be able to correct everything before the year \n     2000,'' said Joel C. Willemssen, the director of information \n     resources management at the General Accounting Office, the \n     watchdog arm of Congress. ``We're going to have to start \n     making priorities among all the systems we view as \n     critical.''\n       The specialists said it is too early to identify specific \n     systems that might not be reprogrammed in time, but they said \n     those would become clearer later this year as agencies begin \n     focusing their efforts.\n       In its report, which was produced at the behest of a \n     congressional committee, the OMB maintains that the progress \n     of federal agencies is generally on schedule and that the \n     agencies ``have made a good start in addressing the year 2000 \n     problem.''\n       Of the 7,649 computer systems in the executive branch other \n     than the Social Security Administration, 21 percent--or \n     1,598--already comply with year 2000 requirements. An \n     additional 9 percent will be fully replaced and 8 percent \n     will be scrapped, the report said.\n       At Social Security, long hailed as the federal agency that \n     has been most attentive to year 2000 problems, 71 percent of \n     its systems don't need to be fixed. Of those that do need \n     repairing, half have been fixed, the report said.\n       The report estimates the cost of renovating computers \n     throughout the government at $2.8 billion, a $500 million \n     increase from an estimate released by the OMB in February. \n     OMB officials said yesterday that figure is expected to cross \n     the $3 billion mark and could eventually grow to as much as \n     $5 billion.\n       ``There's still a lot of work to be done, but I think we're \n     on track,'' said Sally Katzen, OMB's director of information \n     and regulatory affairs, who has been spearheading the \n     government's year 2000 efforts.\n       The report identifies the Agriculture, Education, Justice \n     and Transportation departments as those that have about half \n     their systems or more left to analyze. No department, \n     except for Interior and Veterans Affairs, has more than 25 \n     percent of its systems renovated.\n       At the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which \n     has 206 computer systems, 115 need to be repaired. Although \n     the department is halfway through analyzing those 115 \n     systems, it has only renovated 2 percent of them, the report \n     said.\n       At the Defense Department, which has almost 4,000 systems, \n     by far the most of any government agency, more than 2,700 of \n     them need to be fixed. The agency is only 23 percent done \n     with renovating the systems, and only 8 percent of them \n     actually have been tested and are considered fully fixed, \n     according to the document.\n       The government's progress is expected to come under fire \n     from members of the House Science Committee and the \n     Government Reform and Oversight Committee, which are holding \n     a joint hearing into the matter today, congressional aides \n     said. In addition to questioning the pace of repair work, \n     committee leaders will criticize several agencies' schedules \n     for repairs, which call for finishing work in November and \n     December 1999.\n       ``They haven't left themselves with a margin for error in \n     case something goes wrong,'' said Rep. Constance A. Morella \n     (R-Md.), chairwoman of the Science Committee's technology \n     subcommittee.\n       Committee members also will probe whether any government \n     agencies are now buying software that is not year 2000 \n     compliant, aides said.\n\n             STATE OF REPAIR--STATUS OF MISSION-CRITICAL SYSTEMS BEING REPAIRED AT SELECTED AGENCIES            \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                  Number  Assessment  Renovation  Implementation\n                             Agency                                 of      percent     percent       percent   \n                                                                 systems   complete    complete      complete   \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAgriculture....................................................      469         41           0              0  \nCommerce.......................................................      162         75           7              5  \nDefense........................................................    2,752         64          23              8  \nEducation......................................................        7         30           0              0  \nHUD............................................................      115         50           2              2  \nJustice........................................................      118         52           2              0  \nDOT............................................................      132         50          10              0  \nNASA...........................................................      211         75           2              1  \n    All federal agencies.......................................    4,493         65          17              6  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Office of Management and Budget.                                                                \n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/10/senate-section/article/S7222-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO THE STUDENTS OF HEMPFIELD HIGH SCHOOL\n\n Mr. SANTORUM.

Mr. President, Disraeli once described the youth \nof a nation as, the trustees of posterity. I interpret that to mean \nthat the future promise of any country can be directly measured by the \npresent prospects of its young people. Whatever we invest today in \npromoting and protecting our youth will bring a high return in the \nfuture.\n  For that reason, I am pleased that the Senate has taken some first \nsteps to address the growing problem of uninsured children.\n  I have to say I am still astounded by the fact that this great Nation \ncould allow 10 million children to go without health insurance. Just \nthink about it. At a time when the economy is sound and unemployment is \nat a 23-year low, one in seven of America's children lack a basic \nprotection that every one of us enjoys.\n  Uninsured children are less likely to be fully immunized against \npreventable\n\n[[Page S7224]]\n\nillnesses, or to receive care for chronic conditions and injuries. And \nusually whatever care they receive takes place in a hospital emergency \nroom--one of the most expensive settings possible.\n  As we consider how best to extend health insurance coverage to this \nimportant segment of the population, I want to call my colleagues' \nattention to one aspect of this problem that is often overlooked. I am \nspeaking about the oral health of children.\n  For some reason, many of us often fail to realize that oral health is \nan integral part of a person's overall health. Tooth decay and serious \ninfections are just some of the chronic health problems that can result \nwhen oral health is ignored. At the same time, there is a strong \nrelationship between oral health and other medical conditions that \nmanifest symptoms in the mouth. Regular dental check-ups, or example, \nprovide an early warning system for diabetes, certain forms of cancer, \nand immune disorders like AIDS.\n  According to the U.S. Public Health Service, dental and oral diseases \nmay well be the most prevalent--and preventable--conditions affecting \nchildren. And while we have seen improvement overall, certain groups of \nchildren continue to suffer more than their share of oral health \nproblems, primarily because of their limited access to oral health \nservices. Poor children--usually minority, migrant, and many in rural \ncommunities--are the ones most seriously affected.\n  You might ask ``doesn't Medicaid help these children?'' It should, if \nthey happen to be eligible. But while Medicaid accounts for about 80 \npercent of public funds spent for oral health, only about 1 percent of \nMedicaid funds are spent on dental care. And as we have heard, many of \nthe uninsured children are in working poor families that are just above \nthe Medicaid cut-off for eligibility. These children have no protection \nwhatsoever.\n  The sad irony is that dental care embodies the very qualities that \nmake for a good health care system. Unlike medical coverage, which is \ntriggered by illness, dental coverage emphasizes prevention. How \nimportant is that? According to the National Institute of Dental \nResearch, every dollar spent on preventive dental care saves $4 in \ntreatment costs.\n  And dental coverage favors primary care over more expensive \nspecialized treatment. Regular checkups mean your local dentist can \ncatch and treat problems before they require a specialist.\n  One recent study found that persons with dental coverage are almost \ntwice as likely to visit a dentist, and more than 70 percent of those \ncovered by insurance have annual checkups and receive preventive care.\n  All of which is to say, dental coverage for children is not only good \nsocial policy; it is good economic policy as well.\n  If we truly want to extend basic health protection to our children, I \nurge my colleagues to include dental health coverage in any final \nlegislation we send to the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/10/senate-section/article/S7223-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7224]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO PAUL STAUDENMAIER\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Paul D. \nStaudenmaier, executive director of the Boys and Girls Club of Duluth, \nMN. On September 13, 1997, he will retire with over 21 years of \ndedicated service.\n  Paul's career with the Boys Clubs began in Chicago over 46 years ago. \nIn his teens, he was headed for a gang fight, when a member of the \nChicago Boys Club urged him to come to the area club. He started as a \ngames room worker at the former Harper Chicago Boys Club on the south \nside of Chicago and progressed through many different positions in the \nChicago area clubs. He was program director at the Woodlawn Boys Club, \nunit director at the Lathrop Boys Club on the north side, and unit \ndirector at the Valentine Boys Club in the old neighborhood of the late \nMayor Richard J. Daley.\n  Paul received his masters degree in education administration with the \nhelp of a Boys Club Scholarship from New York University. He also \nserved in the army in the Korean conflict, married Fran, his wife, and \nhad four sons.\n  In 1977, when Paul became executive director of the Boys Club of \nDuluth, the club was floundering and needed strong leadership. The club \nhad less than $500 in the bank, and over $4,000 in unpaid bills. Housed \nin an old church building, it also needed a new boiler. Through the \ngenerous efforts of the United Way of Duluth, Paul secured a new boiler \nand from then on, changes occurred for the better.\n  By 1980 the club was changing to have memberships for boys and girls. \nIt took 10 years before the national organization gave the recognition \nto become the Boys and Girls Clubs of America. Paul's many \ncontributions have included helping to form the Help a Boy and Help A \nGirl scholarship which has been a very successful program. In 1982, he \nformed the Mighty-Mites for 4- to 5-year old children, a summer program \nfor working mothers and in 1984, the Summer Fun Bunch for children, \nages 6 to 12 years old. In 1985, he started the Operating Endowment \nFund which is now the Boys and Girls Club of Duluth Foundation with \nassets of over $400,000.\n  One of the highlights of Paul's career came in 1992 when a joint \npartnership was formed with the Duluth school district at the Lincoln \nPark School, located just a few blocks from the club. The Lincoln Park \nneighborhood has a ratio of 70 to 80 percent of single parent families \nand now has become a youth and family center that serves approximately \n800 youth.\n  It offers community swimming and gym classes for parents and \nchildren, and has a computer center for use after school hours for \nyouth and parents, and offers many other youth and family programs. The \nprogram at the Lincoln School has been so successful that the existing \nclub will be converted into a full service teen center. Paul's ability \nto look ahead has helped the club to form a strategic planning \ncommittee. One of its goals is to work with the local school district \nto form more joint ventures at other schools in other areas of the \ncity.\n  Paul Staudenmaier's contributions over the years are impressive and \nnoteworthy, and it is an honor for me to pay tribute to this remarkable \nand dedicated man. As family, friends, and colleagues gather to honor \nPaul on September 13, 1997, I join them in conveying my heartiest \ncongratulations.\n  It is a privilege for me to join in honoring his distinguished career \nof service to others. As you celebrate this milestone, all the best on \nthis occasion and I extend my warmest wishes to Paul for a well-\ndeserved retirement, filled with continued good health and \nhappiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/10/senate-section/article/S7224-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7224-S7225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IN MEMORY OF COACH JAMES G. LILLY\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise to take a moment to pay \ntribute to a very special West Virginian, Coach James G. Lilly of Oak \nHill, who recently passed away after coaching the Oak Hill Red Devils \nfor 27 years.\n  Coach Lilly was a dedicated high school basketball coach and a true \nhumanitarian. He retired in 1989 ranking third on the State's all-time \nhigh school winning list, with a career record of 591-291. Coach Lilly \nled the Oak Hill Red Devils to two class AAA State championships in \n1984 and 1989, and his Red Devils were runners-up in the 1969 and 1986 \ntournaments.\n  However, there was much more to this three-time coach of the year \nthan just winning basketball games. Jim Lilly tirelessly worked to \nfulfill many of his players' human needs. He gave generously of \nhimself, looking out for his players in the southern coalfields of West \nVirginia.\n  Coach Lilly became a father figure to hundreds of young teens \nthroughout his 38-year career. ``He knew that certain kids needed \ncertain things, a little extra food or maybe an extra dollar . . . he \nlooked out for you and he was very giving . . . my dad died when I was \n9 and he was the most pivotal older male in my life,'' said Sam \nCalloway, a former player and now coach.\n  He was a man of dignity, a man of class, a man of compassion, and he \nwill be deeply missed by the community and coaching profession. Lilly's \ndignity was not only displayed through his life, but through his \nplayers' lives. In six State tournament appearances, the Oak Hill Red \nDevils won five sportsmanship trophies in the eighties. ``Sportsmanship \nwas a direct reflection of the coach,'' said Calloway, ``and when we \nwere on the floor, we represented him.''\n\n[[Page S7225]]\n\n  His contemporaries had an even greater respect for his coaching \ngenius. He was devoted to the game and devoted to the kids he worked \nwith. Coach Lilly demanded a standard of excellence that is unsurpassed \nin West Virginia's coaching ranks.\n  Coach James G. Lilly reminded all of us about the importance of \nsportsmanship. He was dedicated to the game, but more importantly, he \nwas dedicated to the young athletes. His death is certainly a loss to \nWest Virginia. He will long be remembered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/10/senate-section/article/S7224-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      REMOVAL OF INJUNCTION OF SECRECY--TREATY DOCUMENT NO. 105-15\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination \nreported from the Intelligence Committee: George Tenet, to be Director \nof Central Intelligence.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the nomination be confirmed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, any statements relating to \nthe nomination appear at the appropriate place in the Record, the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the \nSenate then return to legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The nomination was considered and confirmed as follows:\n\n       George John Tenet, of Maryland, to be Director of Central \n     Intelligence.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I am pleased to inform my colleagues that \ntoday the Select Committee on Intelligence unanimously voted to \nfavorably report the nomination of Mr. George J. Tenet to be the next \nDirector of Central Intelligence.\n  Although the committee held hearings in May, shortly after receiving \nthe nomination from the President, the committee postponed final action \npending the conclusion of a preliminary investigation by the Department \nof Justice.\n  The Attorney General was required to make a determination of whether \nto recommend the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate \nallegations involving Mr. Tenet's financial holdings and disclosure.\n  Today, the committee was officially notified that the Attorney \nGeneral had concluded that no further investigation was warranted and \nthat she would not seek appointment of an independent counsel.\n  The Vice Chairman, Senator Kerrey, and I promptly convened a meeting \nof the committee and voted to favorably report the nomination to the \nfull Senate. This prompt action by the committee, once the Justice \nDepartment investigation was completed, reflects the strong support Mr. \nTenet has among the members of the committee.\n  Mr. Tenet faces some daunting challenges as he prepares to officially \nassume the responsibilities of the Director of Central Intelligence.\n  He must successfully guide the intelligence community toward new and \nfar more difficult missions. He must ensure that the quality and \nintegrity of his people remains high.\n  He must provide thorough and unbiased analysis to this Nation's \npolicy-makers and he must keep, as he has pledged, the Congress fully \nand currently informed of all intelligence activities.\n  The latter point is very important, Mr. President, because the \nintelligence community, and specifically the Central Intelligence \nAgency, has not enjoyed a great deal of public support in recent years.\n  It will be Mr. Tenet's responsibility to restore the public \nconfidence in his organization, and he can do that by remaining \nfaithful to the values of this Nation and by ensuring that the people's \nrepresentatives are kept fully appraised of all the community's \nactivities.\n  The intelligence community is rich with outstanding Americans, many \nof whom risk their lives to protect the security of this Nation. These \npeople place a great deal of trust in their leadership and it is up to \nMr. Tenet to honor that trust. The committee believes that he will.\n  Mr. President, it is with pleasure that I recommend, as chairman of \nthe Select Committee on Intelligence, that the Senate unanimously \napprove the nomination of George John Tenet to the next Director of \nCentral Intelligence.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to confirm \nthe President's nominee, George J. Tenet, to be Director of Central \nIntelligence. He served as Deputy Director from May 1995 until January \nof this year, he has served as acting Director since that time, and he \nhas already proven to be a highly competent, knowledgeable, capable \nleader of our Intelligence Community.\n  As many of my colleagues know, Mr. Tenet's nomination has been before \nthe Intelligence Committee since April. In hearings and in written \nresponses for the record, Mr. Tenet answered all the committee's \nquestions to the Committee's satisfaction. My sense is Mr. Tenet has \nenjoyed the unanimous support of the Committee since April. However, \nthe Committee chose not to report this nomination to the Senate until \ncompletion of an investigation of Mr. Tenet by the Attorney General \nunder the Independent Counsel Reauthorization Act of 1994. The \ninvestigation was initiated April 23, 1997, and the completed report of \ninvestigation was filed with the United States Court of Appeals for the \nDistrict of Columbia on July 7, 1997. The Committee has been informed \nthat the Attorney General ``determined that there are no reasonable \ngrounds to believe that further investigation is warranted. She is not \nseeking the appointment of an independent counsel.'' Having received \nthis report, the Committee voted today to favorably report the \nnomination. The vote was unanimous.\n  The Attorney General's investigation was triggered by anomalies in \nMr. Tenet's financial reporting statement and biographical \nquestionnaire. In my view these were minor and fully explicable \nanomalies. Given the high standards set in the Independent Counsel Act, \nthe fact that the investigation has been closed without the appointment \nof an\n\n[[Page S7226]]\n\nindependent counsel suggests to me that the Attorney General shares my \nassessment did nothing wrong.\n  The necessity for the investigation created an unfortunate delay, as \nwell as a burden for Mr. Tenet and members of his family. The delay \ncaused by the investigation did not, from what I have seen, create a \nvacuum in leadership at the CIA. Even as the Acting Director, Mr. Tenet \nhas provided steady direction to the Intelligence Community. \nNonetheless, there is no substitute in government for the authority \nthat comes with Senate confirmation, so I am most pleased the \nnomination can move forward and Mr. Tenet can be fully empowered.\n  As Chairman Shelby and I told our colleagues during the recent debate \non the Intelligence Authorization bill, the end of the Cold War did by \nno means mark a diminution in the importance of intelligence to our \nnational security. Sound policy and sound strategy are illuminated by \nsound intelligence, by the sometimes small amount of secret information \nthat gives full meaning to the masses of freely available information. \nAs technology continues in its revolutionary cycles, victory in war is \nmore than ever the result of the linkage of American valor with \nAmerican intelligence and American precision weapons. So intelligence \ncontinues to be essential to our survival and our ability to lead in \nthe world. One of Mr. Tenet's many tasks will be to convince the public \nthat intelligence still matters, and that the public can count on the \nintegrity, patriotism, and morality of those who serve the nation in \nthe Intelligence Community. Mr. Tenet is well suited for this task--he \nis a highly effective communicator.\n  Another task for Mr. Tenet will be to lead those who are serving. The \nCIA and the other intelligence agencies include people who take risks \nfor our country, as well as some of the smartest and most skilled \nanalysts, scientists, and technicians in the country. They deserve \nleadership that fully challenges their talents, rewards their \nsuccesses, maintains an environment of high integrity, enforces \naccountability, and adds to their pride in their profession. They also \ndeserve leadership that will remain with them long enough to really \nmake a difference. I believe George Tenet will provide that leadership, \nand I urge his confirmation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am going to pause a minute to speak \nabout this nomination. I was privileged to serve for 8 years on the \nIntelligence Committee, the last 2 years being the vice chairman. \nDuring that period of time, Mr. Tenet was one of the senior staff \nmembers on the committee. I gained a firsthand knowledge of this \nindividual, not only of his professional capabilities, which are \nsuperb, but his character and his judgment.\n  I commend the President and all those who have worked to see that \nthis fine American takes on this very, very important responsibility. I \nhave confidence in him, and I am confident that he will represent our \ncountry very ably in this important post. I wish him, his lovely wife \nand his family well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/10/senate-section/article/S7225-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until the \nhour of 9 a.m. on Friday, July 11. I further ask unanimous consent that \non Friday, immediately following the prayer, the routine requests \nthrough the morning hour be granted, and the Senate immediately resume \nconsideration of S. 936, the defense authorization bill, and the Senate \nimmediately proceed to a Feingold amendment under a previous order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/10/senate-section/article/S7226-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, tomorrow morning the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the defense authorization bill and, at 9:45 a.m., \nproceed to a vote regarding the Bingaman amendment, re: space-based \nlasers. Following that vote, the Senate will resume consideration of \nthe remaining amendments. Therefore, votes can be expected to occur \nthroughout the day, up to and including final passage of the defense \nauthorization bill.\n  I know the leader and, indeed, I am sure my distinguished ranking \nmember, Senator Levin, and Senator Daschle, both leaders, are anxious \nto finish this bill by noon tomorrow. I am confident that Senator \nThurmond will be here--he usually is--bright and early to start the day \nat 9 o'clock.\n  There is not a recitation of what is to happen between 9 and 9:30. Do \nyou recall specifically? I think it would be helpful.\n  Mr. LEVIN. My understanding, from Senator Feingold who has firsthand \nknowledge, is that from 9 to 9:30, the time is divided on the Feingold \namendment: 20 minutes to Senator Feingold; 10 minutes to Senator \nThurmond.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, that is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. Mr. President, is that the amendment that has been \nthe subject of discussion this evening?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. No, that is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment concerning \nthe Department of Defense jet fighters, a different matter.\n  Mr. WARNER. So that would be between the hours of 9 and 9:30, and \nthen we will proceed as the order has been recited.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for his \ncooperation tonight and for his very strong debate. I regret I can't \njoin him on this.\n  I thank my good friend and colleague, as always. We have been \ntogether on many missions. I thank staff, the Senate and the Presiding \nOfficer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/10/senate-section/article/S7226-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL TOMORROW AT 9 A.M.\n\n  Mr. WARNER.
