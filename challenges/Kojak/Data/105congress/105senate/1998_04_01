Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Coverdell], for himself, Mr. \n     McCain, Mr. Craig, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Helms, Mr. Kempthorne, \n     Mr. Gramm, and Mr. Kyl, proposes an amendment numbered 2199.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, at another time, I had the distinct \nhonor to serve a former President as Director of the U.S. Peace Corps. \nIn that capacity, and due to the time of the watch, I had the \nopportunity to see the faces of people who had never been free or who \nhad not been free for so long they could not remember it. It was the \ntime when the wall was coming down and barbed wire was being clipped, \nand we were among the first Americans over the wall and under the wire.\n  The faces of those people are forever riveted in my mind. The \nconsciousness of what the lack of freedom does to people has become a \nstudy of mine ever since. People's behavior is greatly affected by the \ncondition of their freedom.\n  Then, after the Peace Corps, I had the opportunity to come to the \nU.S. Senate and look at America through the unique window this \ninstitution provides. In comparing the two experiences, I came to \nbelieve that the genesis of all American glory is that we have been a \nfree people, that everything we are to ourselves and to the world is \nrooted in the fact that we have been free.\n  Mr. President, we hear the words freedom and liberty evoked over and \nover. I doubt if there is an American alive who doesn't hear it at \nleast four times a day--that we are free people, that we enjoy freedom, \nthat we experience liberty. But I don't think we reflect very much on \nwhat that means, what are the dynamics of American liberty. My \nsuspicion is that if you were to ask a student what it constituted, \nthey might likely point to the fact that we have been able to protect \nourselves from evil forces throughout our history and keep ourselves \nfree. They would point to Nazi Germany or Saddam Hussein. Or they might \nsay our freedom is constituted in the fact that we are a republic and \nwe are free because we have the right to choose who will represent us \nin our Government. But that is just a process; that is a means to an \nend.\n  Mr. President, for me, there are at least three core components to \nAmerican freedom without which we would not be free. I have to say that \nthere has been serious erosion in the last several years--in the last \n30 years or so--with regard to each of the three components I choose to \nbelieve are core to American liberty. I am asserting that we are not \nwho we are because of our genes; we are who we are because we have been \nuniquely free, and that freedom has produced the grandest experiment in \nhuman behavior in the history of the world.\n  What are the three components? Well, first is economic liberty. We \nfought the War for Independence over the issue of economic liberty. I \nlike to use my family as a case in point. My father was of the \ngeneration--a grand generation--that did their part in building America \nand defended it through two world wars. I don't think anything has ever \nbeen asked of a generation more than theirs. But he was born in 1912 \nand he kept, generationally, 80 percent of all his paychecks. So what \nhappened? Well, the American dream, as we have heard a million times. \nHe began his career as a coal truck driver. Then he sold shoes in a \ndepartment store. Then he sold Hoover vacuum cleaners and became the \nyoungest city manager for that company in Kansas City. And then with \nthose resources he was saving, he opened his own business, and he began \nto build products and dreams. We have heard it a million times. His \ngranddaughter, my niece, has just begun her business career. Under the \ncurrent scheme of events, unchanged in her generation, she will keep 40 \npercent of her paycheck over her lifetime. You don't have to be a \nrocket scientist here. If her granddad kept 80 percent of his paycheck \nand she keeps 40 percent, she has exactly half the options and half the \ncapacity to pursue her dreams and to build her career. And I can tell \nyou.\n\n  Mr. President, that will make her think and function differently than \nher granddad in terms of decisions she makes about her housing, her \nfamily, their education, and whom to count on, and whom not to count \non, and where to turn for resources. No; it is not in our genes; it is \nthat we have been free. We have over the last several generations been \nconsuming everything we had, and the resources of those yet to come--my \nniece--so they won't have as much to work with. Any time a contemporary \ngeneration is in the business of consuming the resources of generations \nyet to come, they are in the business of abrogating the freedom of the \ngenerations yet to come.\n  The second principle of American liberty is safety. Mr. President, \nthat is a little harder to describe. But it is the safety of persons \nand property. I typically ask people, in their mind, to go someplace \nthat they know is not safe. And what will you see? You will see boarded \nup buildings, broken windows, decay, and not very many people. \nConversely, travel in your mind to a place perceived to be safe, and \nwhat will you see? You will see new buildings, you will see new ideas, \nyou will see entrepreneurship, and you will see lots of people, and \nthey will be engaging in commerce and social activities. A free society \nmust be safe--both persons and property.\n  Not long ago, I was in Nicaragua at the time of the inauguration of \nMadam Chamorro, who, in a surprise upset election, threw out the \nSandinistas. It was like looking at a still shot. Nothing had moved \nwhen that society lost its freedom. When a car ran out of gas, it sat \nright there. When an axle broke, it sat there. When a building cracked, \nit broke.\n  She and her Government were saying, ``Invest in this new free society \nto help us rebuild.'' And everybody's response was virtually the same. \nWhen people perceive this to be safe for their investments, safe for \ntheir employees and persons that build and work, the investments will \ncome. But until the Government can assure that in a reasonable degree, \nthey won't. We see that replicated over the world time and time again.\n  With the Asian crisis, suddenly confidence disappeared and assets \nmoved rapidly away. Why? Not safe. Or any social order that can't \nresolve differences in a civil manner--every constitution of every \nState and our Federal Constitution show that government accepts the \nresponsibility for\n\n[[Page S2881]]\n\nthere being a safe society as a principal responsibility.\n  The third component of American freedom, or freedom, is an educated \nmind. An uneducated mind, Mr. President, will be denied the privileges \nof American citizenship. An uneducated people, Mr. President, will not \nbe free. They cannot be free.\n  We have known through our history that we had to produce an educated \npopulation to keep America free. The first thing that happens is, the \nuneducated mind is pushed away from economic opportunity and the \ninability to provide for oneself. The worst extreme is that they are \npushed to a point of the unsavory components of our social structure. \nThen they threaten the second principle of freedom, which is safety. We \nhave all seen the erosion in each of these components.\n\n  Mr. President, I come here as an optimist. I believe this generation \nof Americans, like those who went before us, will commit themselves to \nmaintaining American liberty and the standards of liberty and to \nrestore those components that have been weakened or crippled. We have \npassed the first balanced budget in 30 years. We are already benefiting \nas a people from financial discipline.\n  When I first came to the Senate, an average worker in the State of \nGeorgia was keeping 45 cents out of every dollar they earned. Think of \nit. If Thomas Jefferson were here, he would faint first, and when he \nawoke, he would scorn us unmercifully that we would have ever allowed \nthis to happen, that an American worker couldn't even keep half of what \nthey produced. At a minimum, they should keep two-thirds of their \npaycheck--at a minimum. We passed the first tax relief in 16 years. It \nwasn't near what it should have been, but it was moving in the right \ndirection. Now that Georgia worker is keeping 48 to 49 cents. It ought \nto be two-thirds.\n  I am going to come back to the point. But let me say that I don't \nbelieve, on the premise of safety and a safe society, that America will \nrecognize the drug war within 24 months. Eight out of ten prisoners--it \ndoesn't matter, the smallest town jail or the largest city--are there \non direct or indirect drug charges. And I don't believe this country \nwill tolerate it. It can't. We cannot accept the fact that 2 million-\nplus new teenagers are using drugs, or that one in nine in junior high \nis a regular drug user. That is once a month; or one out of four in our \nhigh schools. We are not going to accept this. I am convinced it will \nbe turned around. As I said, you will not recognize it in just 24 \nmonths.\n\n  With regard to education, we are going to launch a major debate in \nthe Senate on April 20. It will be but one of massive efforts all over \nthis country to reverse the startling data that we receive every week, \nevery month, where only 4 out of 10 students in inner-city schools can \npass a basic exam. If we put all the schools together, we get it up to \n6 out of 10. That is nothing to brag about. Or one-third of the \nstudents or more coming to our universities and colleges cannot read \nwell.\n  This is how you get ready for the new century? No. You will not \nrecognize education grades K through 12, kindergarten through high \nschool, in the United States within a decade. It is going to change. \nAmerica will not accept the status quo. I do not know how all the \nchanges are going to come about, but they are going to happen.\n  We have demonstrated that we are beginning to take charge of our \nwatch and keeping the financial integrity--economic freedom--intact so \nthat Americans will continue to do what they have done throughout our \nhistory.\n  If all we do is protect the economic liberty, the safety of persons \nand property, and keep our population educated, America will take it \nfrom there. Those three components, if we just get them done on a day-\nto-day basis, we will not have to worry about the next century and \nAmerica's role in it. It is not all that complicated: keep them free \nand flexible economically, keep them safe, and keep them educated.\n  Now I come to this amendment. I have just said that an American \nworker is keeping less than half of their paycheck. So this amendment \nis the middle-class tax relief act. What it does is, it says that over \nthe next 5 years we are going to cut discretionary nondefense spending. \nWe are going to be frugal, and we are going to cut it by 6.9 percent. \nIf we achieve that, what we will have done is we will have said we will \nreturn to spending at about the level of 1996.\n  Not an onerous task. That will produce about $200 billion over this \ntime in tax relief. It is designed specifically to reduce the middle-\nclass tax squeeze. The way this works is we help 10 million American \nfamilies who used to be in the lowest tax bracket--15 percent--but once \nthey made 25,000-some few dollars more, they went over the $25,000 \nincome level, wham, the 28 percent tax bracket. We virtually doubled \ntheir taxes as they moved from $25,000 to $30,000. What an incredulous \npolicy.\n  Again, if you want to know what is culturally affecting America and \nthe American family and the way it functions, it is that. In fact, if \nyou look at the tax burden that those families have borne since 1950 to \n1990 and have watched it just skyrocket from 2 cents to 25 cents on the \ndollar, Federal alone, and then match against it teenage suicide, SAT \nscores, it all fits. Every time we pushed that burden up and gave them \nless resources, they were less able to accomplish what the society \nneeds. A lot of people think Hollywood is what has had a profound \neffect on our culture. Uncle Sam.\n  I look at it this way. If something marches through your checking \naccount and takes more than half of what you put in it, it has more to \ndo with you than you do. So we take 10 million of those families and we \nlift the bar and get them back into the 15 percent tax bracket, which \nmeans for the first time in many years they will be keeping over half \ntheir paycheck. What a marvelous accomplishment. And they will have new \nresources to do the things we are all complaining about are not \nhappening in America.\n\n  Everybody will benefit, but the middle class will be the principal \nbeneficiaries. Everybody is taxed on that first segment of income, so \nall taxpayers benefit, but the principal beneficiaries are the ones who \nwe push down into the 15 percent tax bracket.\n  In so doing, we will be reinforcing one of the core components of \nAmerican liberty--economic. Allow workers to work and save and keep \nresources to do the job that we need to have done in America--take care \nof their families, make decisions about education, dream new ideas, \nbuild new businesses. This is how it comes about. You have to protect \nthe American worker's economic options. This goes a long way towards \naccomplishing that.\n  I am going to share just some of the key components of this. As I \nsaid, this middle-class tax relief act returns the middle class to the \nlowest tax bracket providing broad tax relief. I should note that the \ncosponsors are Senator McCain of Arizona--Senator McCain will come to \nthe floor here shortly and give his views on this--Senator Nickles of \nOklahoma, Senator Helms of North Carolina, and Senator Gramm of Texas, \none of our most renowned economists in the Senate.\n  The proposal raises the income cap under which the 15 percent \nindividual income tax rate applies. Approximately 10.3 million tax \nfilers will be returned from the 28 percent tax bracket to the 15 \npercent tax bracket. Married couples' taxable income thresholds would \nrise to $70,000. Approximately 7.6 million married tax filers would be \nreturned from the 28 percent tax bracket to the 15 percent bracket. \nSingle heads of households' income thresholds would rise to $52,000 for \nsingle parents. Approximately 375,000 single heads of households tax \nfilers would be returned from the 28 percent bracket to the 15 percent. \nSingles' taxable income thresholds would rise to $35,000, and \napproximately 2.3 million single tax filers would be returned from the \n28 percent bracket to the 15 percent bracket.\n  Mr. President, 29 million taxpayers would see lower taxes because \nmore income is taxed at 15 percent as a result of this broad-based \nmiddle-class tax relief. It is the only major tax relief proposal \nfocused directly on addressing the middle-class squeeze. It is simple, \nit is basic, and it is achievable in this Congress.\n  Mr. President, $39 billion is expected as the annual tax relief from \n1999 to 2003, according to preliminary estimates by the Tax Foundation. \nNearly $1,200 in average annual tax relief per filer could be expected \nin the first year alone. It would also provide significant marriage \npenalty relief without adding complexity to the Tax Code.\n\n[[Page S2882]]\n\n  There is not a soul in America who doesn't believe we can't find 6.9 \npercent in savings. In fact, if you ask the American people, the figure \nwould be a lot higher when they talk about what they consider to be \nwaste or not-accounted-for money, et cetera. It is interesting, on the \neve of making this presentation, the Wall Street Journal headline \nyesterday: ``United States Fails To Meet Standard Accounting Methods.''\n\n       Overall, the General Accounting Office--which acted as the \n     equivalent of an outside auditor in preparing the financial \n     statement--[on the American Government] found widespread \n     problems with recordkeeping and documentation that apparently \n     prevented the Government from properly accounting for \n     billions of dollars in property.\n\n  This report is alarming, but it underscores what most of us have \nknown for many, many years, that there is significant waste, \nsignificant loss of property and value in this huge, monolithic Federal \nGovernment that we have built. It needs to be downsized. We need to \nreturn to the idea of empowering the American citizen. We have gone way \ntoo far, and we are paying an enormous price for it in flexibility, in \nresponsibility, in the care of our children, in the condition of our \nschools, in the denial of opportunity. There is no telling, over these \nlast 30 years, because of the students who have come through these \nschools with inadequate educations, how many ideas, how many Jonas \nSalks, how many other U.S. Senators, how many new ideas and dreams \nnever happened because we didn't give them the tools that we have \ntraditionally given them in this country,\n  We ought to be about that business. We need to restore and protect \nthe economic liberty of the American worker and family. We need to keep \nthem safe, and we need to keep them educated to make it all work. That \nis what makes American liberty work.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I reserve the remainder of my time \nso the cosponsors might also have an opportunity to come to the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the \nCoverdell amendment be temporarily set aside so I may speak on \namendment No. 2181.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2181\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I also ask unanimous consent that Senator \nGrassley be added as a cosponsor to my amendment, No. 2180.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today I rise to speak on my \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment regarding the use of tobacco revenues to \nrestore solvency to the Medicare Program. During the markup of this \nresolution, my colleague, Senator Lautenberg, offered a very similar \namendment that stated it was the sense of the Senate that any tobacco \nlegislation should increase the cost of a pack of cigarettes by $1.50. \nI voted in favor of this amendment. However, like Chairman Domenici, I \nbelieve we should use these revenues, not for new programs, but to save \nMedicare. I stated in the Budget Committee meeting that we were voting \non amendment after amendment of very popular, and I am sure well-\npolled, ideas. When it comes to educating children or taking care of \nchildren, providing for schools and all of the other ideas that in the \nabstract we find very, very appealing, I found the arguments \ncompelling--except for one thing. We have made some serious promises to \nthe American people with respect to Social Security, Medicare, \nMedicaid--entitlements upon which people, frankly, have come to depend. \nThese programs are in extremis. So, while it would be easy to vote for \nall of these well-polled ideas, I think it is important that we stand \nup for the promises of the past.\n  As we all know, there is a way to protect Medicare and also to \naddress the issue of smoking. The use of tobacco products by children \nand teenagers has become a public health epidemic. According to the \nCenters for Disease Control, more than 16 million of our Nation's \nchildren will soon become regular smokers. This is a national tragedy. \nI hear some of my colleagues, even on my side of the aisle, say we \nshould not do this through price. I have to say, in my opinion, all the \nregulation, all the education materials we can print and provide the \nschools are fine and good, but next to peer pressure the teens feel to \nsmoke, these things amount to very little --except when you go after \nprice. It is an economic deterrent that may well save them from this \nvicious habit, a habit which ultimately could take their lives.\n\n  Of the 16 million children I have talked about who become regular \nsmokers, approximately one-third of them will die from tobacco-related \nillness. As this population ages and becomes eligible for Medicare, the \nhealth-related costs will escalate. In fact, a report by Columbia \nUniversity says that tobacco use costs Medicare approximately $10 \nbillion per year and the total economic cost of tobacco-related health \ncosts is more than $100 billion per year. Regardless of the outcome of \nthe tobacco settlement in Congress--and I am one who intends to vote \nfor a settlement. Whatever we can get through this Congress that will \nhelp to change these disturbing, shameful trends, I intend to vote for \nbecause I believe it is our responsibility to ensure that we provide \nall the deterrence we can towards this habit and at the same time \nensure that the Medicare Program that will bear much of the burden of \nthis habit remains solvent by any and every means, as long as the means \nare contributing to the end that tobacco use by this generation and \ngenerations to come will be on the decline.\n  Whether we end up with a tax on cigarettes of $1.10 or $1.50 a pack, \nthese revenues should be used to restore what has already been lost; in \nthis case, Medicare dollars due to tobacco-related health care costs.\n  I thank my colleagues. I hope they will vote for my amendment. I hope \nwe will have a tobacco settlement. And I hope we will keep yesterday's \npromises first and restore a degree of solvency to Medicare.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I did not understand the entire \nunanimous consent request. Is it fair to assume that the Smith proposal \nis now on the list of amendments to be placed for vote as we proceed \nthrough this, in accordance with our rules of fairness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will advise the Senator the \namendment was previously offered and is one of the amendments that will \nbe disposed of.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  Parliamentary inquiry. How much time remains for the pending \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has approximately 30 \nminutes remaining. The opposition has 60 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder, although we will put in a quorum call with \nboth sides charged equally, I wonder if we could ask the opposition if \nthey have some people to speak against Senator Coverdell?\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and ask that the \ntime be charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2199\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we have heard about the amendment that \nthe Senator from Georgia proposes with Senator McCain, and I want to \ndescribe why I am opposing this amendment. While it sounds good on the \nsurface, I think there are a few things we have to talk about and \nhighlight what kind of problems might ensue.\n  This amendment would cut domestic programs like education, child \ncare, law enforcement, veterans' programs, and environmental \nprotection. It would violate current budget rules. Frankly, I view it \nas fiscally irresponsible.\n  This amendment calls for $101 billion in cuts from discretionary \nprograms for use in providing various tax breaks. I note that it is not \nallowed under the Budget Act. And there is good reason that the Budget \nAct protects against that. The Budget Act is designed to ensure that if \nwe incur permanent obligations, like permanent tax cuts or new\n\n[[Page S2883]]\n\nmandatory spending, that we pay for these obligations with permanent \nsavings. That is what the pay-as-you-go system is all about, and it has \nworked well for many years. People understand very clearly that if you \nspend it, you have to find a way to get the money.\n  This amendment flies in the face of these rules, and it threatens to \nundermine long-term fiscal discipline. The amendment says that we \nshould make cuts in temporary spending--that is, annually appropriated \ndiscretionary programs--and use temporary cuts to fund permanent tax \nbreaks. That is a mix and match that does not work.\n  Mr. President, it does not take a CPA to figure out that this can \ncreate serious problems in the long term. I am not opposed to tax cuts \nfor ordinary working Americans, but I do think we should pay for them \nwith permanent savings. I do not think we ought to introduce gimmickry \nthat says we are going to have permanent cuts and temporary savings.\n  In addition, I am concerned about what it would mean to cut $101 \nbillion from programs which support education, fight crime, support our \nveterans, and protect our environment. Many of these programs are \ncritical to the well-being of our country and to millions of ordinary \nAmericans.\n  The question is raised, Is there waste in Government? Yes, of course, \nbut this amendment does not target waste, it adopts the meat-ax \napproach to Government, and that is not what the American people want. \nIn the most successful corporations, in the largest corporations, there \nis waste, but how you get rid of it is to focus on what caused it in \nthe first place and work deliberately toward ending it.\n  You do not simply say, ``OK, we're going to cut our expenses across \nthe board.'' That goes through good departments; that goes through bad \ndepartments; that goes through good management, as well as bad \nmanagement. That is not the way problems are solved.\n  I think most Senators from both parties will agree that the era of \nbig Government is over. Government has been shrinking, and it will \ncontinue to shrink. As a matter of fact, the executive branch \nemployment is the lowest as a proportion of total civilian employment \nsince the 1930s.\n  Federal outlays as a percent of GDP stand at their lowest level since \nthe Nixon administration. Nondefense discretionary spending is at its \nlowest percentage of GDP since the early 1960s.\n  I think it is important to note where America stands. Total \nGovernment spending as a share of GDP is the lowest for the United \nStates than for all G-7 countries, the most advanced countries in the \nworld--France, Italy, Germany, Canada, the U.K., and Japan. That tells \nus that not only is Government spending proportionately less but that \nGovernment is in fact smaller when it comes to employment and programs \nrealistically.\n  Under the budget agreement reached last year, nondefense \ndiscretionary spending in 2002 will reach its lowest level in almost 40 \nyears as a share of GDP. But the McCain-Coverdell amendment would \nviolate the budget agreement. It would lower the discretionary spending \ncaps even further, making draconian cuts in the investments that \nAmericans care about most.\n  Under this amendment, funding for the National Institutes of Health \nwould be cut by 7.9 percent; education would take a 7.6 percent cut; \nchild care would be hit to the tune of 7.8 percent; the environment, \n8.3 percent; transportation, a 7.1 percent cut; and veterans programs, \na 7.6 percent cut. And it goes on--crime fighting programs would be \nreduced 7.6 percent. All to support $101 billion worth of tax breaks.\n  The kind of cuts that would be required under this amendment could \nhave a devastating effect on our children. It would dramatically reduce \nfunding for education, child care. It would weaken enforcement of \nenvironmental laws and undercut our efforts to reduce crime and support \nour veterans.\n  I listened to the debate carefully, and I heard descriptions of an \nAmerica that I really do not recognize--an America where your freedoms \nare limited, where your opportunities are reduced, an America where it \nis harder to get by.\n  I have to ask one question: Why is it that people will die to take \nthe chance and the risk of death to get to our shores, to sneak in our \nborders, to float on tubes in the Caribbean, hide in the holds of \nairplanes, take a chance on drowning in the hold of a boat to get here, \nto get to this place described as a confiscatory structure that does \nnot permit people opportunity?\n  Mr. President, that bell does not ring true. It may be good politics, \nit may sound good on the radio when people hear it, but it is not the \ntruth about our society. This is the greatest country on the face of \nthis Earth, and it has been since its creation. And we have been smart. \nWe have been working hard, but we have also been darn lucky, let me \ntell you. We have an abundance of whatever it is. We have an abundance \nof oil; we have an abundance of minerals; we have an abundance of \nspace; we have an abundance of agricultural land. Boy, are we lucky--\nAmerica the beautiful. That was not a coincidence; that is the truth. \nAnd people all around this world know it.\n  That is why our stock market is constantly headed upward. Why? \nBecause people say, if you have money, whether you are in countries A, \nB, C, D, all the way around the globe, ``Boy, I want to put my money in \nAmerica, because I know it is safe here.'' We have seen country after \ncountry, the richest oil countries, they are packing their money and \ngetting out of their own resource structure, because they know they may \nhave oil in the ground but they do not have freedom on the streets; \nthey do not have a secure societal structure.\n  And we hear whispers about what Thomas Jefferson might have done. \nLook at this country. Look at our citizens. Life expectancy has never \nbeen better. I remember when I was a child, the man next door to us \ndied. He was 53 years old. And I thought to myself, I said to my \nfriend, ``Oh, he was old.''\n  Old? I see lots of guys over 50. I see guys in my decade running in \nmarathons, jogging, healthy, supporting their families, enjoying life. \nWhy are there conversations about, maybe Social Security ought to be \nraised? I am not endorsing it; I am simply mentioning it. Why? Because \nwe know that people who are 65 are today almost prime-of-lifers.\n  And, boy, I come from New Jersey, and I want to tell you, when I look \nat New Jersey's economic structure, we are called ``the medicine chest \nof the country,'' because we have these pharmaceuticals. I used to read \nthe sports pages actively. Now I read about the new inventions or the \nnew patents actively--what is going to save your hair, what is going to \nsave your heart, what is going to save your lungs. That is the kind of \nsociety we are.\n  What is this gloom, this despair, that hangs over us? ``Well, they're \ntaking away our rights. They're confiscating our property.'' Life has \nnever been better on the whole for the people in the world than in this \ncountry, America, these days.\n  People get in an airplane today that is jammed. It is jammed with \nordinary working people. No more of the formality. You do not have to \nwear a suit and a tie to get in an airplane, as was the custom years \nago because it was restricted to an elite few. It is available for \neverybody. Air traffic today is almost mass transit, because we have \nmade it available.\n  People go on vacations to places that nobody even heard of when I was \na child. It is available. Children are healthy. Look at them. Look at \nthe young people who surround the President's table there, bright, 15 \nyears old. They know what is going on in the world. They have learned. \nThey love the opportunity to be here and to associate with these great \nSenators, I think.\n  This is a country where we devote our energy to young people. We want \nour kids to have appropriate nutrition. We want them to have proper \neducation. Do we succeed in every program? Heck, no. We do not. But we \ntry. We try. And it is a subject of debate here. Right or wrong, it \ndoes not matter. It is a free society, as free as any place in the \nworld. I know lots of places where if you talk about things we talk \nabout here--criticism of the President, criticism of this institution, \ncriticism of that institution--you go off with your hands in handcuffs.\n  This is a great society. It does not need any apologies from anybody \nabout whether or not taxes--yes, maybe taxes\n\n[[Page S2884]]\n\nare a little onerous at times, but the question is, compared to what? \nWe can talk about what tax rates used to be, the amount of income kept \nin years and decades gone by, ``dreamsville,'' but today you may pay a \nlittle bit more, but you have a lot more left because you are earning \nmore. That is what this society is about.\n  Entrepreneurships, opportunities, Mr. President. I have been really \nlucky in my lifetime. Best of all, my luck is four children and five \ngrandchildren, with number six on the way. That is the best luck I have \never had. But in addition to that, I was able, with a couple of other \nguys who, like me, came from working-class parents--my father worked in \nthe silk mills of Paterson. Paterson is an industrial city that has \nfallen by the wayside, one of America's poorest cities trying to fight \nback. A lot of dilapidation; a lot of problems; but a lot of spirit.\n\n  Three of us started a business that started an industry that created \nmore jobs than the computer hardware business. More people are employed \nin the software service side of the computer industry by far than those \nin the hardware business, than the IBMs or the RCAs or the Honeywells \nor the companies that used to be in the computer business. Today, there \nare more people employed in the service companies like ADP--the company \nI helped found--by far than companies that made hardware.\n  I am considered a pioneer. I am in something called the Hall of Fame \nfor Information Processing, a little place in Texas, that has some \nplaques in there because we were innovators. The company I started--\nwithout a dime literally; the three of us came from poverty, not \nmiddle-class; poverty--our company today employs 30,000 people across \nthe world and has one of the best records of growth in its stock of any \ncompany in America. If you invested $300 in ADP in 1961, it is worth \n$1.4 million today.\n  What does it mean? It means that entrepreneurship is alive and well \nin this country of ours. Look at Intel, look at Microsoft, look at \nAmerica Online. Look at these companies. You will see success after \nsuccess after success. There is no shortage of opportunity in America, \nnone at all. The shortage may be in the mentality that fails to see the \ngoodness that we have in this country of ours.\n  Talk of the gloom and the confiscation of property and taxes and how \ndebilitating it is to pay your way--my gosh, if people want to join a \nclub, they look at the dues and they say, ``Well, is it worth it or \nnot? What's it worth to belong to the country club called America?'' It \nis worth everything. People are willing again to fight and to die for \nthe opportunity to be here. Look at how many illegals we have in this \ncountry now. Under all kinds of threats--you get shot at the border, \nyou get stopped, you get jailed--they still pour over because they want \nto be in America. That is where the opportunity is. That is where the \nfreedom is at its fullest.\n  When I hear talk about how we are losing opportunity, we are losing \nthe chance to succeed, it is summarized in one word that means a lot in \nAmerica. It is called ``baloney''--and I'm not talking about meat. \nThere is plenty of opportunity here. And we have problems. One of the \nproblems is our violence rate--10,000 people, roughly, murdered by \nhandguns, people afraid to walk down the street. One of the people on \nmy staff, 2 days ago, was walking home, living just about on Capitol \nHill, a gun was put in her face, took her handbag. Thank the Lord that \nis all that happened.\n  Those are the problems that we have. Those are problems we ought to \nwork on. I don't understand why we want to take money away from safety \nand fighting crime and put it into tax breaks for people who don't need \nit, especially those at the top. Look at the top incomes in this \ncountry. It boggles the mind. I never knew that people could amass the \nkind of fortunes that we have seen.\n  We have our weaknesses, but, boy, have we got our strengths.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment. Don't play with the \nsystem this way--shoot-from-the-hip tax breaks that are permanent, cuts \nin other programs where the revenue flow is just temporary. This adopts \na meat-ax approach to domestic needs while making sure that these tax \nbreaks are there. It violates the Budget Act. We note that. I hope our \ncolleagues will reject this amendment and in that rejection say no, we \nare not going to play those kinds of games.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleague from \nGeorgia in offering this amendment to incorporate the provisions of the \nMiddle Class Tax Relief Act of 1998 into the assumptions underlying the \nFiscal Year 1999 Budget Resolution.\n  On January 22, 1998, Senators Coverdell, Gramm, and I introduced S. \n1569, a bill which would deliver sweeping tax relief to lower- and \nmiddle-income taxpayers. The bill would increase the number of \nindividuals who pay the lowest tax rates of 15% and significantly \nlessen the impact of one of the Tax Code's most inequitable \nprovisions--the marriage penalty.\n  In 1998, the Middle Class Tax Relief Act would place approximately 10 \nmillion taxpayers now in the 28% tax-bracket into the 15% tax-bracket. \nAn estimated 28 million Americans would reap some benefit from the \nbroad-based tax relief provisions in the bill, according to the Tax \nFoundation.\n  The amendment we are offering today provides the budgetary \nflexibility to deliver this broad-based tax relief to Americans. It \npays for this tax relief by trimming more of the fat from our bloated \nfederal government and closing inequitable and unnecessary tax \nloopholes for big businesses.\n  The middle-class tax cut plan in S. 1569 would reduce revenues by \napproximately $195.5 billion from 1999 through 2003. This amendment \nestablishes a reserve fund, comprised of spending cuts and increased \nrevenues from closing tax loopholes, to fully offset this loss of \nrevenue.\n  We eliminate $94 billion in special-interest tax loopholes over five \nyears. These inequitable provisions--like the ethanol fuel tax credit, \ntaxation of coal sales as capital gains, special tax treatment of \nshipping companies' capital construction funds, and dozens of other \nprovisions--benefit corporations and businesses at the expense of \nmiddle-class Americans.\n  The amendment cuts $101.5 billion from non-defense discretionary \nspending, an average reduction of 6.9 percent over five years. At the \nsame time, we recognize that tax relief cannot come at the expense of \nthose programs that ensure the well-being and health of our nation's \nelderly and most needy. Our amendment makes no cuts in Social Security \nor Medicare. It also specifically protects programs that support \neducation and child nutrition, support medical priorities, help low-\nincome families make ends meet, curb illegal drug use among children, \nand reduce illegal immigration. None of the spending cuts would come \nfrom these programs.\n  The cost of providing middle-class tax relief--$195.5 billion--\namounts to only 2 percent of the more than $9 trillion that the federal \ngovernment will spend over the next five years.\n  Our amendment supports the enactment of S. 1569 without throwing the \nbudget into imbalance or even affecting the growing federal budget \nsurplus. The surpluses expected in future years are the key to \nbeginning to pay down our massive $5.4 trillion federal debt and \nshoring up the ailing Social Security system. Middle-class tax relief \nwould, in fact, contribute to a stronger economy and thus to even \ngreater budget surpluses.\n  Mr. President, this amendment offers Senators an opportunity to \nreaffirm their continued support for fundamental tax reform for middle-\nclass Americans. Last year, we passed, with bipartisan support, the \nTaxpayer Relief Act which was a broad-reaching bill to address certain \nvery specific problems, like capital gains taxation, taxes on home \nsales, and the like. The Middle Class Tax Relief Act continues the \nmomentum for tax relief to remove the overly burdensome tax load that \nmost Americans bear.\n  The Middle Class Tax Relief Act focuses directly on addressing the \nmiddle-class tax squeeze. It is essential that we provide American \nfamilies with relief from the excessive rate of taxation that saps job \ngrowth and robs them of the opportunity to provide for their needs and \nsave for the future.\n  First, the bill targets tax relief to the individuals who feel the \ntax squeeze the most: lower and middle-income taxpayers. For example, \nunder\n\n[[Page S2885]]\n\nthis bill, unmarried individuals could make $35,000 and married \nindividuals could make $70,000, and still be in the lowest tax bracket.\n  Second, the bill is simple and provides broad-based tax relief. It \nbases taxation on income alone, rather than the number of school-age \nchildren.\n  Third, the measure results in taxpayers being able to keep more of \nthe money they earn. This extra income will allow individuals to save \nand invest more. Increased savings and investment are key to sustaining \nour current economic growth.\n  Last, the bill minimizes the effect of the marriage penalty. Our \ncurrent tax code taxes a married couple's income more heavily than it \nwould tax a single individual earning the same amount of income as the \nmarried couple. The bill reduces this inequity by taxing a married \ncouple's joint income and a single individual earning the same income \nas the married couple at essentially the same effective rates.\n  In sum, the measure is a win for individuals, for families, and for \nAmerica. Millions of Americans would realize some tax relief from this \nlegislation. Thus, more Americans will be able to keep more of what \nthey earn. This, in turn, will insure that Americans have more of the \nresources they need to invest in their own individual futures, and \nAmerica's future.\n  Mr. President, on a broader scale, I believe we should abandon our \nexisting tax code altogether and create a new system. This new system \nshould have one tax rate, which taxes income only one time. This new \nsystem should also reduce the time to prepare tax returns from days to \nminutes, and the expense to prepare tax returns from thousands of \ndollars to pennies. But I recognize that scrapping the Tax Code now is \nnot a realistic expectation, so we must settle for a more gradual \napproach to relieving the tax burden on Americans.\n  Last year's Taxpayer Relief Act was a step in the right direction to \nprovide tax relief to lower and middle-income families. The Middle \nClass Tax Relief Act of 1998 represents an important further step \ntoward a flatter, fairer tax system, which also provides immediate tax \nrelief for hard-working Americans and their families.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the millions of Americans in need of \nrelief from over-taxation, I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment and demonstrate their continued commitment to tax reform and \nrelief.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to explain my \nvote against the Coverdell Amendment, which has a laudable objective of \nreducing the federal tax burden on millions of American families, but \ngoes about funding such tax relief in a manner which I cannot support.\n  Specifically, the Coverdell Amendment provides for $101.5 billion/\nfive years in tax relief through making more Americans eligible for the \n15 percent tax bracket. The revenues lost through this amendment would \nbe made up by cuts in all non-defense discretionary spending programs \nand over the same five-year period.\n  As Chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I know how hard it is to reduce federal \nspending. I have used a scalpel, not a meat axe, to cut 134 federal \nprograms over the last five years, with savings totaling $1.5 billion. \nThe cuts proposed in the Coverdell Amendment for FY99 include $1.5 \nbillion from health programs such as the National Institutes of Health \nand $2.5 billion from education, job training, employment, and social \nservices. Other cuts in the Coverdell Amendment trouble me, such as \n$737 million in transportation and over $1 billion in cuts for \nveterans' programs in FY99.\n  With respect to the tax relief offered by the Coverdell Amendment, I \ndo not believe it actually goes far enough toward flattening the \ncurrent tax brackets. My own approach toward reducing the tax burden on \nAmericans is my Flat Tax Act (S. 593). I am troubled that Americans \nspend 5.4 billion hours and $600 billion each year complying with the \ncomplexities of the 12,000 pages of the Internal Revenue Code rules and \nregulations. I believe that the best answer for alleviating the \ntremendous tax burden on America's working families and businesses is a \nflat tax, and have proposed replacing the current tax code with a 20 \npercent flat tax on individuals and businesses that could be filed on a \nsimple 10-line postcard.\n  S. 593 increases the personal and dependent allowances for families \nand preserves two key deductions that make the tax burden a little more \nbearable for working families: deductions of home mortgage interest \ncapped at $100,000 in borrowing, and for up to $2500 in charitable \ncontributions. For example, a typical couple with two children earning \n$30,000 would save about $1,100. It also eliminates taxes on estates, \ndividends and capital gains. With respect to businesses, S. 593 would \neliminate the intricate scheme of complicated depreciation schedules, \ndeductions, credits and other complexities that go into business \ntaxation. Businesses would be allowed to expense 100 percent of the \ncost of capital formation, including purchases of capital equipment, \nstructures, and land, and do so in the year in which the investments \nare made.\n  With a flat tax, Americans' savings rates will rise, and the pool of \ncapital available for investment in business expansion and job creation \nwill expand dramatically. Reasonable estimates are that a flat tax can \nlower interest rates by two points, pump an additional $1 trillion into \nthe economy over seven years, and raise the per capita income of every \nAmerican by $1,900.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am going to support the Coverdell \namendment because I believe that the tax burden on American families is \ntoo high and that people--especially hard working low- and middle-\nincome Americans--should be allowed to keep more of what they earn.\n  The federal tax burden is currently the highest in our nation's \nhistory. The National Taxpayer's Union reports that the average \nAmerican family now pays almost 40 percent of their income in state, \nlocal, and federal taxes. The Coverdell amendment addresses this \nproblem by targeting $101 billion in tax cuts at families in Michigan \nand elsewhere, most of them earning between $25,000 and $70,000. At its \nvery core, Mr. President, the Coverdell amendment is a statement that \ntaxes on middle-class American families are just too high.\n  Right now, Mr. President, a family in Michigan that earns as little \nas $42,000 pays an income tax rate of 28 percent--42 percent if you \ninclude payroll taxes. The Coverdell amendment cuts that income tax \nrate to 15 percent.\n  Right now, millions of middle-class couples are penalized by the tax \ncode for being married. The Coverdell amendment helps reduce this \n``marriage penalty'' and end the tax code's bias against families.\n  The Coverdell amendment takes a significant step in reducing tax \nrates for middle-class families and eliminating unfair biases against \nmarried couples.\n  That said, Mr. President, I want to make clear that the offsets \nincluded in the Coverdell amendment are not those that I would choose. \nOverall, the Coverdell amendment calls for a reduction in annual \nfederal spending of about $40 billion out of a total budget of $1.7 \ntrillion, or just over 2 percent. And while these spending reductions \nwill eventually be the responsibility of the Appropriations Committee, \nI believe they can be accomplished without cutting education accounts \nor reducing highway spending.\n  The federal government is projected to spend hundreds of billions of \ndollars over the next five years on administration, overhead, and \npersonnel expenditures. Targeting these areas for cuts, including \neliminating unnecessary government agencies like Commerce, Energy and \nHUD, and reducing excessive overhead accounts, should be the first \npriority to offset these tax cuts and are adequate to offset the \nprojected revenue impact.\n  Mr. President, I support a smaller, more efficient federal government \nthat allows people to keep more of what they earn. For that reason, I \nsupport the Coverdell amendment. If the amendment is adopted, however, \nI intend to offer a series of amendments that would redirect the \nspending reductions called for by the Coverdell amendment towards the \nareas outlined above while protecting important budget functions like \nhealth, education, transportation and law enforcement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, last year's Taxpayer Relief Act was a step\n\n[[Page S2886]]\n\nin the right direction to provide tax relief to lower and middle-income \nfamilies.\n  This amendment to incorporate the provisions of the Middle Class Tax \nRelief Act of 1998 into the assumptions underlying the Fiscal Year 1999 \nBudget Resolution, represents an important further step toward a \nflatter, fairer tax system, which also provides immediate tax relief \nfor hard-working Americans and their families.\n  This amendment provides broad based middle class tax relief by \nincreasing the number of individuals who pay the lowest tax rate of 15% \nand significantly lessening the impact of one of the Tax Code's most \ninequitable provisions--the marriage penalty.\n  An estimated 28 million Americans would reap some benefit from the \nbroad-based tax relief provisions in the bill, according to the Tax \nFoundation.\n  The amendment pays for this tax relief by trimming more of the fat \nfrom our bloated federal government and closing inequitable and \nunnecessary tax loopholes for big businesses.\n  The amendment cuts $101.5 billion from non-defense discretionary \nspending, an average reduction of 6.9 percent over five years.\n  This amendment does not cut any spending from Medicare and Social \nSecurity.\n  It also specifically protects programs that support education and \nchild nutrition, support medical priorities, help low-income families \nmade ends meet, curb illegal drug use among children, and reduce \nillegal immigration.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the millions of Americans in need of \nrelief from over-taxation, I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment and demonstrate their continued commitment to tax reform and \nrelief.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be set aside so I may make some brief remarks and introduce \nan amendment on behalf of myself and my distinguished colleague from \nMaryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. Let me just offer my \nthanks and congratulations to the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee for presenting a budget resolution which balances a large \nnumber of competing interests without a lot of resources to do it. The \ndiscretionary caps are getting tighter, no question about it. The path \nof least resistance would have been to loosen them.\n  I am pleased to say the Budget Committee, under Senator Domenici's \nleadership, avoided that path. Now the real test of leadership is \nbefore the full Senate to see whether we can keep those caps and move \nthe budget--at long last--into balance.\n  Even with the limits we face, the Budget Committee managed to \nassemble a good package that meets a number of critical priorities. \nThat is what budgeting is about--setting priorities. These priorities \ncall for funding the public needs of the current generation, but they \nalso call for self-discipline to avoid increasing the debt burdens on \nour children and grandchildren.\n  The budget resolution before the Senate sets those priorities--\nkeeping our obligations to both the present and the future. The best \ndeals are those in which everybody wins without neglecting any critical \npriorities. I think this budget resolution is one of those kinds of \ndeals.\n  When you look at who wins, first, future generations win. We will \nkeep our commitment to our children and grandchildren, get control over \nthe Federal budget and stop piling on heavier and heavier debt burdens. \nWe do this by putting the budget into balance and resisting the \ntemptation to spend a surplus that we haven't even seen yet. If we keep \nto our current path, we may even get to lighten that debt burden a \nlittle bit.\n  We have lived fairly comfortably at the expense of our children. We \nhave borrowed from them about $5.5 trillion and spent it for our own \nneeds and comforts. The living standard we now enjoy will be paid, to a \ngreat extent, by our children. I think that is worth saying again. Our \nchildren have bought or will buy $5.5 trillion worth of our current \nprosperity. They will pay for it in higher taxes, higher interest \npayments, and less funds to pay for the public needs and priorities \nthey face. We certainly should not increase the debt any more.\n  Now, it appears likely that we will run a small surplus for the next \ndecade or so. Now we have a few crumbs to give back to our children in \nappreciation for what they have already lent us. Incredibly, some folks \naround here want us to spend that as well. We owe it to our children, \nMr. President--we literally owe it to them--to pay down this massive \ndebt.\n  We certainly should not increase the debt even more. That's why it's \nso important to keep to the discretionary spending caps and to keep the \nbudget moving into balance. The budget resolution achieves this goal. \nIt keeps within the discretionary spending caps that the Congress and \nthe President agreed to just last year.\n  Unfortunately, the President's budget would have broken those caps by \n$12 billion in 1999, according to the Congressional Budget Office. I \nfind this remarkable. Why is it so hard to keep to an agreement we made \njust last year?\n  Breaking the discretionary caps, putting the balanced budget in \njeopardy--these would have neglected the priority we have placed on the \nprosperity of future generations. The budget resolution avoids that \ntemptation, keeps to the caps, and keeps our commitment to stop \nborrowing from our children and grandchildren.\n  So, future generations win under the budget resolution. Who else \nwins? Well, current generations win, too--at every stage of life.\n  For example, children already born--not just the children of the \nfuture--win under the budget resolution. Under the committee version, \nfunding for the child care and development block grant will increase by \n$5 billion in budget authority--doubling its budget authority over the \nnext 5 years.\n  I am pleased also that the Budget Committee, on both sides of the \npolitical aisle, agreed with my proposal to designate savings from \nassuming the President's reduction in the School-to-Work Program for \nlocal early childhood development initiatives. This would provide \nanother $1.5 billion for our Nation's children.\n  Clearly, children are winners under the budget resolution. Adults are \nwinners, too. Hardworking American taxpayers come out ahead under the \ncommittee plan.\n  The budget resolution envisions $30 billion in tax relief. Some may \ncriticize that amount for being too little. Of course, we would always \nlike to find more ways to lighten the tax load on America's taxpayers. \nLet me note a couple of things about the committee's actions on tax \nrelief.\n  First, we need to keep in mind that any specific tax cut measure will \nbe the responsibility of the Finance Committee. Nothing in the budget \nresolution dictates to that committee what it must do. In fact, if the \ncommittee finds additional offsets, it may cut taxes even more than the \nbudget resolution proposes. The budget resolution includes a ``tax cut \nreserve fund'' to make deficit-neutral tax relief--of whatever size, as \ndetermined by the committee of jurisdiction--possible.\n  Second, the Budget Committee's $30 billion in expected tax relief \nwould allow long-needed relief in some crucial areas. These could \ninclude $10.5 billion in relief from the marriage penalty and $9 \nbillion in child care expenses.\n  I am particularly grateful that Chairman Domenici included in this \nchairman's mark an acceleration in the deductibility of health \ninsurance for self-employed persons. This idea, which the full Budget \nCommittee subsequently endorsed, is critical to achieving parity \nbetween self-employed persons and their large competitors.\n\n  I have long advocated full deductibility as the only fair policy. \nAlthough current law now calls for that to be achieved in 2007, full \ndeductibility needs to be achieved sooner. Current practice still \nplaces a relative disadvantage on self-employed persons, since \nemployers do have full deductibility. People who pursue the American \ndream through independent self-employment should not be penalized or \ndiscouraged from getting health insurance by treating them differently.\n  I am going to support the budget resolution because it is a step \nforward on this issue and on so many other issues. I urge my colleagues \nwho have their\n\n[[Page S2887]]\n\nown concerns about the tax package to look at it in the same light. Is \nit an improvement over current law? Yes. How can we oppose it just \nbecause it doesn't include everything we might like? I remind my \ncolleagues of the political adage of not making the perfect into the \nenemy of the good.\n  Finally, the budget resolution helps all American taxpayers by \nendorsing reform of the Internal Revenue Service. My distinguished \ncolleagues from Iowa and Oklahoma Messrs. Grassley and Nickles, joined \nwith me in the Budget Committee to propose that a tax relief package \ninclude improvement of taxpayer rights--especially in IRS property \nseizure cases--and reform of IRS penalty rules. This proposal was also \nendorsed by the full Budget Committee and it appears in the budget \nresolution. I thank the committee for its attention to, and concern \nfor, the rights of our Nation's taxpayers.\n  The budget resolution is a winning package for American taxpayers, as \nwell as our children. Another group that wins under the budget \nresolution is our nation's seniors. The budget resolution provides \nneeded support for both Social Security and Medicare.\n  The Budget Committee's package adopts the President's call to set \naside the expected budget surplus until we reform Social Security into \na sound and reliable program for the long-term. Social Security, as the \nPresident knows, is a key source of support for our seniors as part of \ntheir total retirement strategy. That's why the President was right to \ndemand that we ``Save Social Security First.''\n  The Budget Committee adopted the President's view. Remarkably, the \nPresident himself did not. As the Congressional Budget Office noted, \nthe President's own budget submission would have reduced the expected \nsurplus by $43 billion.\n  Forty-three billion dollars. That's money spent to ``Save Big \nGovernment First.''\n  I commend my colleagues on the Budget Committee for including \nlanguage in the budget resolution to remind the President of his \npromise to ``Save Social Security First'' and stating the sense of the \nSenate that these surpluses should be set aside until we reform Social \nSecurity for future generations. The surpluses should not be frittered \naway on higher spending in violation of last year's budget agreement.\n  The Budget Committee also resisted the temptation to spend any \nFederal revenues that might arise from a tobacco settlement, despite \nnumerous amendments from the committee minority to do so. Instead, the \ncommittee's plan earmarks those revenues for bolstering the Medicare \nProgram. Given the health care costs that tobacco has placed on \nMedicare, I can think of no better way to use tobacco revenues. Those \ncosts are part of the reason why Medicare is a troubled program.\n  The seniors who rely on Medicare are counting on us to take the \nnecessary steps to shore up that program. We took some preliminary \nsteps in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. By slowing the annual rate of \nMedicare growth from 8.8 to 5.5 percent, the Balanced Budget Act \nextended the life of the Medicare part A trust fund through 2006, an \nimprovement over the program's previous expected bankruptcy date in \n2001.\n  However, we all know the effect that the baby-boomers are going to \nhave on the program when they start to retire in 2011. Let's start \nplanning ahead by allocating any Federal tobacco revenues to keep \nMedicare in business for the customers--our senior citizen \nconstituents--who need it. It would be irresponsible for use to do \nanything else.\n  I sum, I say again that the best deals are those in which everybody \nwins. The Budget Committee has assembled a package that meets that \nstandard. Future generations win, and current generations--children, \nworking Americans, and senior citizens--also win.\n  Who doesn't win under the budget resolution? Those who would break \nthe discretionary caps, those who would push the budget out of balance, \nand those who would ``Save Big Government First.'' Anyone who observed \nthe Budget Committee's markup of the budget resolution would have to \nnote the alarming number of proposals from the minority that sought to \nspend, spend, spend. They no doubt will be the loudest in condemning \nthe budget resolution for failing to adopt the President's new spending \nschemes.\n  I find this astonishing. Frankly, the minority should be pleased with \nthis resolution. The Budget Committee kept its word to the President to \nprotect certain functions at funding levels the President agreed to in \nlast year's bipartisan budget agreement.\n  That agreement designed five budget functions as ``protected \nfunctions.'' These are International Affairs (Function 150); Natural \nResources and Environment (300); Transportation (400); Education, \nTraining, Employment, and Social Services (500); and Administration of \nJustice (750). In every case, the budget resolution meets or exceeds \nthe levels we agreed to last year.\n  With this in mind, it is amazing that the President could attack the \ncommittee's budget resolution by claiming it ``shortchanges our \nnation's future.'' By reducing the debt, by preserving Social Security \nand Medicare, the plan actually plans for the future. Apparently, the \nonly problem for the President is that we could not keep the deal he \nsigned just last year--and that he wanted to spend, spend, spend, even \nmore than he agreed to last year.\n  A deal is a deal, Mr. President. I supported the bipartisan budget \nagreement last year. I will support this year's plan, too, since it \ncomplies with what we agreed to last year.\n  I do think there are a couple of areas where the budget resolution \ncan be fine-tuned. I emphasize that the amendments I will propose are \nfriendly amendments, intended to make a good budget plan better--not to \nattack it.\n  The first of these related to housing for elderly persons. The \nPresident's budget request proposed slashing this program by some $500 \nmillion. In a hearing before the VA/HUD subcommittee, Secretary Cuomo \ndid not explain why the administration is seeking this cut. Senator \nMikulski and I committed to restoring the cut funds to avoid \njeopardizing the supply of specialized rental housing for the elderly \npoor. We welcome the support of other Senators who share our concerns.\n  I comment on two particular points. Chairman Domenici has included an \nacceleration in the deductibility of health insurance for self-employed \npersons. This idea, which the full Budget Committee subsequently \nendorsed, is critical to achieving parity between self-employed persons \nand the people who work for the large competitors. I fought this battle \non the floor in the past session and in this session, and with the \ntremendous support of colleagues, we are moving in that direction. I \nthink it is good news that the budget now provides that we move that \nup.\n  I will offer one amendment now, and a second amendment I will propose \nwill nudge the Immigration and Naturalization Service to establish \ncircuit rides in the former Soviet Union to recognize the enormous cost \nimposed on refugees having to travel to Moscow. The amendment is a \nsense of the Senate, and it states that the budget resolution assumes \n$2 million in the INS budget.\n  Again, I emphasize that these are offered in a friendly and \ncooperative spirit, seeking to make a good budget resolution even \nbetter. The budget resolution reported from the Budget Committee is a \ndeal in which everybody wins, and I will be pleased to support it on \nthe floor as I did in committee.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2213\n\n  (Purpose: Sense of the Senate to fully fund the Section 202 Elderly \n                            Housing program)\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nmyself and the Senator from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, a sense of the \nSenate to urge we fund fully the section 202 Elderly Housing Program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], for himself and Ms. \n     Mikulski, proposes an amendment numbered 2213.\n\n  Mr. BOND. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       Insert on page 53, after line 22, the following new \n     section, to be renumbered, accordingly:\n\n     ``SEC. 317. SENSE OF THE SENATE TO MAINTAIN FULL FUNDING FOR \n                   THE SECTION 202 ELDERLY HOUSING PROGRAM.\n\n       ``(a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following--\n\n[[Page S2888]]\n\n       ``(1) The Section 202 Elderly Housing program is the most \n     important housing program for elderly, low-income Americans, \n     providing both affordable low-income housing and supportive \n     services designed to meet the special needs of the elderly.\n       ``(2) Since 1959, the Section 202 Elderly Housing program \n     has funded some 5,400 elderly housing projects with over \n     330,000 housing units, with the current average tenant in \n     Section 202 housing being a frail, older woman in her \n     seventies, living along with an income of less than $10,000 \n     per year.\n       ``(3) The combination of affordable housing and supportive \n     services under the Section 202 Elderly Housing program is \n     critical to promoting independent living, self-sufficiency, \n     and dignity for the elderly while delaying more costly \n     institutional care.\n       ``(4) There are over 1.4 million elderly Americans \n     currently identified as having ``worst case housing needs'' \n     and in need of affordable housing.\n       ``(5) There are 33 million Americans aged 65 and over, some \n     13 percent of all Americans. The number of elderly Americans \n     is anticipated to grow to over 69 million by the year 2030, \n     which would be some 20 percent of all Americans, and continue \n     to increase to almost 80 million by 2050.\n       ``(6) The President's Budget Request for fiscal year 1999 \n     proposes reducing funding for the Section 202 Elderly Housing \n     program from the fiscal year 1998 level of $645,000,000 to \n     $109,000,000 in fiscal year 1999. This represents a reduction \n     of over 83 percent in funding, which will result in reducing \n     the construction of Section 202 housing units from some 6,000 \n     units in fiscal year 1998 to only 1,500 units in fiscal year \n     1999.\n       ``(7) The full funding of the Section 202 Elderly Housing \n     program as an independent federal housing program is an \n     investment in our elderly citizens as well as our Nation.\n       ``(b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Section 202 Elderly Housing program, as provided \n     under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959, as amended, \n     shall be funded in fiscal years 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, and \n     2003 at not less than the fiscal year 1998 funding level of \n     $645,000,000.''.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Deja vu all over again. Senator Mikulski and I rise one \nmore time to fight to fulfill our commitment and the commitment of the \nSenate to fund fully the section 202 Elderly Housing Program at no less \nthan $645 million for each of the next 5 fiscal years.\n  I want to emphasize our commitment to this program and the elderly \nhousing as the chairman and ranking member of the VA/HUD Appropriations \nSubcommittee, the Appropriations subcommittee with the responsibility \nfor funding the section 202 Elderly Housing Program, as well as all \nother programs under the Department of Housing and Urban Development. \nThe purpose of this amendment is to set a floor of $645 million for the \nsection 202 Elderly Housing Program, the amount that Congress \nappropriated for this program for fiscal year 1998, as opposed to the \nPresident's budget request of $109 million for fiscal year 1999--a cut \nof over $500 million from this $645 million program. The President's \nbudget request is plainly wrong. I cannot state this in strong enough \nterms. We have an investment in the elderly and our Nation here just as \nwe must invest in the youth of this Nation through good education and \ngood, available health care. I want to be clear that we are not going \nto shortchange the elderly.\n\n  The section 202 Elderly Housing Program is the most important housing \nprogram for elderly low-income Americans, providing both affordable \nlow-income housing and supportive services designed to meet the special \nneeds of the elderly. This combination of supportive services and \naffordable housing is critical to promoting independent living, self-\nsufficiency and dignity, while delaying the more costly alternative of \ninstitutional care. Section 202 elderly housing is more than just \nhousing--it is a safety net for the elderly, providing both emotional \nand physical security and a sense of community.\n  Moreover, since the inception of the program in 1959, the section 202 \nElderly Housing Program has funded some 5,400 elderly housing projects \nwith over 330,000 units. Nevertheless, by the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development's own estimates, there are over 1.4 million elderly \nfamilies currently identified as having ``worst case housing needs'' \nand in need of affordable housing.\n  Despite the need for and the success of the section 202 Elderly \nHousing Program, the President proposes to slash funding for this \nprogram from $645 million in fiscal year 1998 to $109 million in fiscal \nyear 1999. This is a cut of over 83 percent in funding and will mean a \nreduction from building some 6,000 units with fiscal year 1998 funding \nto building only 1,500 units with the President's proposed fiscal year \n1999 funding. We cannot afford this critical loss of housing.\n  Moreover, the President is proposing to merge section 202 elderly \nhousing into the HOME program. I am a great supporter of the HOME \nprogram because it does a good job by providing affordable housing with \ndecisionmaking at the local level. But there is no rational \njustification for merging section 202 into the HOME program. Not only \nis section 202 extremely successful and critically needed, a recent \nGeneral Accounting Office report indicated that the HOME program has \nprovided few elderly housing units since enactment. In particular, from \nfiscal year 1992 through fiscal year 1996, over 1,400 section 202 \nelderly housing projects were developed with some 52,000 rental units \nfor over 47,800 elderly individuals. During that same 5-year time \nperiod, the HOME program produced 30 elderly housing projects with 681 \nunits which serve some 675 elderly individuals. In case you missed the \nfigures, section 202, in 5 years, provided 52,000 housing units; the \nHOME program provided 681 housing units.\n  However, the problem with the President's request does not stop here. \nThe President also requests funding for 8,800 vouchers for the elderly. \nOver the last several years, this administration repeatedly has \nattempted to voucher out assisted housing, including housing for the \nelderly. Vouchers are a very important housing tool and work well in \nmany instances, but the elderly deserve to have decent, safe, and \naffordable housing as well as needed supportive services. Section 202 \nelderly housing accomplishes these purposes, and vouchers do not.\n  Think with me for a moment about this recurring nightmare image I \nhave of an elderly woman in a walker with a voucher in her hand, \nsearching dark and dangerous streets for needed shelter. That is what \nthey are proposing we do. To put it in context, I remind my colleagues \nthat the average tenant in section 202 housing is a frail, older woman \nin her seventies, living alone, with an income of less than $10,000 per \nyear. Do we want to tell her to get out of the housing? Do we want to \nsay, ``Here is a voucher, start walking up and down the streets and \nmaybe a friend will go along and help you with your walker or push your \nwheelchair; you are going to have to hit the streets to find new \nhousing''? That is not a comforting image, but it is a compelling one.\n\n  Again, the need for section 202 elderly housing: There are currently \n33 million Americans aged 65 and over. This is some 13 percent of all \nAmericans. That number will grow to over 69 million elderly by the year \n2030, which would be some 20 percent of all Americans, and will \ncontinue to grow to almost 80 million elderly Americans by 2050. \nCutting back and remodeling the section 202 program will do these \nAmericans a disservice.\n  I cannot emphasize enough the importance of the section 202 Elderly \nHousing Program and the need for Congress to stand by elderly families. \nOver the years, millions of Federal dollars have been saved by \nproviding elderly families with access to supportive services in their \nhomes and their communities. Without this housing and these services, \nmany elderly persons and families would have had to be relocated to \nnursing homes and other institutions where care would be more costly \nand the loss of personal dignity more compelling.\n  Mr. President, as I close my remarks, I send to the desk a letter \nfrom AARP saying that the AARP opposes the President's recommendations \nconcerning section 202 housing and that the Bond-Mikulski floor \namendment is a crucial step along the way to press for current funding \nas the relevant appropriations measure works its way through Congress; \nI ask that it be printed in the Record.\n                                           American Association of\n\n\n                                              Retired Persons,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 30, 1998.\n     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: I am writing on behalf of the American \n     Association of Retired Persons to express our support of your \n     proposed amendment regarding supportive housing programs for \n     elderly and disabled persons when the Senate takes up the FY \n     1999 Budget Resolution this week. These initiatives make a \n     critical difference in the lives of many vulnerable Americans \n     throughout the\n\n[[Page S2889]]\n\n     nation. Given the continuing need for such specialized \n     housing, it is essential that appropriations are subsequently \n     preserved next year in both programs.\n       Living in Section 202 Elderly Housing means living at \n     affordable rents in a user-friendly environment with features \n     such as special lighting, nonskid floors, and grab bars that \n     prevent serious injuries from falls--features which can help \n     prevent early admission into a nursing home. Section 202 \n     helps meet an acute housing need for frail low income older \n     persons. An estimated eight persons, are waiting in line for \n     every one Section 202 vacancy that occurs. Meanwhile, many of \n     these individuals are forced to live an unsafe housing and in \n     crime-ridden neighborhoods--in some instances with windows \n     nailed shut--because they cannot afford to live anywhere \n     else.\n       The Association opposes the President's recommendations \n     concerning Section 202 Housing. We intend to press for \n     current funding throughout the year as the relevant \n     appropriations bill works its way through Congress. The Bond-\n     Mikulski floor amendment this week is a crucial step along \n     the way.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Horace B. Deets,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to stand today with my \ncolleague from Missouri and the chairman of the VA-HUD Subcommittee, \nSenator Bond, to offer a sense-of-the-Senate amendment to the fiscal \nyear 1999 budget.\n  This amendment is designed to state the Senate's view that it is \nabsolutely critical that HUD's section 202 program, which is its \nelderly housing program, absolutely be fully funded. That is what the \nresolution states. That is what I encourage the Members on both sides \nof the aisle to support.\n  For years, I have been an advocate for an affordable and available \nsupply of safe and decent housing for our elderly. For years, I have \nworked with Senator Bond to ensure adequate funding.\n  In 1992, as the chair of the VA-HUD Subcommittee, I worked to \nsuccessfully change the section 202 program from a very expensive loan \nprogram to a grant program. Do you know what? It allowed us to build \nmore housing for less cost. I am concerned, though, that there is in \nthe budget resolution a proposed cut of nearly $500 million in housing \nfor the elderly. I am also concerned about the desire to move to more \nof a voucher approach to elderly housing instead of new construction, \nforcing the senior citizens of this country who need a modest subsidy \nto go out and kind of forage on their own to find housing that meets \ntheir needs.\n  Mr. President, our Nation has many responsibilities, but its most \nimportant one is to protect and help all its citizens, but it has a \nparticular moral obligation to look out for senior citizens.\n  Promises made should be promises kept. This generation, which is now \nthe frail elderly, organized to save this country and to save Western \ncivilization during World War II. Many fought on the battlefront and \nmany were the ``Rosie the Riveters'' who helped this country on the \nhomefront. This is why we need to now look out for them as the frail \nelderly. The amendment I offer today with Senator Bond seeks to do \nthis. They are our mothers and fathers, who raised and nurtured us; our \naunts and uncles, who gave advice; and the neighbors who kept an eye on \nus; they are the people who we grew up with, who looked out for us in \nour communities; they are the people, in many cases who, with their \nblood, sweat and tears, helped build this country into what it is \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, we have the moral obligation to ensure that we do what \nwe can to ensure that those elderly citizens who need our help get our \nhelp.\n  The AARP estimates that there are eight people on the waiting list \nfor every one HUD section 202 unit that becomes available.\n  Senator Bond has put that into the Record.\n  Our subcommittee has done extensive research on this. What do we \nfind? First of all, that the secton 202 program is the most popular HUD \nhousing program we fund. Why is it popular? It meets compelling needs. \nIt often stabilizes neighborhoods where people are ``aging in place.'' \nIt also enables groups that are nonprofit and faith based to \nparticipate in providing housing. The section 202 Elderly Housing \nProgram is important because it meets those needs.\n  Since 1959, when this program was created under a whole other \ndifferent type of HUD, we have funded 5,004 elderly housing projects, \nwith over 330,000 housing units. They are primarily lived in by frail, \nolder women in their seventies living with an income of less than \n$10,000. I think that is a good way to spend taxpayer dollars.\n  The combination of affordable housing and supportive services under \nthe section 202 program has been absolutely critical in meeting not \nonly the housing needs but in promoting independent living, self-\nsufficiency, and dignity for the elderly, while delaying more costly \ninstitution.\n  There are 1.4 million elderly Americans who currently have worst-case \nhousing needs. There are 33 million Americans aged 65, over some 13 \npercent of all Americans, and this number is growing. That is why I \nhave asked HUD to come up with new ideas on how we are going to meet, \nNo. 1, the expanding elderly population, and, No. 2, the expanding \nfrail elderly population. I believe that if we focus our attention and \nour resources, we will meet our needs. This is why I support the Bond \namendment. It is the Mikulski-Bond amendment.\n  My colleague, Senator Sarbanes from Maryland, who is the ranking \nmember on the Housing and Banking Committee, also wants to be a \ncosponsor.\n  I will conclude my remarks by talking about the voucher program. This \nSenator is never going to support a voucher program for the elderly. I \nwill tell you why. When you are old, when you are sick, when you have a \npain, when you have a walker, when you have a wheelchair, when you can \nbarely read a newspaper without a magnifying glass, we are not going to \ngive you a voucher, and say, ``OK, kiddo, you are out there on your \nown.'' We are not going to do that. Senior citizens should not have to \ngo into the marketplace to forage with a voucher to find housing that \nwould meet their needs.\n  Mr. President, I know you have been in housing for the elderly in \nyour own State. They have special architectural needs--low steps and \nspecial kinds of grips in the bathroom--all those kinds of things that, \nif they fall, they don't fail. You just can't put them in any kind of \napartment in the United States of America; they have specialized needs. \nWe can meet those needs.\n  What is so fantastic--I cannot underestimate nor overstate the fact \nthat faith-based organizations are involved in this. In my home State, \nthe role of Catholic Charities, Associated Jewish Charities, and other \norganizations from the United Way step forward to make wise use of \nFederal funds and, at the same time, often value add to what the \nFederal Government is doing.\n  I really encourage my colleagues to support the Bond-Mikulski \namendment. It is cosponsored by Senator Sarbanes. I know that many \nothers will join us. This is one of many budget amendments stating \nsense-of-the-Senate resolutions. This, I think, is not only the sense \nof the Senate, Mr. President, it is the sense of the American people.\n  Senator John Kerry also wants to cosponsor it. Colleagues will be \nable to cosponsor it as we go forward.\n  I yield the floor on this amendment. I really encourage my colleagues \nto support it.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nMaryland, who has been a real champion in housing--housing for all \nkinds of people in need, but particularly housing for the elderly. I \nhad the pleasure of beginning my service on the VA-HUD committee under \nher chairmanship. She has been absolutely invaluable in helping to \nguide, teach, and cooperate with me as we moved forward. Her statement \non the importance of elderly housing is very compelling.\n\n  I hope that we will have overwhelming support on both sides of the \naisle for this amendment. Since some people are not getting the \nmessage, I ask that when a vote is scheduled on this amendment, that \nthe yeas and nays be requested.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair.\n\n[[Page S2890]]\n\n  I believe our message has not been getting across that elderly \nhousing works under the section 202 program. You can't expect elderly \nhousing to be covered by the HOME program where there are many \ncompeting local needs that must be met. Most of all, do not put \nGrandmother or Aunt Effie out on the street in her walker with a \nvoucher and expect that she is going to be able to find decent, \naffordable, appropriate housing.\n  We need an overwhelming vote. I welcome the fact that we have had a \nnumber of cosponsors. I hope we will have a unanimous vote, or an \noverwhelming vote, to express the sense of the Senate that we are not \ngoing to change this program. This is a program that is meeting the \nneeds of the elderly today. We must continue that program, because the \nneeds are only growing greater and we need to do all we can to try to \nkeep up with those needs.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I particularly thank my colleague \nfrom Maryland.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND.

Sense of the Senate supporting long-term \n     entitlement reforms.\n       (a) The Senate finds that the resolution assumes the \n     following--\n       (1) entitlement spending has risen dramatically over the \n     last thirty-five years.\n       (2) in 1963, mandatory spending (i.e. entitlement spending \n     and interest on the debt) made up 30 percent of the budget, \n     this figure rose to 45 percent by 1973, to 56 percent by 1983 \n     and to 61 percent by 1993.\n       (3) mandatory spending is expected to make up 68 percent of \n     the federal budget in 1998.\n       (4) absent changes, that spending is expected to take up \n     over 70 percent of the federal budget shortly after the year \n     2000 and 74 percent of the budget by the year 2008.\n       (5) if no action is taken, mandatory spending will consume \n     100 percent of the budget by the year 2030.\n       (3) this mandatory spending will continue to crowd out \n     spending for the traditional ``discretionary'' functions of \n     government like clean air and water, a strong national \n     defense, parks and recreation, education, our transportation \n     system, law enforcement, research and development and other \n     infrastructure spending.\n       (4) taking significant steps sooner rather than later to \n     reform entitlement spending will not only boost economic \n     growth in this country, it will also prevent the need for \n     drastic tax and spending decisions in the next century.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that that levels in this budget resolution assume that--\n       (1) Congress and the President should work to enact \n     structural reforms in entitlement spending in 1998 and beyond \n     which sufficiently restrain the growth of mandatory spending \n     in order to keep the budget in balance over the long term, \n     extend the solvency of the Social Security and Medicare Trust \n     Funds, avoid crowding out funding for basic government \n     functions and that every effort should be made to hold \n     mandatory spending to no more than seventy percent of the \n     budget.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, for the first time in a quarter century \nthis budget resolution is being debated in an environment, where rather \nthan talking about getting rid of the deficit, we are able to talk with \ngreat enthusiasm about what to do with the surplus. We are talking \nabout tax cuts and various spending programs. There is no question that \nthe recovery of the economy of the United States of America--deficit \nreduction efforts in the past in combination with tremendous changes on \nthe part of entrepreneurs and businesses and individuals out there--has \nproduced the best economic scene I have seen in my entire lifetime, \nwith increases in productivity, growth in the number of jobs, and a \nreduction in welfare rolls. You have to look long and hard to find bad \neconomic news out there.\n  In 1990, this Congress debated a deficit reduction act that was \nlargely a result of President Bush's leadership. We put in place at \nthat time the mechanism that we still use today. It has caps on \nspending that we, for the most part, have lived within. It is that \ndiscipline that is required by the law, it seems to me, that requires \nevery time somebody wants to do a new program, they have to find a way \nto pay for it. You just cannot come down here and throw new spending on \na budget or new tax cuts on a budget without having an offset \nsomeplace. It is that discipline,\n\n[[Page S2891]]\n\ncoupled with the 1993 act and the 1997 act, that I think the American \npeople appreciate very much. It has produced enormous benefits for the \nAmerican economy.\n  But we are now in a state where, unfortunately, rather than merely \ntalking about the easy things, we now need to start facing some very \ndifficult problems that are occurring inside the budget itself. One of \nthe things I find comforting in life is when things don't change. The \nmost impressive force of all in that regard is gravity. It has an \nincreasing impact upon me, my body, and my ability to move and so \nforth. It stays constant. I am impressed with it.\n  One of the things that stayed constant over the last 30 or 40 years, \nindeed a bit longer than that, is that the percent of the entire GDP \nthat we in Washington, DC, use for a variety of spending programs has \nstayed relatively constant--in the 19 to 20 percent range. This does \nnot go all the way back to the years of the 1940s when, during the war, \nwe went up above that 20 percent mark; but in the 1940s, most of that \nspending was for plant, for equipment, increases in the productivity of \nthis Nation. Indeed, many have cited that as a principal reason the \nUnited States of America came out of the Great Depression, the \nsignificant investments that occurred during those war years. So you \nsee that 20 percent figure stayed relatively constant over that lengthy \nperiod of time.\n  This resolution that I have offered up requires us, the Congress, \nwith a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, to look out in the future more \nthan the 10-year budget window that we currently do. You may say why, \nMr. President. The reason is that if you look out for 10 years, from \n1998 to 2008, that takes you just before the baby boom generation \nbegins to retire. You look out to 2008 and life looks relatively good. \nIt doesn't look very difficult. It looks like we ought to be able to \nmanage relatively easily, and the reason it looks like it is going to \nbe relatively easy is that the number of the Americans over age 65 \ngrows relatively steadily, from about 34 million to about 39 million in \n2008. But, from 2010 to 2030, the number of people over age 65 grows by \n30 million. The number of retirees will increase by 25 million while \nthe number of workers only increases 4 million.\n  What happens during that period of time is that the mandatory \nprograms--that is the red, or the entitlement spending; and the yellow \nis the net interest, the interest on the national debt--they continue \nto grow until they completely displace the entire Federal budget, until \nit is 100 percent of the budget at that point. Indeed, in the year \n2027, 100 percent of the budget will be mandatory spending programs.\n  This is a trend. I heard some--perhaps most notably former Secretary \nof Labor Robert Reich, who is on from time to time--criticizing this \nevaluation, saying there are going to be increases in productivity or \nimmigration or other things that are going to take care of it. But it \nhas not taken care of it yet.\n\n  In 1963, John Kennedy went to Rice University. He gave a speech in \nthe summer of 1963 in which he said that we were going to put a man on \nthe Moon. Why? He said not because it is easy but because it is hard.\n  In 1963, 70 percent of this budget was discretionary and only 30 \npercent of the budget was mandatory. In 1973, it had grown to 45 \npercent mandatory; in 1983, 56 percent mandatory; in 1993, 61 percent \nmandatory. And in this budget, 68 percent of the budget is mandatory \nand 32 percent of the budget is discretionary.\n  Even over the next 10 years, the amount that is available for \ndiscretionary--and we allow it actually in the second 5 years to grow \nat the rate of inflation, which is not likely unless we are going to \nbust the caps in the second 5 years--at the end of that 10-year period, \nthe amount available for discretionary spending will be approximately \n26 percent.\n  I ask any of my colleagues what that 26 percent figure means. If you \nbudget it this year and say we are going to give the Appropriations \nCommittee 26 percent of available revenue to appropriate, that will \nforce approximately $115 billion in spending cuts.\n  What is happening is that we are seeing our capacity to build our \nNation's defenses, I say to the distinguished occupant of the Chair, \nwho has talked about how our military is being spread pretty thin--it \nis spread pretty thin right now. We debate from time to time new things \nwe want our military to do. Both our military and intelligence efforts \nare stretched substantially thin at the moment. But that is not the \nonly area in discretionary spending where people come to the floor and \nwould like to spend more money, whether it is on education, on health \ncare, or the environment, or NASA, or Veterans Administration. On all \nthese things, they may come down and say, ``We have to fight the battle \nagainst crime, we need more people on our border, we a stronger law \nenforcement effort.'' All of these Federal efforts come out of \ndiscretionary spending.\n  Unless we as a Congress begin to understand these trends and the fact \nthat they are not going to go away, it is not likely we are going to do \nanything about it. I observe the reason we are not doing anything about \nit, the reason we are not debating it on this floor, is we only have a \n10-year view.\n  The law says to take a look at 10 years--what does it look like in 10 \nyears? Life looks pretty good. It looks like we can handle it. I \nchallenge anybody to construct a discretionary budget with only 26 \npercent available revenue. Unless we believe this Congress is going to \nraise taxes beyond the 20 percent mark--which I don't think it either \nwill or should--what we are faced with, even at 26 percent, is, it \nseems to me, the unlikelihood of being able to construct a budget with \nthat relatively small amount.\n  Unless we look out to 30 years instead of 10 years, we do not see \nthis crisis coming, we do not see the problem coming.\n  So what do we do? We do nothing. We do not even debate it or talk \nabout it. Most of us have seen the movie ``Titanic.'' In the movie, \npeople were on the bow, standing watch for icebergs, and they did not \nhave binoculars. It is very much like us. We do not have binoculars \neither. We can see 10 years, but we cannot see 30. As a consequence, we \ndo not see the iceberg that is out there in the form and shape of the \nbaby-boom generation which, from 2010 to 2030, will convert 100 percent \nof the available money we will tax and collect from the American \npeople--100 percent of that budget is going to go to mandatory \nprograms.\n  There is a price, a big price, for delay, and the price will be paid \nby the baby-boom generation, who will find themselves saying suddenly, \n``Oh, my gosh, I have two choices: Either I take substantial cuts in my \ncurrent benefits or my kids have a tax increase'' that raises their \ntaxes beyond what is, I think, by any standard, a reasonable level. We \nwill see demands on this system, in short, Mr. President, that are \ngoing to put us in a position where we are going to have to ask current \nbeneficiaries, if we do not make reasonable adjustments today, to pay a \nrather substantial price.\n\n  I know the distinguished Senator from New Mexico has talked about \nthis an awful lot. In fact, he can blame himself for me caring about \nentitlements. It was he and Senator Nunn who used to traipse down here \nonce a year and offer amendments. The first time the Senator from New \nMexico offered an amendment to control entitlement spending, I voted \nagainst it. The second year, the light bulb went on, and I said, ``Oh, \nmy gosh, this guy from New Mexico might have something right.'' And, \nindeed, he persuaded me the second year, and I voted with him.\n  In 1994, Senator Jack Danforth and I chaired a commission for an \nentire year looking at the problems of entitlements, and I have not \nbeen the same since. I annoy people; I frustrate people. They can ask \nme what do I think about the weather, do I think Nebraska is going to \nhave a good football team, and as soon as I talk about the weather and \nour great football team, I find myself immediately talking about the \nproblem of mandatory spending and what it is going to do to our \ncapacity to say that we are securing the blessings of liberty for \nourselves and posterity.\n  We are squandering, it seems to me, an opportunity to say we are \nendowing our future, and instead we are putting ourselves in a position \nof saying, ``Make certain I get my deal covered, that I get what I am \nentitled to, and the heck with the future; don't worry about our \nkids.''\n\n[[Page S2892]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 2215\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding passage of the \n               IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1997)\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I send an additional amendment to the desk \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). Without objection, the pending \namendment will be set aside. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I will talk for 1 minute. I see the \ndistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee on the floor. This is \nan amendment that this body ought to act on IRS reform legislation \nprior to our leaving for the recess.\n  I believe this legislation has been considered long and hard. The \ntaxpayers have a deadline of April 15; 120 million of them will have to \nfile their taxes. We need to pass IRS legislation without delay. We \nneed to give taxpayers new powers. I note with considerable interest \nthat every single freshman in the House sent a letter yesterday to \nMajority Leader Lott and to Democratic Leader Daschle asking that the \nHouse bill, or something that can be conferenced, be taken up before we \nleave.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 1, 1998.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Senate Majority Leader, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Senate Minority Leader, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Lott and Minority Leader Daschle: As \n     April 15 approaches, this letter is to urge in the strongest \n     possible terms the United States Senate to pass sound \n     legislation to reform the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).\n       As first-term Representatives of the American people from \n     both political parties, we agree that the Congress must give \n     the highest priority to reforming the IRS. Hearings conducted \n     in the House and Senate have made us all too aware of the \n     horror stories of the average American taxpayer being \n     harassed by rogue IRS agents. We believe it is time that the \n     IRS worked for American taxpayers instead of assuming they \n     are guilty of cheating on their taxes.\n       As you know, on November 5, 1997, the House overwhelmingly \n     passed historic legislation to reform the IRS. This bill \n     incorporates recommendations by the bipartisan National \n     Commission to Restructure the IRS chaired by Senator J. \n     Robert Kerrey and Representative Rob Portman. H.R. 2676, the \n     IRS Restructuring and Reform Act, would shift the burden of \n     proof from the taxpayer to the IRS, create twenty-eight new \n     taxpayer provisions in a Taxpayer Bill of Rights, and \n     overhaul the management of the agency through the creation of \n     an eleven-member independent Oversight Board.\n       With your leadership, we have the opportunity to provide \n     the comprehensive reform of the IRS the American people \n     deserve. We urge the Senate to adhere to the will of the \n     American taxpayer, honor the work of the bipartisan \n     commission, and join the House in passing IRS reform without \n     further delay.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bob Etheridge,\n     John Shimkus,\n                                              Members of Congress.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the taxpayers of the United States have a \ndeadline of April 15. All of us know it. We hear about it when we go \nhome. As I said, 120 million people have to have their taxes filed by \nApril 15. There are 140,000 collection notices that go out every single \nday of the week. Every single working day that the IRS is in operation, \n140,000 collection notices go out.\n  There are approximately the same number of Americans who call the IRS \nevery day. The way it currently operates is, about 40 percent of them \ncannot get through, and of those who do get through, about 25 percent \nof them get the wrong answer.\n  There are many other reasons for to get the laws governing the IRS \nchanged, and get them changed soon. My hope is that the chairman of the \nFinance Committee and the ranking member will meet as quickly as \npossible with Mr. Archer, Mr. Rangel, and Mr. Rubin. Let's get this \nbill conferenced as quickly as possible so that the American taxpayers, \nwho have waited an awful long time for this piece of legislation, will \nget the power they deserve--indeed, the power they need--in order for \nthem to have confidence that this is still Government of, by, and for \nthe people.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for this wonderful opportunity to speak, \nand I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Kerrey] proposes an \n     amendment No. 2215.\n\n  The amendment follows:\n\n       At the end of Title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING PASSAGE OF THE IRS \n                   RESTRUCTURING AND REFORM ACT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) The House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed IRS \n     Reform Legislation, (H.R. 2676), on November 5, 1997.\n       (2) The IRS Restructuring and Reform Act has the potential \n     to benefit 120 million Americans by simplifying the tax \n     process and making the IRS more responsive to taxpayer \n     concerns;\n       (3) The President has announced that he would sign H.R. \n     2676;\n       (4) The Senate plans to recess without considering \n     legislation to reform the IRS.\n       (5) The American people are busy preparing their taxes to \n     meet the April 15th deadline. They do not get to recess \n     before filing their returns; and\n       (5) Senators should keep their commitment to take up and \n     pass IRS reform legislation before they recess.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying the functional totals in this budget resolution \n     assume that the Senate shall not recess until it has \n     considered and voted on H.R. 2676, the IRS Restructuring and \n     Reform Act of 1997.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I inform the Senator that we are willing \nto accept his previous sense-of-the-Senate amendment, and we have \nSenator Burns' amendment. I would like to accept them now and then go \non to the Senator's second amendment. Is that satisfactory?\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I will allow them merely to be accepted. I \nwas going to ask for a rollcall vote on mine. At some point, my fear \nis, without a rollcall vote, I say to the distinguished Senator and \nchairman of the committee, it doesn't necessarily focus people's \nattention as much as it should. I am not sure it will by making them \nvote either, for that matter.\n  I know the chairman of this committee is very enthusiastic about this \nissue and has spent a lot of time on it as well. I just think this \nwhole budget deliberation occurs in a never-never land where we are \ntalking about surpluses and talking about how good everything is and we \nliterally are ignoring this enormous problem.\n  As I said, the people who are going to suffer the most are that baby-\nboom generation, and they will find themselves in a heck of a dilemma \nif we do not act sooner than later. I appreciate the Senator's \nwillingness to accept my amendment and Senator Burns' amendment. I \nagree to allow that to go forward.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 2214\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 2214.\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2214) was agreed to.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 2178\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, there is pending an amendment No. 2178 \nby Senator Burns. There is no objection on this side and, I understand, \nno objection on the Democrat side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the \namendment.\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2178) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote on the two amendments, en \nbloc.\n  Mr. ROTH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wonder if Senator Lautenberg would \njoin me in just a discussion of where we are. And, obviously, I will \nyield the floor. I understand the distinguished chairman of the Finance \nCommittee wants to speak. I yield myself time off the budget \nresolution.\n  Mr. President, fellow Senators, I understand we have one vote \nscheduled on or in relationship to the Kyl amendment at 12 o'clock. The \ndistinguished\n\n[[Page S2893]]\n\nSenator is here. He would like to speak for 1 minute, and there will be \n1 minute in opposition. I make that request and ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to just tell Senators that we now have \nabout 29 amendments that are pending, for all intents and purposes. I \nconsider that everybody wants a vote on them, although I hope not. And \nwe still have about 18 hours, so there is plenty of time for more \namendments. And, frankly, I just hope everybody understands that today \nis Wednesday, tomorrow is Thursday, the next day is Friday.\n  I think that everybody should share with me some concern about \nwhether we can finish this resolution unless there is some cooperation \nwith reference to amendments. I do not ask anything of anyone \nspecifically at this point, but I hope and I urge that, if there are \nmore amendments, you start getting them in to us. There is no time by \nwhich you are bound, but I urge that, if you have additional amendments \nor second-degree amendments, you let us see them. I am sure my friend \nfrom New Jersey will join me in that. At some point we have to try to \nmake a little sense of the process on this to see if we can get this \nwork done in a timely manner.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The chairman of the Budget Committee neglected to \nmention the fact that voting time is not included in the calculation of \nthe remaining hours.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Right.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That is extra time. So if we have 29 or 30 votes, and \neven if we were able by some stretch of the imagination to reduce that \nto 15 minutes, you are talking about more than 7 hours added to the--\nhow much time do we have remaining, may I ask?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eighteen hours remaining.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Eighteen. So we would be looking at prospectively 25 \nhours or more. So I say to all of our colleagues on both sides, get \nthem in here and let us try to get action done on them. If a rollcall \nvote can be dispensed with, it will make a huge difference in what time \nwe conclude our business for this week, reminding everyone, all those \nwhose memory is bad and can't recall, the fact that the recess begins \nfor 2 weeks, in case anybody has forgotten, and should we want to hang \nin through Friday or whatever or however long, I understand we are \ngoing to get this done.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We could stay in here very late tonight, into the \nmorning and that would put us on a path to where we could start voting \nand we could see some daylight.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2169\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am going to yield the floor, but I \nwant to make a parliamentary inquiry. Would the regular order bring the \nKyl amendment now to the Senate?\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Kyl amendment is \nin order. The Senator from Arizona is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Let me take about 30 seconds and then see if anyone on the other side \nwishes to speak to this. This is a very simple sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution, and I will read you what the sense is. I cannot imagine \npeople would oppose this principle.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that seniors have the right to \n     see the physician or health care provider of their choice, \n     and not be limited in such right by the imposition of \n     unreasonable conditions on providers who are willing to treat \n     seniors on a private basis. . .\n\n  Mr. President, there are a lot of details in legislation that might \nultimately be passed that we can argue about, but I think there is no \ndoubt that in expressing the principle, we can all be in agreement that \njust because one turns 65 and is eligible for Medicare does not mean \nthey lose the right to see the physician of their own choice.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and will see if \nthere is anyone who wishes to speak in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I understand we have 1 minute in response.\n  Let me just say, this is not in any way, shape or form an amendment \ndesigned to provide patients with more choice. This will leave seniors \ntotally uncertain about what their Medicare will cover and let doctors \ndetermine the degree of Medicare coverage each beneficiary will have. \nThat is what this is about: Jeopardizing patients' rights, putting them \nin a very uncertain set of circumstances, taking away the certainty and \nthe confidence they have when they are in a doctor's office or in a \nhospital or in an operating room that Medicare will pay their bills. \nLet us not jeopardize those patients' rights or their confidence when \nthey are sick that the Medicare Program is working for them.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to express my support for Senator \nKyl's amendment establishing a sense of the Congress regarding Medicare \nbeneficiaries freedom to privately contract with physicians. I \nunderstand there has been a lot of misinformation about private \ncontracting and the Balanced Budget Act provision. But the fundamental \nissue behind this debate has always been clear. What this really boils \ndown to is what is the appropriate role of the government. And I just \ndon't believe that the federal government should tell seniors how they \ncan or cannot spend their own hard earned money. While the Balanced \nBudget Act allows private contracting on a limited basis, most \nbeneficiaries will not have this freedom because physicians who \nprivately contract will have to opt out of the Medicare program for 2 \nyears. Most physicians won't be able to do that, and most beneficiaries \nwould not want their doctor to do this. Therefore, I support the Kyl \namendment to give seniors the freedom of choice to privately contract.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, this past New Year rang in a harsh \nreality for senior citizens of America: As of January 1, 1998, senior \ncitizens, for all practical purposes, have been stripped of a health \ncare right afforded to any other insured American--the right to pay \nout-of-pocket for the doctor of their choice.\n  I am outraged over this provision--a provision that was added into \nthe Balanced Budget Act of 1997 in the twelfth hour of negotiations \nbetween the White House and Congress.\n  The provision prohibits doctors who privately contract from treating \nMedicare patients for a period of two years. Therefore, it is now \nunlawful for a doctor to take a private payment from a Medicare-\neligible patient if during the previous two years he has billed \nMedicare for any service rendered to a patient over the age of 65.\n  What is the reality of the provision? The reality is that it will be \nalmost impossible for a senior citizen to contract privately for \nmedical services because few or no physicians are going to be able to \nmake ends meet if they can't accept Medicare patients for two years. \nThe reality is that, unlike every other insured American, senior \ncitizens have now lost a significant right--a right of choice in who \nprovides their health care.\n  Currently seniors are being prohibited from going outside of the \nMedicare system for procedures that are not covered by Medicare. For \nexample, if a senior fell and broke his hip, Medicare only reimburses \nfor the lowest-cost hip prosthesis. Since seniors cannot pay extra to \nupgrade, they must settle for lower quality. (Private contracting would \nenable them to opt for quality.)\n  Why is the federal government making that decision for seniors? If a \n75-year-old women in Fairbanks, Alaska, fell and broke her hip, do you \nthink that the government is competent enough to decide what hip \nprosthesis is best for her to gain the best mobility for the rough \nweather conditions of Fairbanks?\n  Last week I turned 65 years old. The week before--when I was still 64 \nyears old--I could choose any doctor I wanted and pay for that doctor \nin any manner I wanted. But now I'm 65, and the federal government is \nsuddenly telling me I can't make my own medical decisions--that I no \nlonger may enter into a private contract with my doctor.\n  Mr. President, I ask you, isn't this a form of age discrimination \nagainst seniors? How can the Health Care Financing Administration \nrestrict such a fundamental liberty--the freedom to\n\n[[Page S2894]]\n\nchoose the care and quality of health providers?\n  The need for a senior citizen to be able to privately contract is \nmagnified in Alaska. Alaska has no HMOs, physician shortages exist in \ntwo-thirds of the state and health care costs that are on average 70 \npercent higher than the rest of the country.\n  All these factors combine to create a system where doctors can't \nafford to treat Medicare patients--which means that patient choice for \nAlaskan seniors is extremely limited. I've received letters from \nAlaskans who have been turned down by three or four physicians--because \nthe doctors cannot afford new Medicare patients.\n  I am pleased with Senator Kyl's sense of Congress--I believe it is an \nimportant stand for Congress to make. The body must do all it can to \nensure that Medicare-eligible beneficiaries who choose to pay out of \npocket will have an unrestricted right to health care.\n  Mr. President, even in the socialized medical system of Great \nBritain, choice is offered to the elderly. In Great Britain, a senior \ncitizen has the choice to pay privately for his or her medical \nservices. Don't the elderly of America deserve that same choice?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I rise to express my opposition to \nSenator Kyl's sense of the Senate Amendment to the Budget Resolution. \nWhile this amendment raises important concerns about the scope of \nseniors' choices in determining their personal health care needs, this \nproposal may actually restrict the health care options available to our \nnation's senior citizens and undermine the quality of care afforded all \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  Initially, Senator Kyl's amendment simply seems to endorse the \nimportant role of choice for seniors when making critical decisions \nabout their personal health. I strongly support efforts to increase the \nhealth care options available to Medicare beneficiaries and improve the \nquality of health care that seniors receive. However, this amendment \nwould move us in the wrong direction. With approximately 96 percent of \nphysicians treating Medicare patients presently, choice of physicians \ndoes not appear to be a problem for Medicare beneficiaries. In reality, \nMedicare allows seniors to choose the doctor of their choice along with \nproviding protections that shield Medicare beneficiaries from \nunnecessarily high out-of-pocket costs. Ironically, in many ways, \nSenator Kyl's amendment is a problem in search of a solution.\n  Senator Kyl's legislation specifically supports private contracting \nbetween physicians and patients for services traditionally covered by \nMedicare. By allowing doctor's to privately contract for these \nservices, this amendment could effectively remove consumer protections \ndesigned to protect seniors' from excessive out-of-pocket costs. These \nprotections are critically important to the elderly who rely on the \naffordable and high-quality care that Medicare provides. Private-\ncontracting for Medicare-covered services would cause seniors to pay \n100 percent of any given health care service or benefit. Few seniors \ncan afford or have any desire to pay, such exorbitantly high-rates. It \nis also important to note that seniors' are perfectly free to contract \nprivately with their doctor on health care benefits not covered by \nMedicare such as routine physical exams, eye care, and prescription \ndrugs. However, by permitting doctors to charge their Medicare patients \nwhatever they wish for Medicare-covered health care services, we would \nbe subjecting seniors' to unnecessarily high-out of pocket costs and \nwould compromise the quality of care afforded to all Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  I am also deeply concerned that this initiative would create a two-\ntiered health care system for the elderly, threatening the quality of \ncare afforded all Medicare beneficiaries. Private contracting could \ncreate an incentive for wealthier and healthier beneficiaries to opt \nout of the Medicare program. This could lead to a health care system \nthat provides high-quality coverage to those seniors' who could afford \nthe high out-of-pocket costs associated with private-contracting, while \nleaving the majority of Medicare beneficiaries with substandard care. \nAlmost 70 percent of Medicare beneficiaries have an annual income under \n$25,000. It is simply unconscionable for these seniors of modest means \nto be subject to paying 100 percent of their health care bill to \nservices that are normally covered under the Medicare program. \nAdditionally, the implementation of a private-contracting system would \nprovide an incentive for doctor's to give priority to those Medicare \nbeneficiaries who can afford to pay for it at the expense of providing \nquality and affordable care to the majority of Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Additionally, the Kyl amendment would offer the potential for \nincreased fraud and abuse within the Medicare program. The Medicare \nsystem is already fraught with staggering levels of fraud and abuse. \nAccording to the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services, $23.2 billion annually is wasted on fraud and abuse in \nthe Medicare program. Given the financial challenges that face the \nMedicare program in the near future, this level of abuse in \nunacceptable. Allowing physicians to set their own payment rates for \ncertain patients, while simultaneously permitting them to submit claims \nto Medicare for the treatment of traditional Medicare beneficiaries for \nthe very same procedures, would create the opportunity for double \nbilling, a serious form of fraud and abuse. While we should be moving \nto prevent fraud and abuse in the Medicare system, private contracting \nwould offer the potential for increased fraud in the Medicare system.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes. I want to point out that the pending amendment \nis not germane, and I raise a point of order that the amendment \nviolates section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is not sustained.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Might I inquire, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has some 20 seconds.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you.\n  I want to respond to the distinguished minority leader.\n  It is true that legislation that would actually change the law would \ncertainly have to consider all kinds of issues dealing with fraud and \nabuse and similar questions that the distinguished minority leader has \nraised. We can have that debate at the time such legislation might come \nbefore us.\n  What is before us today is simply a sense of the Senate, an \nexpression of a principle that it is the sense of Congress that seniors \nhave the right to see the physician or health care provider of their \nchoice. I hope we can at least agree on that basic principle.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to amendment \nNo. 2169, the Kyl amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, before we call the roll, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senator from Washington be able to send up \ntwo amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON EXPANDING MEDICARE BENEFITS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) In the 1997 Balanced Budget Agreement, changes were \n     made to Medicare that extended the solvency of the Trust Fund \n     for 10 years.\n       (2) The Medicare Commission, also established in the \n     Balanced Budget Agreement, has just started the task of \n     examining the Medicare program in an effort to make sound \n     policy recommendations to Congress and the Administration \n     about what needs to be done to ensure that Medicare is \n     financially prepared to handle the added burden when the baby \n     boomers begin retiring.\n       (3) The problems facing Medicare are not about more \n     revenues. The program needs to do more to improve the health \n     care status of retirees and give them more choices and better \n     information to make wise consumer decisions when purchasing \n     health care services.\n       (4) Improving the health care status of senior citizens \n     would ensure additional savings for Medicare. Helping seniors \n     stay healthier should be a priority of any legislation aimed \n     at protecting Medicare.\n       (5) In order to keep seniors healthier, Medicare has to \n     become more prevention based. Currently, Medicare offers very \n     few prevention benefits. As a result, seniors are often \n     sicker when they seek care or are hospitalized.\n       (6) If the objective is to use tobacco revenues to save \n     Medicare, a portion of these new revenues must be allocated \n     to expanding prevention benefits.\n       (7) Preventing illnesses or long hospital stays or repeated \n     hospital stays will save Medicare dollars.\n       (8) Medicare cannot be saved without structural changes and \n     reforms. Simply using a new Federal tax to prop up Medicare \n     will not extend solvency much beyond a few months and will do \n     little to improve the health status of senior citizens and \n     the disabled.\n       (9) Congress should use these new revenues to expand \n     prevention benefits to ensure that seniors are healthier and \n     stronger. This is how we can truly save Medicare.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals underlying this resolution assume \n     the allocation of a portion of the Federal share of tobacco \n     revenues to expand prevention benefits for Medicare \n     beneficiaries with an emphasis on improving the health status \n     of Medicare beneficiaries and providing long term savings to \n     the program.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the two amendments are laid \naside.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 2169\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 51, nays 47, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 53 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--51\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--47\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kerrey\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n       \n  The amendment (No. 2169) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this is not aimed at any Senator or group of \nSenators, but it is so that we will all be on notice. In order to be \nable to complete this budget resolution, we are going to have to stick \nto the 15 minute-votes. I realize that there are markups going on and \nSenators have a lot of commitments, but for the remainder of today--\nSenator Daschle and I have talked about this--we think it is important \nwe begin to stick to 15-minute votes or 10-minute votes if we have in a \ngroup stacked votes, so we will start sticking pretty close to the time \nthat is allocated.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. LOTT. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. FORD. We are in a major markup in the Commerce Committee, and if \nthere is any way you could stack a vote or two to let us come over and \nspend a few minutes and make several votes and then go back to the \ncommittee, I think it might be helpful, rather than having us run back \nand forth. There is hope we might be able to finish that markup, if not \nlate tonight, tomorrow. I am not asking to change your schedule or your \nvotes, just group them together sometime, if you could.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could say to the Senator from Kentucky, \nthey are certainly involved in very important work, and we will take \nthat into consideration. As a matter of fact, we are going to enter a \nunanimous consent request that would allow us to stack some votes. \nSenator Daschle had suggested that, and it seems like a good way to \nproceed where we will have up to as many as, I think, four votes that \nare stacked.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LOTT. Would the Democratic leader like to make a comment before I \nmake the UC?\n  In order to ascertain the remaining workload then ahead of us to \nbring the budget resolution to conclusion, I now ask unanimous consent \nthat all first-degree amendments must be offered by 6 p.m. this \nevening. I further ask that at 5:40 p.m. this evening the minority \nmanager be recognized to offer any amendments necessary for the \nminority side of the aisle, and at 5:50 p.m. Senator Domenici be \nrecognized for up to 10 minutes to offer amendments necessary at that \npoint for the majority side.\n  I further ask that following the scheduled 2 p.m. vote today, all \nfirst-degree amendments be limited to 30 minutes, all second-degree \namendments be limited to 20 minutes, with any votes ordered on any \nremaining amendments to be stacked in a sequence to be decided by the \ntwo managers. I further ask that the first vote in the stacked voting \nsequence be limited to 15 minutes and all remaining votes in the \nsequence be reduced to 10 minutes in length.\n  We hope they will stack as many as three and four in those groupings. \nBut it will be up to them, after, of course, consulting with the \nleaders, to make sure we are taking into consideration other things \nthat may be going on.\n  I finally ask that all time consumed during rollcall votes be counted \nagainst the overall statutory time limit and the new time restraints on \nfirst- and second-degree amendments expire at the conclusion or \nyielding back of the overall time limit.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and\n\n[[Page S2896]]\n\nI will not object--I just want to make certain that the time agreement \nwith regard to the schools amendment has been unchanged.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is correct.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. That is correct.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair hears no objection, and it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I didn't want to object, and I was going \nto make that clarification following the conclusion of the request, but \nI would only add one clarification, which I know the majority leader \nwill want to do, and that is to allow 1 minute prior to each vote in a \nstacked sequence, to be sure that we can explain the circumstances, as \nis normally our procedure in stacked votes. I know that colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle have requested that in the past.\n  With that understanding and also with the understanding, of course, \nthat Senator Moseley-Braun would then be recognized following this UC \nto offer her amendment, I think this is a good plan and I commend all \nof those involved, especially our Chair and ranking member. Obviously, \nwe won't get done with this unless we can find a way in which to manage \nmore efficiently the time remaining. This does it, and I appreciate the \ncooperation of Members on both sides.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do amend the unanimous consent request to \ninclude the 1 minute before each vote and ask for a ruling now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I just ask--everybody might want \nto know this--if in fact we don't complete all the amendments under the \nprescription we have just agreed to, then if there are remaining \namendments, this agreement does not pertain to this at all, that will \nbe looked at by the Senate; we will get it done one way or another?\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct. I think this is a very major step forward. \nWe will still need to assess where we are tonight and in the morning. \nAny amendments still pending at the end, we will still have to deal \nwith those in as orderly a fashion as we possibly can. But I think this \nwill help us move a number of amendments so that we won't have as many \namendments at the end of the session.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished majority \nleader and the minority leader for helping with this. Obviously, this \nis a much more orderly process, and I think it has a chance of working \nto the enhancement of the Senate's ability to do this work right.\n  I understand that the distinguished Senator from Illinois is going to \ncall up an amendment, after which she is going to yield promptly so \nthat Senator Roth might speak for a few minutes, and then it will \nreturn to her for control of her time and we will have time on our \nside.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Yes. I say to the Senator from New Mexico, I have \nbeen asked by the Senator from Delaware and the Senator from North \nDakota as well as Senator Roth--all three have business they would like \nto attend to before this amendment is taken up, and so I would suggest \nto the Senator from New Mexico that might be appropriate--let all three \nSenators go before this amendment is taken up.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is fine with me. I thought the minority leader had \nasked me to call her amendment up and then go ahead and yield this \ntime. But if you want to do it another way--Senator Roth, are you \nsatisfied?\n  Mr. ROTH. I want to speak next.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would it be possible that we could agree then that if \nyou are going to withhold until the following events occur, that \nSenator Roth be permitted to speak for 15 minutes? But he would be \npreceded by two Senators who want to just offer amendments.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, I need 5 seconds, 10 seconds \npossibly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is that possible?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I clarify. I would like 5 seconds as \nwell to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nDakota.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 2218 and 2219\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendment be set aside that I may send two amendments to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes \n     amendments numbered 2218 and 2219.\n\n  The text of the amendments follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2218\n\n  (Purpose: To strike section 301 of the concurrent resolution, which \n expresses the sense of Congress regarding the sunset of the Internal \n  Revenue Code of 1986, and replace it with a section expressing the \n   sense of Congress that important tax incentives such as those for \n  encouraging home ownership and charitable giving should be retained)\n\n       Strike page 33, line 3, through page 34, line 3, and insert \n     the following:\n\n     SEC. 301. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE TAX TREATMENT OF HOME \n                   MORTGAGE INTEREST AND CHARITABLE GIVING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) current Federal income tax laws embrace a number of \n     fundamental tax policies including longstanding encouragement \n     for home ownership and charitable giving;\n       (2) the mortgage interest deduction is among the most \n     important incentives in the income tax code and promotes the \n     American Dream of home ownership--the single largest \n     investment for most families, and preserving it is critical \n     for the more than 20,000,000 families claiming it now and for \n     millions more in the future;\n       (3) favorable tax treatment to encourage gifts to charities \n     is a longstanding principle that helps charities raise funds \n     needed to provide services to poor families and others when \n     government is simply unable or unwilling to do so, and \n     maintaining this tax incentive will help charities raise \n     money to meet the challenges of their charitable missions in \n     the decades ahead;\n       (4) legislation has been proposed to repeal the entire \n     income tax code at the end of the year 2001 without providing \n     a specific replacement; and\n       (5) recklessly sunsetting the entire income tax code \n     threatens our Nation's future economic growth and unwisely \n     eliminates existing tax incentives that are crucial for \n     taxpayers who are often making the most important financial \n     decisions of their lives.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the levels in this resolution assume that Congress supports \n     the continued tax deductibility of home mortgage interest and \n     charitable contributions.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2219\n\n   (Purpose: To establish a reserve fund for health research at the \n    National Institutes of Health, funded by receipts from tobacco \n                              legislation)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the resolution, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.  .

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside for the purpose of offering an amendment, which \nI send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl], for himself, Mr. Grams, \n     Mr. Helms, Mr. Brownback, and Mr. Hagel, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2221.\n\n  The text of the amendment follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING A SUPERMAJORITY \n                   REQUIREMENT FOR RAISING TAXES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Nation's current tax system is indefensible, being \n     overly complex, burdensome, and severely limiting to economic \n     opportunity for all Americans;\n       (2) fundamental tax reform should be undertaken as soon as \n     practicable to produce a tax system that--\n       (A) applies a low tax rate, through easily understood laws, \n     to all Americans;\n       (B) provides tax relief for working Americans;\n       (C) protects the rights of taxpayers and reduces tax \n     collection abuses;\n       (D) eliminates the bias against savings and investment;\n       (E) promotes economic growth and job creation;\n       (F) does not penalize marriage or families; and\n       (G) provides for a taxpayer-friendly collections process to \n     replace the Internal Revenue Service; and\n       (3) the stability and longevity of any new tax system \n     designed to achieve these goals should be guaranteed with a \n     supermajority vote requirement so that Congress cannot easily \n     raise tax rates, impose new taxes, or otherwise increase the \n     amount of a taxpayer's income that is subject to tax.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of Senate that the \n     assumptions underlying the functional totals of this \n     resolution assume fundamental tax reform that is accompanied \n     by a proposal to amend the Constitution of the United States \n     to require a supermajority vote in each House of Congress to \n     approve tax increases.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I ask that the amendment be temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this budget resolution contains some \nprovisions that I applaud, but it falls short in several areas: first, \nthe proposed tax cuts are too small to provide the relief that \ntaxpayers need and deserve; second, it does not adequately restrain the \ngrowth and reach of the Federal Government. Third, it is not what the \nhardworking men and women of America desire nor deserve. They deserve \nbetter.\n  The current economic expansion is now 84 months old, the third \nlongest on record. Overall growth rate has been relatively steady and \nmoderate. In the last three months alone, more than one million new \njobs have been created, while the unemployment rate has been reduced to \na 24-year low. In addition, inflation as measured by the CPI is only \n1.6 percent.\n  In the midst of this prosperity our citizens are burdened by levels \nof taxation that are increasingly oppressive--all to satisfy the \nappetite of the Federal behemoth. This condition runs contrary to \ncounsel handed down from President Jefferson--counsel we would do well \nto heed as we move forward with the budget debate. In his First Annual \nmessage to the Congress, President Jefferson wrote that the object of \ncongressional efforts should be ``to preserve the general and State \ngovernments in their constitutional form and equilibrium; to maintain \npeace abroad, and order and obedience to the laws at home; to establish \nprinciples and practices of administration favorable to the security of \nliberty and prosperity, and to reduce expenses to what is necessary for \nthe useful purposes of government.''\n\n  These are among the core principles which have thus far separated our \nnation from the rest of the world.\n  It is up to this Congress to apply President Jefferson's principle to \n``reduce expenses to what is necessary for the useful purposes of \ngovernment.'' All else should remain in the hands of our citizens.\n  Today, revenue levels are at all time highs, approaching 20 percent \nof GDP in both this fiscal year and the next. Not only are these levels \nhigh in historical terms, they are unprecedented for a peace-time \neconomy. In fact, the only time in this century that revenues were \nhigher was during World War II.\n  Unfortunately, this does not appear to be an anomaly; the \nCongressional Budget Office projects that unusually high levels of \nrevenue will continue to be extracted from taxpayers for the \nforeseeable future.\n  It is worth noting, Mr. President, that these very same revenues are \nlargely responsible for the budget surplus that has generated so much \nexcitement here in Washington. In fact, the current surplus is mainly \nattributable to additional unanticipated revenues of about $72 billion \nin 1997, rather than the effect of spending cuts. It is also worth \nnoting that these revenues have been fueled mainly by our strong \neconomic growth in the last year.\n  Yet, despite the record high level of revenues that the Federal \nGovernment now collects to feed its appetite for spending, we are told \nthat we need additional Federal programs! Over the past 2 months, \nPresident Clinton has engaged in a well orchestrated campaign to secure \napproval for spending billions of dollars more on new and expanded \ngovernment programs. He has set a trap for the American people by \npromising to do more for them in exchange for higher taxes on their \ncapital and labor.\n  We have balanced the Federal budget. But that is only one of the \nsteps to be taken to meet Jefferson's objective. We must go on to \nexamine whether the current size and breadth, let alone further \nexpansion, of the Federal Government for these purposes justifies the \ntaxation on the toil of our fellow citizens. Let's never forget that \nthe revenue collected by Washington does not\n\n[[Page S2898]]\n\nbelong to the Federal Government; it belongs to the hard-working men \nand women of this country.\n  Mr. President, the budget resolution should allow for immediate and \nsignificant tax relief for American taxpayers. However, the $30 billion \nof tax cuts proposed in the current resolution are not sufficient to \nprovide this relief.\n  I would like to see this budget resolution contain total tax cuts of \nat least $65 billion over 5 years. These cuts could take a number of \nforms, including marriage penalty reforms, family tax relief, and \nsavings and investment incentives.\n  For example, half of American families face the marriage penalty. The \nCongress proposed to phase out the marriage penalty for non-itemizers \nas part of the 1995 Balanced Budget Act, but the proposal was vetoed by \nPresident Clinton. In addition to marriage penalty relief, \nconsideration could be given to tax relief for families such as a child \ncare credits for both stay-at-home parents and working \nparents. Ultimately, whatever the final form that tax cuts take, the \ncrucial consideration is that they be substantive and immediate.\n\n  However, we are limited in the ways that we can offset these tax \ncuts. While the President's Fiscal Year 1999 budget contains a number \nof revenue raisers, many are rehashed, or controversial proposals that \nhave failed before due to opposition on both sides of the aisle.\n  We also cannot look to the spending programs within the jurisdiction \nof the Finance Committee for savings. We are all firmly committed to \nprotecting the reforms we have made to the Medicare, Medicaid and \nwelfare programs, and should make no further changes at this time. In \nmy opinion, the best option is for the cuts to be offset through the \nuse of a portion of the tobacco settlement revenues.\n  While the lack of meaningful tax relief is my main objection to this \nbudget resolution, I am also disappointed to see that there is no \nprovision to make better use of the budget surplus.\n  We should not simply spend this surplus, or set it aside; we can do \nbetter for our families and the future. I strongly believe that the \nmost productive use of thee surpluses is to fund individual Social \nSecurity investment accounts for all workers who contribute to the \npayroll tax. Therefore, Mr. president, I will be offering a sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendment to instruct the Finance Committee to report a \nSocial Security bill this year. The bill would dedicate the budget \nsurplus to fund Social Security personal retirement accounts. Equally \nimportant, my bill will place the Senate on record for putting these \nsurpluses to work for the American taxpayers, and not simply setting \nthem aside to be spend on other less important priorities than social \nsecurity.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I must express my concern over some of the \nmethods for shifting funds around under the budget resolution. Budget \nrules should not be invented to give authority to one committee to \nachieve budget savings under the jurisdiction of another committee. \nMore specifically, this resolution gives control over the Medicaid \nprogram and welfare programs to the Appropriations Committee. Moreover, \nsavings are to be achieved through administrative reforms which may \nprove to be unfair and unworkable with our partners, the states. \nReforming Medicaid and finding program savings in the child support \nenforcement system or finding other alternatives should be a task for \nthe committee of jurisdiction--namely the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. President, the American people expect more from us. And it is \nincumbent upon us to see that they get it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I make a point of order a quorum is \nnot present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding the Senator from \nIllinois, under the rule previously agreed to, has 2 hours for debate \non her amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two hours.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2175\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois. \nI call up amendment No. 2175 and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Ms. Moseley-Braun] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2175.\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the March 30, 1998 edition \nof the Record.)\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nSenators Daschle, Kennedy, Harkin, and Murray be added as cosponsors of \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I yield myself as much time as I \nmay require, until such time as someone else comes up to speak.\n  This amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that the fiscal year \n1999 budget resolution assumes that we will enact legislation creating \na partnership between State and local governments and the private \nsector to rebuild and modernize our schools and classrooms for the 21st \ncentury. The amendment calls for the enactment of legislation similar \nto S. 1705, the Public School Modernization Act of 1998, which I have \nintroduced along with a number of my colleagues. Our bill would \nestablish a simple and effective means of helping communities modernize \nand revitalize their schools.\n  The bill creates a new category of zero coupon bonds for States and \nschool districts to issue to finance capital improvements. States and \nschool districts would be able to issue $21.8 billion worth of these \nbonds over the next 2 years. Purchasers of the new bonds would receive \nFederal income tax credits in lieu of interest, thereby cutting the \ncost of upgrading the schools by at least a third and in some cases up \nto 50 percent. The bill will cost the Federal Government only $3.3 \nbillion over five years.\n  This amendment to the budget resolution is the first step toward \nenacting that legislation. It sends a signal that we in the Senate are \nserious about improving education in America.\n  I call your attention to this report card for America's \ninfrastructure. You will notice that school buildings get a failing \ngrade; mass transit got a grade of C--we have taken up the \ninfrastructure needs for mass transit; bridges, a C-minus; solid waste, \na C-minus; waste water treatment, D-plus; roads, D-minus--but schools \nget an F. We are literally sending our children to crumbling schools in \nwhich education becomes well-nigh impossible.\n  Those children--14 million of them, in fact--every day attend schools \nthat are so deteriorated that they do not even meet basic code; 14 \nmillion children in this country every day attend schools which are \nthat dilapidated, Mr. President. From all indications, in failing to \nprovide for the modernization, renovation and repair of school \nfacilities, we are literally causing these children to get less \neducational opportunity than they should be entitled to, but we are \nalso hampering our Nation's ability to be competitive in the 21st \ncentury.\n  At no point in our history has education been more important to both \nindividual achievement or national prosperity. As H. G. Wells wrote \nnearly 80 years ago: ``Human history becomes more and more a race \nbetween education and catastrophe.''\n  Education in America correlates with opportunity for individuals, for \nfamilies and for our entire Nation. Indeed, the rungs on the ladder of \nopportunity in America are crafted in the classroom. It is very clear \nthat high school graduates earn more money over the course of a \nlifetime. As a matter of fact, every year they earn 46 percent more \nthan people who do not graduate from high school. College graduates \nearn 155 percent more than those who do not complete high school. And, \nof course, over the course of a lifetime, the most educated Americans \nwill earn\n\n[[Page S2899]]\n\nfive times as much as the least educated Americans. That is on an \nindividual level.\n  The truth is that education correlates with every indicia of economic \nand social well-being. Educational attainment can be tied directly to \nincome, to health, to the likelihood of being on welfare, to the \nlikelihood of being incarcerated, and even to the likelihood of voting \nand participating in our democracy.\n  It is, however, more than a tool to lift people out of poverty or to \nhave a better standard of living. It is also the engine that will drive \nAmerica's economy into the 21st century. In a Wall Street Journal \nsurvey last year of leading economists, 43 percent of them said the \nsingle most important thing we could do to increase our long-term \neconomic growth rate would be to invest more in education, research and \ndevelopment. Nothing else came even close in the survey. One economist \nsaid:\n\n       One of the few things economists will agree upon is the \n     fact that economic growth is very strongly dependent on our \n     own abilities.\n\n  Another study, looking at the changing nature of the American work \nforce, said:\n\n       The crucial factor accounting for long-term success in the \n     work force is a basic education provided at the primary and \n     secondary levels.\n\n  Of course, a recent study by the Manufacturing Institute confirmed \nthat claim. It concluded that increasing the education level of workers \nby just 1 year raises the productivity level by 8.5 percent in \nmanufacturing.\n  If we fail to invest in education, we will put our Nation's economic \nfuture at risk. Unfortunately, too many of our schools, again, are not \nin adequate physical condition to meet the educational needs of our \nchildren. Too many of our schools are literally crumbling down around \nthe students.\n  The General Accounting Office, which did a major study, a landmark \nstudy, on this issue found that 14 million children attend schools in \nneed of major renovation or outright replacement. Some 7 million \nchildren every day attend schools with life-threatening safety code \nviolations. And they concluded that it will cost $112 billion just to \nbring our schools up to code--$112 billion across the country just to \nbring our schools up to code. That does not equip them with computers. \nThat is not bells and whistles. That is just to address the toll that \ndecades of deferred maintenance has taken. So this F relates to the \n$112 billion demand on us as Americans just to get our schools up to \ncode in this country.\n  I say ``the country'' broadly, and the truth is that crumbling \nschools are to be found in every corner of America. Again, according to \nthe GAO, some 38 percent of schools in urban areas are in this kind of \ndilapidated condition; 30 percent of rural schools are in the same \ncondition; and 29 percent of suburban schools are in the worst \ncondition. Again, this is not statistically all that different between \n29 percent in the suburbs, 30 percent in rural areas and 38 percent in \nurban areas.\n\n  Mr. President, the problem with crumbling schools has become so \nwidespread that even Peppermint Patty in the Peanuts cartoon has a \nleaky school roof. Take a look here. In this series of Peanuts cartoon, \nPeppermint Patty and her friend Marcie express their frustration over \nthe fact that they cannot get anyone to repair the leaky roof. ``It's \nkeeping me awake.'' The roof is leaking. They still don't take it.\n  Marcie forgot to mention the repair of the roof as she talked about \nthe fact that the children were having difficulty learning. But the \ntruth of the matter is that we cannot forget about the fact that our \nschools are dilapidated.\n  In my State of Illinois, school modernization and construction needs \ntop $13 billion. Many of Illinois' school districts have a difficult \ntime even buying textbooks and pencils, much less financing major \ncapital improvements. This legislation would free up local resources in \nmy State for education by providing Federal support for rebuilding the \nschools.\n  This $112 billion national school repair price tag, as enormous as it \nmay sound, again, does not include the cost of wiring schools and \ngetting them up to speed for modern technology. One of the greatest \nbarriers to the incorporation of modern computers into classrooms is \nthat the physical condition of many school buildings will not allow for \nit. You cannot very well use a computer if you cannot plug it into the \nwall.\n  Again, to quote the General Accounting Office, almost half of all \nschools lack enough electrical power for the full-scale use of \ncomputers; 60 percent of them lack enough conduits in the school to \nconnect classroom computers to a network; and 60 percent of schools \nlack enough phone lines for instructional use.\n  Last year, a teacher from Waukegan, IL, came to Washington and was \ntalking about the use of computers in the school and that when they \nplugged in the computers, when they deployed the computers around the \nschool, fires started all through the school because the wiring was so \nold.\n  That situation is replicating itself all over the country. We are \nseeing situations in which the schools cannot give our children the \ntools they need to learn so that they can compete in this 21st century \nbecause the physical structures simply will not allow it.\n  This legislation also will give communities the power to relieve \novercrowding. Again, according to the Department of Education, \nenrollment this year is at an all-time high and will continue to grow \nover the next 10 years. Just to keep up with growing enrollment, we \nwill need to build 6,000 new schools over the next 10 years.\n  Again, in my State, I visited schools where study halls are held in \nthe hallways because there is no other space. I have seen stairway \nlandings converted into computer labs, cardboard partitions used to \nturn one classroom into two. There is one school where the lunchroom \nhas been converted into two classrooms, where the students eat in the \ngymnasium, and instead of gym, they have what is called ``adaptive \nphysical education'' while they stand next to their desks.\n  One youngster from Virginia talked about the fact that the congestion \nin his school is so profound that the kids get into fights in the \nhallway, and they call it ``hall rage,'' when there is just too much \nhuman presence for them to walk around the hallways and they get into \ndisruptive behavior.\n  The teachers and parents know full well these conditions directly \naffect the ability of their children to learn, and the research, of \ncourse, has backed up that intuition. Two separate studies found a 10 \nto 11 percent achievement gap between students who attend school in \ngood buildings and quality surroundings and those who attend school in \npoor buildings after accounting for all other factors.\n\n  Other studies have found that when the buildings are in poor \ncondition, again, the students are more likely to misbehave. Three \nleading researchers recently concluded:\n\n       There is no doubt but that building condition affects \n     academic performance.\n\n  Again, if we are going to address the need to provide our youngsters \nwith quality education, we clearly have to look at the factors and the \nenvironment in which they are called upon to learn.\n  Just last month, the results came in on a set of international math \nand science tests. The results were, quite frankly, profoundly \ndisturbing.\n  The results of that study placed American students at or near the \nbottom on every one of the math and science tests that were offered. \nThis cannot be. We cannot go into the 21st century with our children \nperforming below some less-industrialized countries because we do not \nprovide a quality educational opportunity and, frankly, consistent \neducational opportunity throughout the country.\n  We know that we have some of the best schools in the world in this \ncountry on the one hand. I have some that I visited in the State of \nIllinois--the First in the World School. Those schools are in good \ncondition, and the youngsters who go there have a great opportunity for \neducation. They have scored above the international norm.\n  But at the same time we have the other instance of the crumbling \nschools, the dilapidated conditions and the poor performance across the \nboard as well. We have this patchwork quilt of school facilities \nthroughout the country. Again, I point out these facilities' problems \nare related to how we finance the system, how we pay for schools.\n  Crumbling schools are not just accidents; they are the predictable \nresult\n\n[[Page S2900]]\n\nof the way we fund education. The current system was established a \ncentury ago when the Nation's wealth was measured in terms of \nlandholdings. Wealth, of course, is no longer accumulated just in land, \nand the funding mechanism relying on the local property tax is just not \nappropriate, nor is it adequate.\n  The current school finance structure works against most American \nchildren and mitigates against most families' best efforts to improve \nlocal schools. Again, according to the General Accounting Office, poor \nand middle-class schools try the hardest to raise the revenue to get \nthe money together to fix up their schools. But the system works \nagainst them.\n  In some 35 States, poor districts have higher tax rates than wealthy \ndistricts, but they raise less revenue because, of course, there is \nless property wealth to tax. Now, this local funding model does not \nwork for school infrastructure, just as it would not work for highways \nor other infrastructure.\n  Imagine for a moment what would happen if we based our system of \nroads on the same funding model that we use for schools. If every \ncommunity was responsible for the construction of and maintenance of \nthe roads within its borders and no one else contributed, where we did \nnot have a partnership, we relied on the local property tax, in all \nlikelihood we would have smooth, good roads in the wealthy towns, a \npatchwork of mediocre roads in middle-income towns, and very few roads \nat all in poor communities.\n  Transportation, then, Mr. President, would be hostage to the vagaries \nof wealth and geography. Commerce and travel would be difficult and \nnavigation of such a system would not serve the interests of our whole \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, unfortunately, that hypothetical situation that I have \njust described in terms of roads precisely describes our school funding \nsystem. Schools with a lot of wealth have good schools or are more \nlikely to have good schools, middle-class schools have a patchwork, \npoor communities have little or nothing to point to.\n  Again, I made the point, as the GAO found, that the phenomenon of \ncrumbling schools, the infrastructure, finds itself in all kinds of \ncommunities, suburban, rural and urban, but, again, it is based on the \nlocal property tax in the main.\n  The American Society of Civil Engineers released a report card on \nAmerica's infrastructure, and, again, they found that the only category \nto get an F was the schools.\n  We have just recently acted, and the ranking member, the Senator from \nNew Jersey, will point out that we just passed the ISTEA bill, the \nhighway and mass transit bill, which addresses a number of these \nissues. The Senate passed that bill almost with unanimous support, and \nwe put an additional $214 billion into infrastructure in that \nlegislation.\n  Schools, however, do not benefit from that bill, and that is why I \nbelieve we need to talk about a partnership to fund the redevelopment \nof our school infrastructure. Our children need the same level of \ncommitment for school infrastructure as we have given to our highways.\n\n  I think the way we ought to look at this is not in the sense of \nfinger pointing, saying it is the fault of the States or it is the \nfault of the local governments. I think, if anything, we need to engage \na partnership in which we all contribute and we all weigh in to try to \nfix these schools and give our children an environment that is \nworthwhile to learn in.\n  We have a situation in which States--the argument has been made that \nschool construction is just a State or a local responsibility. Some of \nmy colleagues have argued that, notwithstanding the fact that the \nschool districts face a maintenance backlog of $112 billion--and, \nagain, $73 billion in new school construction needed--the States can \nmeet these costs on their own and by themselves.\n  The truth is that this is not in the interest of our country, that we \nrely on the accident of State effort and the accident of geography and \nthe accident of wealth in order to make certain that we address this \nnational problem.\n  We have an interest, as citizens of this great country, to see to it \nthat every child gets an opportunity to learn, that every child gets an \nenvironment in which learning can take place, and that every child no \nmatter where they live in the United States is given a chance to take \nadvantage of the new technologies that school modernization would \nallow.\n  The General Accounting Office found that only 13 of the States take a \ncomprehensive approach to school modernization and construction. In \n1994, for example, the States spent a total of $3.5 billion on school \nrepair and construction--$3.5 billion. So again with $112 billion worth \nof deferred maintenance, $73 billion worth of needed new construction, \nthe States alone will simply not be able to bear that economic burden.\n  Some of my colleagues have argued that because the economy is doing \nso well the States are now in a position to supplement what they spend \non school facilities with funds from the surpluses that are beginning \nto accumulate in the State treasuries. Most States have a surplus. All \nbut two States had some sort of surplus at the end of fiscal year 1997, \nranging from a $3.2 billion surplus in Alaska to a $32 million surplus \nin Alabama. My own State of Illinois ended 1997 with a $108 million \nsurplus. But the sum total of all the surpluses put together is $28.2 \nbillion. If we were to spend every dime of every State's surplus on \nthis issue, you would just begin to make a dent in it.\n  I think that the notion of the finger-pointing, the notion of blaming \none level of Government or another, is something that we, frankly, do \nnot have time for. We do not have time for that argument any longer. I \nbelieve we have a responsibility to engage as a national community to \nwork together, giving the States and the local governments control, \ncertainly, giving them responsibility for making certain that the \nschools are rebuilt, but providing the financial help that we can at \nthe national level in the simplest way possible.\n  We have the capacity, at the national level, to provide the funding \nleverage that this legislation will provide that will cost us $3 \nbillion to allow these local communities and school districts to go \ninto the capital markets and raise $22 billion. I think it just makes \nabsolute sense, and I encourage my colleagues to support this sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendment.\n  Mr. President, I now yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico, \n2 minutes to the Senator from Washington, and such time to the Senator \nfrom California as she may require.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2223\n\n  (Purpose: To establish a deficit-neutral reserve fund for civilian \n                       research and development)\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, before I give my few comments here in \nsupport of the amendment of the Senator from Illinois, I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be in order that I send an amendment to the desk and \nthen have that laid aside and then return to the amendment of the \nSenator from Illinois.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman] for himself and \n     Mr. Lieberman, proposes an amendment numbered 2223.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with and the amendment be set aside and we return to the \namendment of the Senator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     ``SEC.   .

Mr. President, I, first, say that putting together a \nbudget resolution is a very complex, difficult process. I commend those \nwho have worked on this, particularly my colleague from New Mexico for \nbringing in a budget resolution that is within the constraints of the \nbalanced budget agreement. I think that is certainly progress and is to \nbe commended. I am, however, troubled by many aspects of it. One aspect \nis that which is intended to be dealt with by this amendment by the \nSenator from Illinois.\n  I fear this budget does not reflect the forward-looking perspective \nthat prepares us for the world that we are facing in the 21st century.\n  I do not think anyone would dispute the paramount importance of \neducation, of research, and of a safe, healthy start for our children. \nThe importance of those items, in my view, are not reflected in this \nbudget. They are not given the priority they should be given in this \nbudget.\n  Let me give a few examples. In the area of education, and, of course, \nthe Senator from Illinois was talking about this general area of \neducation, the President has proposed at least $1.6 billion more than \nthe Republican budget in 1999 for the budget functions that include \neducation, training, and social services. The Republican budget does \nnot increase Federal spending by 1 cent over last year's balanced \nbudget amendment in that regard.\n  More specifically, the President and the Senate Democrats have put \nforth some very significant education proposals, one of which is this \namendment by the Senator from Illinois. The Republican budget does not \ngive the same priority to those concerns. The Democratic alternative \nand this amendment propose to help communities to renovate and build \nschool facilities, including BIA schools, which are very important in \nmy home State of New Mexico. The Republican budget essentially ignores \nthis request. The Democratic proposal provides for the hiring and \ntraining of 100,000 new teachers, which is projected to reduce the \naverage class size in grades 1 through 3 from 22 students in a class to \n18 students in a class. Again, the Republican budget ignores that \nproposal.\n  In addition, the Republicans claim they are providing an increase of \n$2.5 billion over the freeze level during this 5-year period for the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Act. It turns out that this funding does \nnot keep pace with inflation.\n  While this resolution proposes to increase money for one type of \nblock grant, the simple fact is that spending is cut significantly \noverall and that means that very important programs will have to be \ncut. Some of those programs--we are not clear as to which ones yet, of \ncourse, since that is not specified in the resolution--but some of \nthose might include title I for disadvantaged children, Head Start, \ntraining and technology for teachers, and teacher quality.\n  The resolution also gives short shrift to child care, and again \nSenator Dodd from Connecticut offered an amendment that I support in \nthat regard.\n  With regard to tobacco, I am tremendously concerned that the budget \nas presently written precludes any meaningful consideration of programs \nto reduce teen smoking. While I strongly agree with the chairman of the \nBudget Committee that we must do something to fix our Medicare Program, \nI believe we do not need to do so at the expense of the current and \nfuture health needs of our children.\n  I commend our colleagues for the hard work that has gone into this \nresolution, but I do differ with my Republican colleagues about the \nways in which we allocate spending in this bill. We are entering the \n21st century as a strong and vibrant and growing economy, but we will \nonly remain that way if we invest in the future and ensure that every \nAmerican has the opportunity to take advantage of that growth. The way \nwe do this is to focus on these areas of priority--education, training, \nand the needs of working families.\n  I hope we can adopt some amendments to this resolution that will \nallow us to do that more effectively.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise in strong support of this amendment and offer my \ncongratulations to the Senator from Illinois for bringing this critical \nissue to the attention of the Senate and to the attention of the \nNation. Certainly it is an issue of safety and health for many children \nacross our country. For all of us who go out and visit schools on a \nregular basis, we see classrooms that are in cafeterias, in gymnasiums, \nand in closet space--of all things--all across this country, and that \nis wrong. This is an issue that has to be addressed.\n  Let me also bring to the attention of my colleagues the issue that \nmany of us hear about--the high number of jobs that are available today \nin the area of technology. The ITEA recently put out a study showing \nthere are 200,000 job openings today. These are $40,000- to $60,000-a-\nyear jobs available in technology, yet we don't have the skills or \nstudents with the skills available to go into these jobs because they \nhaven't had the education and the experience in their schools.\n  I have worked very hard to bring technology to the floor of the \nSenate as an issue. We have put computers into our schools, technology \ninto our schools. In a few minutes, the Labor Committee will be working \non the Reauthorization Act that includes my language to train teachers \nin technology throughout our schools, but if we don't pass the issue of \nschool construction, far too many of our children will never have \naccess to these skills because they are in classrooms where you cannot \nplug in a computer.\n  This issue is critical and I urge my colleagues to support it. I, \nagain, thank my colleague from Illinois for bringing it to our \nattention and appreciate her long concern and work on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of this \namendment, and in particular to thank my friend and colleague, the \nsenior Senator from Illinois, for her hard work. I am aware that there \nis another school construction amendment. It is known as the Roth \namendment. It is part of the Coverdell tax bill. These amendments, in \nmy view, complement one another.\n  What the Senator from Illinois has done is structure an amendment so \nit really benefits some of the older, more stressed urban school \ndistricts in America. What the other amendment would do is stress the \nsmaller, suburban rural areas where there is substantial growth going \non. So between the two of them, they provide to the States and the \ncities and the counties of America a truly major, major commitment to \nnew school construction.\n  This is a $21.8 billion authority for State and local governments to \nissue bonds to construct and rehabilitate schools. For California \nalone, this would mean $2.2 billion in bonds. It is the most of any \nState. Thirty-five percent of these bonds would be used by\n\n[[Page S2902]]\n\nthe 100 largest school districts based on their ESEA title I funding \nwhich assists disadvantaged children; 65 percent would be distributed \nby States based on their own criteria; in addition, the Secretary of \nEducation could designate 25 additional districts based on the State's \nshare of Elementary and Secondary Education Act title I grants, \nexcluding the 100 largest districts.\n  Under this amendment, California school districts are really helped. \nBakersfield would get $19 million; Compton, $30 million; Fresno, $56 \nmillion; Long Beach, $48 million; Los Angeles, deeply troubled, and I \nwill show you why in a moment, $488 million; Montebello, $22 million; \nOakland, $35 million; Pomona, $18 million; Sacramento, $31 million; San \nBernardino, $32 million; San Diego, $69 million; San Francisco, $28 \nmillion; Santa Ana, $27 million; and Stockton Unified, $24 million.\n\n  This proposal, again, helps the large urban poor districts. \nCalifornia's public school enrollment, much of it in these districts \nalone, between 1997 and the year 2007, is going to grow by almost 16 \npercent. That is triple the national projected rate of growth of 4.1 \npercent. California schools will grow three times faster than schools \nin the rest of the United States.\n  Each year, between 160,000 and 190,000 new students will come into \nCalifornia schools. The high school enrollment is projected to increase \nby 35 percent by 2007. Approximately 920,000 students--that is almost 1 \nmillion--are to be admitted to schools in the State during that period, \nboosting total enrollment from 5.6 million to 6.8 million.\n  Our school population is bigger than the population of most of the \nStates. That is how important this bill is to California. California \nneeds to build 7 classrooms a day, at 25 students per class, just to \nkeep up with the average growth that is going to take place. We need to \nbuild 327 schools over the next 3 years just to keep pace with the \ngrowth that is going to take place. We have the largest class sizes in \nthe Nation. Students are crammed into every available hallway, assembly \nroom, and many of them in temporary buildings. Los Angeles--and this is \nstaggering--Unified School District has 560,000 seats for 681,000 \nstudents. That means they don't even have seats for 120,000 students. \nSo the absence of seats in Los Angeles is bigger than most of the \nschool districts in a State. And this is just one city in the State.\n  I could go on and on with examples. But of 60 percent of the schools \nover 30 years old, most do not have modern infrastructure. Eighty-seven \npercent of the schools need to upgrade and repair buildings. The \nCalifornia Department of Education estimates that this State--one State \nalone--just to stay even, needs $22 billion during the next decade to \nmodernize public schools and an additional $8 billion just to meet \nenrollment growth. That is $30 billion in the next decade just to stay \neven.\n  I have heard a lot of talk on this floor about education, and I can \nsay only one thing: If you talk education and you have crowded and \ndilapidated schools and you don't have seats for the children in the \nschools, there is only one thing you can really do, and that is put \nyour money where your mouth is. This is the first step toward ``putting \nyour money where your mouth is'' amendment.\n  I am so proud of the Senator from Illinois. There is no single piece \nof legislation, there is no single amendment on any bill, that will \nhelp the school system of the great State of California more than the \nMoseley-Braun amendment. I want to make that crystal clear.\n\n  Here is what it costs. I mentioned the cost and that we need $30 \nbillion just to stay even. Here is what it costs to build a school in \nCalifornia: An elementary school, $5.2 million; a middle school, $12 \nmillion; a high school, $27 million.\n  Our schools must be built to withstand earthquakes, floods, El Nino, \nand myriad other natural disasters. The cost of building a high school \nin California is almost twice the national cost. The U.S. average is \n$15 million; in California, it is $27 million. We have the largest \npupil-per-teacher ratio in the country. And thanks to the Governor and \nthe legislature, we are now beginning to reduce class size. K-3 is now \nlimited to 20 students per teacher.\n  In conclusion, studies show that test scores of students in schools \nin poor condition can fall as much as 11 percentage points below scores \nof students in good buildings. I think this amendment is important. I \nreally hope that no one in this body would not vote for this amendment \nbecause of the Coverdell bill. The Coverdell bill and the Roth \namendment cover very different school districts than does this \namendment. If you want to help the big urban school districts of \nAmerica, where the dilapidated schools are, where the learning really \nneeds improvement, there is only one game in town, and it is Carol \nMoseley-Braun's school construction amendment. I am proud to support \nit.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Senator from California for her \neloquence. I did, however, want to take issue with one little part. \nThis is just a sense of the Senate, but the underlying legislation does \nrelate to suburban and rural schools as well as city schools. The \nSenator is right about the urban schools. It does a lot more for urban \nschools than the alternative legislation, but it also covers suburban \nand rural, because in my State, of course, just outside of Chicago is a \nplace called Illinois, so I have to make sure that is covered.\n  In fact, if I may, for a moment, pick up where the Senator from \nCalifornia left off, this is a picture from a suburban school. This is \noutside of Chicago. You can see it is a portable classroom. The doors \nare falling off, and the gutters are down on the ground. It is in a \ndilapidated condition. So we see it all over.\n  Senator Feinstein was exactly right to point out how much will be \nrequired for new construction, in addition to fixing the crumbling \nschools we have already. The GAO points out that we need $112 billion \njust to repair the schools that are falling down. They also found, \nhowever, that we have about $73 billion worth of need for new schools. \nSo what we are really looking at is not just the $112 billion price \ntag, but a $185 billion price tag.\n  If you take the argument that somehow this is a local responsibility, \nit should come out of local property taxes, then what you are really \nsaying is that the local property taxpayers should cough up an \nadditional $185 billion--$185 billion. When you consider that property \ntaxes around the country have been increasing, frankly, at a greater \nrate than the taxes at the national level have increased, State and \nlocal taxes, as a share of income, have risen nearly 10 percent in the \nlast decade. In the last 10 years alone, in my State of Illinois, the \nproperty taxes have more than doubled. All across the country, voters \nreject the property tax hikes to pay for schools and other municipal \nimprovements.\n  Again, we cannot continue to rely on the property tax alone to build \nthe schools that we need for the next century. I think what is called \nfor here is a partnership--a partnership in which we come together and \nwork together at the Federal, State, and local government level to \nprovide the funding that will be required to help rebuild our crumbling \nschools.\n  Mr. President, just yesterday a Manhattan State Supreme Court justice \nordered New York City and the New York Board of Education to eliminate \nhazardous school conditions and to begin regular inspections and \nmaintenance of its 1,200 school buildings. That decision came out of a \nlawsuit brought on the issue of the crumbling schools. According to \nthat report that was commissioned by the New York board, 40 percent of \nthe schools in New York lack functioning or accessible bathrooms and \nwater fountains with clean water; 760 buildings had serious heating and \nventilation problems; an average of 47 percent of the schools in New \nYork are falling into unacceptable disrepair.\n\n  Again, this is the kind of dilapidation we are seeing all over. In \nfact, there is litigation pending in another 16 States on this point. I \nthink this amendment we are considering today expressing the sense of \nthe Senate will go in the right direction.\n  The point I believe we have to make is that it is appropriate for us \nat the national level to stop pointing fingers, to stop the divisive \nblame game that stalls Federal support for school improvements, and \nthat we all have a responsibility to come together and work on this. I \nam pleased that Senator Feinstein came to the floor to discuss\n\n[[Page S2903]]\n\nthis matter. It was my understanding that the Senator from New Jersey \nwanted to speak on this matter. I yield to him.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Illinois. I do want to say \nsomething about this important piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I stand to support the amendment presented by the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois. Senator Moseley-Braun's amendment \nis a critical issue in terms of how we deal with the educational \nrequirements of our young people.\n  The Senator from Illinois has had a long record--certainly since she \nhas been here, and I understand before she arrived to the U.S. Senate--\nof interest and involvement in children, particularly focused on \neducation in the early years. I am delighted to join with her and \nothers here who are supporting an investment in bringing our school \nfacilities up to date, making sure that the place in which children are \nexpected to learn invites the process of learning and doesn't distract \nthem, because it is either too cold, too hot, or too dangerous, or \nbecause of water leaking through the roof, or perhaps asbestos in the \nbuilding, or insufficient facilities to attend to the children's needs. \nThe condition is so outrageous that the GAO says that there are more \nthan 14 million children attending schools that are in need of \nextensive repair or replacement. Several million attend schools with \nsafety code violations, and, as I mentioned, leaky roofs are in schools \nthat house 12 million students.\n  The GAO found the problem of crumbling schools transcends demographic \nand geographic boundaries. Roughly one-third of urban rural and \nsuburban schools report that at least one building is in need of \nextensive repair, or to be completely replaced. Furthermore, the GAO \nreports that most schools are not prepared to incorporate modern \ntechnology in the classroom. Forty-six percent of schools lack adequate \nelectrical wiring to support the full-scale use of technology. More \nthan a third of the schools lack the requisite electrical power. And 56 \npercent of schools have insufficient phone lines for modems.\n  When we talk about percentages of 56 percent here and 12 percent \nthere, it kind of escapes into an amorphous condition that prevents us \nfrom really analyzing what the effects of these inadequate facilities \nrepresent. It takes a real toll on students, on children.\n  I came out of the computer business. I arrived here some years ago \nfrom the city of Paterson, NJ, where my company was founded and where I \nwas born. We had a population, I would say, of somewhere around 150,000 \npeople with a commensurate number of students. I have been back there \nmany times. I have a fondness of that place of my birth. I know a lot \nof the people who live in the town. One of my schoolmates was a fellow \nnamed Larry Doby, who was just admitted to the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n  I visit the city regularly. Until recently, I used to go to the same \nbarbershop every couple of weeks since I was a college student. I \nreturn there and very often bring people around my old neighborhood to \nkind of give them a sense of what kind of beginning and opportunity I \nhad. They were amazed at the dilapidated condition of the facility. I \nmet children there and told them I lived in the building. They asked me \nwhat floor. I said, ``The second floor.'' The number of the building \nwas 310 Hamilton Avenue. They asked me, ``What floor?'' I lived on the \nsecond floor. ``Yes. What apartment?'' I said, ``In the back \napartment.'' They said, ``You lived there?'' ``Yes. I lived there.''\n  So it established a particular attachment.\n  I was called on by the board of education at Paterson a year or two \nago to see if I could get them some help so they could get the schools \nwired in preparation for connection into the Internet. They couldn't \nraise the money within the city. People wanted it; they couldn't afford \nto pay the taxes necessary. The city was in arrearages all over the \nplace. I arranged for some people I knew in my old company to pay for \nthe facility to be wired. We went down there, and we stood with the \npeople from the telephone company and pulled wire. What a pitiful \ncondition. Can you imagine that you have to depend on someone's \ngoodness, or some company's willingness to step forward so a school can \nbe affixed to the Internet so the kids can learn that there is \nsomething besides pens and pencils and pads that are going to be \nrequired in the lives that they expect and hope to lead one day? It is \npretty discouraging if kids don't know what it is that the outside \nworld holds for them.\n\n  I once visited a school in Newark earlier in my days in the Senate. \nIt caused me to write a piece of legislation called ``computers in \nschools'' to try to make sure that there was a computer available in \nclassrooms with a reasonable population-to-computer ratio so that the \nchildren there would have a chance to learn the applications.\n  One of the things that we saw in a visit to a school in a very poor \nneighborhood with high crime in a broken-down neighborhood was that one \nchild I was introduced to was sitting at a computer terminal. They told \nme that he was in about the third or fourth grade. They told me that \nthis child had such a bad deportment record that they were looking for \na way perhaps to expel him from the school. Then they brought in a \ncouple of computers. This child couldn't keep up academically. His \nbehavior, as I say, was bad. They sat him in front of a computer. They \ntaught him a couple of basic exercises that children learn. He was so \nproficient in such a short time that he began to outdistance the other \nchildren.\n  I tell you this story only because to me it established the fact that \nchildren have to be given a chance to learn and develop based on their \nown ability, based on their own capacity to learn, and not be \nrestricted to staying with a class where perhaps there is some \nmaladjustment to it.\n  So I fully support this amendment.\n  Broken-down schools have a negative effect on the ability of students \nto learn. They see this grim surrounding, and they begin to believe \nthat is the way the world around them exists and will exist for them. \nAcademic research has proven that there is a direct correlation between \nthe condition of school facilities and student achievement.\n  Georgetown researchers found that test scores of students assigned to \nschools in poor condition can be expected to fall 11 percentage points \nbelow the test scores of students in buildings in adequate condition. \nUnfortunately, many local educational agencies have difficulty securing \nfinancing for school facility improvements. The proposal called for in \nthis amendment would really help. The zero interest school \nmodernization bond and the Federal income tax credits to purchase those \nbonds in lieu of interest payments would be an important step toward \nrebuilding and modernizing our Nation's schools.\n  Mr. President, I say to those who criticize test scores, who intimate \nthat our children are inadequate to the task that they are assigned to, \nI ask those people to look to where the problem is. It is not simply \nlooking at students' surroundings. We should provide facilities through \nour Government. Why is it that we encourage this feeling of being \nforlorn, or outside of the mainstream? It is because the condition of \nthe facility says that these children are not worth the effort that it \ntakes to have them in a better learning condition.\n  Mr. President, if we want our kids to learn, if we want our children \nto be competitive in the years ahead, if we expect them to be leaders \nin the true sense of the word, where we are not just making speeches \nbut we want to do something about it, then this is an excellent \nopportunity to register our support.\n  Again, my commendation goes to the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois for her leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support Senator Moseley-\nBraun's amendment to the budget resolution to help modernize and repair \nthe nation's public school facilities for the 21st century.\n  Schools across the nation face serious problems of overcrowding. \nAntiquated facilities are suffering from physical decay, and are not \nequipped to handle the needs of modern education.\n  Across the country, 14 million children in a third of the nation's \nschools are learning in substandard buildings. Half the schools have at \nleast one unsatisfactory environmental condition.\n\n[[Page S2904]]\n\n It will take over $110 billion just to repair existing facilities \nnationwide.\n  Massachusetts is no exception. 41% of our schools across the state \nreport that at least one building needs extensive repair or should be \nreplaced. Three-quarters report serious problems in buildings, such as \nplumbing or heating defects. 80% have at least one unsatisfactory \nenvironmental factor.\n  In Boston, many schools cannot keep their heating systems functioning \nproperly. On a given day, 15 to 30 schools complain that their heat is \nnot working.\n  Faulty boilers and leaky pipes are responsible for sewage leaks and \nbackups at many schools in Springfield, Massachusetts.\n  The leaking roof at Revere High School is so serious that the new \nfire system is threatened. School Committee members estimate that \nfixing the roof will cost an additional $1 million, and they don't know \nwhere to get the money.\n  It is difficult enough to teach or learn in dilapidated classrooms. \nBut now, because of escalating enrollments, classrooms are increasingly \novercrowded. The nation will need 6,000 new schools in the next few \nyears, just to maintain current class sizes.\n  The student population in Pomona, California has increased 37% in the \nlast ten years, and most students are now forced to study in poorly \nventilated and dimly lit portable classrooms. To accommodate the large \nnumber of students using the cafeteria, school officials have had to \nschedule five different lunch periods every day.\n  Malden, Massachusetts is in the process of building five new \nelementary schools to accommodate increases in student enrollment. The \nestimated cost for constructing these schools will exceed $100 million.\n  The Senate recently heard testimony from a student in Clifton, \nVirginia whose high school is so overcrowded that fights often break \nout in the overflowing halls. The problem is called ``Hall Rage,'' and \nit's analogous to ``Road Rage'' on crowded highways. The violence in \nthe hallways is bad enough. But it's even worse, because it's difficult \nfor teachers to teach when students are distracted by the chaos in the \nhallways and outside their classrooms.\n  State governments and local communities are working to meet these \nchallenges. In Massachusetts, under the School Building Assistance Act, \nthe state will pay 50-90% of the most severe needs. 124 schools now \nhave approved projects, and are on a waiting list for funding. The \nstate share should be $91 million this year, but only $35 million is \navailable. More than 50 other projects are awaiting approval. With that \nkind of deficit at the state and local level, it is clear that the \nfederal government has a responsibility to act.\n  Incredibly, the Republican budget proposal ignores these pressing \nneeds. The Republican plan cuts funding for education. It refuses to \nprovide needed new investments to improve public education, including \nschool modernization and construction.\n  Democrats have made it a top priority to see that America has the \nbest education system in the world. Providing safe and adequate school \nfacilities is an important step towards meeting that goal.\n  I urge the Senate to approve this amendment. Investing in education \nis one of the best investments America can possibly make. For schools \nacross America, help is truly on the way--and it can't come a minute \ntoo soon.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I do not know, before I relinquish the \nfloor, what the expectation is for Senator Conrad, who has a vote \ncoming up. What is the order of business, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote is expected to occur with respect to \nSenator Conrad's amendment 2174 at 2 p.m.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Has the unanimous consent order been propounded that \nwould give Senator Conrad an opportunity to discuss his amendment \nbefore the vote takes place?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has not.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. It has not. How much time remains on the side of the \nproponents?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator from Illinois has a question?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Yes. I thank the Senator from New Jersey. I was \njust going to ask if this colloquy was being charged to time on this \nside because the junior Senator from New Jersey wanted to speak, and I \nwanted to have an opportunity to close. We are 10 minutes from the hour \nof 2 o'clock, and I understand there is a vote scheduled by unanimous \nconsent for that time. In just trying to accommodate the time, I was \nwondering if it was being charged to the time of the proponents of this \namendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. With all due respect, I thought the Senator from \nIllinois had suggested that she was wrapped up with her commentary, and \nin consideration of accepting that condition, it was my understanding \nwe were going to provide Senator Conrad with time to address his \namendment before the vote takes place.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. The Senator is correct. In the meantime, the \nSenator from New Jersey came in the Chamber and asked for time to \nspeak, and, again, I would take a minute to close and if the Senator \ncould take 2 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would be happy to yield the floor.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Senator from New Jersey.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, if Senator Conrad, indeed, desires to \nspeak for 5 minutes and the Senator from Illinois desires to speak for \n5 minutes, I would ask unanimous consent that this Senator have 5 \nminutes, the Senator from Illinois have 5 minutes, and Senator Conrad \nhave 5 minutes, which would mean that the vote would take place at \napproximately 2:10.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will have to raise an objection because there is an \nunderstanding being proposed that would include some time for Senator \nCoverdell. And I will ask unanimous consent, before there be any \nfurther discussion about this, that at 2 o'clock the floor be returned \nto me so that I can engage in a UC with my Republican counterpart.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, the situation is the vote is at 2 \no'clock and Senator Carol Moseley-Braun and I will speak until then?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the understanding.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, there is a significant chance that this Senate will \none day be remembered for having finally begun to address the problems \nof educational quality in America. President Clinton in his State of \nthe Union Address challenged this Congress to deal with the problems of \nschool construction, class size, and competence. We are now taking up \nthat challenge, and, indeed, in the last few weeks in dealing with the \nCoverdell-Torricelli proposal, we also address the problem of access to \nprivate schools and the rights of families to save money privately to \ndeal with the costs of public and private education.\n  Today we return to the subject again. Senator Carol Moseley-Braun of \nIllinois, as she has on many occasions, is now bringing forward \nconsistently and repeatedly a message to deal with the plight--the \nconstruction of our schools.\n  I recognize that in this Senate almost everyone has an idea to deal \nwith the problems of education in America. Almost everyone is right \nexcept those who think they have the only idea. This problem is so \nserious in quality and in access that it will require not just this \nSenate but Congresses to come, not just this idea but many ideas. The \nquality of education in this country is the most serious threat to the \nmaintenance of not only social order but our quality of life. We \nrecognize it has many components but probably none more difficult than \nrebuilding our Nation's schools.\n\n  It is estimated that it could cost $112 billion to rebuild crumbling \nschools in America.\n  Having toured many of these schools in my own State of New Jersey, I \nhave seen students sitting in hallways because there was not enough \nroom. I have seen students with buckets next to their desks to catch \nthe rain, students who did not have restrooms in\n\n[[Page S2905]]\n\ntheir own school facilities but were sent to other buildings. Our \nparents and their parents before them worked and saved and sacrificed \nto build a system of public education in this country and an \ninfrastructure that was without equal in the world. They met that \nchallenge. The simple and regrettable truth is we have not.\n  This system of education, which more than anything else in the Nation \nis the foundation for our country's prosperity, is crumbling around us. \nOne-third of the students in the Nation face exactly the plight that I \nhave outlined, and more will join them unless we stand up to this \nchallenge.\n  To all of you who are part of the efforts to assure there is access \nto the Internet, who joined with us in the fight to help private and \npublic savings through Coverdell-Torricelli, who believe in testing, \nwho join any of these fights, join this fight because there is no one \nfront in the war dealing with educational quality in America. It must \nbe fought on all fronts at the same time.\n  I am very proud to be part of the efforts of the Senator from \nIllinois, Carol Moseley-Braun, who more than anyone else has brought \nthis fight forward and will be principally responsible when we \nultimately do succeed.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding the time.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Senator from New Jersey.\n  In summation, Mr. President, we have heard some of the stories. There \nare many other anecdotal stories, stories even in my State about \nfaucets and drains in science labs that don't work and electrical \nwiring that can't support the computers, a school in Alabama where the \nwater leaks collapsed the ceiling 40 minutes after the children left \nfor the day.\n  These stories, frankly, are news to no one. I hope that this Senate \nwill take a good look at the sense of the Senate and not let this vote \ncome down on truly partisan grounds. I have a sense that it will, and \nthat in my opinion is tragic because, if anything, our children are not \nRepublican or Democrat or Independent. Our children require an \neducation, and politics should stop at the schoolroom door. This should \nbe something that would engage nonpartisan support based on the policy \nobjective of the sense-of-the-Senate amendment.\n  That is what this vote is about. It is about policy. I hope it is not \nabout politics. I hope we will send a signal that we are prepared, \nbecause, again, it is only a sense-of-the-Senate amendment, that we \nwill send a signal to the country that this Congress is prepared to \ntake up the challenge of rebuilding our crumbling schools; that we are \nprepared to do it in partnership with our State and local governments; \nwe are not looking to local property taxpayers alone to carry the \nburden of the $185 billion it will take to build and repair schools; \nthat we are not going to try to pass the buck to the States and have \nthem raise State taxes to do it; that we can work together to provide a \nbureaucracy free of raising the capital.\n  That is all this amendment does. It doesn't tell anybody which school \nto fix. All it says is here is a way to raise the money, and Uncle Sam \nis going to give you a tax credit in lieu of interest on these bonds \nthat the local school districts will issue. I think it makes absolute \nsense. It is a very straightforward way of doing it. It will provide \nsupport for all kinds of schools in rural and suburban districts as \nwell as in urban districts where the needs, of course, are the most \npronounced, but certainly they are pronounced all over the country.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the sense-of-the-Senate \namendment, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois. We \nare ready to proceed with the next piece of business. I think the \nmanager, the chairman of the Budget Committee, has something he wants \nto put down.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I inquire, where are we on the \namendment of the distinguished Senator from Illinois?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). All time of the \nproponents on the amendment has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have not used any time in opposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2174\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment offered \nby Senators Conrad and Lautenberg, which will ensure that any revenues \ngenerated from an increase in the price of cigarettes is directed first \nand foremost to protecting the nation's children from nicotine \naddiction and smoking-induced diseases.\n  The Republican budget creates a number of serious barriers to these \nefforts by prohibiting tobacco revenues from being used for anti-\nsmoking initiatives.\n  In fact, the budget uses Medicare as a smokescreen to make funding \nmore difficult for important smoking cessation programs, counter-\nadvertising to deglamorize tobacco use among children, biomedical \nresearch to cure smoking-caused illnesses, and public education to \ninform the American people more fully about the dangers of tobacco use.\n  If the current restrictive resolution is adopted, a vote of sixty \nSenators would be required to waive the restrictions. The result is \nthat millions of Americans who want to quit smoking will have a much \nmore difficult time achieving their goal. Anti-smoking programs are \ncentral to any effective measure to reduce tobacco use, and they should \nbe the first priority for the dollars raised by a cigarette price \nincrease.\n  If these anti-tobacco initiatives are not funded, the problem of \nteenage smoking in the United States will only increase. According to \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a million youngsters \nstart smoking each year--almost 3,000 a day. One third of them will die \nprematurely from smoking-induced illnesses. The average smoker begins \nat age 13, and becomes a daily smoker by age 15.\n  These facts are serious enough. But the crisis is growing worse. A \nSpring 1996 survey by the University of Michigan Institute for Social \nResearch found that teenage smoking has continued to rise since 1991. \nIt climbed by nearly fifty percent among eighth and tenth graders, and \nby nearly twenty percent among high school seniors between 1991 and \n1996.\n  The industry strategy is obvious. The tobacco companies target \nchildren, because once children are hooked on cigarette smoking, they \nbecome customers for life. Ninety percent of current adult smokers \nbegan to smoke before they reached the age of 18. By contrast, if young \nmen and women reach that age without beginning to smoke, they are \nunlikely to take up the habit in later years.\n  The tobacco companies know these facts. They are fully aware that if \nthey do not persuade children to start smoking, the industry may \ncollapse within a generation. That's why Big Tobacco has targeted \nchildren with billions of dollars in advertising and promotional \ngiveaways that promise popularity and success for those who take up \nsmoking.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that the \naverage 14-year-old is exposed to $20 billion in advertising--$20 \nbillion--beginning at age 6. In fact, the name ``Joe Camel'' is as \nfamiliar to children as ``Mickey Mouse.''\n  Two recently disclosed industry documents illustrate the blatant \nmarketing to youths. In a 1981 Philip Morris memo entitled ``Young \nSmokers--Prevalence, Implications, and Related Demographic Trends,'' \nthe authors wrote that:\n       It is important to know as much as possible about teenage \n     smoking patterns and attitudes. Today's teenager is \n     tomorrow's potential regular customer, and the overwhelming \n     majority of smokers first begin to smoke while still in their \n     teens. . . The smoking patterns of teenagers are particularly \n     important to Philip Morris. . . Furthermore, it is during the \n     teenage years that the initial choice is made.\n  A marketing report by R.J. Reynolds researcher Diane Burrows, written \nprior to launching the Joe Camel advertising campaign, stated:\n       Younger adult smokers are critical to R.J. Reynolds' long-\n     term profitability. Therefore, RJR must make a substantial \n     long-term commitment of manpower and money dedicated to \n     younger adult smoking programs.\n\nA related RJR document states that ``young adult'' refers to the 14-24 \nage group.\n  It is no coincidence that shortly after R.J. Reynolds launched the \nJoe Camel campaign in 1988, Camel's share of the youth market soared \nfrom 0.5% to 32.8%.\n\n[[Page S2906]]\n\n  Unless Congress takes action to reverse this disturbing trend in \nadolescent smoking, five million of today's children will die \nprematurely from smoking-caused illness. That's unacceptable.\n  Although all of us agree that Medicare should be protected for future \ngenerations, one of the best ways to keep Medicare strong is to invest \nin important public health and tobacco control programs that prevent \nchildren from beginning to smoke, and that help current smokers to quit \nsmoking. Americans will lead healthier lives, and the burden of \ntobacco-induced diseases will be greatly reduced.\n  Unfortunately, the Republican budget earmarks all of the tobacco \nrevenues for Medicare. It prohibits using even one dollar of the \ntobacco revenues to deter youth from smoking.\n  Smoking has inflicted great damage on people's health. It is the \nleading preventable cause of death and disability in the nation. \nTobacco products are responsible for a third of all cancers, and 90% of \nall lung cancers.\n  Smoking also causes great harm to nonsmokers. A recent study by the \nAgency for Health Care Policy and Research reports that second-hand \nsmoke is responsible for as many as 60% of cases of asthma, bronchitis, \nand wheezing among young children. It makes sense to use tobacco \nrevenues to discourage children from beginning to smoke.\n  These programs work. Smoking cessation programs are among the most \neffective means to reduce health care costs. At the same time, they \nsave and improve the lives of millions of Americans.\n  They are also cost-effective. Every dollar invested in a smoking \ncessation program for a pregnant woman saves $6 in costs for neonatal \nintensive care and long-term care for low birthweight babies.\n  Dr. Michael Fiore, Director of the Center for Tobacco Research and \nIntervention at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, noted that:\n\n       smoking cessation programs are the most cost-effective \n     prevention intervention a physician can engage in. . . It is \n     a paradox in America that virtually every health insurance \n     policy pays for the outcomes of smoking, whether it is a \n     heart attack, stroke, or cancer, but only half of them pay \n     the $100 to $200 it would take to prevent these very \n     expensive illnesses.\n\n  The Republican budget offers no help in cases like this, and that \nmakes no sense. The Republican budget offers no help to states and \ncommunities for public health advertising to counteract the $5 billion \na year that the tobacco industry pours into advertising to encourage \npeople to start smoking and keep smoking.\n  Paid counter-advertising is extremely effective in reducing tobacco \nconsumption. Both Massachusetts and California have demonstrated that \ncounter-advertising can discourage children from beginning to smoke and \nencourage smokers to quit. It helped reduce cigarette use in \nMassachusetts by 17% between 1992 and 1996, or three times the national \naverage. Smoking by junior high school students dropped 8%, while the \nrest of the nation has seen an increase.\n  In California, a counter-advertising campaign reduced smoking rates \nby 15% over the last three years.\n  A soon-to-be-published study by Professor Frank Chaloupka of the \nUniversity of Illinois found that tobacco counter-advertising can also \nreduce illegal drugs use among youth.\n  The Republican budget, however, will provide no funding for these \nimportant efforts.\n  The Republican budget offers no help to the Food and Drug \nAdministration to enforce the laws against the sale of tobacco products \nto minors, even though young people spend $1 billion a year to buy \ntobacco products illegally.\n  Last year, Congress tried to get away with underfunding the FDA's \ntobacco regulations by providing only $5 million of the $34 million \nPresident Clinton requested to begin enforcement of the youth access \nrule. An amendment by Senator Harkin to the Agriculture Appropriations \nbill to restore the funding was defeated on the Senate floor.\n  Two months later, as public outrage grew, Congress reversed itself \nand overwhelmingly approved the full amount. A similar outcry from our \nconstituents and the public health community is likely if we do not \nprovide funding for these important enforcement efforts.\n  Finally, the Republican budget offers no help for medical research on \ntobacco-related diseases, even though such research can lead to \nenormous savings for Medicare.\n  Funding for tobacco-related medical research is vital to fulfilling \nour hopes for healthy lives for all citizens. The promise of new \nmedical research is boundless. As impressive as the progress of the \npast has been, it pales in comparison to the opportunities of the \nfuture.\n  In addition, a recent study by researchers at Duke University \nindicates that expanded funding for medical research can help keep \nMedicare and other federal health care programs solvent for the long-\nterm.\n  If the goal of this budget resolution is to protect Medicare, it \nmakes no sense to prevent tobacco revenues from being used to support \nanti-smoking programs that will reduce future costs for Medicare.\n  Currently, smoking-induced diseases cost the federal government over \n$20 billion a year. If we invest in medical research to make Americans \nhealthier, we can save enormous sums, protect these programs for future \ngenerations, and prevent many of the illnesses caused by smoking.\n  The country supports these fundamental priorities, and the Senate \nshould support them too. They have been endorsed by the public health \ncommunity, and by Doctor Koop and Doctor Kessler. They are included in \nvirtually all of the tobacco bills introduced in Congress by \nRepublicans as well as Democrats. I urge my colleagues to support the \nConrad/Lautenberg amendment.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2 p.m. \nthe Senate resume consideration of the Coverdell amendment and there be \n5 minutes equally divided for debate on the Coverdell amendment; \nfollowing that, there be 5 minutes equally divided for closing debate \non the Conrad amendment.\n  I further ask a vote occur on or in relation to the Conrad amendment \nat 2:10, to be followed by a vote on or in relation to the Coverdell \namendment, with 2 minutes of debate equally divided between the votes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I note the second vote would be \nlimited to a 10-minute vote so Senators who come down here should know \nthat they cannot go back and expect to spend 15 or 20 minutes back in \nthe office and still be able to vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is the current unanimous consent situation in the \nSenate, is it not, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator for reminding us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2199\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we now have \n5 minutes equally divided on my amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, my amendment is the middle-class tax \nrelief proposal. It calls on the Government to cut nondefense \ndiscretionary spending by 6.9 percent over the next 5 years. It would \nreturn discretionary spending to a level of 1996. That does not seem \ntoo distant a reach for us. It would produce $200 billion in new tax \nrelief to American workers and it would do it by taking 10 million \nAmerican taxpayers who, simply because they now make over $25,000 a \nyear, have had their taxes increased from 15 percent to 28 percent. In \nother words, if they got a single raise, or because of inflation, that \nhas taken these very modest income families and doubled their taxes.\n  So we are saying we are going to lift the bar and we are going to \nallow those families, 10 million of them, to be pushed back down into \nthe 15 percent tax bracket, remembering that American workers today are \nkeeping less than half their paychecks by the time the Government romps \nthrough their checking account. No wonder we have so much trouble in \nour country in terms of families trying to make ends meet. We don't \nleave them enough resources to do the job we have always\n\n[[Page S2907]]\n\nasked them to do. This is a major step to correct that problem. I might \nadd--how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 45 seconds.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I might add that one of the functional components of \nAmerican liberty was and remains the right of workers to have their \nresources come to them so they can live out their dreams and their \nlives. We have changed this over the years.\n\n  I pointed out this morning, my father kept 80 percent of his lifetime \nwages, he was born in 1912, and his granddaughter will be lucky if she \nkeeps 40 percent of her lifetime wages. That will functionally change \nthe way this country governs itself and lives. We must restore economic \nliberty to American workers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I have 2\\1/2\\ minutes to respond. I \nwon't take 2\\1/2\\ minutes because I want to yield some time to Senator \nConrad. But I want to tell you something. My father kept 100 percent of \nhis wages. They were so meager he couldn't pay taxes on them. But he \nhad an opportunity to work whenever he could, and he held his head high \nand he loved America every day that he lived here, and that is what we \nare talking about. We can beat ourselves to death about how terrible \nconditions are here when people are living longer, living better, and \nenjoying life better than ever before in the history of mankind--\nincluding in America. I am proud of this country and, as I said \nearlier: America, America the beautiful.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Conrad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2174\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, my amendment is designed to allow the \nreserve fund for possible tobacco revenues to be used for more than \njust Medicare. My amendment is cosponsored by the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Bingaman of New Mexico, \nand Senator Reed of Rhode Island. While we acknowledge Medicare is an \nimportant priority, we understand it is not the only priority. We all \nunderstand if tobacco legislation passes, there are other things that \nare necessary for a national tobacco policy. The health community has \ntold us very clearly we need to fund smoking cessation, smoking \nprevention. We need to promote and support additional health research. \nWe also need to be able to fund counteradvertising and also ease the \ntransition for farmers. All of those are things that need to be funded \nby a possible tobacco settlement.\n  Unfortunately, under the terms of the budget resolution, none of \nthose things are possible, none of them, even though every bill that \nhas been introduced on the floor, every comprehensive piece of \nlegislation, by Republicans and Democrats, has said that these other \npriorities also need to be funded.\n  Here are the priorities in each of the comprehensive bills that have \nbeen introduced: Tobacco revenue should be provided for smoking \neducation initiatives, to educate our young people. The Republican \nbudget resolution says no, not one dime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on the amendment has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask for 1 additional minute. I ask for \nan additional 1 minute. I would go on to the amendment itself, that \ngives me an additional 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, there is a unanimous consent agreement, so we \nwill not disagree. We will give you the minute. I am not objecting.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We are saying, in addition, tobacco revenues need to be \nused for counteradvertising. The resolution says no, none of the money \ncan be used for that purpose.\n  We say some of the money needs to be used for tobacco-related \nresearch. The resolution says no, none of the money can be used for \nthat purpose.\n  We think some of the money needs to be used to fund smoking \nprevention and cessation programs. The resolution says no, none of the \nmoney can be used for that purpose.\n  We think some of it should be used to assist farmers in the \ntransition. The resolution says no, none of the money.\n  We will be told that, in fact, there is money in other parts of the \nbudget, but all of us who are budgeteers understand that those are \nassumptions. There is no assurance whatever that 1 penny will be \navailable for these purposes from these other funds. And even if they \nwere available, under the assumptions of the Budget Committee, they are \nwoefully inadequate. They only provide about $100 million a year when \nthe health community tells us we need at least $2 billion a year if we \nare really going to have a chance to reduce youth smoking and protect \nthe public health.\n  We have an opportunity now to respond and broaden the use of the \nreserve fund so we can have comprehensive tobacco legislation pass in \nthis Chamber. The only way any of the bills that are before us now will \nbe in order on the floor of the Senate is if my amendment passes.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I gather I have 5 minutes to respond?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have 2\\1/2\\ minutes--it was 5 minutes equally \ndivided.\n  Mr. President, this is a very simple proposition. Do you want to \nstart and create five new entitlement programs or do you want to save \nMedicare? It is a very simple proposition. We suggested, as \nRepublicans, that Social Security and Medicare are the two most \nimportant American programs to save, reform, and make available well \ninto the next century.\n  We put our money where our mouth is, and we put whatever is left of \nthe cigarette settlement on the highest priority health expenditure of \nthis Nation: the salvaging and reforming of the Medicare system.\n  In contrast, my good friend who offers this amendment says, ``Let's \ncreate five new entitlement programs.'' Even though the money will run \nout someday, we will have some permanent programs.\n  Everyone knows this Nation should not have new entitlement programs, \nand everyone knows that there are many high-priority items in the \nAmerican budget. We have said in our budget that we have made room for \nhigh-priority expenditures, and I will tell you quickly what they are:\n  $15.5 billion increase in the National Institutes of Health. We have \ntaken Presidential reductions and said we will spend them here;\n  $825 million for a smoking cessation program, twice the size of the \nPresident's;\n  And then we have said in our settlement of the tobacco fund, if it \never occurs, we pay the States their share and the rest of it goes to \nthe program most in need--Medicare.\n  Let me tell you, there is no relationship between some of the new \nentitlement programs that some want to create out of this tobacco \nsettlement, but there is a direct relationship between the insolvency \nof the Medicare fund and tobacco smoking. As a matter of fact, in 1995 \nthere was $25 billion of costs in the Medicare system that came from \nsmoking. So if you are going to get money from the tobacco settlement, \nput it where the damage to the senior citizens is occurring, and it is \noccurring by virtue of their fund for medical care going bankrupt.\n  I believe the issue is very simple--very simple: Do you want a budget \nthat begins to help with Medicare, or do you want a budget that says \nnot one nickel for Medicare; let's take care of that later with money \nfrom somewhere else.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom North Dakota has 44 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, this issue is simple. The question is, Are \nwe going to have a reserve fund so that there is a solution to the \ntobacco controversy, that we can use the money in a way that \naccommodates every comprehensive bill that is before this body, \nintroduced by Republicans or Democrats?\n  Unfortunately, under the budget resolution, the money can only go for \none purpose: Medicare. While that is an important priority, there are \nother priorities as well--smoking cessation, smoking prevention, health \nresearch, countertobacco advertising, easing the transition for \nfarmers. We should not\n\n[[Page S2908]]\n\nbe creating supermajority hurdles in the way of tobacco legislation, \nand the only way we avoid that is to pass this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the pending amendment is not germane to \nprovisions of the Budget Act. Pursuant to section 305(b)(2) of the \nBudget Act, I raise a point of order against the pending amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I move to waive the Budget Act, and I ask \nfor the yeas and nays on the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act with respect to amendment No. 2174. The yeas and \nnays have been ordered.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2199\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, what is the next order of business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 2 minutes of debate equally divided \nbefore the vote on the Coverdell amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, there are a number of Senators who want \nus to tender amendments on their behalf. We will start to accumulate \nthem. When the next vote is over, we will get them in.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Coverdell for his \nleadership on this issue. It is one that is important to American \nfamilies. It represents an important step toward a flatter, fairer tax \nsystem, and it also provides immediate tax relief for hard-working \nAmericans and their families. The amendment provides broad-based middle \nclass tax relief by increasing the number of individuals who pay the \nlowest tax rates of 15 percent and significantly lessening the impact \nof one of the Tax Code's most inequitable provisions, the marriage \npenalty. An estimated 28 percent of Americans would reap some benefit \nfrom the broad-based tax relief provisions in the bill, according to \nthe Tax Foundation.\n  Again, I thank Senator Coverdell for his leadership on this issue in \nthe ongoing efforts to reduce the tax burden on the American citizens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, first I make the point that the \npending amendment is not germane, and therefore I will raise a point of \norder. Also, Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the McCain-\nCoverdell amendment. The amendment would cut domestic programs like \neducation, child care, law enforcement, veterans, environmental \nprotection, and would violate current budget rules. I think it is \nfiscally dangerous and irresponsible, and I hope we will marshal a vote \nagainst this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia has 30 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, I wish to offer a few remarks to make \nclear my vote on the Conrad amendment. I don't want to see a potential \ntobacco settlement degenerate into just a piggy bank for the Clinton \nAdministration's plans to expand social programs. Certainly, the \nrevenues need to go to health care, but I will not let the Senate \nforget about tobacco farmers. I voted for this amendment today\n\n[[Page S2909]]\n\nbecause it included the tobacco farmers, and the Smith amendment does \nnot. I do not want my vote to imply an endorsement of other programs in \nthis amendment, however, and I do not want to see public health \nprograms turned into politicized slush funds. I think that this \nscenario poses a real danger. However, I want to see the Senate on \nrecord in support of farmers, and this amendment recognizes the need to \nprotect them from the impact of tobacco legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is amendment No. 2175 by \nthe Senator from Illinois, Senator Moseley-Braun.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I ask unanimous consent the pending amendment be \ntemporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Wisconsin \nwho just wants to make an introduction. I give him 1 minute of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FINDINGS AND SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) while it is important to study the effects of class \n     size on learning and study the need to hire more teachers, \n     each type of study must be carried out in conjunction with an \n     effort to ensure that there will be quality teachers in every \n     classroom;\n       (2) all children deserve well-educated teachers;\n       (3) there is a teacher quality crisis in the United States;\n       (4) individuals entering a classroom as teachers should \n     have a sound grasp on the subject the individuals intend to \n     teach, and the individuals should know how to teach;\n       (5) less than 40 percent of the individuals teaching core \n     subjects (consisting of English, mathematics, science, social \n     studies, and foreign languages) majored or minored in the \n     core subjects;\n       (6) the quality of teachers impacts student achievement;\n       (7) the measure of a good teacher is how much and how well \n     the teacher's students learn;\n       (8) teachers should have the opportunity to learn new \n     technology and teaching methods through the establishment of \n     teacher training facilities so that teachers can share their \n     new knowledge and experiences with children in the classroom;\n       (9) school officials should have the flexibility the \n     officials need to have teachers in their schools adequately \n     trained to meet strenuous teacher standards;\n       (10) knowledgeable and eager individuals of sound character \n     and various professional backgrounds should be encouraged to \n     enter kindergarten through grade 12 classrooms as teachers; \n     and\n       (11) States should have maximum flexibility and incentives \n     to create alternative teacher certification and licensure \n     programs in order to recruit well-educated people into the \n     teaching profession.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals in this concurrent resolution on \n     the budget assume--\n       (1) the enactment of legislation to provide assistance for \n     programs that--\n       (A) focus on teacher training delivered through local \n     partnerships, with private and public partners, to ensure \n     that current and future teachers possess necessary teaching \n     skills and knowledge of subject areas; and\n       (B) focus on alternative certification to recruit \n     knowledgeable and eager individuals of sound character to \n     enter kindergarten through grade 12 classrooms as teachers;\n       (2) that the quality of teachers can be strengthened by \n     improving the academic knowledge of teachers in the subject \n     areas in which the teachers teach;\n       (3) that institutions of higher education should be held \n     accountable to prepare teachers who are highly competent in \n     the subject areas in which the teachers teach, including \n     preparing teachers by providing training in the effective \n     uses of technologies in classrooms; and\n       (4) that there should be recruitment into teaching of high \n     quality individuals, including individuals from other \n     occupations.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand that amendment will be put \nin the process whereby it will be assigned an opportunity to be voted \non, if that is the case, in due course.\n  Mr. President, I might discuss with the distinguished Senator from \nNew Jersey where we are now. Senator Tim Johnson has an amendment that \nhe would like not only to call up but to take 3 or 4 minutes on. I am a \ncosponsor. I think we should accept it. We might be able to get that \none done today.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I appreciate the fact the manager is going to yield \nto our friend from South Dakota.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2210, as modified\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding repair and \n                 construction needs of Indian schools)\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to send a \nmodified version of the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to modify his \namendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2210) as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of Title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC  . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING REPAIR AND CONSTRUCTION \n                   NEEDS OF INDIAN SCHOOLS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) many of our nation's tribal schools are in a state of \n     serious disrepair. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) \n     operates 187 school facilities nationwide. Enrollment in \n     these schools, which presently numbers 47,214 students, has \n     been growing rapidly. A recent General Accounting Office \n     report indicates that the repair backlog in these schools \n     totals $754 million, and that the BIA schools are in \n     generally worse condition than all schools nationally;\n\n[[Page S2910]]\n\n       (2) approximately 60 of these schools are in need of \n     complete replacement or serious renovation. Many of the \n     renovations include basic structural repair for the safety of \n     children, new heating components to keep students warm, and \n     roofing replacement to keep the snow and rain out of the \n     classroom. In addition to failing to provide adequate \n     learning environments for Indian children, these repair and \n     replacement needs pose a serious liability issue for the \n     Federal government;\n       (3) sixty-three percent of the BIA schools are over 30 \n     years old, and twenty-six percent are over 50 years old. \n     Approximately forty percent of all students in BIA schools \n     are in portable classrooms. Originally intended as temporary \n     facilities while tribes awaited new construction funds, these \n     ``portables'' have a maximum 10 year life-span. Because of \n     the construction backlog, children have been shuffling \n     between classrooms in the harsh climates of the Northern \n     plains and Western states for ten to fifteen years;\n       (4) annual appropriations for BIA education facilities \n     replacement and repair combined have averaged $20-$30 million \n     annually, meeting only 4% of total need. At the present rate, \n     one deteriorating BIA school can be replaced each year, with \n     estimates of completion of nine schools in the next seven \n     years. Since the new construction and repair backlog is so \n     great and growing, the current focus at BIA construction must \n     remain on emergency and safety needs only, without \n     prioritizing program needs such as increasing enrollment or \n     technology in the classroom; and\n       (5) unlike most schools, the BIA schools are a \n     responsibility of the federal government. Unfortunately, the \n     failure of the federal government to live up to this \n     responsibility has come at the expense of quality education \n     for some of this nation's poorest children with the fewest \n     existing opportunities to better themselves.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     budget resolution assume that the repair and construction \n     backlog affecting Bureau of Indian Affairs school facilities \n     should be eliminated over a period of no more than five years \n     beginning with Fiscal Year 1999, and that the President \n     should submit to Congress a plan for the orderly elimination \n     of this backlog.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from New Mexico yield time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I believe he is calling up an amendment and he has time \non the amendment.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, the amendment that is being offered is \nwith the cooperation of Chairman Domenici. It is cosponsored by \nSenators Daschle, Dorgan, Bingaman, Wellstone, McCain, Kohl, Conrad and \nMurray, and it is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, which is designed \nto reflect on the crisis that we have with Indian school funding in the \nUnited States today. This is an issue that Chairman Domenici has shared \nwith me as a matter of great concern on the Senate Budget Committee.\n  We recognize the budget resolution assumes $166 million will be \nallocated for Indian school repair work and replacement work. However, \nwe recognize this is part of the budget resolution and is not binding \non the Appropriations Committee.\n  There is a need to raise the visibility of the very real crisis that \nexists in terms of BIA school funding and replacement needs. That is \nthe purpose of this sense of the Senate. The BIA manages some 143 \nschools within the United States. It is a Federal responsibility. This \nis not a question of whether the Federal Government ought to be \ninvolved in these schools or not. In this instance, these schools are \nFederal property and it is a Federal responsibility.\n  We have a repair and replacement backlog now of about $754 million. \nThe rate at which we have been replacing some 60 schools that currently \nare in need of replacement has been at about one per year. So obviously \nthe backlog is getting larger and larger as we go about this kind of \nunderfunded replacement and renovation.\n  Mr. President, 40 percent of the BIA students attending class are \nattending class in portable classrooms. We have a fast-growing \npopulation attending these schools, and it is clear that something far \ndifferent from what we have been doing in the past is absolutely \nessential if, in fact, we are going to meaningfully address this \nbacklog.\n  It is our concern that we have to infuse more resources into the \nbacklog problem, and that we have greater direction from the White \nHouse itself, from the BIA itself, relative to a concrete plan to get \nthis done over a relatively modest timeframe, over the next 5 years.\n  So this resolution calls on the administration to work with us in \narriving at a plan that is infused with sufficient funds to make \nsignificant progress over these coming years on this backlog. This \nresolution will send a signal, and I think an important signal, to the \nappropriators and to the administration that this is a crisis that we \nrecognize and we acknowledge, and for which there is a bipartisan \nconcern.\n  So that is the thrust of this resolution. I commend Chairman Domenici \nfor working with me, and for the work of his staff, working with my \nstaff, trying to arrive at a strategy that is constructive and is \nmeaningful on this problem. The Senator represents a State with a \nsignificant Indian population, suffering many of the same problems that \nthe Native American population in my State of South Dakota suffer. So \nthis is a problem about which we jointly share a great concern.\n  The chairman is commended for a longstanding commitment to trying to \nenhance opportunities and the quality of life for the Native American \npopulation of his State and around the United States in general. This \nis one area where we both agree; I believe that higher visibility and a \nhigher level of commitment is badly needed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if the Senator will yield me 5 minutes?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I yield the Senator 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First, I want to ask, did the Senator name me as a \ncosponsor?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Yes; I did.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if Senator Bingaman of New Mexico has been \nasked about being a cosponsor?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Senator Bingaman was also named. We are very proud to \nhave both Senators from New Mexico on this amendment as cosponsors.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is Senator Campbell, the chairman of the Indian Affairs \nCommittee, on it?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. We do not have Senator Campbell on it. Senator Campbell \nheld a hearing and a mark-up today at his committee, and we have not \nbeen able to reach him on this amendment as yet.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if you would mind having him called and we \nwill modify it by adding him on it. I think we should ask to have the \nchairman on it.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. That is a good idea.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What has been amazing to the Senator from New Mexico is \nthe way the U.S. Government fails to recognize its sole and singular \nresponsibility. We are busy all the time, every year, with budgets that \ntry to do new things. Frankly, the President of the United States had a \nvery long list of new things, new programs. In fact, he had a \nsuggestion that we use a lot of the money for helping classroom size, \nhelping build public schools. But the real problem here is that if we \ndo not rebuild the Indian schools that are run by the Government and \nput them under some management and maintenance, nobody will. They don't \nbelong to anybody else. They are not being run by the State of Georgia, \nor the school board of Bernalillo County, Albuquerque. It is either we \ndo it or the Indian young people go to school in buildings that are not \nfit for occupancy, much less for Indian education.\n  I don't know what to do about it. The Senator from New Mexico doesn't \nknow what to do about it. I work at it every year. We need to get some \nproposal to get this huge backlog taken care of and get on with being \nable to say to our Indian young people and the teachers who are in \nthose schools, ``We think enough of you to give you a school that \noffers you an opportunity like the rest of Americans to get educated.'' \nThe school building doesn't make the child, but I tell you, you can \nhave a bad enough school building that the child can hardly learn.\n  So I have asked that this resolution contain another provision, just \nin an effort to see if we can get there, and that provision, which was \nin the modification that Senator Johnson sent to the desk, asked the \nPresident of the United States--if I am not correct--it asked the \nPresident to submit to us by a date certain a 5-year plan to see to it \nthat, regarding the Indian schools the Government owns, the Government \nmust maintain them or they will not get maintained, and those where we \nhave to build a new one because the old one is decrepit, that entire \npackage be put in a 5-year plan and the President\n\n[[Page S2911]]\n\nrecommend to us how we might get that done.\n  Frankly, I believe unless and until that shows up in a Presidential \nbudget, we are not going to find the resources in the Senate or the \nHouse to do what we must do. This is not a little $50 million problem; \nthis is a hundreds-of-million-dollar problem. So I believe we are on to \nsomething here in this resolution. It is not just a hollow one; it is \none that is to get something back from the Chief Executive of America, \nand it is going to tell us whether we agree on this problem, and if \nthey do, how do we take care of it in a given number of years.\n  I anxiously await, and I will see to it that we hold this in \nconference, because I think it is the kind of thing that should be in \nthe budget. Some sense-of-the-Senates don't belong in, but this belongs \nin because this is a problem we can't fix in a budget resolution. We \ncan hardly fix it in appropriations, as you know. So, Senator, thanks \nfor your leadership. I am glad to be on board. This will be welcome \nnews in Indian country.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I thank the chairman for his supportive remarks here. \nThe chairman has a great understanding, profound understanding, of the \nimmensity of the problem that this country faces relative to Indian \nschools and the need for White House leadership on this issue. We will \nwork with the White House in that regard, but it is going to require a \ncooperative effort if we are going to have any success on a problem of \nthis immensity.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Kohl, Conrad, \nInouye, and Murray be added as cosponsors to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. And the \nSenator from North Dakota?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will be proud to be made a cosponsor of \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me just take 30 seconds.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I support fully the comments made by the \nSenators from South Dakota and New Mexico, and in fact I hope in just a \nmoment to be able to speak off the bill on the Moseley-Braun amendment, \nand I intend to address a few of these issues with respect to that as \nwell. And I am pleased the Senator offered the amendment and pleased to \nhear the comments of the Senator from New Mexico as a cosponsor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Johnson \namendment, which expresses the sense of the Senate about the need to \naddress the Bureau of Indian Affairs school construction backlog.\n  The conditions at the schools on America's Indian reservations are \nsome of the worst in the nation. They are truly deplorable. In January, \nI accompanied the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs on a tour of \nthe Standing Rock Community School at Fort Yates, North Dakota. I wish \nevery one of my colleagues in the Senate could see the conditions at \nthis school. The school was built in an open-classroom design, without \nwalls between the classrooms. The noise at the school can be deafening \nat times, and this is not an environment in which students can learn. \nHow is it that we can have a school in which the physical conditions \nactually prohibit learning from happening? In addition, the heating and \ncooling system at the school is grossly inadequate, so it can be 50 \ndegrees in one wing of the school, and 80 degrees in another.\n  As bad as this is, things have recently gotten worse: the lights at \nthis school and the local elementary school have begun to leak an oily \nsubstance that has been found to contain PCBs. The Bureau of Indian \nAffairs is in the process of removing these lights and conducting \nadditional testing for further contamination. They are also testing the \nceiling tiles, which preliminary tests show may contain dioxin. To \nprotect the health of the students, the schools were shut down for \nweeks. The BIA is in the process of reopening the schools' classrooms \nand other facilities, as clean-up is completed. These conditions pose \nserious threats to the health of the children of the Standing Rock \nReservation. How can we ask families to sent their children to be \neducated in such deplorable conditions?\n  In looking at conditions at schools throughout Indian Country, the \nStanding Rock Community is not an anomaly. In January, the GAO released \na report on conditions at BIA schools and the costs to repair these \nschools. The BIA estimates that the costs of total inventory repair \nneed for BIA education facilities is $754 million.\n  Data from a 1994 National Schools Facilities Survey conducted by GAO \nshow that BIA schools are generally in poorer physical condition, have \nmore unsatisfactory environmental factors, more often lack key \nfacilities requirements for educational reform, and are less able to \nsupport computer and communications technology, compared to other \nschools nationwide.\n  Of the conditions found at BIA schools:\n  62 percent had at least one building in less than adequate condition, \ncompared with 33 percent of all schools.\n  79 percent had at least one inadequate building feature (such as \nroofs, floors, foundations, plumbing, heating, electrical power, and \nlife safety codes). Nationwide, 57 percent of all schools had at least \none inadequate building feature.\n  94 percent had at least one unsatisfactory environmental condition, \ncompared with 50 percent of schools nationwide. Environmental \nconditions include lighting, heating, ventilation, indoor air quality, \nacoustics, flexibility of instructional space, energy efficiency, and \nphysical security of building.\n  These are serious school construction needs--about $754 million \nworth--that should be addressed, and should be addressed quickly. The \nJohnson amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that the BIA school \nconstruction backlog should be eliminated within five years. We need a \nserious, sustained effort to get the job done and provide a safe \nenvironment in which Native American children can get an education.\n  The Johnson amendment also requires the Administration to submit to \nCongress a plan for how this construction backlog will be addressed. As \na member of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, I intend to work \nclosely with Kevin Gover, Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, to \nensure that the job gets done. Assistant Secretary Gover visited North \nDakota and quickly grasped the magnitude of the school construction \nproblem. He has made a commitment to me and other members of the \nCommittee to take action on this school construction backlog.\n  We cannot let these conditions persist. We cannot let the BIA school \nconstruction backlog continue to grow out of control. And we cannot \ncontinue to ask parents to send their children to school where learning \ncannot take place and where serious health hazards exist. I hope that \nall of my colleagues will vote for the Johnson amendment and show their \nsupport for the will-being of Native American children.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today there is a $1.5 billion backlog of \nrepairs, renovation, and replacement for all federally owned and \noperated BIA schools, including elementary, secondary, and post-\nsecondary schools.\n  A December, 1997 report by the General Accounting Office (GAO) \nconcluded that ``the cost of the total inventory of repairs needed for \nBIA education facilities (elementary and secondary only) is $754 \nmillion. This includes $693 million for repairs to school buildings, \nincluding dormitories for students. It also includes $61.7 million in \nrepairs needed for education quarters such as employee housing.\n  The footnote to this estimate notes that $754 million ``does not \ninclude the costs of replacing school buildings. BIA's priority list \nfor constructing education facilities includes eight unfunded school \nreplacement projects with a total estimated cost of $112 million.''\n\n\n                   The BIA Construction Priority List\n\n  Mr. President, we in the Senate who pay close attention to this BIA \npriority list for school construction are well aware that this list has \nbeen frozen for several years now. This means that the eight school \nscheduled for replacement are the ones on this frozen priority list. I \nam attaching this list of 16 total BIA schools from the \nAdministration's FY 1999 budget request for the Record.\n\n[[Page S2912]]\n\n  Obviously, a school that is replaced would be deleted from the list \nof school needing repair. The GAO report includes the costs of schools \nscheduled for replacement. In short, the GAO estimate does not fully \nestimate the costs of replacement schools.\n  To get a rough idea of the costs of replacing these schools, \nincluding those that are not on the frozen priority list, I have \nchecked with the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, Kevin Gover. \nHis office informs me that 50% of the 185 BIA schools are over 30 years \nold and fail to meet current codes and standards.\n  The GAO, has noted that 25% of BIA schools are over 50 years old, \nand, of course fail to meet the same standards for safety and teaching.\n\n\n            Total BIA Schools Needing Replacement and Repair\n\n  There are 93 BIA schools that should be replaced--well beyond the \ncurrent priority list of 16. At an average cost of $180 per square \nfoot, these 93 schools would cost one billion dollars to replace.\n  Replacing these 93 oldest BIA schools would leave about $200 million \nin repair and renovation costs for the remaining 92 BIA schools.\n  This simple arithmetic gives us a current estimate of about $1.2 \nbillion to bring all federally operated BIA schools up to par.\n\n\n                       Indian Community Colleges\n\n  These Indian community colleges fall into two categories: those run \nby the BIA and those that are tribally controlled community colleges.\n  In the first category, those run by the BIA, Haskell (Kansas) and \nSIPI (Albuquerque) are the only two that are fully federally operated \nby the BIA. The BIA now has 26 tribally controlled community colleges \neligible to receive funds through the Tribally Controlled Community \nColleges Act, and one more, United Tribes Technical College, funded \nthrough the BIA's Community Development funds.\n  In total, then, there are 29 Indian Community Colleges with direct \nBIA funding, and one, Crownpoint Institute of Technology, that is \nfunded primarily through the Carl Perkins Vocational Education program \nof the U.S. Department of Education.\n  These Indian community colleges have an estimated repair and \nrenovation cost of about $310 million. Replacement costs, such as the \nShiprock branch of Navajo Community College, are not included. The \nShiprock branch is estimating the costs for a new campus at about $28 \nmillion. The need for married student housing at Crownpoint Institute \nof Technology is also not included.\n\n\n            Total BIA Schools and Indian Community Colleges\n\n  For the sake of simplicity, we can easily estimate that total repair, \nrenovation, and replacement costs for all elementary, secondary, and \npost-secondary BIA schools and tribal schools eligible for BIA funds, \nexceed $1.5 billion.\n\n\n                       GAO Report on BIA Schools\n\n  For the benefit of my colleagues, I would like to submit an edited \nversion of the GAO study on Indian school repair needs. Please keep in \nmind that this report is focused on elementary and secondary schools \nonly.\n  The GAO finds that 47,200 Indian students are served by 173 schools. \nThe BIA count is 185 schools and over 50,000 students. The BIA schools \nrange in size from 15 to 1,144 students, with about half of these \nschools enrolling fewer than 200 pupils.\n  Growth is very high in these schools with an increase in student \nenrollment of 25 percent since 1987. Most of this growth has occurred \nin the last 5 years.\n  About 10 percent of all Indian students attend BIA schools, funded or \noperated by the BIA. The vast majority or 90% of Indian students in \nAmerica attend regular public schools.\n  BIA schools are located in 23 states, but are highly concentrated in \n5 states--North Dakota, South Dakota, Arizona, New Mexico, and \nWashington.\n  BIA schools are generally in poorer physical condition that even \ncentral city schools and lack more key facility requirements than \ntypical American schools.\n  The BIA schools are older and less able to support computer and \ncommunications technology than average American schools.\n\n\n       Conclusion (S. Res. 100 on Education of American Indians)\n\n  In addition to the physical needs of our federally operated Indian \nschools and colleges, there is a parallel crisis in operating funds for \nIndian schools nationwide.\n  American Indian students have the highest dropout rate of any racial \nethnic group (36%) and the lowest high school completion and college \nattendance rates of any minority group.\n  Average annual funding for Indian college students is $2,900 compared \nto $6,200 for Americans as a whole.\n  Senate Resolution 100, introduced in the First Session of this \nCongress which I introduced with the cosponsorship of Senators \nCampbell, Inouye, Johnson, Dorgan, and Wellstone, discusses the overall \nsituation of Indian education and calls upon the 105th Congress to \naddress these issues through major education bills under consideration.\n  I urge my colleagues to review Senate Resolution 100, and support its \npassage by this body in order to draw more needed attention to the \nmajor problems we face today in Indian education.\n  I ask unanimous consent that S. Res. 100 be printed in the Record, \nalong with the BIA school construction priority list, and my summary of \nthe GAO report on Indian school repairs.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                    replacement school construction\n\n       Program Description ($19,200,000: During fiscal years 1991 \n     thru 1997, $117.2 million was appropriated to complete \n     construction of schools at Laguna, Choctaw, Dunseith, Pine \n     Ridge, and the Haskell Dormitory, as well as the first eight \n     schools on the Replacement School Construction Priority List \n     (List). Funds appropriated in FY 1998 were used to start \n     construction of the Many Farms School complex. This school is \n     ranked no. 4 on the Replacement School Priority List (List). \n     Funds appropriated in FY 1998 will be used to accomplish site \n     work at both the Sac & Fox Settlement School and the Pyramid \n     Lake High School. These schools are ranked 10 and 11, \n     respectively, on the List. Congress also funded this \n     rebuilding of the Wa-He-Lut School which was completed in \n     seven months and is occupied.

The \n     schools ranged in size from 15 to 1,144 students, with about \n     one-half enrolling fewer than 200 pupils.\n       Enrollment in BIA schools is growing and overall has \n     increased 25 percent since 1987. Most of this growth has \n     occurred in the last 5 years.\n\n\n                   GAO Estimates on Nation's Schools\n\n       We estimated that the nation's schools needed about $112 \n     billion (+/- 6.6% sampling error) to repair or upgrade \n     facilities to good overall condition. Responses to our survey \n     indicated that about 33 percent of America's schools reported \n     needing extensive repair or replacement of one or more \n     buildings; almost 60 percent reported problems with at least \n     one major building feature, such as plumbing; and about 50 \n     percent reported unsatisfactory environmental conditions.\n       Furthermore, many reported lacking critical physical \n     capabilities to meet the functional requirements of education \n     reform and key technology elements to support computers and \n     communications technology.\n\n\n                        Isolation of BIA Schools\n\n       BIA officials told us that BIA schools are often located in \n     isolated areas and have to provide and maintain extensive \n     campus infrastructures because they are too far from \n     population centers to have access to town or city services. \n     For example, one school we visited had to house and maintain \n     a fire truck on campus because it is too far from the nearest \n     city to use its fire department.\n       In addition, some schools must provide dormitory space for \n     students and/or housing for faculty and staff because they \n     are so distant from population centers. BIA officials told us \n     that this isolation may also contribute to maintenance \n     difficulties and costs when materials have to be shipped long \n     distances and construction/repair staff have to be housed \n     while on site.\n\n\n                           Age of BIA Schools\n\n       Officials also told us that about 25 percent of BIA school \n     buildings are at least 50 years old, and many of these \n     buildings are on the National Historic Register. BIA \n     officials told us that this listing often restricts the \n     ability to make education-related renovations and \n     improvements.\n\n\n                     BIA to Update Repair Inventory\n\n  BIA reports that, as of October 1997, the cost of the total inventory \nof repairs needed for education facilities at all BIA schools is $754 \nmillion. This includes $693 million for repairs to school buildings, \nincluding dormitories for students. It also includes $61.7 million in \nrepairs needed for education quarters such as employee housing.\n  BIA's inventory of repairs needed--the facilities backlog--is an \namalgam of information collected by architects, engineers, and BIA \nstaff over the years. The inventory describes in detail individual work \nitems required by national standards and codes such as the Uniform \nBuilding Code, National Fire Codes, and National Electrical Codes to \nrepair the facilities. The facilities backlog contains the repair cost \nfor deficiencies identified in a building or at a site.\n  The deficiencies may involve safety and health, access for persons \nwith disabilities, or noncompliance with other building codes. BIA is \ncurrently developing a new Facilities Management Information System and \nwill be validating and reassessing the entire facilities backlog and \ninventory. The validation will include professional estimates of the \ncost of all backlog repair items and a determination of the relative \neconomic values of repair versus replacement. The system development \nand validation projects are scheduled for completion in fiscal year \n1999.\n  Our 1994 survey asked school officials to estimate the total cost of \nall repairs, renovations, and modernizations required to put their \nschool buildings in good overall condition. The amounts reported by the \n71 BIA schools responding to our survey were generally in agreement \nwith BIA's estimates of the costs required to address the inventory of \nrepairs needed at these schools.\n\n                              S. Res. 100\n\n       Whereas there exists a unique legal and political \n     relationship between the United States and tribal governments \n     and a unique Federal responsibility to American Indians and \n     Alaska Natives;\n       Whereas, under law and practice, the United States has \n     undertaken a trust responsibility to protect and preserve \n     Indian tribes, Indians, and tribal assets and resources;\n       Whereas the Federal Government's commitment to Indian \n     education has been recognized, reinforced, and carried out \n     through most treaties with Indian tribes, Congressional \n     legislation, numerous court decisions and Presidential \n     executive orders;\n       Whereas this Federal responsibility includes working with \n     tribal governments and their members to improve the education \n     of tribal members;\n       Whereas the 1990 census shows the poverty rate for American \n     Indians and Alaska Natives was nearly twice the national \n     average--31 percent of Indians live below the poverty level, \n     compared to 13 percent of the total population. Nearly 38 \n     percent of Indian children above the age of 5 were living \n     below the poverty level in 1990, compared with 11 percent of \n     non-minority children;\n       Whereas the development of tribal economies is dependent on \n     physical infrastructure, capital investment, and highly \n     developed human capital and an educated labor force;\n       Whereas excellence in educational facilities and services \n     is a key to building the skills necessary for Indian people \n     to develop vibrant tribal economies;\n       Whereas ever-increasing regional, national, and \n     international economic competition demands that Indians have \n     every competitive advantage accruing from achieving \n     excellence in education;\n       Whereas there are approximately 600,000 American Indian and \n     Alaska Native children attending schools in this country. An \n     estimated 87 percent of these children attend public schools \n     located on or near reservations and in urban areas; another \n     10 percent attend schools funded by the Bureau of Indian \n     Affairs (BIA) and an estimated 3 percent attend private \n     schools;\n       Whereas these schools have experienced an increase in \n     student population of 3-4 percent in the past 5 years, \n     however, annual funding for the education of Indian children \n     has not increased proportionately;\n       Whereas United States census data shows that the Indian and \n     Alaska Native population has increased significantly in the \n     past three decades. Primary growth concentrations are at ages \n     5 through 19;\n       Whereas the 1994 National Assessment of Education Progress \n     (NAEP) showed over 50 percent of American Indian fourth \n     graders scored below the basic level in reading proficiency, \n     compared with 42 percent of all students;\n       Whereas American Indian students have the highest dropout \n     rate of any racial ethnic group (36 percent) and the lowest \n     high school completion and college attendance rates of any \n     minority group. As of 1990, only 66 percent of American \n     Indians aged 25 years or older were high school graduates, \n     compared to 78 percent of the general population;\n       Whereas the demonstrated need for improvements to Indian \n     schools and colleges is acute as reflected in the great \n     disparity between average annual college funding per student \n     of $2,900 for Indian students, and $6,200 for non-Indians in \n     America, and the Federal Government should assist in bringing \n     the Indian schools and colleges up to parity with the rest of \n     America;\n       Whereas tribal scholarship programs nationally are only \n     able to serve an estimated 40 percent of the eligible college \n     student population and funding for graduate scholarships has \n     been cut in half in the past 2 years;\n       Whereas there is a major backlog of $680 million in funding \n     need for facilities constructions, maintenance and repair for \n     the 185 BIA-funded schools as well as for public schools \n     located on and near Indian reservations;\n       Whereas there exists an alarming decline in the use of \n     Native languages indigenous to the United States. A 1969 \n     Senate Committee report stated that in 1969 there were 300 \n     separate languages still being spoken. In 1996, the number \n     had dropped to 206 still being spoken. These languages are \n     spoken nowhere else in the world; and\n       Whereas, despite these alarming statistics, funding for the \n     education of American Indian and Alaska Native students has \n     been reduced substantially in the past 3 years. The United \n     States Congress in fiscal year 1996 eliminated discretionary \n     education programs in the Office of Indian Education budget \n     which had funded adult education, research and demonstration \n     programs, the Indian Fellowship Program and teacher training \n     and professional development projects. At the same time, \n     funding for reservation-based education programs in the BIA \n     budget was reduced by more than $100 million in the fiscal \n     year 1996 budget: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the United States \n     Senate--\n       (1) that the Senate recognizes and supports the Federal \n     Government's legal and moral commitment to the education of \n     American Indian and Alaska Native children, which is a part \n     of treaties, Executive orders, court decisions and public \n     laws which have been enacted by the House and Senate of the \n     United States Government;\n       (2) that funding for all bills, including reauthorizing \n     legislation in the 105th Congress with specific programs for \n     American Indians and Alaska Natives be funded at levels \n     sufficient to meet the ever-increasing educational and \n     economic demands facing Indian people on reservations, urban \n     communities and Alaska Native villages;\n       (3) that the Senate recognizes the adult literacy needs of \n     American Indians and Alaska Natives through the inclusion of \n     tribal provisions in the administration's proposal to \n     reauthorize the Adult Education Act;\n\n[[Page S2914]]\n\n       (4) that the administration's bill for reauthorization of \n     the Higher Education Act of 1965, Public Law 102-325, \n     preserve the original purpose and intent of the Tribally-\n     Controlled Community Colleges Act and promote access to \n     higher education opportunities for American Indians and \n     Alaska Natives;\n       (5) that during the 105th Congress' reauthorization of \n     agricultural research programs, the needs of tribal colleges \n     as designated land-grant institutions must be given close \n     attention, through amendments to the Educational Equity in \n     Land-Grant Status Act of 1994;\n       (6) that early childhood programs such as Head Start \n     (Public Law 103-252) and Healthy Start contain resources \n     needed to meet a growing number of American Indian and Alaska \n     Native children whose rate of growth exceeds the national \n     average; and\n       (7) that the Senate recognizes the need for development and \n     implementation of a Government-wide policy on Indian \n     education which addresses the needs of American Indian and \n     Alaska Native people.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, from what I understand, we have no \nobjection on this side, and I understand there are no objections on the \nDemocratic side. Therefore, I believe if we yield back our respective \ntimes, we can accept this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If there was time in opposition--I don't know what it \nis--we yield it back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Johnson amendment is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2210), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes, or such time as \nmay be needed, to the Senator from North Dakota. The time is to come \noff the resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor such time as he may consume.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2175\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I very much appreciate Senator Lautenberg \nyielding me the time. I am going to visit a bit some of the items that \nwere just discussed about Indian schools and schools generally. I \nwanted to come and talk about the Moseley-Braun amendment.\n  We talk a lot about family values in this Chamber. It seems to me \nthat every family that sits around in the evening and talks about their \nlives must certainly talk about the schools their kids are going to. We \nhave 14 million students who attend schools in this country now, \nschools that are in need of extensive repair--extensive repair.\n  This afternoon, we sit in a nice Chamber. We have people here who \nenjoy their lives, and they are well dressed. We talk about education \nand theory in the abstract. In Cannonball, ND, today there is some \nlittle kid sitting in school, and I bet you that child is smelling \nsewer gas backed up from the pipes, because that is the way the school \nis down in Cannonball. That school is 70 years old. There are 150 kids \nattending that school with two bathrooms and one water fountain, and \nthat school is in serious disrepair.\n  I just mention that one, but I could mention thousands of schools \nacross this country that are in desperate need of repair. Senator \nMoseley-Braun has proposed an amendment that says in this Budget Act \nlet us make room for school construction, for the Federal Government to \nprovide some incentive, some small incentive to State and local \ngovernments to help repair and rebuild our schools.\n  I have two children in public school this afternoon. Last year in \npublic school, one of those children was in a classroom with 30 \nstudents. That is too big. This year, one of them is in a temporary \nclassroom or an expanded mobile home. That is too bad. It is a good \nschool, and both of them are getting a good education. The fact is, we \ncan do better in all of these areas, especially with respect to school \nconstruction. We know what the problem is and we know how to fix it. \nThe issue of the budget on the floor of the Senate is a matter of \npriorities. What do each of us think is important for this country.\n\n  I watched last week during consideration of the supplemental \nappropriations bill someone come into this Chamber and offered an \namendment that went just like that, just that quick, for $170 million \nfor missile defense. It wasn't debated, it wasn't discussed, it was \njust added. And there it was, $170 million.\n  Let me talk about these schools for a moment, and let me talk \nspecifically about the Indian schools, because while we are talking \nabout the 14 million students who are in school today in schools that \nneed extensive repair, let me talk just for a moment about the students \nin the Indian schools run by the BIA. These are schools owned by the \nFederal Government. They are owned by us. We have no one else to blame \nif we don't fix those schools, and it doesn't take a rocket scientist \nto figure out how to fix it. You can look at the school, find out what \nis wrong and spend the money to invest in that school to help those \nchildren.\n  Let me tell you about the Ojibwa school. That is up on the Turtle \nMountain Indian Reservation. Those children walk between portable \nclassrooms in the middle of the winter up to six times a day in bone-\nchilling weather. A health and safety inspection of that school and \ntemporary classrooms in 1995 found 156 violations--fire hazards, broken \nwindows, roof leaking, wooden stairs and landings for portable \nclassrooms had deteriorated so much to the point they were no longer \nsafe, wires hanging exposed from some classrooms.\n  The Cannonball School is a public school. It is not a BIA school. It \nis on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation for grades K through five. \nThe school is 70 years old. It has been condemned as a fire hazard, but \nthe local tax base cannot support building a new school. The second \nlevel of the school isn't used because the stairs are unsafe. The water \nand sewer systems are old and regularly back up.\n  Last week, when we talked to the Cannonball School superintendent, \nshe said two classes had to be moved in with other classes because the \nsmell of sewage got so bad in the classrooms of these young children. \nOne wing of the school doesn't have running water. Mr. President, 145 \nstudents and 40 staff share two bathrooms and one water fountain. The \nelectric wiring is so old that it cannot support computers in the \nclassrooms, but it doesn't matter, because there can't be computers in \nthese classrooms. The classrooms are 8 foot by 12 foot. The music \nclasses take place in what used to be the janitor's closet, 8 foot by \n10 foot.\n  Standing Rock Reservation: Standing Rock School has PCBs leaking from \nthe light fixtures. PCB, as we know, is a carcinogen. It is very \ndangerous. Federal law says that PCB levels over 50 parts per million \nare unsafe. In the Fort Yates school, the PCBs leaking from the light \nfixtures measured not 50 parts per million, which is unsafe, but \n143,000 parts per million. That is in our school. That is with kids \nattending school.\n  What happened? They shut the school. The took the kids out of the \nschool and placed them around town in portable classrooms, some in a \nhome. Six classes have been meeting in the school gymnasium. The others \nhave been meeting in portable trailers and a private home. The extra \nclasses, like physical education, music and art, of course, have been \nsuspended, and the school officials don't yet know when the students \nwill return to their classrooms.\n\n  PCBs leaking from light fixtures in a school that is in disrepair--\nthis happens to be on an Indian reservation where, incidentally, in 9 \nmonths, 48 teenagers attempted suicide. In the last 9 months, 48 \nattempted suicides, 6 of which were successful.\n  If I sound a little angry about this, I am. Every single year I have \ncome to the floor of the Senate to talk about this problem, and these \nkids go to school in conditions for which we ought to be ashamed. This \nCongress can do something about it, and the\n\n[[Page S2915]]\n\nbudget process is a process in which we make decisions. If someone \nstands up here and says, ``No, school construction doesn't count \nbecause we have other priorities,'' I ask them, ``What is your priority \nif it is not your children?'' By ``your children,'' I mean this \ncountry's children.\n  All across this country, when our kids go to school, I hope every \nparent wants their child to walk into a school that is safe, secure, \nand in good repair. I defy anybody in this Chamber to stand up and say \nto me that kids who go to school where sewer gas leaks into the \nclassrooms and they have to move kids out of those classrooms because \nof the stench of sewer gas, I defy anybody to say it is a good thing \nfor kids. If it is not a good thing for kids, and we know it is going \non around this country--and anecdotically we see it in a GAO report and \nother investigations--then let's decide we want to do something about \nit. The question isn't whether, the question is what.\n  Senator Moseley-Braun has made a proposal. Her proposal is modest. I \nsuspect it will be voted down. It will be voted down because we have \npeople who construct the budget and say, ``Here are our priorities; \nthis is what we want to spend money on, and it doesn't include this.''\n  The amount of school repairs necessary in this country last year--3 \npercent of the funds available to meet the needs of school repairs was \nallocated to the State and local governments last year. If this \nCongress doesn't have the nerve and the will to say on behalf of our \nkids that you matter, this is a problem we know we can fix and we are \ngoing to put in our budget the provisions that allow us to say to kids, \n``We're going to invest in your young lives,'' if this Congress doesn't \nhave the capability to do that, then there is something, in my \njudgment, fundamentally wrong with the priorities we have established \nfor public spending.\n  I said yesterday that everybody in this Chamber will be dead in 100 \nyears. Everybody. Nobody will be around here feeling good, working. \nThey will all be dead. We will all be dead. Only historians will \nevaluate through our budget, by looking back at the budget process in \nthis Congress, the 105th Congress, what were our values; what did we \nthink was important; what did we decide to invest in; what did we think \nwould improve this country.\n  I hope historians will not look back at us and say, ``Well, oh, they \nhad discussions about a terrible deplorable condition in some schools \nin their country, but they decided not to invest in schools, because, \nsomehow, schools took a backseat, schools were in second place to a \nrange of other priorities, some of them very strange priorities.''\n  I hope historians will say that this Congress, yes, in tight fiscal \ntimes decided that one of the most important investments they could \nmake in America was to make a good investment in the education of our \nkids.\n  No kid in this country can go to school and learn the way we expect \nchildren to be able to learn unless those schools are in decent repair. \nThey must be safe, in decent repair, good places of learning. You have \nto have a teacher who knows how to teach, a student who is willing to \nlearn, and a parent involved in that education. When you have that at \nwork and have invested in good school facilities that are necessary to \nmake that take place, then we will have done our job as a country.\n  I wanted to come and say Senator Moseley-Braun has offered an \namendment that is very, very important. I can think of a thousand \nreasons why people will stand up and say they are against it. None of \nthem are good. Mark Twain was once asked to debate--I have told my \ncolleagues this before. He said, ``Of course.''\n  ``We've not told you the subject.''\n  He said, ``Doesn't matter, as long as I can take the negative side; \nthat takes no preparation.''\n  It takes very little preparation to oppose. The Senator from Illinois \nhas proposed something that ought to rank right at the top of the list \nof what is important for this country. When we vote today, I hope the \nAmerican people who listen to this debate will call the offices and \nsay, ``We agree that this represents the first priority for the \nCongress, the first priority for this country, to invest in the lives \nand education of the American children.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield such time as needed to my \ncolleague from Illinois so that she may discuss her amendment. And \nuntil such time as my colleague is ready----\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I am. I thank the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for \nsuch time as she may consume.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Senator from New Jersey for his \nindulgence, for allowing additional time to talk about this issue \nbecause it is such an important issue and we were limited by virtue of \nthe agreement on this budget discussion so we did not get the time to \nreally go through all the details. But I did want to pick up on a \ncouple points that were made while the Senator from North Dakota spoke. \nHe was so eloquent in his support of the legislation. But he touched on \ntwo themes that I would like to touch on or respond to now.\n  The first one goes to, whose job is it? Whose responsibility is it to \nsee to it that our children go to school in environments that are \nsuitable for learning? Whose fault is it? Whose fault is it that we \nhave crumbling schools, that we have schools that fall below building \ncodes? We have schools where the ceilings are falling in because of \nfaulty plumbing. We have schools where the wiring is insufficient to \nmaintain a computer. We have schools with broken windows in this \ncountry.\n  Almost fully a third of the schools, according to the General \nAccounting Office, fall below the code standards, decent environments \nfor learning, just basic kinds of facilities requirements. This is not \nbells and whistles. This is not anything exceptional, just the basic \nlevel of facilities and infrastructure. Almost a third of the schools \nin this country fall below that level.\n  So as you go through the debate, a lot of this debate really comes \ndown to, whose fault is it that it is this way? And what the sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendment proposes is that we stop playing the game, the \nblame game, that we stop trying to pass the buck, that we stop trying \nto point the finger to assess the blame, to make it somebody else's \nproblem, because, indeed, the children of this country are all of our \nproblem.\n  We will not be able to maintain the standard of living that we all \ntalk about and maintain as the American dream, we will not be able to \nmaintain that American dream into the next century if we do not give \nevery one of our children an opportunity to learn, if we do not give \nevery child the best access to education that we can possibly make \navailable to them. Quite frankly, we cannot give quality education to \nchildren in school buildings that are literally falling down.\n  It should be intuitive to everybody in this Chamber, but beyond \nintuition, the fact is that the studies actually have confirmed that \nperformance is directly related to the condition of the environment in \nwhich learning is supposed to take place.\n  Children who go to schools that are falling down consistently score \nbelow children in quality facilities, across the board, on all the \ntests. We should have gotten a warning call as a nation just a couple \nweeks ago when the results came in on the international tests in math \nand science. What those results said to us was that the United States \nhas fallen behind most industrialized countries.\n\n  The United States scored below Slovenia. I do not mean to disparage \nSlovenia, but we scored below Slovenia in math and in science. How can \nwe possibly expect to compete in this global economy with this kind of \nlaissez faire attitude, this kind of neglect, this kind of, I would \neven suggest, triage of our children, that leaves their education up to \nhow much their parents happen to be able to afford?\n  That gets to the point of--there was a chart over there, and it has \nkind of fallen. I do not know where it went. I actually would like to \nuse it for a second. It was on the opponents' side. It\n\n[[Page S2916]]\n\nwas a quote from one of the White House assistants in 1996 when this \nproposal got cut out of the budget. In spite of the fact that the White \nHouse said at the time they were in support, the fact is--and everybody \nin this room knows; and I am not embarrassed about it anymore--that the \nWhite House said, ``Well, we have some other priorities. We can't \nafford to do this now.'' So they punted on the school construction \nproposal. They essentially let it get cut out at the table because \nthere was opposition on the other side of the aisle, and the majority \nobjected to it. The White House said, ``OK, fine. We'll let it go.'' So \nthe proposal fell once again that time just under the circumstances of \nthat debate.\n  But that loss, in my opinion, should have just been temporary \nbecause, if nothing else has happened, I think in the ensuing years \npeople have had a chance to take a look at the whole question of whose \nfault it is and whose responsibility it is. The truth is, we cannot \njust expect to pay for rebuilding our crumbling schools based on the \nlocal property tax.\n  Right now our school finance structure proceeds from the local \nproperty tax. That is one of the reasons why we have this patchwork of \nschools across the country. In much the same way General Eisenhower, \nwhen he set up the Interstate Highway System, concluded that the only \nway we were going to serve the national interest in transportation from \none end of the country to the other was to have a system that had some \ncongruence and some core communication and some networking, if you \nwill, to it. So we were able then to get around the wealth of a \nspecific community by saying we are going to have one good road that \ntakes us from one end of this country to the other.\n  Well, so it is with facilities. If we just rely on the local property \ntax, we will be forced then to have a school system where in wealthy \ncommunities there will be good faculties, in middle class communities \nthere will be a patchwork of full school facilities, and in poor \ncommunities there will be school facilities with broken windows and \nfalling bricks and leaky roofs. That is the situation we are in. And \nthat is the situation we have come to.\n  Let me suggest this debate and this sense of the Senate does not say \nthat State and local governments do not have a role to play or that we \nshould take this up as a new program for the Federal Government. \nIndeed, we should not. If anything, this calls on all levels of \ngovernment to go into a partnership, to work together, to collaborate, \nto get beyond the blame game and the finger pointing and the skirting \nof responsibility, to say let us work together to make this happen, to \nfix these crumbling schools.\n  The property taxes have already--already--been rising. In fact, State \nand local taxes as a share of income have risen nearly 10 percent--\nnearly 10 percent. And the increase in State and local taxes has been \ngreater than the increase in Federal taxes. It is stunning. People \nthink, ``Oh, taxes are terrible.'' Well, most of the tax hikes have \ncome at the State and local level. This is going to dawn in the general \nconversation fairly soon, I suspect, because the problem is not coming \nfrom here, it is coming because we are pushing off to State and local \ngovernments a lot of responsibility that we could help them with. That \nis the point, not that we are going to take it over; we can help them.\n\n  Indeed, if we do not create a more equitable partnership to modernize \nour schools, the local property taxpayers will have to come up with an \nadditional $153 billion--$153 billion. This sense of the Senate \nsuggests that we have that partnership, that we work together, that we \nprovide some financial assistance to local governments, that we provide \nan opportunity for them to give some relief of the local property \ntaxes, that we support State efforts to rebuild the schools, that we \nwork together for our children, because they are all our children and \nwe have a stake as citizens of this great country in the education of \neach and every one of them.\n  It seems to me that if we form this partnership, we will be able to \nmeet this challenge, we will be able to provide our children with \ndecent facilities, we will be able to give them the tools they need to \ntake up the challenges of this technological age of their time.\n  I thank the ranking member for giving me this time. It appears that \nthe majority is prepared to take the floor. But I yield back to the \nSenator from New Jersey. I thank the Senator so much for his support of \nthis. He has been a builder. I have to say one thing about the Senator \nfrom New Jersey. He likes and he understands the importance of \ninfrastructure; of the basics; of making certain that our roads are \ngood in this country, because that is how business gets done; of making \ncertain that we have infrastructure with the bridges so we do not have \naccidents, so that people can get from one place to the other, can get \nto work; of making certain that our children have the quality education \nand that the infrastructure is adequate to that end.\n  It seems to me that there can be no more fundamental priority for us. \nAnd this is an opportunity for us to provide for educational \nexcellence, again, in collaboration and cooperation and in partnership \nwith State and local governments on ways in which they retain control. \nThere is not a lot of bureaucracy with the proposal. Actually, this is \nnot a proposal. The sense of the Senate is so general, I would expect \nit to have unanimous--it could very well, if it were not so partisan an \nissue, it could very well have unanimous support in this Senate. It \nshould have. It should have.\n  The politics, frankly, should stop at the schoolroom door, and it \nshould stop on something like a sense of the Senate that just says, \nlook, this makes sense for us to do. It does not legislate, it does not \nmandate, it does not dictate anything. A sense-of-the-Senate amendment, \nas the Presiding Officer knows, is just a statement of what we think is \nthe right thing to do.\n  And I hope that we could have unanimous support for the right thing \nto do by our children, by our school facilities. I hope to have 99, if \nnot 100, votes. It would be very nice. But I am a realist in this \nmatter. I know that it is going to fall prey to partisan politics. I \nthink that is a shame too, because I really think the time when we have \nto just have these partisan divides on these kinds of issues, that time \nhas passed.\n\n  I think the American people have gotten to the point where they are \ntired of the blame game, they are tired of the finger pointing, they \nare tired of the argument, the argument of, ``This is what's wrong with \nAmerica, and isn't this a shame?'' Let us move to the constructive, to \nthe positive, and talk about what is right with America, what is right \nwith our generation. Our generation is as capable as any of the \ngenerations that have gone before us of meeting the challenges of our \ntimes. I submit to you that this crumbling school initiative is \nprecisely such a challenge.\n  When I went to school, we were in schools largely my parents' \ngeneration built, my grandparents' generation built. What is our \ngeneration going to leave as its legacy to the kids? Schools based on \nwhether or not your parents are wealthy? Schools based on whether or \nnot you live in a community that has a big shopping center so there are \na lot of property taxes? Are we going to just leave it to an accident \nof geography whether or not a youngster has a chance to be educated in \na decent facility? I hope not.\n  I hope we take advantage of this opportunity and see this sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendment as an opportunity--as an opportunity--for us to \ncome together as Americans for something that we all believe is the \nright thing to do.\n  I want to again thank the Senator from New Jersey. I yield to the \nSenator from New Jersey and thank him again for his indulgence and for \nall of his great support in this matter.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if I might ask a couple questions.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much is the program that you envision going to cost \nthe Federal Treasury?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. $3.3 billion.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. $3.3 billion?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Can you explain how we will get so much for so little?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. In the first instance, this sense of the Senate \ndoes not prescribe a level. The sense-of-the-\n\n[[Page S2917]]\n\nSenate amendment is conceptual; it does not go to $3.3 billion. That is \nthe underlying legislation that has that figure in it.\n  How do we get so much for so little? That is a very good question. I \nwill tell you how. What we do is provide the issuers of the zero coupon \nbonds with the ability to give, basically, a tax break to purchasers of \nthe bonds. So instead of having even an interest rate buydown, an \nindividual will get a tax credit when they buy one of these \ninstruments. They will get a tax credit instead of interest. That will \nallow for the leveraging to the $22 billion or thereabouts of the bond \nissue.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me make sure I understand a couple more things.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. $21.8 billion. The $3 billion I mentioned will \nleverage into $21.8 billion worth of these bonds over the next 2 years. \nAgain, it is calling for a partnership. It calls for private-sector \ninvestment--private-sector investment--in helping to rebuild these \nschools. It is not all out of the Treasury. It is largely the private \nsector stepping forward and saying, ``As purchasers of these \ninstruments, we want to help achieve a national goal.''\n  Mr. DOMENICI. In a sense, if this sense of the Senate is ever carried \nout, the Finance Committee would have to find room on the tax side for \n$3.3 billion of tax cuts; is that correct?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. We have the tradition of paying for those things \nthat are authorized out of the Finance Committee.\n  We passed a bill last night that wasn't fully paid for, as I know the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico is aware. However, yes, we would \nhave to find the ``pay for.'' There is no question about it. Whether or \nnot that would come out of some of the various revenue streams \nmentioned in connection with the bill we passed out last night or some \nother--we can be innovative. The chairman of the Finance Committee is \nsitting here, and he is one of the most innovative persons I know in \ncoming up with things like that. We can work together to find the \nrevenue stream to support the $3.3 billion. It is a small price to \nleverage $21 billion of private-sector investment to achieve the goal \nof helping to start down the path of meeting this $112 billion worth of \ndeferred maintenance.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I don't have any further questions. I think there are \nsome other Senators on our side that do, and in due course they will \ncome down. I have nothing further.\n  Are you finished on your side?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I yielded for the Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2209\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, and I ask for the immediate consideration of \namendment No. 2209.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That will be the pending question.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this amendment deals with a vital national \nissue--Social Security reform. This amendment is cosponsored by \nSenators Breaux, Gregg, Robb, Hatch, Nickles, Gramm, Gordon, Smith, and \nSantorum.\n  Let me say first that as the chairman of the Finance Committee I am \nacutely aware of Social Security's future financial problems. I am sure \nthese problems are familiar to most members, but nonetheless they bear \nrepeating.\n  In just 14 years, in 2012, revenues to the Social Security trust \nfunds will no longer cover benefits. Social Security will then cash in \nTreasury bonds that are now accumulating in the trust funds. This will \nplace major pressure on the Federal budget and crowd out other \nimportant spending.\n  By 2029 the bonds will be gone. Social Security will then be able to \ncover only 75 percent of benefits directly from revenues. The long-term \ndebt of the Social Security system--the difference between revenues and \nbenefit through 2075--is estimated to be an astounding $121 trillion.\n  The purpose of my amendment is simple. Nevertheless, it is important \nand urgent. The amendment instructs the Finance Committee to dedicate \nthe budget surplus to establishing Social Security personal retirement \naccounts.\n  Despite its simplicity, I know that many of my colleagues will have \nat least two questions about this amendment. First: ``Why establish \npersonal retirement accounts this year, rather than wait until next \nyear?'' And second: ``Why not begin with comprehensive Social Security \nreform, rather than start with personal retirement accounts?''\n  Mr. President, the easy course would be to wait until next year to \nbegin Social Security reform. But the fact is, Social Security reform \nwill be a big job. I am very concerned that trying to do it all in one \nyear--in 1999--will simply not be possible.\n  Americans have learned that big, comprehensive proposals, with many \nparts, often run into problems in Congress and can easily take several \nyears to enact. Particularly proposals that deal with an important, \nsensitive program like Social Security.\n  The place to start with Social Security reform is to establish a \nprogram of personal retirement accounts--funded by the budget \nsurpluses. Dedicating the surplus to personal retirement accounts \nallows us to get started on reform without running into controversies \nover changes to the traditional program.\n  Personal retirement accounts themselves would be a big, new feature \nof Social Security. We will need to explain these accounts to the \nAmerican people, and writing a bill will require thoughtful action by \nthe Finance Committee.\n  Mr. President, let me note for the record that there is a growing \nbipartisan consensus that personal retirement accounts must be an \nessential feature of Social Security reform. And I want to emphasize \nthe word ``bipartisan.''\n  In the Senate, Senator Bob Kerrey, another member of the Finance \nCommittee, was an early and vocal advocate of personal retirement \naccounts. In the last Congress, he and Senator Alan Simpson, now \nretired, introduced a ground-breaking Social Security reform bill with \npersonal retirement accounts that grew out of their experience on the \n1994 Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax Reform.\n  Other Democrats support this concept. For example, Senator Robb, \nanother cosponsor of my amendment, proposed a sense-of-the-Senate to \nlast year's budget resolution that would have funded Social Security \nretirement accounts.\n  And just two weeks ago, Senator Moynihan, the ranking Democrat on the \nFinance Committee and a recognized expert on Social Security, \nintroduced a comprehensive Social Security reform package that included \npersonal retirement accounts.\n  On the Republican side of the aisle, there is strong support as well. \nSenators Judd Gregg, Don Nickles, Phil Gramm, Rick Santorum, and Rod \nGrams, among others, have been enthusiastic advocates of Social \nSecurity personal retirement accounts.\n  Let me explain why Social Security personal retirement accounts find \nso much support--not only in Congress, but among the American people. \nWhile proposals differ, the basic objective of this program is to \nprovide each working American with funds to be deposited into personal \nretirement accounts.\n  With even conservative investment, such accounts have the potential \nto grow to provide a secure and generous retirement nest egg. Indeed, \nfor the first time Americans could look forward to having real personal \nwealth in old age, not just enough to keep body and soul together.\n  A recent report by the Congressional Research Service provides many \nillustrations of what Social Security personal accounts may offer. For \nexample, for an individual who is 28 years old today and earns an \naverage wage--about $27,000, just 1 percent of an amount equal to his \nor her wages invested over the next 37 years in the S 500 would grow \nto $132,000, which would be worth about 20 percent of his or her Social \nSecurity benefits. By the way, CRS assumed a 10-percent rate of return \nfor the S 500. In fact, over the past 10 years, the compounded annual \nreturn on the S 500 has been 18 percent.\n  Mr. President, using the budget surpluses to create retirement \naccounts represents an opportunity to get these accounts up and \nrunning. Once in place, we can then begin looking at Social Security \nbenefits for the long run. It will help insure that Social Security \nbenefits continue to provide a secure foundation of retirement income. \nEstablishing these accounts this year--as a new program in addition to \nthe current Social Security program--would allow us to demonstrate \ntheir value in\n\n[[Page S2918]]\n\nproviding retirement benefits for working Americans in the years to \ncome.\n  Creating these accounts would also give the majority of Americans who \ndo not own any investment assets a new stake in America's economic \ngrowth, because that growth will be returned directly to their benefit. \nMore Americans will be the owners of capital--not just workers.\n  Creating these accounts will help Americans to better be prepared for \nretirement, generally. According to the Congressional Research Service, \n60 percent of Americans are not actively participating in a retirement \nprogram other than Social Security; this, in spite of the fact that \nSocial Security was never intended to be the sole source of retirement \nincome.\n  Mr. President, could there be a more important use of the budget \nsurplus? Some may believe that the budget surplus should be used to \nreduce the debt, not dedicated to personal retirement accounts. That is \nexactly what we will do by using the surplus to create these accounts. \nSocial Security, a $121 billion unfunded liability over the next 75 \nyears, is a huge debt and we need to recognize it as such.\n  Retirement accounts and other solvency proposals would be a critical \nfirst step in reform. At the same time, it would tackle that debt and \nprotect benefits. Most observers expect a surplus upwards of $60 \nbillion this fiscal year, enough to get started on retirement accounts \nand to begin reducing the Federal debt. Some may be concerned that the \nPresident and others have called for a year-long national dialog on \nSocial Security reform. They may be erroneously believing that doing \nreform this year might undermine the national dialog. On the contrary, \nI can think of no better way to focus it than with specific proposals \nand action by a U.S. Senate committee.\n  Mr. President, Congress has talked for a long time about the need to \ndo something to shore up Social Security. The time has come for action. \nIt is indeed a blessing that we have a surplus to work with. Now let's \nput that surplus to work. The Finance Committee must get started on \nSocial Security reform this year. The place to start is by dedicating \nthe budget surplus to fund personal retirement accounts. This amendment \nwill get the ball rolling. I urge Members to support it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Roth amendment. \nClearly, there is a long way to go before we have rendered Social \nSecurity solvent way into the next century. But it is even more obvious \nthat this is the era when part of what a citizen who is working should \nhave for retirement should be a personalized savings account or an \nannuity that comes from that personalized savings account. There can be \nno doubt that it can be structured in such a way that it will turn out \nto be better for the senior citizen. They will be assured of the \nbenefits that they are getting now and, in most cases, will come out \nfar, far ahead.\n  In the meantime, if it works right, the surpluses of the U.S. \nGovernment, if used partially for this, will be invested in a safe way, \nnot solely in IOU's from the Federal Government, which is where they go \nnow, which is the law now; rather, they will be invested where they \ncan, without much risk, yield significantly more and, when compounded, \nthe power of compounding is enormous.\n  So in a very real sense I come here today saying to the distinguished \nSenator, Senator Roth, chairman of the Finance Committee, that the time \nhas come for some significant reforms that will not put in jeopardy the \nSocial Security system, but rather in the long run make sure that it is \nnot short of money, that its liabilities will not be there to destroy \nthe system, but rather that in years to come, it will be more solvent, \nand that ultimately, with part of it being compounded because of \nthe annual return that will come from safe investments, it is clear \nthat everyone gains. The seniors gain, the 21-year-old paying into the \nsystem today gains, and the American economy is the beneficiary of \nindividuals investing in this economy across the board so that the \nworking people of the United States will own an interest in the \nAmerican companies that produce our wealth.\n\n  Frankly, I am delighted that we are going to discuss this today. If \nwe discuss it for a long time, that is fine with me. If we discuss it \nfor a short time and it passes, that is fine with me. But clearly, we \ndiscuss a lot of things that are not nearly as important to our future, \nand we adopt sense-of-the-Senate resolutions that are, in many \ninstances, not even important to the fiscal policy of our Nation and \nthe future well-being of our people.\n  This is moving in the direction of reform and personalized accounts, \nand is a very appropriate thing to be doing on a budget resolution. It \nhas everything to do with what we do with our surpluses, if we have \nthem, what we do with capital needs in the future, and how we assure \nsenior citizens that they are going to be guaranteed a Social Security \ncheck or better, because they will have invested some portion of it in \npersonalized accounts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, may I have some time under the bill?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time does the Senator want?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield Senator Santorum 15 minutes, and then Senator \nNickles needs 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise in very strong support of \nChairman Roth's amendment. There is nobody in this Chamber who has done \nmore to look out for the retirement security of Americans than Senator \nRoth from Delaware. It is with his Roth IRA and other kinds of \ninnovation in his work on the Finance Committee that he has helped to \nprovide for retirement security for millions of Americans, which is \nlegendary. I commend him for that and for firing, if you will, here on \nthe floor of the Senate, the first salvo in what I believe will be a \nlong debate, and I hope will not be a hostile debate, on the issue of \ntransitioning Social Security.\n  What we have seen is now a bipartisan agreement that personal savings \naccounts must have a very significant role in transitioning Social \nSecurity. Why is that? Social Security is in trouble. It is not in \ntrouble next year or the year after, but Social Security, which was \n``saved'' back in 1983 with the most recent revision--it was supposed \nto save it for generations to come, but it is now scheduled to go \nbankrupt some 30 years sooner than originally expected. That number is \nnot set in stone either. It is now 2029 when the system goes bankrupt. \nIn the year 2013, the system starts running a deficit, paying out more \nthan it takes in. Now is the time, before that bulk of the population, \nthe baby boom generation, goes into retirement, to begin to look at how \nwe can begin to solve this problem. Well, there are things you can do \nwithin the current structure, like changing benefits--when I say \n``changing,'' I don't mean raising them, I mean cutting benefits--\nincreasing taxes, and do a whole lot of things to try to preserve a \npay-as-you-go system that will not work over time because of very \nsimple demographics, the most important of which is that people are \nliving much longer, which is a good thing, and also we have very low \nbirth rates in this country. You have people living longer and fewer \npeople to pay for them. So you are looking at dramatic increases in \ntaxes or cuts in benefits, and that is a mindset of a finite, fixed \npie.\n\n  What Senator Roth is suggesting here is, let's grow the pie. So when \nhe says let's grow the pie, let's invest this money, not, as Senator \nDomenici said, in Treasury bonds that earn a very small rate of \nreturn--in fact, if you are entering the work force now, the rate of \nreturn on Social Security taxes you are going to pay is below zero. \nThat is not a good deal for young people in this country. But what we \nhave to do is transition the system using the ideas of growth in \nproducing more retirement income for people who are just entering the \nwork force, or who have been in the work force a relatively short \nperiod of time, but at the same time, make sure that we do not change \nwhat has been promised to those at or near retirement.\n  That is our challenge. But with challenge comes tremendous \nopportunity; in crisis comes a tremendous will to be innovative in \nusing the private market\n\n[[Page S2919]]\n\nsystems that work so well in this country to provide wealth. As the \nSenator from Delaware said, our modest amount of money being paid on \nSocial Security was never intended to be the sole source of retirement. \nAs a result, it is a very modest amount. People living on Social \nSecurity today will tell you that if that is their only income and they \nhave no other pension income or savings income, they are hard pressed \nto make a living. This is not an adequate savings system. What we need \nto do is enhance that, create an opportunity for more growth in \npeople's wealth and, at the same time, protect those who are in the \nsystem or have been in the system such a long period of time, so that \nthey will keep at least what we have promised in the past.\n  We can do that, but we must use the power of the marketplace, the \npower of investment and savings. In so doing, we will not only open up \nthe opportunity for wealth and a better retirement income for \ngenerations to come, but open up huge economic benefits for this \ncountry with the amount of money that is going to be poured into the \ncapital markets and the debt markets, to be able to finance future \neconomic expansion and growth, better jobs, and higher standards of \nliving and real wage growth. I heard earlier today from Jose Pinero, \nwho was the Secretary of Labor during the time Chile went to a private \npersonal saving system there, some 17 years ago. He said that 30 years \nprior to Chile going to that system, they had a real wage growth of 1 \npercent a year, on average. Since they passed the personal savings \naccounts in Chile, they have had a real wage growth of 7 percent a \nyear, for almost 15 years, in that country.\n  What they have done is dramatically increase--over double; two and a \nhalf times--their savings rate. People now understood. Senator Roth \nsaid a very important thing, that only 40 percent of the people in this \ncountry have some investment in the marketplace and understand the \ndynamics of how the market works, how our economy works. That is a \ndisability, if you will, for millions of Americans who don't have that \nadvantage. The average, ordinary Chilean has that knowledge now and \nunderstands the marketplace and uses that knowledge to their own \nbenefit--and not only their own benefit in their personal savings \naccount, but in their life and in their savings and other skills of \ninteracting in the economic marketplace. It creates such synergy that \nit will have a dramatically positive impact on the future of this \ncountry.\n\n  This is the opportunity that is before us, and what I am so excited \nabout is what I see is a real chance for a bipartisan solution to this \nproblem. With Senator Moynihan's proposal of putting 2 percent aside in \nprivate savings, I think that is a very healthy initiative. We want to \nbuild, in my opinion, from that as to how we can transform this system \nto provide the security for those at or near retirement, put it in the \nlaw, which is not the case today, so that those benefits will be there \nas long as they are alive, that we will not change the benefit \nstructure as long as they are alive--there is no law that says that \nright now--guarantee it. Then we can create opportunities for those, \nfrankly, who have very little expectation that Social Security will be \nthere.\n  I talk to a lot of young people. I have been to over 110 high schools \nin my State since I have been in office. I can tell you, when I ask the \nquestion, ``How many believe Social Security will be there when you \nretire?'' if anybody raises their hand, the other kids in the crowd \nlook at them and laugh at them. They have no expectation that Social \nSecurity will be there. They think it is, in fact, a pyramid scheme, a \nponzi scheme, some sort of thing that the folks who are in power right \nnow are just going to make them pay and then slash the heck out of \nSocial Security when it comes their time.\n  Well, what we are going to do here is create hope. One of the things \nI hear so much about is how young people are cynical in this country \nand they don't believe in our institutions and our culture, and what we \nare doing here is, in fact, giving them something they can hold, they \ncan have a passbook with their money in it so they can track it every \nday and see how it grows, and they can say, ``This is my money,'' from \nthe first day they worked flipping that first hamburger at a fast food \nrestaurant. That money goes into their account and is building for \ntheir retirement security. They can see that happening with them at \nwork. They can see hope. They can see the potential for wealth and for \na good life. They will understand the dynamics that are so important \nfor all of us to understand that have to survive economically in this \ncountry and in the world that is out in front. This is truly not \nsomething we should be looking at and saying, how are we going to fix \nSocial Security? Such a problem, such a crisis. What are we going to do \nand have money? But to walk hand in hand and jump at the opportunity to \ncreate a whole new way of looking at providing opportunities for \nmillions of Americans upon their retirement and energizing and \nuplifting an economy through that process, this is a great opportunity \nfor all of us.\n\n  What the chairman of the Finance Committee has done today is to lay \ndown the first mark on the budget where it should be laid down, because \nwhat we will be doing by allowing private investment is dramatically \nlower--not everyone talks about how we are going to use the surplus in \ntransition. That is a big concern we have to worry about--how we \ntransition these costs. That is the big nut we have to crunch. But at \nthe end, what will happen is that budget deficits and the huge \nunemployment liability in $7 trillion or $8 trillion of unfunded \nliability in the Social Security trust fund today will in effect over \ntime vanish because of the dynamics of allowing private savings to \noccur.\n  This is in fact a multifaceted solution to many problems that are out \nthere, one of which is the long-term problems of the budget deficit in \nthe outyears when the baby boomers are beginning to take retirement--\nnot only Social Security but Medicare as well--when the budget deficit \ncomes back again. You hear so much about surplus. It comes back again. \nThat is the era, that is the time that we can, by acting now, keep \nsurpluses coming long into the future and grow the economy, create \nstability, create hope for those who now do not have it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from \nPennsylvania for his statement. I also compliment Senator Roth for his \nresolution. I am happy to cosponsor this resolution. I hope we will \nhave overwhelming bipartisan support for it, and hopefully everyone can \nunderstand what we are talking about doing. We are talking about saving \nSocial Security.\n  The President during his State of the Union speech says we want to \nsave Social Security; we don't want to spend one dime of the surplus. \nSenator Roth is trying to save Social Security. Because we do not just \nsave Social Security by not spending the surplus either in the form of \nadditional outlays--frankly, the President is violating that as we \nspeak because he wants to have a supplemental appropriations bill and \ndoesn't want to pay for it. He is already violating what he said in the \nState of the Union Address.\n  But I agree. We should save Social Security. This resolution says \nthat we should take the surplus and allow individuals to set up \npersonal savings accounts. I think that is the way to save Social \nSecurity. I think that is the way to fund Social Security. Right now we \ndon't fund Social Security. It is an unfunded paying system. One \ngeneration pays for retired generations, or working employees today pay \nthe Social Security tax. Social Security taxes are enormous. They \nhave grown, and they have exploded in cost.\n\n  As a matter of fact, somebody paying Social Security today is paying \na total--if you look at Social Security taxes, their contribution today \nis a total of $10,465 if they have the maximum amount of income, which \nis $68,400. That is a lot. That actually includes Social Security and \nMedicare, I might mention. So that is a lot. Social Security is 12.4 \npercent of $68,000. That is a lot of money. That is over $9,000 that \npeople are paying. If somebody happens to be making $68,000, they are \npaying a lot. What do they have to show for it? Nothing. They can't \nopen up a bank account and say, ``Here is\n\n[[Page S2920]]\n\nmy money for an investment.'' Basically they are funding a previous \ncommitment.\n  Senator Roth is saying we should take the surplus and allow people to \nset up their own individual retirement accounts, let them be able to \ninvest in the marketplace, let them be able to enjoy the rewards of \ncompounding interest. Right now the rate of return on Social Security \nas an investment--some people say 1 percent, some people say 1.2 \npercent, or 1.3 percent. That is not a very good rate of return. It is \npathetic if you consider what the market has done in the last several \nyears. The marketplace--the Dow Jones or Standard & Poors 500--has been \ncompounding in the 20 and 30 percent range for the last 4 years. But to \nhave individuals be able to enjoy this? The answer is no, not in Social \nSecurity.\n  Senator Roth has done something else. I really appreciate it, because \nit is important. He said not only should they be able to invest a \nportion, but also we should be able to use that money to reduce the \nunfunded promises that we now have in Social Security.\n  I want to do this proposal for two reasons.\n  One, I want millions of Americans to become millionaires. If we let \nthem take--some people say 2 percent. I think it should be up to maybe \n5 or 6 percent, maybe half of their Social Security tax. Of the Social \nSecurity tax of 12.4 percent of their income up to $68,000, you would \nlet them put 6.2 percent of their income in for 40-some-odd years \nbefore they retire, and you will find that we will have lots of people \nwho started out maybe making $20,000 a year who are going to be \nmillionaires.\n  Senator Roth's example is they put in 1 percent at age 28, and they \ncan have over 100-some-odd thousands. That is 1 percent. Let's get it \nup, and it can really compound, and individuals can have hundreds of \nthousands of dollars, if not over a million dollars.\n  I want those individuals to be wealthy, whether they are on the lower \nend of the income scale or in the higher end. We want them to be \nindependent.\n  Likewise, I want to reduce the unfunded promises that we don't have \nthe money to pay for. I am really concerned about what our kids are \ngoing to have to pay for 20 years from now. If we do not do something, \nas Senator Roth is proposing--Senator Moynihan, Senator Breaux, and \nSenator Kerrey, and others of us have been working on it--our kids are \ngoing to be inheriting a debt that is twice as large as our national \ndebt. Everybody is bragging around here. We are patting ourselves on \nthe back. ``Hey, we balanced the budget.'' We are balancing the budget \non using a great deal of Social Security surplus. That debt right now \nhas accumulated, the Federal debt--usually people say about $3.3 \ntrillion or $4 trillion. The unfunded vested promises that we have in \nSocial Security today is almost $10 trillion, twice as large as our \nnational debt.\n\n  What this change by going to a capitalist-funded retirement system \nwould do would provide security, provide retirement funds for \nindividuals, and likewise could reduce the Government's obligations in \nthe future--to me that is a very positive thing--so future generations \nwon't have to have a payroll tax that is maybe twice as high as the \npayroll taxes we have today. I think it is a very positive thing.\n  I might mention--I see a couple of colleagues on the floor who talked \nabout how we should not use Social Security funds to balance the \nbudget. Today the Social Security trust fund, this year 1998, $101 \nbillion more will go in than goes out. That is a surplus. Yet, we are \nusing that surplus just like every administration has used it since we \nhave had Social Security.\n  What I would like to see it do--I might mention the Budget Committee \nhas already passed it. I was interested. I was going to introduce a \nresolution that says we should pass in 2 or 3 years--3 years, let's \nsay--the budget resolution that doesn't use one dime of Social Security \ntrust funds to balance the budget.\n  I tell my colleague from North Dakota, who has talked about this on \nmore than one occasion, that I am willing to do it. It won't be easy, \nbut we should do it. I tell my colleague that in 10 years the Social \nSecurity surplus will be $197 billion, almost $200 billion. I don't \nthink we should use these Social Security revenues to balance the \nbudget. If we balance the budget without that, we can make these moneys \navailable for personal security accounts. Now you are talking about \nreal money. You are talking about $200 billion in the year 2008 alone \nthat can go into personal security accounts that can be invested in the \nstock market, that can be invested in mutual funds, that can be \ninvested in bonds, that can be invested in T bills. Let the individual \ndecide how he wants to invest it. We allow Federal employees to invest \nin the stock market, in bonds, and in T bills. Federal employees are \nable to do this. My colleague from Pennsylvania mentioned that they do \nit in Chile. They make investments. Surely Americans are capable of \nmaking these investments. I think it would be exciting to allow people \nto be able to invest their own money. It is their money. It is not the \nGovernment's money. We have been taking it from them. Shouldn't we \nallow, out of that 12.4 percent, the individuals to take maybe 4 \npercent or 5 or 6 percent and be able to invest it for themselves? In \nexchange for that, they will be a lot more dependent on themselves and \na lot less dependent on the Government.\n  This is a mandatory tax. Shouldn't we allow them to have part of that \nfor themselves so they can have an account and look at it on a monthly \nbasis, so it is there, and it is something they can count on, not for \nan unfunded Government promise that we hope will be there. \nDemographically, everybody who has ever looked at this problem says we \nhave a real problem. Some people say we don't have problems until 30 \nyears. That is hogwash. We have problems, as Senator Roth mentioned, in \n12 years.\n  It is estimated that by the year 2010 or 2012, for Social Security \nthat line of more money going in switches. More money goes out. No \nlater than 2012, more money goes out than in. We will start drawing on \nthe trust fund. What is in the trust fund? Nothing but Government IOUs. \nThat is the promise. The way we finance those--you say they are the \nsame things as T bills or the paper equivalent. It is just an IOU. The \nway we pay for these is we issue more T bills. In 12 years we have a \nbig problem. We will have enormously high payroll taxes and a lot of \ndebt. You have to issue more debt. I think that is a bad solution. This \nis the right solution, and I will tell you that millions of people in \nthe private sector have done this. We did it in my company. We went \nfrom a defined benefit to defined contribution plan. Our employees love \nus. I think we should give every American an opportunity to do this for \nat least part of their Social Security. It doesn't have to be for all \nof it. Some people say 2 percent. I said maybe it should be half of \nit--maybe 6.4 percent, 6.2 percent. The Government, the employer \nportion, can still go to meet current obligations. But, likewise, we \nwould be reducing current or future obligations. I think that is very \nimportant.\n\n  What Congress has done in the past--we have had problems with Social \nSecurity--is raise taxes. We raised the base. We raised the tax rate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na chart showing payroll taxes--Social Security taxes and employer taxes \ncombined. For the record--my colleagues can see this--if you look at \nSocial Security and if you look at disability, Medicare, if you add \nthose taxes together, in 1998, for a person making maximum of the base, \nthe base amount, which is $68,000, it shows they are paying in payroll \ntaxes alone $10,465. That is a lot of money. I am saying we should \nallow individuals to take part of that, a few thousand dollars of it, \nand be able to put it into their own account and likewise reduce \nGovernment's obligation at the same time. I think it is awfully \nimportant.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a chart that I \nhave prepared that shows the budget deficits and Social Security and \nhow that equates. It shows that we are becoming more and more reliant \nover the next several years on Social Security surpluses that I \nmentioned before, which disappear by the year 2012.\n  There being no objection, the chart was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S2921]]\n\n\n\n                    BUDGET DEFICITS & SOCIAL SECURITY\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                  Social       Unified\n                                   On-budget     Security      budget\n                                    deficit      deficit/     deficit/\n                                                 surplus     surplus \\1\\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1962............................

base. The HI wage base was eliminated\n  beginning in 1994, making the maximum HI contribution unlimited.\n\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, we need to wean ourselves and get off of \nthis addiction to this and take that money and allow people to put it \nin their own account. That to me is a challenge. We shouldn't be \nsitting back and saying, ``Oh, we balance the budget. Aren't we proud \nof ourselves? We are doing good. We have a unified budget.''\n  I think we should have a unified budget. But I think we should go \nback and let's balance the budget without using Social Security. Then \nlet's allow people to take that amount of money and be able to put that \nin their own account.\n  I might mention that in the 10 years, if we did that, there would be \nover $1.5 trillion that could go into individual accounts and we would \nhave more constituents that would be happier with us than anything else \nwe would do. We would do more to secure their retirement and their \nfuture than anything else we could do.\n  I have even told the President's representatives. I said, if the \nPresident really wants to go down in history and show that he has done \nsomething significant, this change, this evolution of allowing at least \npart of Social Security to be funded as a defined contribution in a \npersonal savings accounts would be an astronomically positive impact \nfor not only this generation; I think it would be a positive impact for \nfuture generations, which history will record as having truly been a \ngreat thing to do for seniors, a very positive thing to do for future \ngenerations as well.\n  So I compliment my colleague from Delaware, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee. I tell him that, as a member of that committee, I \nwill work energetically to try to see that we can make this happen as \nsoon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleague, Senator John \nBreaux, in delivering a statement as to why we support the sense of the \nSenate language put forth by the chairman of the Finance Committee, \nSenator Roth.\n  For the past year, Senator Breaux and I have co-chaired the National \nCommission on Retirement Policy, convened by the Center for Strategic \nand International Studies. Our task is to review the situation facing \nour Nation with respect to retirement income in the 21st century.\n  We will soon be releasing a final report of our findings and \nrecommendations, and we need not preview them here in detail. Suffice \nto say that each of the major sources of retirement income--Social \nSecurity, employer-provided pensions, and personal savings--will be \nunder severe strain in the 21st century, as a consequence of the aging \nof our population, and the declining ratio of workers to retirees.\n  The situation facing Social Security is sufficiently dire to command \nour immediate attention. We, as co-chairs of the NCRP, wrote to \nPresident Clinton last December, urging him to make this issue a \npriority in his state of the union address, and we were extremely \npleased that he did so. Social Security will begin running operating \ndeficits in the year 2012 under current law, and even if the $2.89 \ntrillion that the Federal Government will owe Social Security is repaid \nin full, the Trust Fund would still run dry in the year 2029. The \nunfunded liabilities of the Social Security--the gap between projected \noutlays and projected revenues--is on the order of $3 trillion. The \ntrue ``unfunded liability,'' however, is much greater, because those \ntaxes haven't been collected yet, and therefore all of the future \nliabilities of the program are in a sense unfunded, to be financed from \ntax revenue at the time that they are paid.\n  We have carefully studied this problem for a year, and we believe \nthat there are several problems that must be solved simultaneously. The \nactuarial soundness of Social Security is but one of these. There is \nalso a huge problem residing in the size of the tax burden that is \nawaiting the future economy if we do not advance fund some of Social \nSecurity's future liabilities. A solution to this problem is no \nsolution at all if it achieves actuarial soundness at the price of an \nunfair tax burden on tomorrow's economy, or at the price of further \nworsening the quality of the deal that today's young workers will \nreceive from the Social Security program.\n  It is for this reason that Senator Breaux and I believe that personal \naccounts must be a component of the Social Security solution. Tough \nchoices will need to be made in order to bring the outlays and the \nrevenues of Social Security back into balance, and we believe that \npersonal accounts should be established within this context. Creating a \nfunded savings account component within the Social Security system is \nperhaps the only way to give something back to today's young workers to \nimprove their treatment by the Social Security system relative to a set \nof traditional solutions alone. This is one way that we have found to \nprevent the income provided by the Social Security system from \ndeclining below the level that we expect from the program.\n  Before turning to Senator Breaux, let me also note the flexibility of \nSenator Roth's language with regard to the administration of such \naccounts. This language does not commit the Senate to any particular \nmethod of administration. Senator Breaux and I,\n\n[[Page S2922]]\n\nafter a year of study, have reached the conclusion that the best way to \nadminister personal accounts is through the existing payroll tax \ncollection system. That money is already being paid in a timely way by \nemployers on behalf of individual employees, and is a structure that we \ncan practicably work through to set up accounts in every wage-earner's \nname through a refund of some portion of the payroll tax. The Roth \nlanguage is flexible enough to permit a variety of approaches to \nadministering the accounts, as it should be. I hope that Senators who \ndiffer as to the best administrative mechanism will be able to unite \nbehind it.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank Senator Gregg for his unwavering leadership on \nthis issue. It has been a pleasure to work with him over the past year. \nI also want to thank Chairman Roth for his leadership. Times have \ncertainly changed since the days when no one would even talk about \nSocial Security reform. Today, we have key members of the Senate \npresenting innovative ideas about how to address the looming \nliabilities of the Social Security program. I applaud Chairman Roth's \nefforts because he is moving this debate forward.\n  This is critical because the motto must be ``sooner rather than \nlater''. There is no better time to tackle entitlement reform than \nduring good economic times. While SS's financing is projected to pay \nfull benefits until 2029--the strain on the Federal budget will begin \nmuch earlier, only 10 years from now. The Social Security Advisory \nCouncil could not agree on an approach to reform Social Security; \nhowever, they all agreed that early action should be taken. This call \nhas been echoed time and time again by the General Accounting Office, \nAlan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, as well as most \nother experts.\n  The budget resolution already contains Sense of the Senate language \nregarding the budget surplus and Social Security reform. It reads as \nfollows: ``Congress should use unified budget surpluses to reform \nSocial Security for future generations . . .'' I support Chairman \nRoth's Sense of the Senate because it takes this language a step \nfurther. It suggests that individual accounts are the direction in \nwhich Social Security reform should move. I agree with this.\n  The American people will hear again and again over the next several \nmonths about the financial instability of Social Security--about the \npromises made that we can no longer afford to keep. Americans will also \nhear about what is necessary to put Social Security on sound financial \nfooting--the difficult sacrifices and the tough choices. This dialogue \nwill only compound the already low level of confidence most Americans \nhave in our nation's public retirement system. I adamantly believe we \nmust do something to reverse this trend. We must provide some good news \nin the middle of this debate. If we include individual accounts within \nSocial Security reform we are giving all Americans a new chance to \nprovide substantial retirement savings for themselves--that is the good \nnews.\n  This Sense of the Senate does not dictate or even suggest how these \nindividual accounts should be administered or that they be done \nindependently of fundamental Social Security reform. Senator Gregg and \nI have our own ideas about how Social Security should be reformed and, \nspecifically, how individual accounts should be set-up and \nadministered. I look forward to our ideas being discussed and debated \nduring the coming weeks and months, along with all the other ideas \nbeing put on the table. The Aging Committee, which I am pleased to \nserve as Ranking Member, is looking at this issue closely. I hope the \nFinance Committee will hold hearings as soon as May.\n  In looking to Social Security reform we cannot lose sight of the \nlarger budget picture and the difficult steps we have taken in this \nCongress to get our country's books in order. What we tried to do with \nthe balanced budget--and what we should be trying to do with the \nsurplus--is reduce this country's overall financial liabilities. As \nstated in the budget resolution, Social Security's unfunded liability \nstands at around $3 trillion. Obviously, Social Security is a large \npart of this country's debt and must be addressed. Again, it must be \naddressed sooner rather than later. In conclusion, I want to again \nthank Chairman Roth and Senator Gregg for their efforts in moving this \ndebate forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, a few moments ago I had an opportunity \nto discuss with the chairman of the Budget Committee how we might \nproceed, because one of the things we are running into is that, \nalthough we had agreed to have a half-hour limit on amendments equally \ndivided, as a result of courtesy, we have extended time on the \nresolution. It, thusly, then challenges whether or not we are ever \ngoing to get done here, because we have almost 30 amendments. If we \ntake 30 amendments, you have 2 hours each, 7 or 8 hours of votes to \naccompany that, that is another, who knows, 7, 8, 10 hours.\n  So what we are going to do, unless there is a difference in the \nconversation as I remember it from what the distinguished Senator from \nNew Mexico agreed, we are going to permit approximate time on this side \nequal to the two speakers that we just had. Then we are going to \neliminate further time off the bill itself for amendments.\n  With that, I yield some time to the Senator from North Dakota, as he \nsees fit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I thank the ranking \nmember. We have just seen a proposal unveiled on the floor of the \nSenate which has some interesting aspects. I must say some of the \nconcepts here are ones that I am interested in. But I am concerned \nabout the specifics of the proposal that is before us in this regard. \nThe chairman of the Finance Committee suggests we ought to devote the \nbudget surpluses to building private accounts in Social Security. I am \non record as one member of the Finance Committee who favors moving \ntowards private accounts over time. But I must say, I am concerned \nabout the specifics of the proposal of the Senator from Delaware in \nthat it is based on, I think, a false assumption. I see the false \nassumption as being that we have budget surpluses.\n  I am certain there are people listening here, here in the Senate \nChamber and people listening at home, who wonder what is this talk \nabout budget surpluses and Social Security surpluses? What does this \nall mean? It is confusing. Unfortunately, the language we use here in \nWashington, I think, contributes to that confusion. We talk about \nbudget surpluses but what we do not tell people is the way we have \ncalculated their surpluses is that we have included the Social Security \ntrust fund surpluses. This year that amounts to over $100 billion. And \nby throwing that money into the pot, by, in effect, raiding Social \nSecurity, we say there is a $8 billion surplus in the budget.\n  There is not a surplus in the budget. The truth is there is a \nsignificant deficit. Oh, yes, on a unified basis--if you take all the \nfunds of the Federal Government and throw them into the pot and look at \nall of the expenditures of the Federal Government, we are in balance. \nThat is what they call the unified budget. But the problem with that \nis, and the little dirty secret here, is that $100 billion of the \nSocial Security surplus is being put into that calculation.\n  If any private company tried to balance their books in this way, they \nwould be headed for a Federal institution all right, but it would not \nbe the Congress of the United States. They would be headed for a \nFederal facility all right. It would be a Federal prison, because that \nis fraud. That is fraud. To take money for one purpose and use it for \nanother is fraud. Unfortunately, that is the pattern and practice here \nand has been for 30 years. We are taking Social Security trust fund \nsurpluses, throwing those into the pot, and this year we are saying we \nhave balanced the budget.\n  If any company tried to take the retirement funds of its employees \nand throw those into the pot and say they balanced the operating budget \nof the company, they would be in violation of Federal law. So I think \nwe want to be cautious when we have a proposal that\n\n[[Page S2923]]\n\nin many ways is attractive. I want to say to the Senator from Delaware, \nI am on record as favoring a partial privatization. I like the idea of \nindividuals being able to have several percentage points of Social \nSecurity trust fund payments that they make be reserved in private \naccounts that they could invest. I like that basic concept.\n  But how do you fund it? How do you fund it? It seems to me the first \nthing we have to do is stop the practice of looting Social Security. If \nwe are going to secure the long-term prospects for Social Security, we \nought to stop raiding it. We ought to stop looting it. And we ought to \nstop the talk that we have a budget surplus. Because the only way we \ngot a budget surplus is by counting those Social Security trust fund \nsurpluses, which we are going to need for the day when the baby boom \ngeneration starts to retire.\n  We have a demographic time bomb just over the horizon, and it is the \nbaby boom generation. When they start to retire in the year 2012, all \nof a sudden everything that looks rosy now is going to change and \nchange quickly. In fact, by the year 2029 we anticipate the Social \nSecurity fund will have run through these massive surpluses that are \nbeing built now. They are not built up in terms of money actually in \nthe bank, but built up in terms of IOUs that are being registered and \naccumulated based on borrowing by the other parts of Government that \nare spending those moneys, even though we know we are going to need \nthose funds when the baby boomers start to retire.\n  I think the basic concept the Senator from Delaware has merit. But I \nam very concerned about the specifics that he has proposed, because to \ntake these so-called budget surpluses that we have on paper that only \nexist because we are raiding Social Security and use those funds before \nwe use them to preserve and protect Social Security, has the prospect \nof undermining our first responsibility and our first obligation. Our \nfirst responsibility and our first obligation is to keep the promise to \nthe tens of millions of people who are relying on that Social Security \ncheck.\n  Before we go off and raid the Social Security trust fund surpluses in \norder to claim we have a budget surplus, we ought to stop that \npractice. We ought to clean up our act, stop raiding Social Security, \nstop looting Social Security, and then we can move in the direction \nproposed by the Senator from Delaware. But I think the proposal that he \nhas before us at this moment is based on a misnomer. And the misnomer \nis that there are budget surpluses. There are only budget surpluses \nbecause we are taking $100 billion a year from Social Security \nsurpluses and throwing those into the pot when we make the calculation \nof budget surpluses. So we say we have a budget surplus next year of $8 \nbillion, but we are taking $100 billion from Social Security surpluses \nin order to make that claim.\n\n  So I just say to my colleagues, I favor the notion of having some \nportion of Social Security in an account where people control their own \ninvestment. I like that idea. But we have to work through the \ntransition costs of this very carefully or we will undermine and \nthreaten the solvency, the long-term solvency, of the Social Security \ntrust fund itself. That should not be anything that we do.\n  Our first obligation, I believe, is to stop raiding the Social \nSecurity trust fund, stop raiding those funds, and move to secure the \nlong-term solvency of Social Security and then have a chance to move in \nthe direction the Senator from Delaware has asked for.\n  Mr. President, I will be happy to yield back my time so the \ndistinguished Senator from New York has a chance to comment on the \nissue before us.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield up to 15 minutes to the \nSenator from New York, Senator Moynihan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and neighbor from New \nJersey, the manager on our side, and my friend Senator Conrad of the \nFinance Committee, for his remarks.\n  Mr. President, I rise not so much in opposition to the proposal by \nthe esteemed chairman of our committee, as to see if it is not possible \nto clarify some of these issues. And to welcome the Senate to what \nshould be a substantive, constructive debate over the next 6 months--\npending the time when our distinguished Director of the Office of \nManagement and Budget, Mr. Franklin D. Raines, has indicated the \nadministration plans to begin to have legislation on this issue, in the \nfirst session of the next Congress. In my view, we ought to take up \nsuch legislation as a first order of business in that session.\n  May I take the presumed responsibility of this body, which tends to \nhave long tenure, to give a bit of history? In 1935, we established the \nSocial Security system on a pay-as-you-go basis. It was no time, in the \nmidst of a great economic depression, to take more money out of the \neconomy than was being put back, even if it was only a nominal process.\n  This went on until 1977 when we moved from a pay-as-you-go system to \na partially funded system. I was a member of the committee of \nconference between the Senate and the House which adopted that change, \nand I can say there was very little attention paid to it. We put in \nplace a huge surplus to provide for the baby boom retirement, as the \nphrase was. But we did not put in place any mechanism to save that \nsurplus.\n  Indeed, if I look around the horizon of political economy, I do not \nthink there is any such mechanism. You can strengthen an economy by \npaying down debt such that the private sector grows. Theoretically you \ncould build warehouses and fill them with cans of Campbell soup to be \nopened in 30 years time. But in a system of this kind, a defined \nbenefit arrangement for retirement and for survivors and the disabled--\nonly 62 percent of persons receiving Social Security benefits are \nretired persons; the rest are spouses and children of persons who have \ndied, and the disabled--there is no way to save a surplus.\n  The result was that for 21, now 22 years, we have had each year a \nlarge surplus from the payroll tax. This is what Senator Conrad was \nspeaking about. And we have used it for other reasons altogether. We \nhave abused it because at a minimum we have never let our debt be paid \ndown so our private savings and investment would rise as an absolute \nreciprocal, as mathematicians say. For every dollar of debt you pay \ndown you get a dollar of savings that will be used for private \ninvestment.\n  Instead, we used this money to conceal the enormity of the deficits \nwe ran in the 1980s and which we now have gotten past. We are now down \nto a stable situation, not yet one of surplus, because we still have \nthis money coming in from the partially funded system we put in place \nin 1977 with a very regressive, high payroll tax, 12.4 percent of \npayroll, paid on the first dollar of income and up to $68,400 this \nyear.\n  But this is no longer much of a surplus. The numbers are \napproximately this, and I say approximately because we won't know for \nanother year or so, but next year the combined costs of old age and \nsurvivors and disability insurance, plus hospital insurance, will be \nroughly equal to the combined payroll tax revenues for these two \nprograms; thereafter you are in deficit. Technically, there are \nTreasury bonds that can be cashed in, but then you have to get general \nrevenue or borrow more to convert them into benefits.\n  By about the year 2010, there is no longer any surplus in the primary \nOASDI, Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance. We have 11 years \nuntil there is nothing left there either.\n  Senator Kerrey of Nebraska and I have introduced legislation that we \nthink accommodates the situation we are in which, first of all, does \nnot save Social Security. Social Security does not need to be saved. \nWhat it does not need is to be destroyed. There is now abroad a \npowerful ideological movement to turn the system of retirement benefits \nand survivors benefits over to personal savings in the market. This is \na legitimate idea, but I am not sure, if it were understood, it would \nbe a very popular idea.\n  It puts at risk much more than we would ever wish to do in terms of \nthe entire population. It translates the experience of successful \nentrepreneurial people in an age of great economic growth into a \nproposition that this is something that the whole of the population can \nand ought to want to do.\n  We have a plan which does two things: One, it secures Social Security \nas a defined benefit for retired persons, for disabled persons, for \nsurvivors indefinitely. Simultaneously, it provides\n\n[[Page S2924]]\n\nfor lowering payroll taxes and allowing the difference to be used for \njust the kind of personal savings accounts, investment accounts, that \nour friend from Delaware would like to do.\n  Specifically, we move from the current 12.4 percent payroll tax--half \nof it by the employee, half by the employer--to 10.4. That will pay \nyour benefits for more than 30 years; thereafter the payroll tax is \ngradually increased to a combined 13.4 percent thereby, with some other \nadjustments I will mention, securing the system for more than a \ncentury. Then we say give the employee the option of taking his or her \n1 percent as income--some will do that; young persons will do, no \ndoubt--or having the 2 percent deposited into some kind of thrift \nsavings plan.\n  We have such an arrangement in the Federal Government. You can \ncontribute part of your salary, which the Federal Government matches. \nThere is a booklet, and you pick the kind of investment you would like. \nSome people like index funds, bonds, mutual funds--there are a whole \nrange of these products, as they are called, and you can pick what you \nwish, and from time to time you can change, if you wish.\n  The prospect for the average earner with a 2 percent investment is \nthat, after contributing for 45 years into the system, the worker would \nhave a nominal asset from that 2 percent contribution in the range of \n$400,000. This would mean Americans would have an estate. They could \nleave something to their grandchildren, who might even be more \nattentive given that prospect.\n  We have an idea of an America very different from the world of the \n1930s and the system we put in place, which was put in place in Europe \nin the 1880s. We have an idea of a retirement system in which persons \nbegin to have a three-tiered system: You have your Social Security, a \nfixed amount, an annuity. You have benefits from private pensions that \nyou earned with your employer. About half of American workers now have \nsuch. And then you have income, if you wish it, from your savings and \ninvestment accounts.\n  That requires a few other changes. It requires that we get an \naccurate cost-of-living index by which to adjust the benefits for \nchanges in the cost of living. We do not now have one. There is a small \ngroup of economists who dissent, but the overwhelming judgment of the \nprofession is that the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index \nis not a cost-of-living index, which the Bureau of Labor Statistics \ninsists it is not. They do not misrepresent their product; it is we who \nmisuse it.\n\n  I will say that again. The Department of Labor does not misrepresent \nits Consumer Price Index; it is we who misuse it. We began the practice \nin 1972 at a time when Social Security benefits were the object of a \nbiannual auction on the House and Senate floors as Members rose to say, \n``I propose we raise benefits 5 percent,'' then 10 percent, then 15 \npercent. I think on one occasion we went up 20 percent. We had to stop \nthat. The nearest thing at hand was the CPI. We can make a correction.\n  A committee of distinguished economists, headed by Professor Michael \nBoskin, the former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under \nPresident Bush, reported to the Committee on Finance a year and a half \nago recommending a correction of 1.1 percentage points.\n  Different economists, different Government officials, have different \njudgments, but they are almost all in the same range. And just at this \nmoment, the principal economic planners of the U.S. Government do not \nuse the CPI as a measure of inflation. They just don't; they know \notherwise.\n  We have to gradually increase the age of retirement to 70, as we do \nin our bill, way into the next century. Under current law, we are \nalready approaching an increase to 67. The majority of beneficiaries, \nMr. President, retire at age 62 at a reduced benefit, which is \nactuarially sound.\n  We get rid of that dumb earnings test. It wasn't dumb in 1935 when we \nwere encouraging people not to be in the labor force. Right now, if you \nwork between ages 62 and 70, you lose some or all of your benefits. At \nage 70 and above, you would then get increased benefits. That is, you \nreceive the same benefits over the course of your retirement. Under our \nbill, you can decide when to collect your benefits, regardless of \nwhether you are working. You don't have to fool around.\n  We would tax these benefits at the rate at which ordinary pension \nincome is taxed. May I say, Mr. President, for a very, very large \nnumber of our present recipients, particularly the old ones, their \nSocial Security benefit and any other income they might have is so low \nthat they pay no Federal taxes of any kind and would not pay any taxes \nunder this new proposal.\n  But I say that this can be done, but it won't be done if we don't \nunderstand that we are dealing with a group, a body of respectable \nopinion, that basically thinks Social Security is a failed plan, \nperhaps never should have been put in place and now should be \ntransitioned out. This is not the view of the Senator from Delaware. He \nwould like to see a basic annuity for all Americans continue. But it is \nthe view of many more people than we know, or perhaps are aware of, or \nperhaps are collected in a coherent manner.\n  This morning in the Committee on Ways and Means, Mr. Gingrich spoke \nvery much in these terms. Typically, Senator Dole, who appeared as a \nwitness, did not. The problem is, right now there are groups who are so \nattached to the present system that they will not make the changes \nnecessary to maintain the present system. It is painful. They know who \nthey are. If I may say, the White House knows who they are. I daresay \nthere aren't many of us in the Finance Committee who do not know. But \nthey must recognize that the alternative is the loss of everything we \nhave developed over 60 years, 60 years in which the system has never \nbeen a day late or dollar short on any payment, but which has somehow \nlost the confidence of the public. I ask my distinguished friend for \nanother 2 minutes to conclude.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will be happy to yield up to 5 minutes, as needed, \nby the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I want to make this point. I want to \nshout this point at the American people: They are trying to scare you \nout of your Social Security. You don't think you are going to get it \nnow. Why, I am not sure. But ask anyone on the streets at home. Ask \nsomeone in their thirties or in their forties. The polls are clear. \nPeople do not expect to get it. Partly this is bad management at the \nSocial Security Administration. It got lost in the HEW and then HHS.\n\n  In 1994, we re-created it as an independent agency with an \nindependent Administrator, but the SSA never tells people that the \nagency knows their name, what they are going to get in benefits, and \nthat they are on top of this.\n  I say it right now, there are people who would like to scare you into \nthinking you are not going to get Social Security, so don't worry about \nit when they take it away, and what they are going to make you instead \nis a millionaire in the stock market. I don't think that will happen. I \ndon't think it should. I think we should allow the accommodation of \nboth. I think we should begin, if I can use a term from the academy, to \ndemystify some of these claims, not by Senator Roth, who is loyal to \nthis institution. He has been on the Finance Committee for 30 years and \nhas helped maintain the system.\n  But there are those who are out to do away with it. Why, I do not \nknow. They take as their model the system in the Nation of Chile, a \nnation of some 12 million people, I believe, a system developed under \nGeneral Pinochet, which does not immediately suggest sound social \npolicy or equity. I don't say there is anything wrong with their \nsystem, but there is nothing wrong with ours either. It is ours to \nmaintain. We should do it, and we should not let our people be \nfrightened into giving up something so important to them and to their \nchildren and to their parents.\n  I thank my friend for giving me this time. I regretfully have to say \nthat while I very much endorse the idea of personal savings accounts, \nright now we should use the surplus money we have to pay down the debt, \nincrease investment, and get on with the simple changes we need to make \nthis system permanent and stable.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I thank the manager for his \ncourtesy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this amendment sounds innocuous, but it \nis a direct assault on Social Security, and\n\n[[Page S2925]]\n\nit deserves resounding rejection by the Senate.\n  Millions of senior citizens depend on Social Security. In fact, \nSocial Security benefits comprise more than 75% of the income of half \nof the nation's 28 million recipients. It is a sacred compact between \ncitizens and their government that says, ``pay into Social Security \nduring your working years, and we will guarantee you a decent \nretirement income during your golden years.''\n  Social Security is one of the most popular programs ever enacted. It \nis also one of our nation's most successful anti-poverty programs. In \n1959, 35% of the nation's elderly lived in poverty. Today, that number \nhas dropped to 9%.\n  We all recognize that legislative action is necessary to assure that \nSocial Security will be solvent throughout the 21st century. There is \nno crisis--but there is a problem, and the sooner we take action to \nsolve it the better. All of us know that Social Security will run out \nof money in 2030. All of us know that the single highest priority of \nthe American people is to see Social Security preserved.\n  All of us know that the President has said that none of the budget \nsurplus should be spent until we solve the Social Security problem--and \nthe American people strongly support this approach.\n  But this amendment takes a different approach. It says: ``Let's \nforget about preserving Social Security. Let's go ahead and spend the \nsurplus on a risky and untried experiment with individual retirement \naccounts.''\n  We all know what is going on here. There are a number of members of \nthis body who want to throw Security on the scrap heap of history. They \nthink it ought to be privatized. They think the concept of Social \nSecurity is wrong. They think individuals, instead of relying on the \ntried and true and guaranteed support that Social Security provides, \nshould take their chances by speculating in the stock market. If they \ndo well, they can become rich. If they do poorly and are impoverished \nin their old age--so be it.\n  I reject that philosophy. The American people, I believe, also reject \nthat philosophy. And the Senate should reject that amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, just to be certain, if we combine the \ntime that was yielded off the resolution and off of the amendment, the \nproponents used a total of?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We to this point have used a total of?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thirty. So I will yield myself some time off of the \namendment, which I understand is the time that remains to respond to \nthe proposal by the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, \nthe Senator from Delaware, whose proposals we always take seriously. \nThis is a man who is intelligent, who is committed to the proper \nprocedure of getting things done. We have great respect and regard for \nthe Senator from Delaware. But we can nevertheless disagree.\n  On this particular proposal, I do disagree because I see things in \nperhaps a different light. When I think of the prospect--and I thank \nthe Senator from New York because, as usual, he has a grasp of issues \nthat goes way beyond the capacity of the average human being. And, boy, \ndo we learn, and we learn in a hurry here. But nevertheless, I listened \ncarefully to what the Senator from New York said. He talked about the \npossibilities of some investment on the private side, and I respect \nthat, when combined with other changes that have to be made. I think \notherwise we are rushing almost willy-nilly into a change, if this \nproves to be law at some time, that would rock the timbers of our \nsociety.\n  When we think of Social Security, we think of the foundation that it \nholds for senior citizens. I kind of ask myself, well, would we \nrecommend to the elderly across this country that they go ahead with \nsome investment adviser, or make a decision on their own, whether it is \nto buy fund X, A, B, or C? We saw what happened to this investment club \nthat was doing so well, according to the papers, and finally they \nadmitted they made a few accounting mistakes. Would anyone want to have \nto face that widow who perhaps gets $700, $800 a month and say, \n``Sorry, there's an error; you don't have $800 a month, you have $400 a \nmonth or $500 a month''? Or would you rather say, ``Listen, what you \nhave is guaranteed. It may not have provided the kinds of things that \nyour husband and you had when you were living together, but you will \nnot be chased out of your room or your house. You will have a chance to \ncontinue to live at some scale, modest as it may be.''\n  But when I look at companies like the Prudential Insurance Company, \none of the great companies of the world, one of, if not the largest \ncompany in the world--it was among the top five--it had some \ninappropriate management problems there. And they are good friends of \nmine, so I do not knock the company. But they, nevertheless, had to \nreduce the interest they were paying on policies, on cash reserves on \ntheir policies. This giant company, the Rock, the Rock of Gibraltar was \ntheir trademark, and they had to reduce their interest rates.\n  In October, a few years ago, 1987, the market lost a substantial \nportion of the holdings. I was at a meeting in Boston and people up \nthere were shaken to their foundation to see their investments, their \ngrowth in investments, suddenly whittled away by some 15-plus percent. \nWhile I am excited about the market and where it is going, just like \neverybody else, I know one thing: That going down is always faster than \ngoing up when there is any velocity attached to it.\n  I think that without full deliberation about what the consequences \nmight be, pro and con, with this kind of investment, it is excessively \nhasty. I would not want to be talking to people who suddenly decided \nthey wished they had had Social Security IOUs, as they were described \nhere. I do not know about you, but I know that I still feel pretty good \nabout an IOU owed by the U.S. Government, by the people of America. \nThose are, as they say in the movies, as good as it gets, not high-\npaying but everybody pretty much feels that, listen, the worst that \nhappens, we are going to get paid. We may even have it monetized a \nlittle bit with inflation, but the fact is we know it is there.\n\n  So when I look at the proposition that is offered, I say that I hope \nmy colleagues will vote against it. When you cast your vote, you must \nlook or try to look in the eyes of an elderly parent or grandparent, or \nperhaps, at some of our ages, a brother or sister, who are totally \ndependent on Social Security for their survival--for their survival.\n  I tell you, I would not recommend on a personal basis--and I have had \na lot of experience. I ran a big company. And I managed, as part of my \nresponsibilities, the company's investments. I managed acquisition. I \nhad a lot to do with the financial side of things. I could hardly \nimagine myself recommending to someone whose principal asset, exclusive \nasset in some cases, was Social Security, that they invest in the \nmarket a little bit, buy a hedge fund maybe or, gee, your adviser--I \nremember when one of the great unions, I say to Senator Moynihan, sued \na bank in New York, who I will not identify here, for the poor \nperformance that this bank had with hundreds of millions of dollars \nthat belonged to this union's pension funds because it underperformed.\n  Who, with an investment of a couple thousand dollars a year or a \nthousand dollars a year or less, is going to be able to pick just the \nright adviser? There is some genius sitting there waiting to take your \n$1,000 a year and monitor it and watch it? Come on, what do we think \nthis is? The guys who get that kind of attention are the guys who hit \nthe new scales on the heights--$500 million in net worth, $1 billion in \nnet worth, the people who are outside.\n  I know of one university fund, common among investments, being made \ntoday by university endowments, who wants to get into investments that \nthey can be out of in 5 years. They do not want to be stuck in \ninvestments that carry them indefinitely. And you will find that true \nin place after place.\n  I say also that everyone is aware today that capital is not a problem \nin this country. Capital is chasing investment all over. I know people \nin the real estate business. I know people in the investment business \nand merchant banks. And people are coming to them--institutions, \nuniversities, companies, individuals--with money saying, ``Please help \nme invest it properly.\n\n[[Page S2926]]\n\n Please help me place it securely. Please help me make sure that it's \nsafe.''\n  So how is a person who has a modest Social Security income going to \nhave the security to know that they have the right person advising them \nor whether they know how to read a financial statement? It is an \ninteresting idea, but an idea, in my view, whose time has not come. I \nhope that we will stand securely against it, give it a chance, led by \nthe leadership that the chairman of the Finance Committee can so aptly \nprovide, and have a full review of what it means.\n  We have discussed it. We have discussed it in the Budget Committee, \nand we have discussed it with other committees, with Alan Greenspan and \nwith other distinguished economists: What does it mean? What about \nprivatization? Some say yes, some say no. I tell you this, I would far \nrather be one who said no, just leave it where it is, than take the \nrisk that we have to face someone who is depending on Social Security \nand not finding the reserve there when they need it.\n\n  So I hope this amendment does not pass. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst it. No disrespect to the chairman of the Finance Committee or \nthose who are supporting it, but it just needs more time than we have.\n  Mr. President, as I stated, I must oppose the proposal to allocate \nthe surplus for personal savings accounts. In my view, this proposal \nhas serious ramifications for the future of Social Security. And we \nshouldn't endorse it without first carefully examining all of its \nimplications.\n  Mr. President, let me just discuss a few of the concerns raised by \nthis amendment.\n  First, this proposal represents a major step toward privatizing \nSocial Security. And privatization, in my view, is directly \ninconsistent with the fundamental purpose of the program.\n  Social Security is supposed to guarantee that all American seniors \ncan avoid poverty and live their lives with a basic level of dignity. \nIt is a social insurance program. It is not supposed to be the only \nsource of retirement income for most seniors.\n  Moving to a system of private accounts represents a dramatic shift in \nrisks. Away from government. And onto the backs of individual senior \ncitizens.\n  Under a privatized system, seniors would lose: protection against \ndeclines in stock prices; protection against inflation through cost of \nliving adjustments; and protection against outliving their assets.\n  Mr. President, protections against these kinds of risks--which are \ncompletely beyond the control of any individual--are why we need social \ninsurance in the first place.\n  Let me be clear. I'm all for private retirement savings. I support \nIRAs and 401(k)s, and believe Americans need to save more. But private \nsavings should supplement, not replace, social insurance. Otherwise, \nmost Americans will spend their old age walking a financial high wire, \nwithout a safety net. And as someone who lived through the Great \nDepression, that is not what I want for my children and grandchildren.\n  If we use a surplus to roll back payroll taxes and force people to \nput this money into private accounts, money would be drained from the \nSocial Security trust funds. That would accelerate the date when the \nprogram will go bankrupt. And that is the opposite of what we should be \ndoing.\n  There are many other points I could make about this proposal, but I \nwill not get into great detail here. Let me just say again that this is \nnot the kind of change that we should endorse without a great deal of \ncareful and thoughtful debate. That discussion is only now just getting \nunderway. And it would be premature to rush to judgment on such a \nfundamental change in our system.\n  So I hope my colleagues will oppose this proposal. Let us fix Social \nSecurity. But let us do it carefully. And let us do it right.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed some editorials in the \nRecord. The Senator from New York has asked us to do that, and I put \nthem forward.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From USA Today, Mar. 17, 1998]\n\nSocial Security Needs Repair, But Poor Shouldn't Pay For It--Moynihan's \n        Plan Isn't Perfect, But at Least He's Got People Talking\n\n                          (By Michael Tanner)\n\n       Before the nation can solve its $15 trillion problem of \n     financing 70 million baby-boomer retirements, people need to \n     start talking about it. On Monday, Sen. Daniel Patrick \n     Moynihan, D-N.Y., gave them a place to begin.\n       His conversation starter: a 15% cut in the Social Security \n     payroll tax that could all go into a personal retirement \n     account.\n       In a speech at Harvard, Moynihan tacked that concept on to \n     his long-standing plan to put Social Security on a pay-as-\n     you-go basis. That's a small step, perhaps, but one that \n     could help break a political stalemate over Social Security \n     reform.\n       It bows to GOP plans to give people more control over \n     Social Security contributions while keeping the safety net \n     Democrats favor.\n       To pay for these enticements. Moynihan proposes some hard \n     medicine members of both parties have balked at swallowing.\n       Neither party has shown enthusiasm for Moynihan's plan to \n     end their balanced-budget charade. Payroll tax cuts now would \n     take away revenue that's used to mask government's $100 \n     million operating deficit.\n       And even those who embrace budget honesty aren't likely to \n     enjoy the senator's proposals for making up the money and \n     ensuring Social Security's fiscal soundness.\n       He'd reduce cost-of-living adjustments for both tax \n     deductions and benefit increases. He'd also subject more \n     income to the payroll tax, raise the retirement age to 67 \n     more quickly than now planned, and raise payroll taxes higher \n     than today's levels after 2025.\n       Trade-offs like those are inevitable if Social Security is \n     to be saved. But the real problem with Moynihan's plan is the \n     risk that it may not go far enough to protect the poorest \n     workers in their old age.\n       That is Social Security's fundamental goal. And it has \n     almost been achieved.\n       In 1935 when the program was initiated, more than half of \n     all elderly were supported by their children. Today, most are \n     independent. In 40 years, poverty rates among the elderly \n     have plummeted from 35% to under 11%, with Social Security \n     providing the bulk of income for 40% of elderly households.\n       Unlike most plans to privatize all or part of Social \n     Security, Moynihan's would not make savings mandatory. So \n     low-income families, squeezed for pennies, likely would spend \n     the $4 a week they'd get from the payroll tax cut.\n       That permissiveness is counterproductive. If the money were \n     saved for 40 years at 7% interest, it would generate more \n     than $40,000. The income from those savings--about $2,800 a \n     year at the same 7% rate--combined with other Social Security \n     payments would keep recipients out of poverty. Such savings \n     are essential for laborers who may not be able to work into \n     their late 60s as Moynihan's higher retirement age would \n     require.\n       Congress needs to start moving soon on Social Security \n     reform. Time is the great enemy of affordable answers. And \n     enabling people to invest some Social Security themselves may \n     be part of the answer.\n       But the test for any changes is whether they'll assure all \n     Americans of an adequate retirement. Social Security \n     shouldn't be saved or altered by robbing the poor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From USA Today, Mar. 17, 1998]\n\n Tinkering Won't do the Job--The Only Sensible Solution Allows Private \n                               Investment\n\n                          (By Michael Tanner)\n\n       From President Clinton on down, there is now a national \n     consensus that Social Security is in trouble. Indeed, the \n     retirement program will begin running a deficit by 2012, just \n     14 years from now. The program's total unfunded liabilities \n     top $9 trillion.\n       Yet, in the face of the coming crisis, some still resist \n     serious change. They will suggest that a little tinkering \n     around the edges will be enough to fix Social Security.\n       Some want to raise taxes. But payroll taxes have already \n     been raised more than 38 times since Social Security began. \n     Even after accounting for inflation, payroll taxes are 800% \n     higher than at the program's inception. Three out of four \n     American workers now pay more in payroll taxes than they pay \n     in federal income taxes.\n       Others want to cut benefits. But young workers are already \n     going to receive less back in benefits than they pay in \n     Social Security taxes. Reducing benefits will only make \n     Social Security a worse deal for these young workers.\n       Tinkering will not fix Social Security's most basic flaw. \n     Social Security is a pay-as-you-go program, similar to the \n     type of pyramid scheme that is illegal in every state.\n       Taxes paid by today's workers are not saved for their \n     retirement, but rather are spent immediately to pay benefits \n     for today's retirees. When those workers retire, they have to \n     hope that the next generation of workers will be large enough \n     to support them. But with people living longer and having \n     fewer children, the number of workers supporting each retiree \n     is shrinking.\n       What we really need is a new Social Security system based \n     on the power of private investment and individual savings.\n       Under such a plan, benefits to current retirees would be \n     guaranteed, but workers would be given the option of shifting \n     their payroll taxes to individually owned retirement \n     accounts, similar to IRAs or 401(k) plans.\n\n[[Page S2927]]\n\n       Those accounts would be privately invested in real assets \n     such as stocks, bonds, annuities, etc. Because private \n     investment brings much higher returns, individuals could \n     expect to receive much higher retirement benefits.\n       It's time to stop tinkering and get on with the fundamental \n     reform necessary to preserve retirement security for future \n     generations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 18, 1998]\n\n                          Public Trust Busting\n\n       When Senator Pat Moynihan speaks, liberals listen. So it \n     just might mark a watershed in the Social Security reform \n     debate that the New York Democrat this week embraced private \n     investment retirement accounts.\n       Mr. Moynihan's welfare state credentials are impeccable. He \n     helped to expand it during the Johnson and Nixon years and \n     he's been its most intellectually nimble defender since. He \n     bitterly opposed President Clinton's decision to sign a \n     welfare reform law. And only last year, writing in the New \n     York times, he seemed to rule out any significant change in \n     Social Security.\n       Well, he's now revising and extending those remarks. On \n     Monday at Harvard, he said Social Security can be saved only \n     by changing it. And not merely with the usual political \n     kamikaze run of raising taxes and slashing benefits. He's \n     also endorsing a redesign that would allow individuals to \n     invest two percentage points of their payroll tax as they \n     please, presumably in stocks, bonds and other private \n     investments.\n       This is a big breakthrough, ideologically and politically. \n     The idea of a private Social Security option has until \n     recently been the province of libertarians and other \n     romantics. When Steve Forbes talked up the concept in 1996, \n     he was demagogued by fellow Republicans. Even such a free-\n     marketeer as Ronald Reagan was forced to accept a Social \n     Security fix in 1983 that relied mostly on tax hikes.\n       What's changed? Only the world, as Mr. Moynihan admits. The \n     weight of the looming Baby Boom retirement has caused a loss \n     of public faith in Social Security's sustainability. Few Gen-\n     Xers even expect to receive it. More and more Americans also \n     began to see the virtue of private retirement vehicles like \n     IRAs and 401(k)s, which grew like Topsy as the stock market \n     boomed.\n       ``In the meanwhile the academic world had changed,'' Mr. \n     Moynihan also told the mostly liberal academics at Harvard. \n     ``The most energetic and innovative minds had turned away \n     from government programs--the nanny state-toward individual \n     enterprise, self-reliance, free markets.'' (No, he wasn't \n     quoting from this editorial page.) Privatizing Social \n     Security suddenly became thinkable, in many minds even \n     preferable.\n       In short, the same economic and political forces that have \n     remade American business are now imposing change on \n     government. Global competition and instant information have \n     forced industry to streamline or die. Now those forces are \n     busting up public monopolies--the public trusts, to adapt a \n     Teddy Roosevelt phrase--that deliver poor results.\n       In the U.S. that means breaking a public school monopoly \n     that traps poor kids in mediocrity or worse. And it means \n     reforming a retirement system that gives individuals only a \n     fraction of the return on their savings that they know they'd \n     receive if they invested the money themselves. These are \n     ultimately moral questions, because in the name of equity \n     these public trusts are damaging opportunity for those who \n     need it most.\n       The rich have known for years how to exploit the magic of \n     compound interest, for example. Why shouldn't working stiffs \n     have the same chance? Mr. Moynihan shows that a worker \n     earning $30,000 a year can, at a modest 5% annual return, \n     amass $450,000 in savings over 45 years by shifting just 2% \n     of the payroll tax into a private account. Thus do even \n     liberals become capitalists.\n       Now, let us acknowledge that ``privatizing'' Social \n     Security is not what Mr. Moynihan desires. His political goal \n     is to reform Social Security just enough to be able to save \n     its universal guarantee. He fears, sensibly enough, that if \n     liberals oppose any change they may find the debate has moved \n     on without them. ``The veto groups that prevented any change \n     in the welfare system,'' he says, ``looked up one day to find \n     the system had vanished.''\n       No doubt many conservatives will want to go much further \n     than the New Yorker, us among them. If investing 2% of the \n     payroll tax rate is desirable, why not more? Workers ought to \n     be able to decide for themselves if they want to trade lower \n     taxes now for a lower Social Security payment at retirement.\n       We also disagree with Mr. Moynihan on some of his details. \n     To defray the cost of reducing the payroll tax, he would \n     increase the amount of wages subject to that tax--from \n     $68,400 now to $97,500 by 2003. This is a large increase in \n     the marginal tax rate for many taxpayers that would defeat \n     reform's very purpose. He'd also raise the payroll tax rate \n     down the line as the Boomers retire--something that needn't \n     happen if the reform were more ambitious than the Senator \n     says he wants.\n       Yet for all of that, Mr. Moynihan moves the debate in the \n     direction of more individual control and more market sense. \n     Along with his pal and co-sponsor, Nebraska's Bob Kerrey, he \n     has broken with liberal orthodoxy. Maybe their daring will \n     even give courage to Republicans.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 29, 1998]\n\n                      Wrong Way on Social Security\n\n       Proposals from archconservatives to chip away at a \n     gargantuan Government program like Social Security shock no \n     one. But when an influential moderate like Senator Daniel \n     Patrick Moynihan proposes to divert Social Security taxes \n     into private retirement accounts, a flawed idea gains ominous \n     support. Mr. Moynihan's rationale is complex. But it is also \n     misleading and unwise.\n       Mr. Moynihan exaggerates the financial predicament by \n     pointing to 2029 as the date that actuaries say the Social \n     Security trust fund will empty out. But actuaries also say \n     that annual revenues will continue to cover almost all of \n     each year's outlays. Indeed, the financial gap amounts to \n     only about 2 percent of payrolls and can be eliminated with \n     modest benefit trims, changes in retirement rules and small \n     tax increases. Instead, Mr. Moynihan proposes a cut of up to \n     30 percent in future benefits, larger even than what is \n     needed to balance the trust fund's books. He does so because \n     his plan includes a second agenda--partial privatization.\n       Mr. Moynihan would temporarily cut payroll taxes and invite \n     workers to deposit the money saved into individual tax-\n     sheltered retirement accounts. Some will accept the \n     invitation and, depending on the outcome of risky investment, \n     replace some or all of the 30 percent benefit cut. But based \n     on past behavior, most workers will not save for their \n     future. Mr. Moynihan's reasons for cutting revenues of a \n     program that he depicts as near bankrupt are political. He \n     wants to stop Congress from frittering away the current \n     temporary surpluses in the program to support other programs \n     in the Federal budget. He also proposes partial privatization \n     to ward off a more sweeping privatization assault by \n     conservatives.\n       Private accounts are popular because, if invested in \n     stocks, they can grow faster than money deposited in the \n     trust fund, which is invested in low-yielding Treasury bonds. \n     Mr. Moynihan warns that liberals who oppose his partial \n     privatization risk having the entire Social Security program \n     scrapped, along with its magnificent record in redistributing \n     money from the rich to poor and thereby lifting millions of \n     retirees out of poverty each year.\n       But Mr. Moynihan refuses to acknowledge the harm his \n     partial privatization scheme would do. Small savings accounts \n     are expensive to administer, threatening to burn up a quarter \n     of a low-wage worker's annual deposit in commissions and bank \n     fees. Besides, the seemingly small return on money turned \n     over to Social Security is partly an optical illusion.\n       Social Security has promised to pay millions of retirees \n     benefits that far exceed the amounts they pay into the trust \n     fund. Part of the payroll tax that workers turn over to the \n     Social Security system covers these unfunded benefits. If \n     part of the money that workers would deposit in private \n     retirement accounts under the Moynihan plan were siphoned off \n     to pay their fair share of unfunded benefits, then the yield \n     on these accounts would look puny too.\n       By reinforcing the false notion that private accounts are \n     far superior to public accounts, Mr. Moynihan risks setting \n     off a political process that would feed the conservative goal \n     to replace virtually the entire public program with private \n     savings.\n       Mr. Moynihan's warning that Social Security looks like a \n     lousy deal for workers should be heeded. The best way to \n     increase retirement funds is to invest payroll taxes in \n     stocks. But rather than having a hundred million workers \n     invest itsy-bitsy amounts on their own, the trust fund \n     itself, through a process insulated from politics, should \n     invest in equities on behalf of everyone. The Social Security \n     problem is modest. So too are the right solutions\n                                  ____\n\n\n          [From the Christian Science Monitor, Mar. 19, 1998]\n\n                               SOS for SS\n\n       Always pungent Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan has gotten to \n     the heart of America's Social Security problem. In a speech \n     at Harvard this week he offered a specific, tough-minded \n     formula for saving Social Security from the demographic \n     collision it faces in future decades.\n       Moynihan, long an expert on Social Security, shrewdly weds \n     (a) a conservative plan to allow workers to invest a portion \n     of their SS payroll tax in a private nest egg to (b) a return \n     to a Rooseveltian pay-as-you-go pension system.\n       As ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, he \n     plans to propose such a reform immediately.\n       Compare that with the official Washington crawl on Social \n     Security.\n       In his state of the union speech last month, President \n     Clinton claimed to be concentrating mightily on Social \n     Security, but then sent it out for yet another scrutiny by \n     commission. Mr. Clinton also cast himself as a latter day \n     Horatius telling politicians to keep their hands off federal \n     budget surpluses. He said he was earmarking those surpluses \n     to save SS.\n       Good theater. Poor economics. The best way to preserve \n     those surplus revenues for a need starting two decades hence \n     would be to use them now to reduce the national debt. That \n     would trim those huge interest bills on the debt for years to \n     come. And that, in turn,\n\n[[Page S2928]]\n\n     would allow more pay-as-you-go money for SS.\n       Instead, Clinton announced a clutch of new programs that \n     would eat up the surpluses--despite iffy funding from tobacco \n     revenues.\n       Hence the appeal of Moynihan's approach. It would allow \n     Americans to voluntarily use as much as 15 percent of their \n     SS payroll tax for personal pension savings accounts. Because \n     that's optional and restricted to a modest percentage, it \n     would minimize the danger that at retirement a pensioner \n     might suffer from a market drop. And the upside--higher \n     compounded returns over decades of savings--would compensate \n     for increased risk.\n       Meanwhile, Moynihan would seek to ensure that the basic SS \n     pension remains rock solid by assuring its yearly pay-as-you-\n     go integrity. To make bearable the tax burden borne by next \n     generation workers paying for their retiring baby boom \n     parents, he adapts two existing ideas: (1) Speed the move to \n     a standard retirement age of 70, reflecting longevity \n     statistics. (2) Trim the rate of indexing for inflation.\n       There will be battles to come. But at least one of our most \n     thoughtful political statements has gotten a realistic mix of \n     elements on the table. Now it's up to his colleagues.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG.

Mr. President, I want to speak for a couple of minutes \nabout a conference report that is now before the Senate which is of the \nutmost urgency that we proceed to and pass yet today. I am hopeful we \ncan do it. That is S. 1150. It is the agricultural research bill which \nwe passed here last year by unanimous consent. What happened is, the \nHouse passed it also last year but the House, for one reason or \nanother, refused to go to conference, and then the session ended last \nyear.\n  About 3 weeks ago, the House finally consented to go to conference. \nWe went to conference. We worked out our agreements on a very important \nbill. And that bill now is before the Senate.\n  In the ag research bill, there are at least three very important \nparts: The ag research; crop insurance, to work out the problems in \ncrop insurance so we can have a disaster crop insurance program for the \nnext 5 years; and there is also a food stamp provision for refugees and \nthe asylees that were inadvertently left out of the welfare-to-work \nreform bill that we passed in August of 1996.\n  We need to pass this bill today. It is of the utmost urgency. We have \nover 717,000 catastrophic crop insurance policies in America today, \nfarmers all over this country, from California to Maryland, from North \nDakota to Texas. All rely upon this crop insurance program.\n  If we don't pass this bill very soon, those policies will start to \nlapse and those farmers who have to plant in the summertime for winter \ncrops will not be able to get their crop insurance. That means if they \nwere to have a natural disaster that would wipe them out completely, \nthey would be in here to Congress again begging us to bail them out. \nThat is why it is so important we pass this today.\n  Now, why today? Because we have a very strange parliamentary \nsituation. If we don't pass it today and this budget passes tomorrow, \nwhich it will, then we lose all the money that we have for crop \ninsurance to help out our farmers. I might also add, we lose the money \nthat is in there to meet a need for refugees and asylees who are legal \nimmigrants in this country. Some of them, like the Hmong who fought \nalongside our American troops in Laos during the Vietnam war, were \ninadvertently cut out of the welfare reform bill. This is in the bill \nbefore us, S. 1150.\n  As I said, S. 1150 had bipartisan support in conference, Republicans \nand Democrats, House and Senate. We worked out all the differences. \nThere are no objections in our committees to this. That is why it is so \nvitally important that we pass it today.\n  I guess I ask here on the floor, the majority leader, and to the \nstaff who are here, if they could possibly bring up S. 1150 today, \nsometime by the end of the day. I don't know if the managers of the \nbill would mind if we set it aside for 15 minutes--I don't think it \nwould take longer than that; after all, it passed by unanimous consent \nlast year--and pass it today. I don't think it would take much time. As \nI said, I am sure Senator Lugar, being the chairman, and I, the ranking \nminority member, don't need more than 15 minutes on this bill. It is \nvitally important, because if we don't pass it, we will lose the crop \ninsurance for our farmers, especially those who need to plant summer \ncrops.\n  I yield to Senator Conrad from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to add my voice to the strong voice \nof the Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin. We are now facing an \nemergency with respect to the research bill. The research title is a \nbit of a misnomer because much more is involved here than agricultural \nresearch, although that is critically important. That is critically \nimportant because we have been hit all across the country with a set of \ndiseases because we are in a wet cycle. That wet cycle has been \ndevastating in my State. We lost 30 percent of the crop last year, over \n$1 billion of economic loss because of scab and vomitoxin, and those \nlosses continue.\n  Now we are in a situation where we desperately need research into \nthose diseases, but it goes much beyond that. It goes to the heart of \nthe crop insurance system in America. As the Senator from Iowa has \nindicated, there are 700,000 policyholders in America. They are about \nto get a notice that there is no crop insurance available for them. \nThat is the danger that we risk if we fail to act, and act today.\n  The crop insurance shortfall may result in farmers across the Nation \nreceiving cancellation notices. This is a dire emergency.\n\n[[Page S2929]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am delighted to yield 1 minute to our colleague \nfrom North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be brief.\n  The Senator from Iowa raise a concern of some urgency for the United \nStates Senate. What he is describing is a bipartisan agreement on \nlegislation that is critical to our part of the country. It deals not \nonly with research, but also with crop insurance. It deals with \ncritically needed investment for research in crop diseases such as \nfusarium head blight or scab which produces vomitoxin in wheat and \nbarley.\n\n  We have an awful problem out in our part of the country with these \ncrop diseases and crop losses. We need a viable crop insurance program. \nWe were delighted when the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from \nIndiana and others reached this bipartisan agreement and moved it \nthrough the conference with the House of Representatives. I know how \nhard that was. That was a tough thing to do because the sides were \nquite far apart. When they reached this agreement, we were delighted \nwith that. It is an important agreement.\n  Now, as usual, in the case of politics, timing is everything. It is \nvery important for this bipartisan conference agreement to be \nconsidered by the Senate and moved along. Time is of the essence here.\n  I commend the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank both Senators from North Dakota for their strong \nvoices and strong support for the crop insurance program.\n  To sum it up, our farmers, our refugees, our asylees, should not be \npenalized because of the delay on the part of the House last year--not \ngoing to conference--and they should not be penalized because of this \nodd parliamentary situation we have.\n  I hope the majority leader and his staff who are listening to this \nwill hopefully bring up this bill today, and let's get it passed.

More than \\1/2\\ of the \n     elderly do not receive private pensions and more than \\1/3\\ \n     have no income from assets.\n       (2) For 60 percent of all senior citizens, social security \n     benefits provide almost 80 percent of their retirement \n     income. For 80 percent of all senior citizens, social \n     security benefits provide over 50 percent of their retirement \n     income.\n       (3) Poverty rates among the elderly are at the lowest level \n     since the United States began to keep poverty statistics, due \n     in large part to the social security system.\n       (4) 78 percent of Americans pay more in payroll taxes than \n     they do in income taxes.\n       (5) According to the 1997 report of the Managing Trustee \n     for the social security trust funds, the accumulated balance \n     in the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund is \n     estimated to fall to zero by 2029, and the estimated payroll \n     tax at that time will be sufficient to cover only 75 percent \n     of the benefits owed to retirees at that time.\n       (6) The average American retiring in the year 2015 will pay \n     $250,000 in payroll taxes over the course of a working \n     career.\n       (7) Future generations of Americans must be guaranteed the \n     same value from the social security system as past covered \n     recipients.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budgetary levels in this resolution assume that no \n     change in the social security system should be made that \n     would reduce the value of the social security system for \n     future generations of retirees.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2241\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress regarding the right to \n           affordable, high-quality health care for seniors)\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

This is not \n     a specific recommendation that any new program be added to \n     Medicare;\n       (2) the Federal Government should take all appropriate \n     steps to inform the public about the financial risks by long-\n     term care costs and about the need for families to plan for \n     their long-term care needs;\n       (3) the Federal Government should take all appropriate \n     steps to inform the public that Medicare does not cover most \n     long-term care costs and that Medicaid covers long-term care \n     costs only when the beneficiary has exhausted his or her \n     assets;\n       (4) the appropriate committees of the Senate, together with \n     the Department of Health and Human Services and other \n     appropriate Executive Branch agencies, should develop \n     specific ideas for encouraging Americans to plan for their \n     own long-term care needs; and\n       (5) the upcoming National Summit on Retirement Income \n     Savings should ensure that planning for long-term care is an \n     integral part of any discussion of retirement security.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2251\n\n Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the Congress should \n           begin to phase out the marriage penalty this year\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON VA COMPENSATION AND POST-\n                   SERVICE SMOKING-RELATED ILLNESSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the President has twice included in his budgets not \n     permitting the program expansion that the Veterans \n     Administration (referred to as the ``VA'') is proposing to \n     allow post-service smoking-related illness to be eligible for \n     VA compensation;\n       (2) Congress has never acted on this program expansion;\n       (3) the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of \n     Management and Budget have concluded that this change in VA \n     policy would result in at least $10,000,000,000 in additional \n     costs to the VA;\n       (4) these increased number of claims and the resulting \n     costs may present undue delay and hardship on veterans \n     seeking claim review; and\n       (5) the programs expansion apparently runs counter to all \n     existing VA policy, including a statement by former Secretary \n     Brown that ``It is inappropriate to compensate for death or \n     disability resulting from veterans' personal choice to engage \n     in conduct damaging to their health.''.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the function totals and assumptions underlying this \n     resolution assume the following:\n       (1) The support of the President's proposal to not allow \n     post-service smoking related illnesses to be eligible for VA \n     compensation until the study annd report required by \n     paragraph (2) are completed.\n       (2) The Veterans Administration and the Office of \n     Management and Budget are jointly required to--\n       (A) jointly study (referred to in this section as the \n     ``study'') the VA General Counsel's determination (O.G.C. 2-\n     93) and the resulting actions to change the compensation \n     rules to include disability and death benefits for conditions \n     related to the use of tobacco products during service; and\n       (B) deliver an opinion as to whether illnesses resulting \n     from post-service smoking should be considered as a \n     compensable disability.\n       (3) The study should include--\n       (A) the estimated numbers of those filing such claims, the \n     cost resulting from such benefits, the time necessary to \n     review such claims, and how such a number of claims will \n     affect the VA's ability to review its current claim load;\n       (B) an examination of how the proposed change corresponds \n     to prior VA policy relating to post-service actions taken by \n     an individual; and\n       (C) what Federal benefits, both VA and non-VA, former \n     service members having smoking-related illnesses are eligible \n     to receive.\n       (4) The study shall be completed no later than July 1, \n     1999.\n       (5) The Veterans Administration shall report its finding to \n     the Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate and the \n     chairmen and ranking minority members of the Senate Budget \n     and Veterans' Affairs Committees.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2262\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on the procurement of \n   Blackhawk utility helicopters for Colombia to reduce illicit drug \n                              trafficking)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON COLOMBIAN DRUG WAR \n                   HELICOPTERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Colombia is the leading illicit drug producing country \n     in the Western Hemisphere;\n       (2) 80 percent of the world's cocaine originates in \n     Colombia;\n       (3) based on the most recent data of the Drug Enforcement \n     Administration (DEA), more than 60 percent of the heroin \n     seized in the United States originates in Colombia;\n       (4) in the last 10 years more than 4,000 officers of the \n     Colombian National Police have died fighting the scourge of \n     drugs;\n       (5) in one recent year alone, according to data of the \n     United States Government, the United States had 141,000 new \n     heroin users and the United States faces historic levels of \n     heroin use among teenagers between the ages of 12 and 17;\n       (6) once Colombian heroin is in the stream of commerce it \n     is nearly impossible to interdict because it is concealed and \n     trafficked in very small quantities;\n       (7) the best and most cost efficient method of preventing \n     Colombian heroin from entering the United States is to \n     destroy the opium poppies in the high Andes mountains where \n     Colombian heroin is produced;\n       (8) the elite anti-narcotics unit of the Colombian National \n     Police has the responsibility to eradicate both coca and \n     opium in Colombia, including the reduction and elimination of \n     cocaine and heroin production, and\n\n[[Page S2937]]\n\n     they have done a remarkably effective job with the limited \n     and outdated equipment at their disposal;\n       (9) more than 40 percent of the anti-narcotics operations \n     of the Colombian National Police involve hostile ground fire \n     from narco-terrorists and 90 percent of such operations \n     involve the use of helicopters;\n       (10) the need for better high performance helicopters by \n     the Colombian National Police, especially for use in the high \n     Andes mountains, is essential for more effective eradication \n     of opium in Colombia;\n       (11) on December 23, 1997, one of the antiquated Vietnam-\n     era UH-1H Huey helicopters used by the Colombian National \n     Police in an opium eradication mission crashed in the high \n     Andes mountains due to high winds and because it was flying \n     above the safety level recommended by the original \n     manufacturer;\n       (12) in the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and \n     Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1998 (Public Law 105-\n     118), amounts were appropriated for the procurement by the \n     United States for the Colombian National Police of three UH-\n     60L Blackhawk utility helicopters that can operate safely and \n     more effectively at the high altitudes of the Andes mountains \n     where Colombian opium grows at altitudes as high as 12,000 \n     feet;\n       (13) the Blackhawk helicopter is a high performance utility \n     helicopter, with greater lift capacity, that can perform at \n     the high altitudes of the Andes mountains, as well as survive \n     crashes and sustain ground fire, much better than any other \n     utility helicopter now available to the Colombian National \n     Police in the war on drugs;\n       (14) because the Vietnam-era Huey helicopters that the \n     United States has provided the Colombian National Police are \n     outdated and have been developing numerous stress cracks, a \n     sufficient number should be upgraded to Huey II's and the \n     remainder should be phased-out as soon as possible;\n       (15) these Huey helicopters are much older than most of the \n     pilots who fly them, do not have the range due to limited \n     fuel capacity to reach many of the expanding locations of the \n     coca fields or cocaine labs in southern Colombia, nor do they \n     have the lift capacity to carry enough armed officers to \n     reach and secure the opium fields in the high Andes mountains \n     prior to eradication;\n       (16) the elite anti-narcotics unit of the Colombian \n     National Police has a stellar record in respecting for human \n     rights and has received the commendation of a leading \n     international human rights group in their operations to \n     reduce and eradicate illicit drugs in Colombia;\n       (17) the narco-terrorists of Colombia have announced that \n     they will now target United States citizens, particularly \n     those United States citizens working with their Colombian \n     counterparts in the fight against illicit drugs in Colombia;\n       (18) a leading commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces \n     of Colombia (``FARC'') announced recently that the objective \n     of these narco-terrorists, in light of recent successes, will \n     be ``to defeat the Americans'';\n       (19) United States Government personnel in Colombia who fly \n     in these helicopters accompanying the Colombian National \n     Police on missions are now at even greater risk from these \n     narco-terrorists and their drug trafficking allies;\n       (20) in the last six months four anti-narcotics helicopters \n     of the Colombian National Police have been downed in \n     operations;\n       (21) Congress intends to provide the necessary support and \n     assistance to wage an effective war on illicit drugs in \n     Colombia and provide the equipment and assistance needed to \n     protect all of the men and women of the Colombian National \n     Police as well as those Americans who work side by side with \n     the Colombian National Police in this common struggle against \n     illicit drugs;\n       (22) the new Government of Bolivia has made a commitment to \n     eradicate coca and cocaine production in that country within \n     5 years;\n       (23) the United States should support any country that is \n     interested in removing the scourge of drugs from its \n     citizens; and\n       (24) Bolivia has succeeded, in large measure due to United \n     States assistance, in reducing acreage used to produce coca, \n     which is the basis for cocaine production.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals underlying this resolution assume \n     that--\n       (1) the President should, with funds made available under \n     Public Law 105-118, expeditiously procure and provide to the \n     Colombian National Police three UH-60L Blackhawk utility \n     helicopters solely for the purpose of assisting the Colombian \n     National Police to perform their responsibilities to reduce \n     and eliminate the production of illicit drugs in Colombia and \n     the trafficking of such illicit drugs, including the \n     trafficking of drugs such as heroin and cocaine to the United \n     States;\n       (2) if the President determines that the procurement and \n     transfer to the Colombian National Police of three UH-60L \n     Blackhawk utility helicopters is not an adequate number of \n     such helicopters to maintain operational feasibility and \n     effectiveness of the Colombian National Police, then the \n     President should promptly inform Congress as to the \n     appropriate number of additional UH-60L Blackhawk utility \n     helicopters for the Colombian National Police so that amounts \n     can be authorized for the procurement and transfer of such \n     additional helicopters; and\n       (3) assistance for Bolivia should be maintained at least at \n     the level assumed in the fiscal year 1998 budget submission \n     of the President and the Administration should act \n     accordingly.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2263\n\n(Purpose: expressing the Sense of the Senate regarding reauthorization \n

SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE 105TH CONGRESS, 2ND \n                   SESSION SHOULD REAUTHORIZE FUNDS FOR THE \n                   FARMLAND PROTECTION PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings--\n       (1) Eighteen states and dozens of localities have spent \n     nearly $1 billion to protect over 600,000 acres of important \n     farmland;\n       (2) The Farmland Protection Program has provided cost-\n     sharing for eighteen states and dozens of localities to \n     protect over 82,000 acres on 230 farms since 1996;\n       (3) The Farmland Protection Program has generated new \n     interest in saving farmland in communities around the \n     country;\n       (4) The Farmland Protection Program represents an \n     innovative and voluntary partnership, rewards local \n     ingenuity, and supports local priorities;\n       (5) current funds authorized for the Farmland Protection \n     Program will be exhausted in the next six months;\n       (6) The United States is losing two acres of our best \n     farmland to development every minute of every day;\n       (7) These lands produce three quarters of the fruits and \n     vegetables and over one half of the dairy in the United \n     States;\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals contained in this resolution \n     assume that the 105th Congress, 2nd Session will reauthorize \n     funds for the Farmland Protection Program.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2264\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate concerning health care \n   quality for participants in the Federal Employees Health Benefits \n                                Program)\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING MARKET ACCESS PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The Market Access Program (MAP) continues to be a vital \n     and important part of U.S. trade policy aimed at maintaining \n     and expanding U.S. agricultural exports, countering \n     subsidized foreign competition, strengthening farm income and \n     protecting American jobs. Further, the Senate finds that:\n       (A) The Market Access Program is specifically targeted \n     towards small business, farmer cooperatives and trade \n     associations.\n       (B) The Market Access Program is administered on a cost-\n     share basis. Participants, including farmers and ranchers, \n     are required to contribute up to 50 percent or more toward \n     the cost of the program.\n       (2) The Market Access Program has been a tremendous success \n     by any measure. Since the program was established, U.S. \n     agricultural exports have doubled. In FY 1997, U.S. \n     agricultural exports amounted to $57.3 billion, resulting in \n     a positive agricultural trade surplus of approximately $22 \n     billion, and contributing billions of dollars more in \n     increased economic activity and additional tax revenues.\n       (3) The Market Access Program has also helped maintain and \n     create needed jobs throughout the nation's economy. More than \n     one million Americans now have jobs that depend on U.S. \n     agricultural exports. Further, every billion dollars in \n     additional U.S. agricultural exports helps create as many as \n     17,000 or more new jobs.\n       (4) U.S. agricultural, including farm income and related \n     jobs, is more dependent than ever on maintaining and \n     expanding U.S. agricultural exports as federal farm programs \n     are gradually reduced under the FAIR Act of 1996.\n       (5) In addition to the Asian economic situation and \n     exchange rate fluctuations, U.S. agricultural exports \n     continue to be adversely impacted by continued subsidized \n     foreign competition, artificial trade barriers and other \n     unfair foreign trade practices.\n       (6) The European Union (EU) and other foreign competitors \n     continue to heavily outspend the U.S. by more than 10 to 1 \n     with regard to export subsidies.\n       (A) In 1997, the EU budgeted $7.2 billion for export \n     subsidies aimed at capturing a larger\n\n[[Page S2938]]\n\n     share of the world market at the expense of U.S. agriculture.\n       (B) EU and other foreign competitors also spent nearly $500 \n     million on market promotion activities. The EU, spends more \n     on wine promotion than the U.S. currently spends on all \n     commodities and related agricultural products.\n       (C) The EU has announced a major new initiative aimed at \n     increasing their exports to Japan-historically, the largest \n     single market for U.S. agriculture exports.\n       (7) U.S. agriculture is the most competitive industry in \n     the world, but it can not and should not be expected to \n     compete alone against the treasuries of foreign governments.\n       (8) Reducing or eliminating funding for the Market Access \n     Program would adversely affect U.S. agriculture's ability to \n     remain competitive in today's global marketplace. A reduction \n     in U.S. agricultural exports would translate into lower farm \n     income, a worsening trade deficit, slower economic growth, \n     fewer export-related jobs, and a declining tax base.\n       (9) U.S. success in upcoming trade negotiations on \n     agriculture scheduled to begin in 1999 depends on maintaining \n     an aggressive trade strategy and related policies and \n     programs.

Mr. President, I would like to explore with the Senate \nhow we might proceed.\n  Mr. President, what I have discussed with the leader and with the \nranking member is that we try to have three amendments ready to vote \npursuant to the order at 7 o'clock. I think we can do that.\n  First, we will attempt to have the amendment of Senator Moseley-\nBraun. It would be on or in relation thereto. Then I understand Senator \nHollings has an amendment. Could he quickly tell us what it is?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Just requiring a 60-vote margin relating to the Social \nSecurity trust fund.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Then we have a sense of the Senate; Senator Faircloth, \nor I in behalf of, on the marital deduction disparity and efforts that \nwe want the Senate to make in terms of clearing that deficiency with \nreference to the marital deduction. The first vote will be 15 minutes, \nand 10 minutes thereafter, as we have already agreed to.\n  Would Senator Lautenberg like to let Senator Hollings proceed?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes. I ask unanimous consent that the next amendment \nthat is brought up be that offered by the Senator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask the Senator from New Mexico. As part of the \nstructure that we have arranged, which is a half hour for those \namendments that can be heard that are equally divided, and then there \nis a provision for 20 minutes for any second-degree amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2273\n\n(Purpose: To assure that use of the tobacco reserve fund is consistent \n     with comprehensive tobacco legislation approved by the Senate)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, before the clock strikes 6, I have one \nadditional amendment which would not be in order after that.\n  In behalf of Senator Hatch, I send this amendment to the desk. It is \nthe last one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Domenici), for Mr. Hatch, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2273.\n\n[[Page S2940]]\n\n       On page 28, strike lines 1 through 17, and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 202. TOBACCO RESERVE FUND.\n\n       (a) In General.--In the Senate, revenue and spending \n     aggregates may be increased and allocations may be increased \n     for legislation that reserves the Federal share of receipts \n     for tobacco-related programs and activities authorized by \n     Senate-passed comprehensive tobacco legislation.\n       (b) Revised Aggregates.--Upon the consideration of \n     legislation pursuant to subsection (a), the Chairman of the \n     Committee on the Budget of the Senate may file with the \n     Senate appropriately revised allocations under section 302(a) \n     of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and increased \n     aggregates to carry out this section. These aggregates shall \n     be considered for the purposes of the Congressional Budget \n     Act of 1974 as the allocations and aggregates contained in \n     this resolution.\n       (c) Application of Section 202 of H. Con. Res. 67.--For the \n     purposes of enforcement of section 202 of H. Con. Res. 67 \n     (104th Congress) with respect to this resolution, the \n     increase in receipts resulting from tobacco legislation used \n     to reimburse the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund shall \n     not be taken into account.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I wanted to just explore publicly a question that \narose, and that is we have not yet had an opportunity to examine these \namendments and there may be an interest on either side to have a second \ndegree. So we are not precluded, I assume, by that. I just wanted to \nconfirm that with the chairman of the Budget Committee as to the \nprocess, assuming that there is no obstruction to that, and I know of \nnone now, but I do have an inquiry that says what happens in a \nparticular case if we have a second degree? There is no prohibition to \nthat?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand when we entered into the unanimous consent \nrequest we very particularly and specifically did not mention the issue \nof second-degree amendments, other than the amount of time that would \nbe allotted to debate them. That means when an amendment comes up or as \nit is getting prepared, Senators who are interested in a second degree \nwould obviously have time before the amendment and have time during the \namendment, which is 30 minutes, to prepare and send to the desk the \nsecond-degree amendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the chairman of the Budget Committee. I ask \none more question, or at least seek to get a clarification among those \nwho hear us. That is, it is my understanding we are going to be very \nstrict.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator will suspend. The \nSenate will be in order.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I understand, with the approval of \nthe leadership, which I am asking indirectly, that we will be very \nstrict about the time on these amendments. The traditional 15- or 20-\nminutes will be as it is and thereafter 10 minutes. But I ask all of \nour colleagues--because as I did a mental count here, we probably have \n60 or 65 amendments sitting there--that we ought to not have anybody \nsaying just give me a minute more. We made those decisions as of this \nmoment and we are going to try to move the agenda along as \nexpeditiously as we can.\n  Last, everyone should understand that this is done at the request of \nSenators on both sides, lots of Senators who say let's get our business \ndone, let's complete our agenda and let's be prepared to conclude the \nweek, hopefully, by tomorrow evening. I do not mean to put words in the \nmouth of the Senator from New Mexico, but as I remember our discussion, \nthat's where we want to be.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask consent that it be in order to \nfile an amendment in behalf of Senator Sessions. It was not part of my \npackage. I ask it be in order nonetheless at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2274\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding limitations on \n          attorneys' fees under any global tobacco settlement)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mr. \n     Sessions, proposes an amendment numbered 2274.\n\n  The amendment follows:\n       At the end of title III add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING LIMITATIONS ON \n                   ATTORNEYS' FEES UNDER ANY NATIONAL TOBACCO \n                   SETTLEMENT.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying the functional totals in this resolution assume \n     that legislation providing for a national tobacco settlement \n     should provide the following:\n       (1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a State \n     that receives funds under such legislation may not utilize \n     more than $5,000,000 to pay attorneys' fees on behalf of \n     attorneys for the State in connection with an action \n     maintained by a State against one or more tobacco companies \n     to recover tobacco-related medicaid expenditures, or for \n     other causes of action.\n       (2) The limitation described in paragraph (1) shall apply \n     to attorneys' fees provided for or in connection with an \n     action of the type described in such paragraph under any--\n       (A) court order;\n       (B) settlement agreement;\n       (C) Contingency fee arrangement;\n       (D) arbitration procedure;\n       (E) alternative dispute resolution procedure (including \n     mediation); or\n       (F) other arrangement providing for the payment of \n     attorneys' fees.\n       (3) The limitation described in paragraph (1) shall not \n     apply to any amounts provided for the attorneys' reasonable \n     and customary expenses.\n       (4) No award of attorneys' fees shall be made under any \n     national tobacco settlement until the attorneys involved \n     have--\n       (A) provided to the Governor of the appropriate State, a \n     detailed time accounting with respect to the work performed \n     in relation to any legal action which is the subject of the \n     settlement or with regard to the settlement itself; and\n       (B) made public disclosure of the time accounting under \n     subparagraph (A) and any fee agreements entered into, or fee \n     arrangements made, with respect to any legal action that is \n     the subject of the settlement.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask that Senator Grassley be added \nas a cosponsor on amendment No. 2213 on behalf of Senator Bond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to follow up on the remarks of my distinguished \nranking member. The leader has indicated to me that we are supposed to \nproceed as the floor managers see best tonight. We are going to try to \nhave three votes at 7 p.m.. They will be expeditious in terms of time \nallotted to both, and then we intend to continue on for the evening, \nperhaps an hour, hour and a half. After that we will have another group \nof amendments, and we will do this until we see some daylight, in terms \nof the entire time running out on this bill.\n  With that I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2193\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I call up my amendment No. 2193 on \nbehalf of Senator Daschle, Senator Conrad, Senator Feingold, Senator \nDorgan and Senator Reid of Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, this goes right to the point of the \nrequirement of a 60-vote supermajority in order to spend the Social \nSecurity funds or report a budget with respect to Social Security \nfunds. It conforms to the sense of the Senate that the Members will \nfind on page 37 and 38 of the concurrent resolution itself. We passed \nin the Budget Committee the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \nunderlying the functional totals included in this resolution assume \nthat Congress and the President should continue to rid our country of \ndebt and work to balance the budget without counting Social Security \ntrust fund surpluses.\n  There was, of course, a unanimous vote in the Budget Committee. \nIncidentally, it was partly a response to the clarion call of the \nPresident of the United States, in his State of the Union address to \nthe joint session of Congress, that we ``save Social Security first.'' \nAnd, incidentally, some 8 years ago, 98 Senators voted for the very \nsame thing.\n  The reason for the 98-Senator vote back in 1990 was to comply with \nthe suggestions of the Greenspan Commission on Social Security. The \nGreenspan Commission in 1983 suggested a very high payroll tax, not \njust to balance Social Security's budget, but also to build up a \nsurplus for the baby boomers in the next generation. For example,\n\n[[Page S2941]]\n\nthe Commission's report included projections to the year 2056.\n  We have constantly heard on the floor of the Congress, in both \nHouses, ``Oh, the baby boomers are going to cause a problem, the baby \nboomers are going to cause a problem in the next generation.'' Not at \nall, not at all, Madam President. The fact is, if we quit looting the \nSocial Security trust fund, we could get along well with just minor \nadjustments to the Social Security program. The problem is being caused \nnot by the baby boomers, but by the adults on the floor of the Congress \nitself--in that we have this euphemism called the unified budget.\n  Let me tell you about that unified budget. The unified budget is a \ndevice of the financial community, of corporate America, of the Federal \nReserve Board, to keep interest rates low. They could care less about \nthe burden of having to pay the bill. They are not Congressmen. They \nare not Senators. They don't have to face up to the present deficit of \n$631 billion we owe Social Security now, or the $1.2 trillion this \ngovernment will owe Social Security by the end of the budget under \nconsideration.\n  We are going right up against the wall. We will owe this money and \nthen someone will say, ``Well, we can't raise taxes.'' Someone is going \nto say, ``Well, we have to raise the age.'' Then someone will say, ``We \nhave to limit the benefits.'' These are the remarks we can expect to \nhear in this Congress at the turn of the century.\n  The President, to his credit, grabbed ahold of this particular issue, \nwhich we have been working on for years. He said, ``Save Social \nSecurity first.'' We passed, already, one sense of the Senate by a vote \nof 100 to nothing. We passed the one I now propose by 20 to nothing in \nthe Budget Committee. I would like to remark on a comment made in the \nCommerce Committee's markup of the tobacco bill just a few moments ago, \nwhen the distinguished chairman turned to another Senator and said, \n``Now, wait a minute, is this a sense of the Senate?''\n\n  And the Senator responded, ``No, this is real. This counts.''\n  I want, and I am sure every Senator here wants, the desire to save \nSocial Security to count. One of the best ways to make sure it counts \nhere is to require--for the first time on the parliamentary treatment \nof issues here, in the reading of bills and concurrent resolutions--at \nleast a 60-vote supermajority margin in order to spend Social Security \nsurpluses, or list them, or waive the requirement they not be expended.\n  To return to the Greenspan Commission report for a moment, I believe \nthat report was very judicious in its vision with respect to the baby \nboomers. The report said we know we have this high tax and we are going \nto have surpluses. But we want to make sure these surpluses are not \nexpended by some tricky device called a unified budget, or a unified \ndeficit. Section 21 of the Greenspan Commission report required just \nthat, that Social Security be put off-budget. After the Commission made \nits report, we struggled within the Budget Committee for years to \nimplement its suggestions. It wasn't until 1990 that we finally were \nable to require, by a vote of 20 to 1, that trust funds be taken off-\nbudget. And then, on the floor of the Senate, by a vote of 98 to 2, we \npassed section 13301 of the statutory law of the Budget Act--which was \nthen passed by the House and signed into law by President Bush on \nNovember 5, 1990. Section 13301, which I have a copy of now, prohibited \nCongress from including Social Security trust funds in the budget.\n  I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record at this \nparticular point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Subtitle C Social Security\n\n     SEC. 13301. OFF-BUDGET STATUS OF OASDI TRUST FUNDS.\n\n       (a) Exclusion of Social Security From All Budgets.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts and \n     disbursements of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance \n     Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund \n     shall not be counted as new budget authority, outlays, \n     receipts, or deficit or surplus for purposes of--\n       (1) the budget of the United States Government as submitted \n     by the President,\n       (2) the congressional budget, or\n       (3) the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \n     of 1985.\n       (b) Exclusion of Social Security From Congressional \n     Budget.--Section 301(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n     1974 is amended by adding at the end the following: ``The \n     concurrent resolution shall not include the outlays and \n     revenue totals of the old age, survivors, and disability \n     insurance program established under title II of the Social \n     Security Act or the related provisions of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 in the surplus or deficit totals \n     required by this subsection or in . . .\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. As you can see, we passed the law. But it has been \nignored. And we are ignoring it again, Madam President, because if you \nlook on page 67 of the committee's report, you will find at the bottom \nline: ``on budget for 1998, minus $95.6 billion.'' Then: ``off budget, \n$103.4 billion.'' The report then states a total surplus of ``$7.8 \nbillion.''\n  That is not the actual deficit, Madam President--not at all. That is \nthe so-called unified deficit, which its adherents arrive at by looting \ntrust funds. But if you look on page 5 of the resolution itself, you \nwill see the deficit is listed for fiscal year 1999 as $108.2 billion. \nThis is a far cry from a surplus. That is in response to section 13301. \nThat is the actual deficit. Just go down one step further to the \nsection, on that same page 5, labeled ``Public debt.'' You will find \nthat from 1998 to 1999, in the present budget under consideration, all \nyou need to do to compute the actual deficit is to subtract the \nincrease in the national debt. That is the actual spending that occurs \nthat we do not pay for. That is the actual outlay that is not taken \ncare of by revenues themselves. You only have to do simple arithmetic \nto find that for the year 1999, according to this present budget under \nconsideration, the deficit will be $186.3 billion.\n  Madam President, it is interesting, in this time of headlines that \ntout surpluses as far as the eye can see, to just look at the deficits \nfor the next 5 years--the additions to the national debt. You will see \nthat they add up each year to a total of $905 billion. In other words, \nunder the budget currently being considered, the government will spend \nalmost $1 trillion more than it receives in revenue. Yet, we have \npeople claiming on the floor of the Congress, and in newspapers and \neditorials, ``Look at what a wonderful job we have done.''\n  The fact is, instead of balancing the budget, instead of continuing \nto lower deficits as we have done 6 years in a row--and I give the \ncurrent administration credit for having done so --we are going to turn \nand change course and, for the first time now with this 1999 concurrent \nresolution for this particular budget for 1999, we will increase rather \nthan lower the deficit. We will increase the deficit some $32 billion. \nWe will go from $153 to $186 billion--$31 billion, not counting \ndecimals here. That is $31 billion that we are increasing the deficit.\n  Madam Chairman, I would like to return to the original point: some \nkind of parliamentary restriction to bring sobriety to this body, to \nprevent politicians from claiming, ``I voted for a sense of the Senate; \nI voted not to spend Social Security.'' That was just not real. That \nwas just a sense of the Senate. This resolution would be binding at \nleast for a 60-vote majority. It ought to really have 100 votes, \nbecause that is what we voted time and time again when actually voted \non.\n  I yield the floor to my distinguished colleague from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. How much time is remaining on the time of the Senator \nfrom South Carolina?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from South \nCarolina for yielding and, more importantly, for taking the lead on \nthis amendment. There is no more important amendment in this whole \nbudget resolution than the Hollings amendment. This goes to the heart \nof the matter.\n  Madam President, I am pleased to join my good friend, the Senator \nfrom South Carolina (Mr. Hollings), in offering this amendment to close \na loophole in the rules protecting the Social Security Trust Fund \nbalances.\n  Let me note it gives me particular pleasure in cosponsoring this \namendment with Senator Hollings; both in this body and in the Budget \nCommittee, he has been a consistent voice for fiscal prudence.\n\n[[Page S2942]]\n\n  There is a fundamental difference between the way many in Congress \napproach the budget, and the way I approach it.\n  That difference is Social Security.\n  Since the time Lyndon Johnson lived in the White House, Presidents of \nboth parties and Congresses controlled by both parties have included \nthe Social Security Trust Fund balances in their budget calculations.\n  The result is a false picture of our country's fiscal health, and, \njust like a false medical report that covers up a serious illness, it \ncan lead to major problems in the future.\n  This false budget picture has been used so often it has become almost \na matter of ``budget convention,'' and it has so impressed itself into \nthe vocabulary of the budget that we now hear the word ``surplus'' when \nthere is no surplus.\n  We hear people talking about a budget ``surplus'' in Congress, in \nnews stories, and in the letters we receive from constituents.\n  But there is no surplus; there is a deficit that is still being \nhidden, and Social Security is the curtain used to hide it.\n  We need look no further than the budget resolution itself.\n  On page 5 of S. Con. Res. 86, the deficit levels are listed for \nFiscal Years 1998 through 2003.\n  For Fiscal Year 1998, the deficit is $95 billion.\n  The deficit rises to over $120 billion in Fiscal Years 2000 and 2001 \nbefore returning to levels below $100 billion, reaching $92 billion in \nFiscal Year 2003.\n  With surpluses like these, who needs deficits?\n  Despite these continuing deficits, many in this body want to act as \nif we have a surplus--free money to hand out in the form of new \nspending or new tax cuts.\n  The notion of a so-called unified budget, which began as a political \nconvenience to mask the deficit almost 30 years ago, has now become the \nbudget reality for many.\n  This must stop.\n  ``Surplus'' is supposed to mean something extra, like a bonus.\n  It means, all the bills are paid and there is money left over.\n  One dictionary defines ``surplus'' as: ``something more than or in \nexcess of what is needed or required.''\n  The so-called unified budget surplus is not ``more than or in excess \nof what is needed or required.''\n  Those funds are needed; they are needed to pay future Social Security \nbenefits.\n  They were raised by the Social Security system, specifically in \nanticipation of commitments to future Social Security beneficiaries.\n  When Congress makes budget obligations today based on those Social \nSecurity funds--whether in the form of tax cuts or spending increases--\nwe are committing to a path of fiscal policy that jeopardizes future \nSocial Security benefits.\n  The amendment Senator Hollings and I are offering is designed to \nshore up protections surrounding Social Security, and end talk of \nbudget surpluses that are not really there.\n  Our amendment does so by closing a loophole in the supermajority \nprotections we give to Social Security.\n  It establishes a point of order against any measure that would allow \nCongress to change the off-budget status of Social Security, directly \nor indirectly, without a supermajority vote.\n  Under most circumstances, our rules require a supermajority vote to \nchange the budget treatment of Social Security.\n  But while supermajority points of order usually protect the Social \nSecurity Trust Fund balances, in certain circumstances those points of \norder are subject to amendment or repeal by only a simple majority \nvote.\n  While legislation to amend budget rules and laws generally is subject \nto a supermajority point of order, under Section 306 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, this point of order does not apply to \nlegislation or a budget resolution that has been reported or discharged \nfrom the Senate Budget Committee, or to any amendments to such \nlegislation.\n  Our amendment eliminates this loophole in the supermajority \nprotections we have established for Social Security.\n  We must play it straight with the American people, and we must give \nthem an honest balanced budget.\n  This means Congress must stop pretending there is a surplus, and \nstart acknowledging we still have a way to go before our budget is \ntruly in balance.\n  I very much hope our colleagues will support this sensible protection \nfor Social Security, and will join us in making it harder to change our \nbudget rules in a way which would allow Social Security Trust Fund \nbalances to be used to pay for spending increases or tax cuts.\n  Madam President, let me reiterate, the fact is, we do not have a \nsurplus. All this talk about a surplus is not accurate, and the \nAmerican people know it. We have made tremendous progress. I am glad \nthat much of it was done in 1993. Some of it was done last year. But \nthe fact is, we have a long way to go.\n  What the Senator from South Carolina is doing is just trying to make \nthis body face up to the reality by creating a little higher standard, \na 60-vote rule rather than a majority-vote rule to continue this \npractice. This practice should not be continued at all. There should \nnot be any 60 votes or 70 votes or 80 votes to use Social Security to \ntry to pretend there is a real balanced budget. At least under the \nHollings amendment, the standard would be tougher. It would require 60 \nvotes. You couldn't sanitize the process by running it through the \nBudget Committee.\n  This is to me the most fundamental issue here, because we are, in \neffect, telling the American people something that just is not true. We \nhave done well. The economy has stayed very solid throughout this, but \nto pretend that there is extra money, to pretend that we can do \nspending or big tax cuts at this time is not straightforward. This, of \ncourse, is not just with regard to our senior citizens.\n  The Social Security fund is in good shape for a number of years to \ncome but it has more to do with the baby boomers and the young people \nin their twenties and thirties and those in high school and even \nyounger.\n  I have had the experience of having high school kids ask me at high \nschool forums not just about the issues one expects high school \nstudents to ask about, but whether or not Social Security will be there \nwhen they get to that age. That is an unusual question for a high \nschool student, but they know they are potentially being taken for a \nride.\n  Many of them are working. They are getting a check from, let's say, \nMcDonald's, and they notice something is being taken out of their \nchecks. ``What is it being taken out for?''\n  ``Well, for Social Security.''\n  Then they find out it might not be there for them.\n  What the Senator from South Carolina is saying is the Congress should \nstop borrowing from Social Security to try to make this look better. \nThis is a very, very important amendment for truth in budgeting.\n  I thank the Senator from South Carolina and yield back any time.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I thank my distinguished colleague \nfrom Wisconsin. He has been a Trojan in the trenches working on the \nsame side.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Boxer, as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I rise in support of this amendment, \nwhich would establish a new point of order to protect the Social \nSecurity surplus. It's designed to enforce the principle that President \nClinton emphasized in his State of the Union address: ``save Social \nSecurity first.''\n  The Social Security program is the most important social insurance \nprogram in the United States. It's dramatically reduced poverty among \nolder Americans. And it provides a critical safety net for those who \nsuffer from disabilities, or the death of a family member.\n  Unfortunately, Social Security's long-term viability is now \nthreatened by the impending retirement of the baby boom generation, and \nthe significant new pressures that will place on the system. Congress \nneeds to act promptly to address this problem.\n  Congress already has made a clear commitment to Social Security, and \nwe've created various procedural protections to enforce that \ncommitment.\n\n[[Page S2943]]\n\nFor example, Section 301(i) of the Budget Act prohibits the Senate from \nconsidering a budget resolution that would reduce a Social Security \nsurplus. And Section 311(a)(3) prohibits us from considering any \nmeasure that would decrease a Social Security surplus below the level \nset in the budget resolution.\n  The point of order proposed today is consistent with these \nprecedents. But rather than directly protecting Social Security, this \npoint of order would protect the rules that protect Social Security.\n  These budget rules, in effect, require 60 votes to reduce a Social \nSecurity surplus. The problem, though, is that there's a loophole. And \nthe loophole is that these rules themselves can be amended under \ncertain circumstances with only 50 votes.\n  In general, legislation to amend budget laws is subject to a \nsupermajority point of order, under Section 306 of the Budget Act. But \nthis point of order doesn't apply to legislation that's been reported \nfrom the Budget Committee, or to any amendments to such legislation.\n  So, for example, if the Budget Committee reports a minor bill to make \ntechnical corrections to the Budget Act, an amendment to gut the Social \nSecurity rules could be adopted by a simple majority vote.\n  In my view, that's a loophole that we need to close.\n  Let's not just proclaim our commitment to saving Social Security \nfirst. Let's put it in writing. And let's make it enforceable.\n  I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support the \namendment.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time has Senator Hollings used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has used 13 \nminutes 44 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So he has 1 minute-plus left.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, unless my friend from New Jersey \ndesires to speak, I will not use my entire 15 minutes. I will make a \npoint of order that the Senator's amendment violates the Budget Act and \nrequires 60 votes.\n  Frankly, I do not understand what the distinguished Senator is \ntalking about. He has been a longtime friend, and he has been on the \nBudget Committee. He has served on it. Actually, the Budget Committee \nis the source of the firewall that protects Social Security now. This \namendment says he is taking away our jurisdiction, that we can't do \nanything with reference to Social Security, and we are the committee to \nmake the recommendations.\n  If, indeed, the recommendations in some other provision of law \nrequires 60 votes to pass, that is a different thing. To say to a \ncommittee of jurisdiction that you cannot pass on anything because \nthere is a supermajority requirement just seems to me that we could \ntake every committee of jurisdiction, we could take away their \njurisdiction all under the rubric that we are trying to keep them from \nspending money. Maybe we don't like Commerce. They have been putting \nout too many bills. So we adopt a process that says whatever your \njurisdiction is, you can't report out any bills without a supermajority \nin these different areas.\n  That is not right. The Senator apparently has some great goal in \nmind. I remind the U.S. Senate and my friend Senator Hollings, he does \nnot like us to use the word ``balance,'' that we are in balance. So \nevery time we use it, we better say the ``unified budget is in \nbalance.''\n  Let's acknowledge that only 6 years ago, 5 years ago, if he is \nworried about Social Security, the unified budget was $300 billion in \nthe red. Have we made any headway in keeping the Social Security trust \nfund from getting spent? Of course. For starters, we have made $300 \nbillion worth, and right now we have a $10 billion surplus. That does \nnot mean we have a surplus without the Social Security trust fund, but \nit means that we are borrowing $10 billion less from the Social \nSecurity fund because of the balance in the unified budget of the \nUnited States. Is that bad? That seems to me to be good.\n  If some think that they can wipe out the nonunified deficit quicker, \nthen there are only two ways to wipe it out quicker: One is to cut more \nexpenditures or to raise taxes.\n  That is what somebody has to be talking about if they want to make us \nstop the $90 billion worth of borrowing, which used to be more, and it \nis down from $100 billion to $90 billion this very year because of the \nsurplus. Instead of talking about the Budget Committee doesn't have any \njurisdiction without supermajorities to move anything with reference to \nSocial Security--all we are doing is making recommendations to the \nSenate.\n  To act as if this will in some way make the Social Security trust \nfund more solvent, frankly, in all honesty, I just don't understand how \nthis is going to do any good, and I have not heard anything from the \nSenator yet that indicates that it will do anything good.\n  In all respect, I just do not believe it is going to accomplish what \nthe Senator wants. Social Security is not going to be any more \nprotected, and we are just going to say that there is a 60-vote point \nof order against anything the Budget Committee would do with reference \nto recommending Social Security changes or reforms, which just seems to \nme doesn't have anything to do with the problems that he describes \nbecause we are still borrowing from the Social Security trust fund.\n  I repeat, we are doing a lot better than we were 5 years ago, 6 years \nago, and a lot better than we expected to do. That means Social \nSecurity is getting closer and closer to a stable state because the \nunified budget is getting more and more surplus, which the surplus is \nfor now being applied to that debt, and we are borrowing less, which is \nnow easy to understand. There is all kind of confusion. There are trust \nfunds, IOUs. But the truth is, on paper, we are borrowing $10 billion \nless when we have a surplus than otherwise. If it gets up to $100 \nbillion, we won't be borrowing anything. That is pretty good, and that \nis reality.\n\n  The Budget Committee had something to do with that. There is a \nfirewall that does not permit us to spend any Social Security money \nthat would, in any way, affect the actuarial soundness of the Social \nSecurity system. That is a firewall of 60 votes. That was recommended \nby the Budget Committee. If we put that in before and came to the \nfloor, it would require 60 votes to become law. It doesn't seem to me \nthat is right.\n  When the time has expired, I will make a point of order and then we \nwill have a vote and try to stack it as early as possible so we can \ndispose of the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico doesn't have to remind the Senator from South Carolina that we \nare doing better than we were 6 years ago, because this Senator voted \nfor that particular plan, which included spending cuts and which \nincluded tax increases to get this economy turned around. It included a \ntax increase on Social Security, as well. And we didn't get a single \nRepublican vote for that Budget Act--not one vote from that side of the \naisle.\n  Now the Senator from New Mexico says we are borrowing $10 billion. \nTurn, if you please, to the analysis of the President's budget proposal \nby the Congressional Budget Office put out the day before yesterday. On \npage 36, you will find the actual debt increases to $184 billion. So we \nare not borrowing $10 billion less. The actual facts, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, are that we are borrowing $31 billion \nmore.\n  Tell me about the budgets and requirements of the Budget Committee \nsupermajority. You have to get a supermajority to get the tobacco \nmoney. Why not a supermajority to protect Social Security? We have \nsection 13301 of the Budget Act itself that is a firewall anyone \ndisobeys when he spends that money.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. If I need more time, I can get some, I guess, off the \nresolution. But let me hear it. My time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n\n[[Page S2944]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 8 minutes 54 \nseconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I make the point of order that the \namendment of the distinguished Senator, Senator Hollings, is out of \norder under the Budget Act. It is not germane.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, pursuant to Section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, I move to waive the applicable \nsections of that act for the consideration of the pending amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will stack the vote as soon as we can for three \nvotes.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Can we get the yeas and nays?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Surely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I am going to call up the Faircloth \namendment with reference to the marriage penalty, and then we are going \nto stack four votes which will include two Democrat votes and two \nRepublican votes. In order to get the second Republican vote, I would \nhave to have Senator Craig offer a second one so we would have two. And \nthat would make the votes be on two Democrat and two Republican \namendments. Is that acceptable? All right.\n  If you have another one that is ready--Madam President, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2251\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I call up amendment No. 2251.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Amendment numbered 2251 previously proposed by the Senator \n     from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] for Mr. Faircloth.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 5 minutes of the opening remarks to Senator \nSessions with reference to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I would like to offer some comments in \nsupport of this sense-of-the-Senate resolution regarding the \nelimination of the marriage penalty. Marriage is an institution to be \nvenerated, and our public policy should affirm marriage and we should \nhave laws that treat married couples on an equal basis with those that \nare not married. That is the fundamental principle of fairness.\n  The fact is that under our current laws, married couples suffer a \nfinancial penalty when it comes to taxation. In fact, married couples \npay often substantially more tax than they would pay if they were not \nmarried.\n  For example, the U.S. Congressional Budget Office found that 42 \npercent of married couples face a marriage penalty under the current \ntax system. The Congressional Budget Office also found that the average \ntax penalty amounts to $1,380 per year. That is a $100-a-month tax \npenalty on people who choose to be married rather than those who choose \nnot to marry. As a result of that, we are taking more of their money to \nin fact subsidize people who are not married who receive those \nbenefits.\n  I think some people have suggested this is in fact a realistic cause \nof people not to marry. For example, in 1970, just .5 percent of the \ncouples in the United States were not married. By 1996, that number had \nrisen to 7.2 percent.\n  So, Madam President, I would say that this is a very important \ndebate. And I will not belabor the subject. This is a matter that has \nbeen the subject of much debate, with much intellectual and financial \nstudy, and the conclusion of these numbers is plain and obvious. Under \nour current tax system, married couples are being subjected to an \nunfair financial penalty. This is a matter that this Senate must \naddress.\n  It may be a bit late this year to make those changes. I wish it could \nhave been done this year, but it is a change we are going to have to \nmake. We are going to have to eliminate the circumstance in which a \nmarried couple is penalized for being married. It is not just, it is \nnot fair, not appropriate, and it is unbecoming of the laws of the \nUnited States.\n  So, Madam President, I support this resolution and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I compliment the Senator on his remarks. They are right \non point. As a matter of fact, the resolution as drafted says to the \nU.S. Congress to begin to cure this marital tax inequity this year. In \nessence what we are saying is, if we are going to have a tax bill, we \nhave no authority to dictate its content, but we are saying it is the \nsense of the Senate that we shall start down the road of eliminating \nthat this year.\n  Now, I might add----\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If the Senator will yield, I would like to say how much \nI appreciate the Chairman's support for this concept, and for this \nresolution. I think we can begin now to take the kind of steps \nnecessary to improve the tax laws in this regard.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the Senator, I just want to ask a question. \nYou used the figure of $1,380 a year or $1,340?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The number I have is $1,380.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is this what you mean? If you have two single people \nearning a combined income, that are single and filing separate returns, \nand you have a married couple with exactly the same amount of income, \nthe married couple, everything else being equal, will pay $1,380 more \nin taxes per year?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator is exactly correct. That is the average for \nthose who suffer a penalty. That is the average amount of penalty that \nis suffered, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So it could be a very large amount of money for people \nabove the average?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I assume it could be $2,000, $3,000, $5,000, $10,000?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Of course, for those under the average it would be \nless. But is it not true that you have heard, as I have, that some \npeople do not get married who are living together saying they are doing \nbetter on taxes without being married, and that this is frequently used \nin conversation if not in reality?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator from New Mexico is exactly correct. \nCertainly we have more people, more men and women living together \nwithout being married today than ever before.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I tell you what, I am going to \nsupport this amendment. So I ask if I can talk as one of the proponents \nfor a minute to raise a question.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure. How much time do I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes 16 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much of that would you like?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. No. I would like a short period of time. I think if \nwe can agree--and I do not see anybody here that wants to talk in \nopposition--we ought to yield back the time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We do have Senator Faircloth en route. If he is not \nhere shortly, then we will be able to do what you suggest. But I am \ntrying to hold a little bit of time for him.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I see. My only question relates, frankly, to the \nschedule that is proposed here. The one thing I have to remind my \nfriend and colleague, the Senator from New Mexico, about is the volume \nof the sense-\n\n[[Page S2945]]\n\nof-the-Senate resolutions. We are building--we may have a record year \nthis year, I say to the chairman.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We might.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. So we just let it flow, go with the flow, as they \nsay. None of us want to do anything to impose a penalty on marriage. \nThe statistics are not as good as we would like to see in the first \nplace, so we do not want to make it any more difficult. But when the \nschedule says ``shall begin to phase out the marriage penalty this \nyear,'' I think that is somewhat precipitous. But hearing the Senator \nfrom Alabama confirm I think what we all know, all we can do is kind of \nmake this abstract recommendation and hope that it gets picked up along \nthe way. So with that, with that caution, I am ready to go to a vote. I \nhope, I say to the chairman, in the interest of time, that we might be \nable to move it along.\n  Is Senator Faircloth still on his way?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, he is. And Senator Hutchison is one of the \noriginal cosponsors. She would like some of the time. I yield the \nSenator 4 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Four minutes. I thank the Senator. I appreciate that.\n  This is the Faircloth-Hutchison amendment and it is also the \nFaircloth-Hutchison bill that would eliminate the marriage penalty tax.\n\n  All this amendment says is, it is a priority of Congress to eliminate \nthe marriage penalty tax. We don't think Americans should have to \nchoose between love and money. Yet 21 million American couples today \nhave to make that exact choice, because they go into a higher tax \nbracket when they get married.\n  Let me give an example. A rookie policemen in Houston, TX, makes \n$33,500. His wife is a schoolteacher in the Pasadena independent school \ndistrict making $28,200 a year. When this young couple got married, \nthey owed Uncle Sam $1,000 more a year. This is at a time when they \nwould like to buy their first home, when they have to buy a second car. \nThey are having to pay Uncle Sam $1,000 because they got married. That \ncould be two house payments, three or four car payments, and we are \ntaking it away from them by an unfair Tax Code.\n  Our Tax Code does not meet the fairness test. I think this sense of \nthe Senate says it best--that it will be the highest priority of \nCongress to correct this inequity in the law. I don't think Congress \nintended it, but that is the way it happened, and Congress does have \nthe power to correct it.\n  I hope we will take this opportunity to speak with a loud, firm, \nclear voice, that Americans should not have to pay more money because \nthey get married than they would have to pay if they stay single. That \nis the issue, a very simple amendment. I hope we will have a unanimous \nvote when this amendment comes forward to show that we intend to do \nsomething about this if we possibly can within the constraints of the \nsurplus, and that if we are not able to do something, it will be the \nhighest priority when we do have that budget surplus that I have seen \nspent in so many ways already in the last year. We haven't seen that \nbudget surplus, so I think spending it is a little premature.\n  I do appreciate the fact that this committee set aside $10 billion \nfor the first year for tax cuts, and I think if we can build on that, \nwe can do some good for the hard-working American. We should continue \nto give money back to the people who earned it. You can always tell who \ncares about the people who earn the money, and that is by how they \nrefer to tax dollars. We refer to tax dollars as belonging to the \npeople who worked for them, and we are going to try to let people keep \nmore of the money they earned. They deserve it. That is what setting \nthis priority will do for 21 million American couples.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I concur with most of what has been said here. I read \nthis resolution, and it is hard to argue with a resolution that is \npraising marriage and the married. I think we are all for that. \nAnything in the law of this land, whether tax law or otherwise, which \ndetracts from that institution, should be examined and seriously \nconsidered.\n  But I keep wondering--I am not an expert on tax law, but there are \nsome situations where marriage actually reduces the tax burden; where, \nin fact, if you have one of the spouses who has a high income and \nmarries someone with a much lower income, it could reduce the tax rate. \nI certainly hope there is nothing in this sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution which suggests we should change that. I think we want to try \nto encourage people, and when the Tax Code rewards those who are \nmarried, we should continue doing that.\n  What I am told is there are two sides to the story. As there are \nthose who are losers and are penalized by the Tax Code by marriage, \nthere are those who are benefited by the Tax Code.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would love to address that issue. It is a valid \npoint.\n  We will not take away the break that a couple has in the one-income-\nearner family; that is, where people are ahead if they have one income \nin the family, they get a break on taxes. The people who get hit are \nthe low-income people with two wage-earners in the family. They are the \nones that often have to work to make ends meet, and yet they are \npenalized because they get married. It is a couple that makes $28,000 a \nyear and $33,000 a year, and together they move into the higher \nbracket, but separately they would not be in the higher bracket, they \nwould stay at the 15 percent bracket.\n  What we are trying to do is create an equity for those lower- and \nmiddle-income two-earner couples that right now are paying a hefty \npenalty.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Texas for that clarification. I \nhope we can do everything in our power to make the Tax Code not only \nfriendly to those who are married but more progressive so that those in \nthe lower- and middle-income categories get a helping hand from the \nFederal Government instead of the backhand.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Illinois for allowing me to \nclarify that. It is certainly important for us to keep the advantage \nfor the one-income-earner couple, but that we give that added advantage \nto that two-income-earner couple that really does need it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I am prepared to yield back the time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am prepared to yield back.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator yield?\n  If Senator Faircloth is not going to be able to give remarks, I would \nlike to be able to say on his behalf what a leader he has been.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will try to arrange this right now, if you listen to \nmy consent. If it doesn't work, we will use some time here.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that after the time is yielded \nback and we proceed to the next amendment, that nonetheless, prior to \nthe vote at 9 o'clock or thereafter on the Faircloth amendment, that he \nbe permitted to speak for 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. May I reserve the right to ask a question? That is, \nthis depends on the time, because we agreed we were going to control \nthe time carefully. I ask how much time is left for the proponents of \nthe amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 6 minutes 36 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What I was trying to do is give back the 6 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. And trade for 3.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And trade for 3.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I consent to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Would this be included in this batch of votes?\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. When we take up Senator Moseley-Braun, Senator \nHollings, this would be the third one in that sequence.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That would be at 7 o'clock--you said 9 o'clock.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Nine o'clock.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thought we talked about a series of votes at 7 \no'clock.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think people heard 9 o'clock or 9ish, so we ought to \nget on with more amendments.\n  I thought the 7 o'clock was precluded when the Chair went right ahead \nand made us vote on previous amendments.\n\n[[Page S2946]]\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Is there a unanimous consent request at the desk \ncalling for a specific time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me correct that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me correct that. I believe that only I was thinking \nthat that previous vote did that and nobody else was, so I must not \nhave told anybody. Everybody on the staff agrees. They must be right. \nWe can't do anything without them.\n  Perhaps what we can do--Senator Craig, would you be willing to spend \n15 minutes on your amendment?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I can.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to get one more stacked.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Just to clear the air and be sure we are both hearing \nwhat each other is saying, that is that if that is the case, then we \nare going to ask for another unanimous consent that would enable \nSenator Craig to offer his amendment, give us a chance to take a look \nat it, but Senator Craig, I thought, debated his amendment last night.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I did.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, he did.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. So what time would be available for Senator Craig now \nif the debate was conducted last night? What system are we operating \nunder?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I assume we are operating on the half hour.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. But how much time did Senator Craig use last night to \ndebate his amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That was before we had an agreement. I don't want to \nargue over it. That is what we did with anybody who argued an amendment \ntwo nights ago. If he could have 15 minutes, you 15 minutes, we will \nget 4 votes in here in 15 or 20 or 30 minutes--assuming you won't use \nall the time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That is all right with us. I agree, certainly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. All time is yielded back then on the Faircloth \namendment, and we will proceed to Senator Craig at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2211\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, last night I offered an amendment called \nthe Surplus Protection Amendment for myself and several other \ncolleagues here in the Senate: Senator Allard, Senator Coverdell, \nSenator Grams, Senator Helms, Senator Hutchinson, Senator Inhofe, \nSenator Sessions, and Senator Thomas. My amendment is a fundamentally \nsimple amendment which sets forth very clearly a new approach toward \nhow we handle mandatory spending. Pay-as-you-go budget enforcement \nrules were established to help put Washington's fiscal house in order.\n  Since fiscal year 1994, the Senate has had a point of order requiring \n60 votes to waive against any legislation that would increase the \ndeficit. However, mandatory spending in Washington is Washington's \nversion of a fiscal autopilot. Once enacted, it requires no further \ncongressional action to operate. Rather than a perpetual motion \nmachine, what we have found out with mandatory spending, of course, is \nthat it is a perpetual spending machine. It is, if you will, the \nEnergizer Bunny of budgeting and has kept growing and growing and \ngrowing.\n  What all this means--and I think it concerns us all greatly--is an \nincrease in mandatory spending must be paid for with a tax increase. \nAny tax cut must be paid for by a mandatory spending cut. As anyone can \ntell, pay-go, in its present form, is very insufficient to control \nmandatory spending.\n  Mandatory spending has increased dramatically and will continue to \nincrease dramatically over the next few years. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, in 1987 mandatory spending accounted for \n47 percent of the Federal budget; in 1997, it accounted for \napproximately 56 percent; in the year 2008, it will account for 70 \npercent. Many of us have struggled mightily, as has the chairman of the \nfull committee, to control this.\n  What is happening is that mandatory spending is crowding out, rapidly \ncrowding out, Federal Government spending for schools, for roads, for \nlaw enforcement, and for those infrastructure maintenance kinds of \nprograms that most citizens in our country feel are legitimate spending \nareas for our Government.\n  I have sensed, as many of my colleagues have, that it is time to make \na modest adjustment to try to change the process by which we deal with \nthis issue. Current estimates are that the budget will be balanced this \nyear, and the chairman of the full committee and many colleagues on \nthis floor deserve credit for that because it will be, and we are \npleased about it, excited about it, and I think the country is also. It \nis true that we are nearly 4 years ahead of schedule in balancing the \nbudget, and there is a lot to be credited for that--certainly our \nability to begin to control spending here, but also our ability to help \nfree this economy and to see it move as successfully as it has, has \nbeen another major contributing factor.\n  However, we must look not just to the horizon of spending, as this \nbudget resolution does, but look well beyond it. If we fail to look \nbeyond it, we fail to recognize what is out there in the very, very \nnear future of additional spending as a result of the drive of \nmandatory entitlement-style spending. To avoid what will happen in the \nfuture, I think we have to change the way we work now, because if we \ndon't gradually move into controlling these kinds of spending areas, \nthe step that we would want to take or have to take out there or be \nforced to take would be uncontrollable-- tax increases, major budget \ncuts of the kind many might find intolerable. What I am proposing is a \nmodest step. I guess I am a bit like a doctor tonight. I am going to \nsuggest that we first pledge to do no harm. What I am offering tonight \ndoes no harm to this budget.\n\n  My amendment establishes a point of order that requires new mandatory \nspending programs to be paid for by mandatory spending savings. In \nother words, it would require 60 votes in the Senate to create a new \nmandatory spending program that was not funded by an equivalent \nmandatory spending savings. Tough choices? Not necessarily. But it \nforces the Congress to do the work that it probably hasn't liked to do \nover the years, and that is to do oversight to see whether these \nprograms are working or they ought to be adjusted or changed, and if \nthey are changed, is there something better that we might adjust to? If \nall of the new mandatory spending programs had been paid for, as we had \nclaimed, we would not be facing a fiscal future of exploding spending \nand exploding deficits.\n  I think anybody who might be listening to what I am saying tonight \nwould be scratching their heads and saying: But, Senator, the budget \nyou are proposing this night is balanced. The budget that the senior \nSenator from New Mexico, chairman of the Budget Committee, is offering \nis at balance, and we are talking about the potential of surplus \nrevenues.\n  My point is--and it is a point that nobody disputes--that the current \nbudget path that we are on, which is the right path, is unsustainable. \nAs good as a balanced budget is today, it will not remain a balanced \nbudget for long. The path that we are traveling is no secret that it is \nunsustainable. It is not. We all know because so many have told us so, \nincluding some of our own colleagues here on the floor. Senator Kerrey \nof Nebraska, who chaired the bipartisan commission on entitlement and \ntax reforms, has said so. The General Accounting Office has said so. \nInterestingly enough, the President's budget has said so. And in the \nmost recent report, the Congressional Budget Office said:\n\n       Currently, more than half of the nearly $1.7 trillion in \n     Federal spending goes for entitlements and other mandatory \n     spending programs. As a share of the total outlay, mandatory \n     spending has jumped from 32 percent in 1962 to 56 percent in \n     1997. If current policies remain unchanged, such spending \n     will continue to grow faster than other spending, reaching 63 \n     percent of total outlays by the year 2002, or twice the size \n     of discretionary outlays.\n\n  Under baseline assumptions, continued growth in mandatory outlays \nwould raise their share of the budget to 70 percent by the year 2008. \nLast year, the Congressional Budget Office wrote that this year's \nbudgetary news should not lull people into complacency and, most \nassuredly, this budget, the budget resolution we have before us, should \nnot. It is an excellent work and it controls spending. It gets us to a \nbalanced budget.\n\n[[Page S2947]]\n\n  But let me suggest that the retirement of a large baby boomer \ngeneration is just over the horizon. If the budgetary pressure from \nboth demographic and health care spending is not relieved by reducing \nthe growth of expenditures or increasing taxes, deficits will mount and \nseriously erode future economic growth. That report concluded:\n\n       Current budget policy is unsustainable and attempting to \n     preserve it would severely damage the economy.\n\n  How serious are the future projections? The Congressional Budget \nOffice concluded that even if the budget were balanced in the year \n2002--and that is our goal and we are going to get there--we would have \na deficit equal to 34 percent of the gross domestic product by the year \n2050 and the public debt would be 283 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct. Those are the outward projections of the current path of \nexpenditure.\n  There will be a demographic shift to older populations. This Senator \nstanding before you tonight is part of that group. I am part of that \nbaby boomer crowd. I am going to be one who will be collecting my \nSocial Security and my Medicare. And there is no question that, in \n1995, there were 34 million 65-year-old and older citizens. But by the \nyear 2030, there will be twice that number, or 68 million. There will \nbe more elderly. They will live longer and they will be using Federal \nservices more intensively. There will be relatively fewer workers \naround to put foot all of these bills. If we don't sense that now--and \nseveral sense-of-the-Senate resolutions have talked about it today, but \nmy amendment changes the process, forces the issue, causes us to work \nour way through these kinds of tough decisions.\n\n  In 1950, there were 7.3 workers for every senior. In 1990, there were \n4.8 workers for every one senior. In 2030, there will be 2.8. We all \nknow the reality of that. What I am talking about are the taxpayers \npaying into the programs that will fund that one individual. It will \ntake all 2.8 of those workers working together at a very large chunk--a \n60-plus percent tax rate on their income to fund that one individual, \nalong with all the other Government services and necessary programs \nthat we think are appropriate.\n  So what the demographic shift means is that spending rises very \nrapidly relative to revenue. Quoting the Congressional Budget Office:\n\n       Revenues will be squeezed as the number of people working \n     and the economy grows slower. At the same time, outlays for \n     Government programs that aid the elderly will burgeon as the \n     number of people eligible to receive benefits from these \n     programs will shoot up.\n\n  What the fiscal squeeze means is major new revenues in the form of \ntaxes or enormous deficits. The deficit, last year, was less than 1 \npercent of GDP. It would be 29.8 percent by the year 2030. The Federal \ndebt was 50 percent of GDP last year; it would be 250 percent by the \nyear 2035. Those are not my numbers; that is the Congressional Budget \nOffice speaking. Those are valid numbers, and anybody who studies the \nbudget curves understands that. This is unprecedented. We have never \nhad a period of time in our country's history where these numbers \nbecame reality, because we never have spent that much of the gross \ndomestic product of our country. The deficit has been higher than 10 \npercent of GDP only briefly, during major wars. And we understand those \nreasons--when our Nation is at risk and our freedoms are to be secured. \nThe debt exceeded 100 percent only once and that was during World War \nII. The result would be based on the figures by the year 2035 of \neconomic catastrophes. I don't know of any other way to explain it, any \nother way to compare it. Those would be the realities. Even to make the \nburden sustainable, the Congressional Budget Office terminology \nallowing debt to rise, but keeping constant in relation to the gross \ndomestic product, would have dire consequences. The tax burden would \nhave to increase 20 percent just to continue running deficits and \nadding debt.\n  Of course, someone will say that the budget agreement solves the \nproblem. No, the budget agreement doesn't solve the problem. It \naddresses the immediate, it addresses the desire to maintain current \nspending while mandatory spending within this continues to grow at the \nrates offered in these projections that brings us to the year 2035. It \nis certainly an improvement, and I am very laudatory of the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee, and others. It delays the scenario I have just \noutlined. But according to the CBO, if the budget is balanced through \nthe year 2010--and that is what I believe this Congress strives to do--\nit will take less than 15 years to reach the same scenario that I have \njust described--a huge deficit and a debt of 230 percent of gross \ndomestic product by that time. Quoting the Congressional Budget Office:\n\n       Regardless of how the budget is balanced in the near term, \n     congressional budget action would still be needed to put the \n     budget on a sustainable path.\n\n  So what I am proposing is a modest first step. The years 2030 to the \nyear 2050 are not real to us on this floor. We cannot even begin to \nappreciate the kinds of budget numbers those years will produce. But \nthey are very real to our children or any child that might be in the \ngalleries tonight, because they are the ones who will be paying that \nhuge tax rate out there to fund these kinds of programs that we have \nalready put in progress today. So those are the realities of what we \nare dealing with. My amendment is a first step in that direction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey has 14 minutes 43 \nseconds.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair. Has the proponent side used all of \nits time at this juncture?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Senator \nCraig's amendment. This amendment would prohibit using revenues to \noffset new mandatory spending and, instead, require all new mandatory \nspending to be offset with other mandatory cuts. The amendment would \nprohibit using revenues to offset new mandatory spending. \nAlternatively, instead, it would require all new mandatory spending to \nbe offset with mandatory cuts.\n  The amendment would represent a significant departure from current \npay-as-you-go rules. It would give special protection to special \ninterest tax loopholes at the expense of programs like Social Security \nand Medicare. It would further undermine the prospects for \ncomprehensive tobacco legislation.\n  There is nothing new about using revenues to offset mandatory \nspending. The pay-as-you-go rule has been in place for many years and \nit has worked well. That rule says that new mandatory spending must be \nfully offset either by revenue increases or mandatory savings. In other \nwords, new mandatory spending must be deficit neutral.\n  Under Senator Craig's proposal, however, deficit neutrality is not \nenough. Under this amendment, legislation to provide a new mandatory \nbenefit, like Medicare coverage for a new medical procedure, would have \nto be offset with other mandatory spending cuts. No new revenue could \nbe used.\n  If you think about that for a minute, it really doesn't make sense. \nIf we are looking to pay for a new benefit, why would we say that \ncutting Social Security is fine, but closing a wasteful tax loophole is \nnot? Why would we say that cutting Medicare is OK, but eliminating a \ncorporate tax subsidy is not? Well, Mr. President, maybe some people \nthink that the Tax Code is just fine the way it is and that it doesn't \ncontain any loopholes or special breaks for the special interests. I \nhappen not to be one of them. I don't think many Senators on either \nside of the aisle would make that claim. After all, we are now hearing \ncalls to scrap the entire Tax Code even without a replacement. Can \nthese same Senators now also be claiming that there is not one special \ntax break or loophole that deserves closing, even if the savings could \nbe used to provide for new health benefits for people stricken with \nnewly discovered deadly diseases? I hope that not many of my colleagues \nreally believe that. In my view, we ought to be intensifying our \nefforts to eliminate wasteful tax loopholes. The last thing we should \ndo is give any special protections to them\n\n[[Page S2948]]\n\nat the expense of Social Security or Medicare. So it is a little out of \nbalance.\n\n  This amendment would compound the obstacles already created in this \nbudget resolution for comprehensive tobacco legislation. Under this \namendment, tobacco legislation could not use tobacco revenues to pay to \nfinance antitobacco activities. It doesn't make sense, and it would \nundercut what could be the most important piece of legislation in this \nsession of the 105th Congress.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. It would change a \nfundamental rule that has worked well for many years. It would give \nspecial protection to wasteful tax loopholes at the expense of programs \nlike Social Security and Medicare and could seriously impair the \nability to get us to a comprehensive tobacco program.\n  The pending amendment is not germane. I, therefore, raise a point of \norder that the amendment violates section 305(b)(2) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  I don't see anyone else in opposition. I yield the time.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I move to waive the Congressional Budget \nAct.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: Are we \nscheduled to start voting now?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That is the condition, as I understand it. I ask the \nmanager of the bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are going to vote on four amendments very shortly. \nSenator Moseley-Braun is going to be first with her amendment, then we \nare going to follow that with Senator Hollings' amendment, which is \nsubject to a point of order, and then we are going to follow that and \nSenator Faircloth's marriage penalty, to be followed in fourth place by \nSenator Craig.\n  I have a parliamentary inquiry with reference to Senator Moseley-\nBraun's amendment. What is the unanimous consent? Does the Senator have \nsome time, and do we have some time at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has used all of her \ntime. The Senator from New Mexico rises in opposition.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, it was my understanding that the \nunanimous consent agreement had 1 minute before for each side in \naddition to the time budgeted for the amendment. There was supposed to \nbe 1 minute for each side before the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That unanimous consent has not been entered \ninto relative to this amendment. But that is the standard agreement. \nThat is the usual practice.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We would like to make sure that occurs. So I ask \nunanimous consent that be the case with reference to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It will be the case with the subsequent ones, will it \nnot?\n  You said it is not a part of the unanimous consent already. I thought \nit was.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator making that request?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I make that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I had my entire time left on Senator Moseley-Braun's. I \nyield that back and will use 1 minute before I move to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 1 minute.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask the manager whether this now \nprecludes second degrees. Are we going to go ahead? Are we just going \nto vote?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. My understanding is there will be no second degrees. I \nask unanimous consent that no second-degree amendments be in order to \nthe four amendments that are pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2175\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, our amendment is a sense of the Senate that the fiscal \nyear 1999 budget resolution assumes that we will enact legislation \ncreating a partnership between the State, local, and national \ngovernments to rebuild and modernize our schools and the classrooms for \nthe 21st century.\n  Winston Churchill once said, ``We shape our buildings, thereafter \nthey shape us.'' Nowhere is that more true than with schools.\n  The poor condition of America's schools has a direct effect on the \nability of our students to learn the kinds of skills they will need to \ncompete in the 21st century global economy. America cannot compete if \nour students cannot learn, and our students cannot learn if their \nschools are crumbling down around them.\n  Our amendment would ensure that school districts around the Nation \nhave the resources they need to address school improvement priorities \nso we can give our children an environment suitable for learning.\n  I encourage support for this amendment. It is, after all, a sense-of-\nthe-Senate amendment. It will give everyone an opportunity to express \nwithout the particularity of the actual legislation. I express the \nsupport of doing the right thing by our kids.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I have a question I would like to \nresolve that I think is agreed upon. The first vote would be the \ntraditional 15, plus 5, and thereafter 10-minute votes. All of them are \nstrictly controlled so we can move the program along.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a unanimous consent?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. That will be the order.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to ask. I thought when we entered into the \nunanimous consent agreement earlier in the day about stacking votes \nthat we said we were going to have them 15, 10 and 10.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  I have 1 minute on this amendment. Let me just say there is a \nstatement behind me that was made in the budget by the President of the \nUnited States. It is very simple. It says:\n\n       The construction and renovation of school facilities has \n     traditionally been the responsibility of State and local \n     government, financed primarily by local taxpayers; we are \n     opposed to the creation of a new Federal grant program for \n     school construction.\n\n  I acknowledge that is a grant program. But I believe that we should \nchange that word and say, ``We are opposed to tax credits for school \nconstruction,'' because I don't believe the U.S. Government ought to \nchange its tax laws to allow a total tax deduction, which is what a \ncredit is for the interest that a bond will yield if it is for \nconstruction of schools in the United States.\n  There is no formula. We don't know how we will do this. We don't know \nwhether poor districts will get it. I think we ought not start down \nthis path. I know for some any education program is difficult. I \nunderstand this may be one of those. But I truly don't believe we ought \nto do this.\n  I remind everyone, in any event, this is a sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution. It is not binding. That will give you latitude to vote \ndifferently than I recommend, since it is not binding. But I don't \nbelieve we ought to tell the Finance Committee we want them to start \ndown this path in a big way with reference to school construction.\n  Having said that, I move to table, and I ask for the yeas and nays on \nmy motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered. The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question \nis on agreeing to the motion of the Senator from New Mexico to lay on \nthe table the amendment of the Senator from Illinois. On this question, \nthe yeas and nays are ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \nwho desire to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 54, nays 46, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 57 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--54\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n\n[[Page S2949]]\n\n\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Cleland\n     Conrad\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Specter\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 2175) was agreed \nto.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have three votes to go. We can move them \nalong promptly if we can have order in the Chamber.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I announce that when we finish this \nseries of votes tonight, there will be no more votes tonight, but we \nwill stay and debate five additional amendments --three from the \nDemocratic side, two from the Republican side. Those will be stacked in \nthe morning under the previous order, a 15-minute vote followed by 10-\nminute votes.\n  I will tell everyone, we now have in excess of 75 first-degree \namendments filed. We will take care of five of them tonight, and that \nwill probably leave us with about 70. Obviously, we could not dispose \nof 70 amendments at 10 or 15 minutes each in a very short period of \ntime. So tomorrow morning, we will have, and my friend Senator \nLautenberg says his staff will have some charts to show you your \namendments while we are voting in the morning.\n  We would like you to be honest; we don't ask you tonight in the full \nlight of everybody which ones you really want to vote on and which ones \nyou would like for us to consider and which ones you might withdraw. We \nare going to work on accepting as many as we can, with the idea that \nthere is still a conference to go to, during which time those accepted \namendments will be given due consideration.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Does the Senator intend to stack the votes on these five \namendments for in the morning?\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

The pending amendment is the Hollings \namendment No. 2193. A point of order has been raised against the \namendment on the basis that it is not germane. The pending question is \nthe motion to waive the Budget Act to allow for the consideration of \nthe amendment on which a rollcall vote has been ordered.\n  There is 1 minute on each side for debate. The Senator from South \nCarolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senator Daschle, \nSenator Conrad, Senator Feingold, Senator Dorgan, and Senator Reid of \nNevada, we put this in to do just exactly what was called for by the \nPresident. We want to save Social Security first.\n  As we all know, we have used the euphemism of a unified budget, a \nunified deficit, and we have been spending, looting, the Social \nSecurity trust fund. Some say that actuarially there is a surplus in \nthere. That is on a sheet of paper. Actually, the money is gone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from South Carolina suspend \nuntil we can get order in the Chamber? The Senator from South Carolina \nhas a right to be heard.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this more or less puts into \nparliamentary procedure what we voted for time and again, what the \ndistinguished Senator from New Mexico has voted for. It is in the law, \nsection 13301, that we save Social Security and quit looting the fund.\n  If you really want to put your money where your mouth is, as the \nexpression goes, rather than just a sense of the Senate, then support \nthis particular resolution now under consideration and put on some \nparliamentary controls, which is what this amendment does. If you want \nto save Social Security, vote for the amendment; waive the Budget Act, \nbecause that is what the Budget Act says to do in section 13301. If you \ndon't want to, vote against the waiver.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n1 minute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to my fellow Senators, if I \nthought this amendment would do anything to save or preserve Social \nSecurity, I would be for it. In my humble opinion, it does absolutely \nnothing to save Social Security. What it does is attempt to change the \nprocess and procedures so that if the Budget Committee reports out for \nSenate consideration anything on Social Security, it is subject to a \n60-vote point of order.\n  We could get to the point where we will take every committee of \njurisdiction and pass a process rule because there was something in \ntheir jurisdiction we didn't want them to do business on. We could say \nanything you report out has to have 60 votes. Then we would take that \nto the floor, and the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction would \nstand up and say, ``What have we come to?''\n  This seems like some kind of exuberance that is not calculated to do \nanything except have some words suggesting we are trying to save Social \nSecurity. I raised a point of order. There is a motion to waive it. I \nhope we do not waive it. I urge Senators to vote ``no'' on the motion \nto waive. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act with respect to the Hollings amendment No. 2193. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2251\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending question is the Faircloth \namendment, amendment No. 2251. There is 1 minute of debate allocated to \neach side.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I believe the Record will reflect that Senator \nFaircloth was granted permission to speak for 3 minutes since we \nyielded back 6 minutes of his time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator would kindly put that in the \nform of a UC request.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Faircloth have 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I rise to speak on the Hutchison-Faircloth marriage \ntax elimination amendment. It is cosponsored by a number of Senators: \nSenator Domenici, Senator Inhofe, Senator Hutchinson of Arkansas, and \nSenator Gramm of Texas.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank Chairman Domenici for the tremendous \nhelp on the issue he has given us on the elimination of the marriage \ntax in this budget resolution. What this amendment says is very simple, \nthat it is the sense of the Senate that eliminating the marriage \npenalty tax should be one of the highest priorities for tax relief this \nyear.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has reported that in 1996, 21 million \nAmerican couples paid an average of $1,400 more in income tax simply \nbecause they were married. The marriage penalty, as it is sometimes \ncalled, comes about as a result of the way the Tax Code is written. It \nneeds to be rewritten so that couples who chose to marry do not get a \nhefty tax bill for choosing to make that decision.\n  We should be encouraging couples to marry, not handing them a $1,400 \ntax bill. I introduced this legislation along with Senator Hutchison to \ncorrect this problem. The majority leader, Senator Trent Lott, has also \nbeen tremendously supportive. Senator Hutchison, Senator Lott, and I \nrecently pledged on Valentine's Day that we would work to remove this \nburdensome tax known as the marriage penalty. I think that it is a \nreasonable goal. We are a step closer today with the budget resolution. \nI urge support for the amendment, and I yield back any time.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Will the Senator add me as a cosponsor?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I would be delighted to.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Thurmond be added as a cosponsor \nto my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who seeks recognition? Who yields time?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if there is any time left on Senator \nFaircloth's amendment, I would like to just say I am very pleased to \nsupport his leadership on the marriage penalty tax.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 40 seconds left allocated to the \nSenator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent to have that 40 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from North Carolina yield his \n40 seconds to the distinguished Senator from Texas?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Yes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you.\n  I urge all my colleagues to vote for the sense of the Senate, which \nbasically says it will be a priority of Congress to eliminate the \nmarriage penalty tax. People should not have to choose between love and \nmoney in this country, but 21 million couples are doing it. And they \nare the police and schoolteachers, people making $28,000 and $32,000 \nthat are getting hit the worst with taxes up to $1,400 just because \nthey got married. That is not right. It is a priority of Congress to \nchange that. And I urge my colleagues to say that the U.S. Senate is \ngoing to fix this problem very soon.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I have expressed myself before. I am \nconcerned about trying to initiate change this year, but I think it is \nfairly clear that this amendment has support. We do not want to \ncontinue a penalty in any way, whether it is marriage and taxes or \nmarriage and any place. So unless there is someone else on my side who \nwants to use a few seconds, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nRockefeller) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The pending amendment is the Craig\n\n[[Page S2951]]\n\namendment No. 2211. The point of order was raised against the amendment \non the basis that it is not germane. The pending question is on the \nmotion to waive the Budget Act to allow the consideration of the \namendment for which a rollcall vote has been ordered. One minute is \nallocated to each side.\n  The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues tonight to vote with me \nto waive the Budget Act. It is the first step to reigning in the \nuncontrolled costs to mandatory spending programs. Your vote tonight \nmerely extends the same treatment to mandatory spending that already \nexists to annually appropriated discretionary spending; that new \nprograms will offset with savings in existing programs; that mandatory \nspending is out of control--we all know that.\n  While this is a balanced budget in the outyears of 2020, and 2035, we \nwill be looking at spending up to 200 plus percent of the gross \ndomestic product.\n  The Craig amendment will not affect a single current beneficiary of a \nsingle existing program. The Craig amendment will not affect a single \nperson who will qualify to become a beneficiary under current \nentitlement programs.\n  We need to start with a single, simple, first step, toward reigning \nin mandatory spending. An aye vote starts us in that direction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I hope that the Senators will oppose \nthis attempt to waive the point of order.\n  This is a new scheme for things. It says that we ought to depart from \npresent pay-as-you-go rules. It would give special protection to \nspecial interest tax loopholes at the expense of programs like Social \nSecurity and Medicare.\n  Mr. President, very simply, I urge my colleagues to vote against the \nwaiver.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

On this vote the yeas are 54, \nthe nays are 45. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not \nhaving voted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of \norder is sustained, and the amendment falls.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I gather the sequencing would be that \nSenator Dorgan will start and then Senator Allard will follow, and then \nSenator Lautenberg, and then Senator Bond, and then Senator Bumpers. We \nwill arrange for Senator Bumpers by unanimous consent.\n  Mr. President, before we start the order here, might I suggest that \nSenator Bumpers would be our fifth amendment tonight, but we have \nagreed with him that we will come in at 8:30 in the morning instead of \n9. He will offer his amendment, and thus the half-hour between 8:30 and \n9 will be available for the agreed-upon time, which is a half-hour, \nequally divided, for the Bumpers amendment. He is here.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when we start up in the morning at 8:30 \nthe order of business be the Bumpers amendment, and pursuant to the \nprevious order there be a half-hour equally divided on that and the \nvote eventually be on or in relationship to that and we waive no points \nof order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator, I wonder if the Senator would accommodate me \nfor about 6 or 7 minutes. Senator Gorton would like to speak on a \nmatter. I ask consent he be permitted to speak for 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Washington is recognized.\n  MR. GORTON. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Gorton pertaining to the introduction of S. 1904 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2218, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that my amendment No. 2218 be called up and \nthat my amendment be modified with the modification I now send to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Strike page 33, line 3, through page 34, line 3, and insert \n     the following:\n\n     SEC. 301. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE TAX TREATMENT OF HOME \n                   MORTGAGE INTEREST AND CHARITABLE GIVING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) current Federal income tax laws embrace a number of \n     fundamental tax policies including longstanding encouragement \n     for home ownership and charitable giving, expanded health and \n     retirement benefits;\n       (2) the mortgage interest deduction is among the most \n     important incentives in the income tax code and promotes the \n     American Dream of home ownership--the single largest \n     investment for most families, and preserving it is critical \n     for the more than 20,000,000 families claiming it now and for \n     millions more in the future;\n       (3) favorable tax treatment to encourage gifts to charities \n     is a longstanding principle that helps charities raise funds \n     needed to provide services to poor families and others when \n     government is simply unable or unwilling to do so, and \n     maintaining this tax incentive will help charities raise \n     money to meet the challenges of their charitable missions in \n     the decades ahead;\n       (4) legislation has been proposed to repeal the entire \n     income tax code at the end of the year 2001 without providing \n     a specific replacement; and\n       (5) recklessly sunsetting the entire income tax code \n     threatens our Nation's future economic growth and unwisely \n     eliminates existing tax incentives that are crucial for \n     taxpayers who are often making the most important financial \n     decisions of their lives.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the levels in this resolution assume that Congress supports \n     the continued tax deductibility of home mortgage interest and \n     charitable contributions.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to notify me when I have \nused 5 minutes. I will then yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nArkansas and yield back the remainder of the time.\n  My amendment is very simple. There is in the budget resolution \nbrought to the floor of the Senate a sense-of-the-Senate provision that \nwill sunset the Internal Revenue Code on December 31, 2001.\n  My amendment strikes that provision and in its place it inserts \nlanguage saying it is the sense of the Congress that we support the \ncontinued tax deductibility of the home mortgage interest deduction, \ncharitable contributions, and so on.\n  My point is this: It is irresponsible, in my judgment, to talk about \nsunsetting the Tax Code and a progressive income tax without providing \nany means of telling the American people what you would put in its \nplace.\n  I want to read something from the Tax Executives Institute. They \nrepresent some 5,000 corporations around the country.\n\n[[Page S2952]]\n\n  They write that it is folly to make tax policy by sound bite, and \nproposals to sunset the Tax Code without making provisions for its \nreplacement or telling the American people what you propose for \nreplacement ought to be rejected.\n  This is what they say:\n\n       For example, a company that otherwise would invest millions \n     of dollars in a multi-year expansion of its manufacturing \n     facilities might well demur if the pending legislation were \n     enacted because of uncertainty over whether or how, after \n     December 31, 2001, it would recover its costs.\n\n  They wouldn't know:\n\n       To repeal the Internal Revenue Code without specifying a \n     replacement system--to exalt the exhilaration of ``doing it \n     now'' over the necessity of ``doing it right''--is to \n     threaten major disruptions of the economy and the lives of \n     the American people.\n\n  The question I have is this: For those who say let's sunset the \nentire Tax Code, I say, when you say sunset the Tax Code in 2001, what \nare you going to replace it with, a national sales tax? A Brookings \nInstitution study on that says if you want to replace the current \nprogressive income tax with a national sales tax, you are probably \ntalking about at least a 35 percent tax rate. I know that the \nproponents of a national sales tax say a 15 percent rate will work. But \nstudy after study shows that you are probably talking a 35 percent tax \nrate, and that is the 35 percent sales tax, for example, when you buy a \nhome. Think of adding 35 percent to the cost of buying a home.\n  How about a flat tax or a VAT tax? A Treasury Department analysis in \n1996 took a look at one of the major flat tax proposals in the \nCongress. It says the flat tax will reduce taxes for families with \nincomes of $200,000 or more, and increase taxes for families with \nincomes under $200,000. Is that what the American people want? To \nsunset the entire Tax Code and replace it with--tax breaks for the \nhighest income folks and higher taxes for the rest?\n  I ask the question, Is the current Tax Code perfect? No. Are there \nsignificant troubles with it? Yes. I have a proposal on what we ought \nto do about that. I think my plan would greatly simplify the tax system \nfor most Americans. But it does not include flat tax, VAT tax, sales \ntax, all of which would tax work and exempt investment, cut only upper-\nincome folks' taxes and increase taxes on working folks. That is \nexactly what all the proposals are about ricocheting around this \nChamber.\n  Don't take it from me, take it from the Treasury analysis, take it \nfrom the Congressional Budget Office analysis, take it from any study \nyou like. But those who want to abolish the current Tax Code rather \nthan fix what is wrong with the current Tax Code want to replace it, in \nmost cases, with something that says, ``Let's tax work and let's exempt \ninvestments. Let's propose a new system that lowers the tax burden on \nupper-income folks and raises the tax burden on the rest.''\n  I will tell those who offer this proposal that everyone out there in \nthis country who owns a home and understands their home mortgage \ninterest is deductible from their income tax, if this sort of thing \never passes, they will be told by this Congress, ``Don't count on \ndeductibility of your home mortgage interest, because we may not have a \ntax system that allows that. Don't count on the deductibility of your \nhome mortgage interest, because we may abolish the tax system. In fact, \nwe want to sunset it, abolish it, replace it with something else, but \nwe don't want to tell you what that something else is.''\n\n  It is highly irresponsible, in my judgment, to say let us just \nabolish the Tax Code as of December 31, 2001 before agreeing on a \nreplacement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask for 30 additional seconds, and then I will yield 5 \nminutes to the Senator from Arkansas, or as much time as he needs under \nthe allotment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand this proposal to terminate \nthe tax code has been ricocheting around for some long while. The Tax \nExecutives Institute says it best. This is a good sound bite, but it is \na poor excuse for good policy. Don't take it from me, take it from \nAmerican corporations and taxpayers who need certainty.\n  Those who want to terminate the entire Internal Revenue Code in this \nmanner risk creating financial trouble for millions of homeowners. \nNearly thirty million homeowners who would ask you: If you want to get \nrid of the current Tax Code, what are your intentions with respect to \nthe tax deductibility of my home mortgage interest? Do you intend to \nkeep that? If not, why not? What do you say to folks who have invested \nin a home and whose home values will now drop because this proposal \nwould abolish the deductibility of home mortgage interest?\n  If this extreme measure is enacted, future home buyers would likely \nfind it more difficult to purchase a new home and realize the American \nDream of home ownership. This is because, in addition to losing the tax \ndeduction, such a move would surely result in great uncertainty for our \nfinancial markets, lead to higher interest rates, and otherwise \nincrease the costs of purchasing a new home--already the largest single \nfinancial investment for most families.\n  Another one of the many important casualties caused by these efforts \nto terminate the Tax Code would be the tax incentives that encourage \nmillions of taxpayers to make gifts to charities that provide services \nto needy families and others. Charities perform an important public \nservice by providing help to others when the government is unwilling or \nunable to do so. At a time when the government is downsizing and we are \nasking charities and other groups to do more, we ought not take away \ntheir key tax tools for attracting the funds they need to meet future \nchallenges. But that's exactly what would happen should this sunsetting \nproposal become law.\n  These are just two examples of the serious problems caused by this \nwrong-headed proposal. For all of the uncertainties this proposal would \ncreate, one thing seems certain to me: this sunset provision will leave \nmost Americans in the dark.\n  My amendment is simple, it strikes the sunset provision and inserts \nsomething in place of it that I think makes sense: support for the \ncontinued tax deduction for home mortgage interest, charitable giving \nand more. I hope my colleagues will support that motion to strike.\n  I yield as much time as he may consume to the Senator from Arkansas, \nSenator Bumpers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, first I express my sincere gratitude to \nthe Senator from North Dakota for taking on this issue. I decided \nperhaps nobody was going to offer such an amendment. But I take this \nopportunity to say to my colleagues and the American people, for that \nmatter--we are not supposed to call attention to C-SPAN2, but I hope a \nlot of people are watching C-SPAN2 because I want to say that this is \nmy 24th year in the Senate, and this is the most irresponsible, without \nquestion, the most irresponsible provision I have ever seen in a piece \nof legislation. The very idea of saying we are going to abolish the \nInternal Revenue Code without a clue as to what we are going to replace \nit with is the height of irresponsibility.\n  I know the applause lines. As the old saying goes, I know how to \nbring people to their feet. The object of any responsible legislator is \nto bring people to their senses. Everybody knows that when you talk to \nthe Chamber of Commerce, if you are looking for that nice applause, \njust get on the Internal Revenue Service. Everybody has his own \nfavorite horror story. I have my own. I daresay every Member of this \nbody has his own horror story about their arrogance, how overbearing \nthey are, how they have cost you money. Those are indefensible. I am \nnot defending those.\n  But I can tell you, if you think the year 2000 computer glitch is \nbad, if you think that may bring this country to the brink of disaster, \nyou just eliminate the Internal Revenue Code with absolutely no thought \nof what you are going to replace it with, just as this country is on a \nsound financial basis, and as we are looking forward to a surplus this \nyear, what in the name of all that is good and holy are we thinking \nabout?\n  Is it going to be a flat tax? That gets a lot of applause in some \nplaces. As far as I am concerned, the flat tax was created by the \n``Flat Earth Society,'' but that is beside the point. I know how to get \napplause talking about a flat tax. Everybody ``pays the same amount.''\n\n[[Page S2953]]\n\n  Is it going to be replaced by some kind of a flat tax where your \nchurch contributions won't be deductible? Is it going to be a flat tax \nwhere, as the Senator from North Dakota has pointed out, your mortgage \ninterest will not be deductible? ``Mr. Businessman, before you applaud, \nare you willing to give up depreciation? Are you willing to give up \nhundreds of other things that are in the code now that you know \nabout?''\n  I will tell you one thing, I will take the known, no matter how bad \nit may be, before I will take the unknown. And for the Members of the \nSenate to buy into this proposition of saying we are going to \neliminate--eliminate--the Internal Revenue Code with nothing to replace \nit--do you know something, I didn't vote for that extra thousand pages \nin the Internal Revenue Code last summer. All the people who were so \nhot for the balanced budget amendment and the big tax cuts and what do \nwe get? A thousand more pages in the Internal Revenue Code so they can \ngo out and tell the Chamber of Commerce what a horror it is--the same \npeople who bring you this piece of trash.\n\n  Mr. President, I, again, thank my friend from North Dakota for \nalerting the people of this body and, hopefully, across America, that \nwe are not just going to take this country to the brink of a disaster, \nwe are going to take it right over the brink, and if you get to the \nyear 2000 after you eliminate the Internal Revenue Code and you don't \nhave anything to collect $1.7 trillion with, you tell the Social \nSecurity recipients how that is going to work out. Tell everybody--the \nMedicare people--how that is going to work out.\n  I plead with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, do not buy \ninto an applause line. Keep your sanity and do the rational thing and \nstrike this from this resolution.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, one of the proponents of this provision, \nalthough I saw to it that it was put in the resolution, is Senator \nBrownback who is standing now and wants to be recognized. Is the \nSenator going to lead off on his side?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator, and then I will yield \n5 minutes to the next Senator who is his copartner in getting this \ndone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the chairman of the \nBudget Committee for including this provision in the budget and for \nbeing a cosponsor, along with 37 other Members of the U.S. Senate, of \nthis provision.\n  I have a quiz, if I can, for the Members who are still watching. Just \na simple question; a series of facts and then a question.\n  Let me ask people to, if they will, go through this quiz with me of, \nwhat is 10 million words long, cost over $150 billion annually just to \ncomply with, is unintelligible by almost every American, including \nthose with advanced degrees, advanced law degrees, advanced tax \ndegrees, and is the lead way Washington mismanages and micromanages our \nlives? What one thing is that?\n  It is the Tax Code.\n  The Tax Code is over 10 million words, costs over $150 billion just \nto comply with before anybody pays a thin dime on this Tax Code. It is \nunintelligible to people who are tax law experts, and is the lead way \nthat Washington micromanages individual lives across this country. It \nis no wonder this is an applause line. It is because people despise \nthis code. It has been amended and added to and jiggered with over the \nyears and years to where it just does not make any sense.\n  All the resolution says is that we should sunset the code at the end \nof the year 2001. We sunset many Federal programs when many Federal \nprograms are required for reauthorization.\n  I heard the arguments on the other side from my colleagues from North \nDakota and Arkansas--very good men, with a great deal of integrity and \nhonor. But we disagree on this. I have to say their arguments sound \nvery familiar. They sound very familiar to the time when we had the \ndebate about balancing the budget by a date certain.\n  The President then was saying, ``If we balance the budget by a date \ncertain, by 7 years, it's going to throw the economy into a tailspin, \nit's going to do all these terrible things. You don't know how you're \ngoing to balance the budget, do you?'' We said, ``We know a number of \nways to balance this budget. And if we don't set a date by which we're \ngoing to accomplish it, it'll never get done.''\n  That is the same theory with this bill. There are a number of ways to \nredo the Tax Code. I am glad to hear Senator Dorgan has a proposal \nhimself. There is a flat tax proposal, there is a consumption tax \nproposal, there is a VAT tax proposal. Congressman Gephardt has \nproposals. There are a number of them. And we will be phasing in \ntransitions the same as phasing in on different programs we have gone \nto.\n  But the point of it here is, if we do not start, we will never get \nthere. If we do not start, we are going to enter the next century for \nlong periods of time with this same Tax Code in place. Let me say to \nthe people here who are listening, we cannot have another American \ncentury built on this Tax Code. It is so big and so intrusive that \npeople live in fear of it. Small businesses live in fear of this Tax \nCode because they use so many resources to comply with it. And when \nthey comply with it, they still do not know what they have actually \ndone to comply with the law.\n  So all we are saying by this little provision that is in the budget \naccord is, let us deal with this Tax Code by the end of the year 2001. \nIt leaves alone Social Security and Medicare. Those are not touched in \nthis. So in case people are saying that they are worried about Social \nSecurity and Medicare, it is not touched in the bill.\n  We are saying, if we are ever going to get rid of this that has \nhaunted us for so long, we have to set a date certain by which we will \ndo it. I think it is a good provision in the budget resolution. I urge \nmy colleagues to vote against this amendment so we can have another \nAmerican century with a different taxation system.\n  I yield to my colleague from Arkansas.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield to Senator Hutchinson who has been one of the \ncoleaders on this issue.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n  I wish my good friend and colleague from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, \nhad been able to stay because he called this the most irresponsible \npiece of legislation that he has heard of during his time. This isn't \nabout applause lines and not about flat taxes or flatter. It is about \nwhether or not we are going to vote to defend the status quo, whether \nwe are going to vote to defend an incomprehensible monstrosity called \nthe IRS Tax Code.\n\n  I want to begin my remarks by just quoting the words of James Madison \nin Federalist Paper No. 62 when he said:\n\n       It will be of little avail to the people. . .if the laws be \n     so voluminous that they cannot be read, or so incoherent that \n     they cannot be understood; if they be repealed or revised \n     before they are promulgated, or undergo such incessant \n     changes that no man, who knows what the law is today, can \n     guess what it will be tomorrow.\n\n  I think if he were writing today, he would be talking about the IRS \nTax Code being incomprehensible. The biggest issue raised against it is \nthat it is going to cause uncertainty if we repeal it, if we sunset it, \nand that it is going to cause uncertainty.\n  Mr. President I can think of no greater expert on the economy or the \neffects of public policy on the economy than Alan Greenspan, the \nChairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. All of this \n``the sky is falling,'' all of this fearmongering, all of this rhetoric \nthat this is going to somehow cause economic chaos--Mr. Greenspan said, \nin testifying before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs \nCommittee in 1995:\n\n       Sunsetting is a very important process for both regulation \n     and various different types of legislation.\n\n  He was asked:\n\n       If we're talking about sunsetting regulations, should we \n     sunset taxes as well. . .?\n\n  He responded:\n\n       I cannot find reasons why all programs should not have \n     specific time-certain ends to them and be required to be \n     reauthorized.\n\n  He went on:\n\n\n[[Page S2954]]\n\n\n       After a period of years, I would say yes to that. I would \n     say all institutions of a democratic society should be \n     reviewed. . .the presumption that institutions should not be \n     reviewed periodically in a democratic society is a mistake.\n\n  Mr. President, we just passed in this Chamber a transportation \nfunding bill, the ISTEA bill. We would not have done it had it not been \nsunsetted, had it not expired, had it not had to be reauthorized. We \nwould have never forced ourselves to do it.\n  Today I spent most of my day in a higher education reauthorization \nmarkup. We did that because the last one is expiring, because it was \nsunsetted. We do that on spending bills all the time--the IDEA bill. \nWhy should we not also do that on bills on the Tax Code that has become \nso incomprehensible to the American people?\n  Senator Bumpers, my good friend from Arkansas, said it is the height \nof irresponsibility to sunset something before you know what you are \ngoing to replace it with. I am so glad--I am so glad--that our Founding \nFathers did not adopt such a position. To say that you cannot pass a \nlaw until a new law is ready to replace it ignores the rich history of \nthis country that was founded by a group of freedom lovers who signed \nthe Declaration of Independence 12 years before the Constitution \nwas drafted and implemented. Surely we can do that with just one title \nof the U.S. Code.\n\n  To say that it is the height of irresponsibility--can you imagine our \nFounding Fathers saying, ``Well, it's very irresponsible for us to \ndeclare independence before we know what the Constitution is going to \nlook like or before we know what the Government is going to look like \nor before we know what the Tax Code is going to look like.''\n  We know one thing. We may not know, I say to my colleague, whether we \nwant a flat tax, sales tax, value added tax, or some other hybrid, but \nwe, as the American people, know that of what we have, we deserve \nbetter, that this serves no one, and the April Fool's joke is to defend \nthis Tax Code, which is the nightmare for the American people 2 weeks \nbefore they reach this deadline.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on this resolution which would delete \nthis important sunset provision sense of the Senate from our budget \nresolution. I thank the chairman for his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think that 3, 4 years ago, 5 years ago, someone might \nhave walked up to me and said, ``Senator Domenici, why are you on such \na measure?'' But for many years, more than 5, I have been telling New \nMexicans and every American that I could speak to that we are going to \nreform the tax laws of America. And guess what has happened. They now \nconsist of 17,000 pages of laws. That is not the regulations and all \nthe other things--17,000. And every year that passed, since that 5 or 6 \nyears ago when we started talking about basic reform, the tax laws got \nmore complicated, more difficult, cost more money, and more detrimental \nto the American economy with the passage of each year.\n  Frankly, I am on this bill and I decided to put it in the budget \nresolution because it seemed to me that we were muscle bound. We could \nnot get anything done. I believe the right thing to do when you are in \nthat condition, and the people are suffering from it, and the country \nis suffering from it, is that you say there is going to be an ``or \nelse'' to this--``you fix it or else.''\n  That is what sunsetting is. But nobody should think that we are \ntalking about sunsetting a code without prescribing some basic \nfundamentals about the code we intend to replace, that defective, \ndeficient one. And anybody who is interested in knowing whether we just \nsaid, ``Let's do away with the code,'' or whether we spoke \nintelligently and with great common sense, right to what the American \npeople are worried about, just turn to page 33 of S. Con. Res. 86--and \nif my time runs out in the middle of these next two or three \nparagraphs, just stop me. But the findings are found in this \nresolution. And it says:\n\n       Findings--Congress finds that a simple and fair Federal tax \n     system is one that--\n       (1) applies a low rate, through easily understood laws, to \n     all Americans;\n       (2) provides tax relief for working Americans;\n       (3) protects the rights of taxpayers and reduces tax \n     collection abuses;\n       (4) eliminates bias against savings and investment;\n       (5) promotes economic growth and job creation;\n       (6) does not penalize marriage or families;\n       (7) provides for a taxpayer-friendly collections process. . \n     . .\n\n  And then it goes on to say that the reason for this sunset is ``that \na new Federal tax system''--not nothing, as was suggested, but ``a new \nFederal tax system will be enacted that is both simple and fair as \ndescribed in'' the provisions that I just read 2 minutes ago.\n  That is what the American people want to hear, that we are going to \ndo away with this one because we want to pass a new one and more like \nit. And if we can pass the law and send it to the President with the \nreal sunset, it is a message to the committees of the Congress, to the \nreformers who seem to never end in terms of, what are we going to get \nin place of this one, that the time is running out, the clock is \nticking. And that is what this is about.\n  I believe the American people, although they have been fed some shock \nmedicine by the President, who talks about how irresponsible this is, \nif they heard this read, what we propose, that we are saying stop what \nis currently an abomination and substitute it with a new one that does \nthe following things, would say, ``Hallelujah. Let's do it.''\n  So I believe we should turn down the proposal that attempts to wipe \nthis out of the budget. It is the right place to have it. It is the \nright thing to do. And if we want a good future, we are right on track. \nFix Social Security in the way we have been discussing, take care of \nMedicare, and fix it, and reform this Tax Code; and we will be giving \nour children and future generations the best present that we could give \nanyone as elected adult leaders.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I yield to my friend from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes. Mr. President, I sat and listened here with \nwonderment. We are about ready to say, ``Let's get rid of this other \nthing because that will make us behave like responsible citizens. \nThat's the only way we can do it.'' We heard the same speeches, with \nall due respect, about whether or not we needed a balanced budget \namendment because we cannot discipline ourselves, and, thank the Lord, \nthat failed. And we did not alter the Constitution, and we did not get \ninto the ridiculous kind of arguments that we would have. We just went \nout and did it.\n  To my friends on the other side I would say, have faith, have faith \nin your own ability that you can make a difference. You have a \nmajority. Let us change it. But if you want to burn down the house so \nwe can be forced to move and find another location, I think that is a \npretty poor way of conducting business. I see what the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico has proposed as an alternative, something that \npromotes economic growth, something that is a low tax rate.\n  This amendment would delete the provision in the resolution calling \nfor scrapping the tax code without an alternative. Instead, the \namendment calls for the continued tax deductibility of home mortgage \ninterest and charitable contributions.\n  I share the frustration of most Americans about the Internal Revenue \nService, and believe strongly that we must pass IRS reform legislation \nas soon as possible. The House approved similar legislation last year. \nIt's long past time for the Senate to act.\n  At the same time, I have serious concerns about the proposal to scrap \nthe tax code without an alternative. I think, with all due respect, \nthat it is a reckless political gimmick that would backfire on this \nCongress.\n  The main problem with this proposal is that it would create enormous \nuncertainty about the continued availability of many important tax code \nprovisions. And that could create economic chaos and other problems for \nmillions of Americans.\n  The Finance Committee needs to consider these problems before we \nscrap the whole tax code. For example,\n\n[[Page S2955]]\n\nwhat will this do to the value of homes? How will uncertainty affect \ncontributions to charities, or savings plans for retirement and \neducation purposes? How will employers react to health and retirement \nplans; will they refuse to set up new plans? Will they reduce \ncontributions to existing plans?\n  What will be the overall effect of uncertainty on economic growth and \njob creation? These are important questions that need to be publicly \nexamined.\n  The Finance Committee ought to consider these types of questions \nbefore we approve sunsetting legislation. But I do think it is \nimportant that, in the meantime, we reaffirm our support for the \nmortgage interest deduction and the deduction for charitable \ncontributions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, in short, I hope that the amendment by \nthe Senator from North Dakota will prevail, because it makes good sense \nand it tests the mettle of those who are voting. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I guess I have 3 minutes remaining. The \nother side has 2. I will take my 3 minutes. They are welcome to finish.\n  There is a wonderful legislative strategy, I guess, that if you \ncannot change the facts, change the subject. The subject here isn't \nabout the current Tax Code; the subject is about what do you want to \nput in place of a Tax Code you want to abolish? Something new, we are \ntold. Well, it is interesting. There is nothing new around here that I \nsee about the proposals to change the Tax Code. All the proposals I \nhave seen are the same tired, old proposals--exempt the rich, tax the \nrest, and call it reform.\n  You think that is not the case? The plans out here are: Tax work and \nexempt investment; tax people to go to work; tax the income from work; \nsay to those that clip coupons, you are exempt. Nothing new about that. \nPeople have been trying to do that for a century.\n  The question I would ask the opponents of this amendment is, do you \nthink the American people will be better off with a national sales tax \nplan? Is that what you are going to replace it with?\n  Bill Gale at Brookings, who did this piece, says your national sales \ntax rate, by the way, despite all the numbers they tell you, will be 35 \npercent. Want to pay a 35 percent sales tax on a home you buy? Do you \nthink you are better off with that kind of tax program? Do you think \nyou are better off with a program that has also been introduced here in \nthe Congress that the Treasury Department analyzes that everybody over \n$200,000 gets a big tax cut? Everybody under $200,000 a year in income \ngets a big tax increase? Do you think you will be better off with that \nkind of Tax Code? I don't think so. Is a business going to be better \noff when they find they can't get their existing depreciation \ndeductions ? Or tens of millions of homeowners will be better off when \nthey discover they can't deduct their home mortgage interest?\n  No, this isn't about change. And with respect to Mr. Greenspan, who \nwe are told about here--Mr. Greenspan, of course, is the fellow who \nsaid if we ever go below 6 percent unemployment we have calamity in \nthis country. It has been about 45 months that we have been below 6 \npercent unemployment and the economy is doing well and inflation is in \ncheck. He was wrong about that. He said we will have a new wave of \ninflation, every month. He has been wrong about that for 4 years. \nInflation is way down. I was about ready to think maybe the Senator had \nmerit until he started talking about Greenspan supporting his case.\n  Sunset the Tax Code--what will you replace it with? Will the American \npeople be better off with a flat tax? A VAT tax? A national sales tax?\n  This is the only town in America where people think it is a bold new \nstroke, having a billionaire proposing a tax plan that would cut his \ntaxes by hundreds of millions of dollars. That is not bold or new. It \nis the same tired old argument the American people have heard for years \nand years and years.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Does the Senator know that Chairman Roth in a March \n13, 1998, letter--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from New Mexico has 1 minute 45 seconds.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Will the Senator yield 1 minute?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 1 minute.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I guess the rationale of the Senator from North Dakota \nis we are stuck with this Tax Code forever and that is the way it will \nbe.\n  Frankly, there are a lot of different ideas floating around. I heard \nthe Senator from North Dakota has a tax proposal, as well.\n  I simply ask people looking at this, could we do any worse than this \ncurrent Tax Code? If I had a stack of books here now, it would be this \ntall. I am a lawyer. I confess that sin. I looked at this Tax Code and \nit is unintelligible. We couldn't do any worse with something \ndifferent.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Will the Senator yield some time to me?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 40 seconds.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. The language contained in our budget resolution \nmimics the language of the Tax Code Termination Act. Thirty-eight \nMembers of the Senate are cosponsoring it; 154 Members of the House. It \nis responsible language that will force this Congress to act. It will \nforce the national debate, it will force a consensus, and it will force \nus to make a decision.\n\n  We can do better and the American people deserve better. We need to \nset a sunset for this Tax Code.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If the discussion on the amendment is done, I yield \nmyself 2 minutes off the bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thought we weren't going to do that. We entered a \nunanimous consent agreement that we couldn't do that. Or did we say we \nwould only do it for ourselves?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I guess that is what I thought we said, but it is \nlike the Senator made a mistake and thought 7 o'clock was 9 o'clock.\n  Fair enough.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How many seconds do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I gave him 40 seconds and you said I had 57 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time was counting as the Senator was asking \nthe question.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thirty seconds apiece.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thirty seconds apiece.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. In my 30 seconds, by unanimous consent, Mr. \nPresident, I say that it is important to note that in a March 13, 1998, \nletter to the Budget Committee, Chairman Roth wrote, ``I believe a \ncomprehensive overhaul of the Tax Code should be in place before any \naction is taken to sunset the existing Tax Code.''\n  I rest my case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Dorgan proposed to us, and I think to the \nAmerican people, that he is not for reform and he likes the current tax \nsystem. Unless that is the case, then it seems to me he would at least \npermit those who write the tax laws to try to write a new one that is \nbetter than this one.\n  My question is, do you like the Tax Code the way it is? Do you like \ntax reform, which has never been passed yet? We don't know what it will \nbe, except it will be better than this one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2170\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. I ask the pending amendment be laid aside and I ask to \ncall up amendment No. 2170.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Amendment numbered 2170, previously proposed by the Senator \n     from Colorado [Mr. Allard].\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, the purpose of the Allard amendment, which \nwe did debate last night--I brought it back to continue the debate this \nevening--is to explain just how easy it\n\n[[Page S2956]]\n\nis for us to make a commitment to pay down the debt by making some \ncommitment of revenue flow for that sole purpose.\n  I have a chart with a provision called the ``American Debt Repayment \nAct.'' Basically, what it does is take the budget bill, the 5-year plan \nwe have before us, take the revenues, and say we don't spend it, we \nsave it to pay down the debt, and after 5 years we will take $11.7 \nbillion, less than 1 percent of the total budget allocated over 30 \nyears, and we will eliminate the debt by doing that.\n  The American family today, when they take out their largest loan--\nusually to buy a new home--has a 30-year mortgage. I am just saying \nthat we can make a minimal commitment from the budget and we can pay \noff this debt within 30 years. That is the reason I propose my \namendment, because I want this body to make a minimal commitment to \npaying down the debt.\n  When you do this, several things happen. First of all, there is \ntremendous savings on interest, some $3.7 trillion in interest over \nthat 30 years that is saved that can be used for other programs, \nwhether it is tax cuts or whether it is additional spending. I am not \nin favor of additional spending. I think tax cuts is the way to go, but \nthe money is there to do it. We do this with this commitment, and yet \nwhen we do that we still let our budget grow traditionally at the rate \nit has been growing in the past.\n  We are really not making a sacrifice but we are making a commitment, \nif we pass this Allard amendment, to help pay off the debt. If we pay \noff the debt in 30 years, that gets us out to year 2027, 2028. If that \nhas a familiar ring, let me remind Members that is the same date that \nmany economists predict Social Security will be bankrupt. So this is a \nkey first step in us being able to address some very serious problems \nthat we are faced with today, and that is a Social Security that is \ngetting ready to go bankrupt, a Medicare system that is even in worse \nshape than the Social Security system. This frees up revenue to address \nthose kinds of problems.\n  I asked the chairman of the Federal Reserve when he testified before \nthe Banking Committee, Alan Greenspan, if he would comment about paying \ndown the debt. He said he agrees that paying down the debt or \neliminating the Federal debt would have several positive impacts on \nSocial Security reform. I will quote his testimony before the Senate \nBanking Committee on the 25th of February:\n\n       The notion to pay down the debt creates a very large amount \n     of savings in the system, a very big window to do a lot in \n     the area of Social Security, if you go that direction.\n\n  In a letter that I received from Alan Greenspan on March 26, 1998, he \nsaid: ``Budget surpluses will not by themselves make the current \nstructure of Social Security taxes and benefits viable over the long \nrun. Assuring payment of intended benefits beyond that date will \nrequire some statutory adjustments to Social Security receipts and or \nbenefits.'' So he does recognize that there is definitely a correlation \nbetween Social Security reform and making a commitment to pay down that \ndebt.\n  I will comment about the impact of paying off the debt on the total \neconomy. Again, I will quote the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan \nGreenspan, when he testified before the Senate Banking Committee, again \non the 25th of February. In regard to the economy he says: ``The means \nby which you pay off the debt is to run very substantial unified budget \nsurpluses. What happens when you do that is you shift the issue of debt \nfrom the public to the private sector. I think there are very major \nbenefits from that occurring.''\n  So I think there is a lot of support from people who really know \nabout the budget, know about the economy, know about Social Security, \nabout this, and there are a lot of Americans who support the idea we \nought to be paying down the debt. I think the Senate ought to show a \nsimilar commitment to pay down this huge debt, which is somewhere \naround $5.6 trillion.\n  I have on the floor with me a colleague, and I yield 8 minutes to the \nSenator from Wyoming to talk about paying down the debt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I rise to express my support for the common sense \namendment, No. 2170, which would pay down the national debt.\n  When Congress was in session, and on most weekends, I traveled \nthousands of miles throughout the vast State of Wyoming. I polled \npeople on what they think is the most important thing we can be doing \nwith their money. I consistently heard many people say, ``If there's a \nsurplus, pay down the debt.'' I have to tell you, they don't quite \nbelieve in the surplus we keep talking about back here because they \nunderstand Social Security. But they don't want us squandering it on \nnew spending and new ideas.\n  If recent CBO statistics hold true, we should see a budget surplus of \n$8 billion in fiscal year 1999--not counting Social Security. However, \nwe did not get to this point by exercising fiscal constraint. We still \nspend too much. We spend about $1.7 trillion every year. I voted \nagainst the spending portion of the balanced budget amendment of 1997 \nbecause it seemed clear to me that more could have been done to cut \ndown the size and scope of the Federal Government. We could have \nenacted more meaningful entitlement reform. We could have gotten the \nfiscal house in order faster. If not for the unexpected revenues that \ncame as a result of 7 years of economic expansion, we would not be \nclose to eliminating that deficit today.\n  Just the interest that we are now paying on the Federal debt has \nreached about 15 percent of the total budget outlays. That amounts to \nabout $250 billion that cannot be used for education or military \nreadiness or national defense. The only way we can cut down on the \namount and percentage of interest paid is to reduce the Federal debt.\n  This amendment will accomplish just that. It will set Congress on a \npath of fiscal responsibility and will require a 30-year pay down of \nthe Federal debt. In the past few months, I have seen a unique attitude \ntransformation take place in this city. Even though a budget surplus or \nzero deficit, only estimated, has not yet occurred, the administration \ndid not hesitate to offer around $100 billion worth of new or expanded \nprograms that would easily create a larger deficit in the proposed \nbalanced budget. It seems their eye for spending is still bigger than \nthe taxpayers' wallet.\n\n  Even though the economy is strong, I am surprised that so few in \nCongress are concerned about what we, as a nation, are in danger of \npassing on to our children and our grandchildren. It seems we are tied \nto the immediate gratification we receive from spending more money that \nwe don't have, that we don't see the danger that looms in the not-too-\ndistant future if we don't stop spending on credit with reckless \nabandon. That danger is a massive Federal debt and the changing \ndemographics that will place a tremendous amount of pressure on young \ntaxpayers who, if no change is made with the entitlement programs, will \nsee a bankrupt Social Security and Medicare system and a mountain of \nhigh debt and an economy so weak that there will be no hope of passing \nit off--paying it off; we are trying to pass us off.\n  Somehow we have convinced ourselves that we deserve these benefits \nand we will it to our children to figure out a way to pay for them. \nThroughout the debate in the budget resolution it becomes even more \nevident that it does not matter whether the economy is performing at \nrecord highs or lows, some Members of Congress will always propose more \nspending and more programs. I have heard numerous excuses this week of \nwhy we should spend more of our Federal dollars.\n  There seems to be a belief that no matter how much we spend, we are \nnot spending enough for the American people. Before I came to \nWashington as a Senator, I knew we had a plethora of Federal programs. \nNow that I am here, however, I am even more astounded at the number of \nprograms available for nearly everything and everyone under the sun. \nBut some still believe the Federal Government is not doing nearly \nenough to help those in want or need, or more.\n  It is very short-sighted to believe that our children or \ngrandchildren will not be left with the bill that is accruing. Do we \never stop to think what the possible consequences are before we propose \na program expansion or creation? The Allard amendment would\n\n[[Page S2957]]\n\nrequire us to focus on our priorities. It would help us focus on a \nlimited, less-expansive Federal Government. A limited, responsive \nFederal Government is what the people of Wyoming expect from any \ngovernment, whether at the State, local or Federal level. They and the \nother American people deserve a disciplined Federal Government. This \namendment will help Congress focus on limiting the scope of Government.\n  With a Federal debt of over $5.5 trillion, we must run budget \nsurpluses not just for 1 or 2 years, but for 30 or more years to pay \noff the debt. I believe the administration and Congress should heed the \nwords of Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan. He noted in his \ntestimony in the Senate Budget Committee on January 29, 1998, that we \nshould be cautious in our spending because Federal revenues are not \nguaranteed and may fall short of expectations. He, again, advised that \nwe should be aiming for budgetary surpluses and using the proceeds to \nretire the outstanding Federal debt. He mentions how that will help the \neconomy and save Social Security.\n  The Allard amendment follows the advice of Chairman Greenspan. It \nrequires budgetary surpluses every year, with these surpluses going \ntoward payment of the Federal debt. These payments would amortize the \ndebt over the next 30 years, similar to mortgage payments on a $5.5 \ntrillion mansion. Anybody who purchases a house must pay the mortgage \nthat accompanies it. Why should the Federal Government be exempt from a \nsimilar requirement? It is the ethical thing to do and it just makes \nsound economic sense. Yes, we bought a house for ourselves and our kids \nand our grandkids, and we will pass on the house and we will pass on \nthe debt. But let's be sure that we are current on the payments.\n  The Allard amendment will not take money from the Social Security \nsystem. To the contrary, it will extend the life and solvency of the \nSocial Security system and other entitlement programs. The best way to \nshore up Social Security is to pay down the national debt while we work \non reforms to the system.\n  Now is the time to start making those mortgage payments and to begin \nto chip away at the mountain of debt. It is irresponsible, reckless, \nand selfish to wait any longer. Any delay will further jeopardize the \nnational security and economic freedom of our Nation and our children. \nSome may ask if we can afford to do this now. In response, I will \nborrow the words of President Ronald Reagan: ``If not now, when? If not \nus, who?''\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Allard-Enzi amendment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 15 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and \nyield the floor.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I watched with interest the \ndevelopment of this amendment and the others that we heard over the \nlast couple days. It seems like there is a testimonial here to Alan \nGreenspan. He is a very smart guy, and I will tell you how I know how \nsmart he is. He used to be on the board of my company, and when I left \nto come to the Senate, he was still on the board of my company. He \ndidn't leave there until he was chosen to be chairman of the Fed. At \nthat point, he could not stay and continue enjoying the private side of \nthings. It was very nice.\n  He is a very bright guy. At our board meetings, everybody used to \nlisten so attentively to what Alan said. Fortunately, in this country \nof ours, there are lots of smart people. It doesn't mean that he is \nwrong, but it means that others can have a differing view. I think that \nthis amendment--and I am not putting myself in his league, I must tell \nyou; but we talked to economists, too, and we see a problem with this.\n  This amendment would establish a point of order against any budget \nresolution in which revenues do not exceed outlays for any given year. \nWe are considering a budget resolution today. There would be a point of \norder against any budget resolution in which revenues do not exceed \noutlays for any given year. Well, this amendment would lock us into a \nrigid formula for fiscal policy, threaten to make future recessions \nmore severe, jeopardize our national security--I don't use these words \ncasually--and deprive the Nation of needed investments in our future \nwell-being.\n  We all know that reducing the Federal debt is an important goal of \nfiscal policy. I don't think it is unknown that our President, \nPresident Clinton, is a very strong advocate of doing that. He proposed \nusing any surpluses to pay down debt and, yes, to shore up Social \nSecurity, which it does at the same time--pay down that. That is what \nthe President said, ``I am not going to let you tinker with that. If I \nhave anything to do about it, I don't want you to use that money for \nanything but paying down the debt.'' So we have a common goal here, but \nit should not be pursued to the exclusion of all other worthy goals.\n  If this amendment were to pass, it would make future recessions \ndeeper by eliminating the budget's ability to stabilize the economy \nautomatically. We use it that way--perhaps to the surprise of some--and \nwhen an economic downturn hits, tax revenues go down automatically and \nspending for unemployment benefits increases automatically. That is the \nway, frankly, I think it should be. The budget's automatic response \nhelps to offset some of the economic pain and to shorten the \nrecession's duration.\n  Handcuffing our fiscal policy in times of economic crisis, as this \namendment would do, risks turning recessions into depressions. As one \nwho lived through the Great Depression myself, I know very well what \nthat would mean to our Nation. I know what it did to help my family, \nthe only time--other than the GI bill--that we had to reach out. My \nfather was humiliated when his job was finally lost in the Depression \nand he had to go to work for the WPA, a Government program. It was \nembarrassing to him, but that was the only way he could see to try to \nsupport his family. That is the way it happens in times of stress like \nthat.\n\n  So when I look at what is being proposed here, I say thank goodness \nwe have the capacity in times of need to make changes. For instance, \nthe Allard amendment doesn't just pose a threat to our economic \nsecurity; it also jeopardizes our national security. The cold war may \nbe over, but that doesn't mean we won't face serious new military \nthreats in the future. What would happen if America confronted an enemy \nthat was building up its military in preparation for conflict? We would \nnot be able to arm ourselves to meet the challenge because of this \nfiscal straitjacket.\n  I know that the Senator from Colorado wants to do the right thing \nand, again, we share a goal, but the approach is radically different. \nThe Allard amendment does include an exception in matters of Defense, \nwhen a declaration of war is in effect. There is very significant \nmeaning to those few words. We faced a variety of major military \nchallenges since war was last officially declared, and the year was \n1941. This amendment, in those several times, would have tied our hands \nbehind our backs. I also say to Senators who care about public \ninvestment that this amendment could prevent us from providing \nprudently for our future.\n  Here is an example: If Congress were to decide that it's important to \nmake significant new investments in our telecommunications \ninfrastructure or our transportation infrastructure and we wanted to \namortize the cost over several years, even though we don't have \namortization formally in our financial statement, the Allard amendment \nwould create a new roadblock. I want to say especially to our friends \non the other side of the aisle who believe that tax cuts underwrite our \nfuture prosperity, this amendment would also make it more difficult to \nenact tax cuts.\n  My point is not at all to advocate huge, new tax breaks. But I want \nto highlight the fact that this amendment will tie everybody's hands \nbehind our backs and limit flexibility for Senators on all sides of the \nideological spectrum. We have eliminated the deficit, restored fiscal \ndiscipline, and helped create the strongest economy in decades--maybe \nretroactively we are going to say it has been the strongest\n\n[[Page S2958]]\n\ndecade ever. We have done it all without procedural gimmicks that \nlimited our flexibility. We did it the old-fashioned way, with hard \nwork and hard choices. That is the way I think we ought to do it now \nand in the future. There is just no need for this kind of rigid rule.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment. I think it would be a \nhuge mistake. It could wreak havoc on our economy, could weaken our \nnational security to a dangerous point. It could impede our ability to \nmake needed investments either directly or through the Tax Code.\n  Mr. President, at the appropriate time, I intend to raise a point of \norder against this amendment. It is not germane. If the proponents of \nthe amendment move to waive my point of order, I hope my colleagues \nwill vote no on the motion to waive.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to summarize and make sure \nthat any opposition to my amendment has had an opportunity to speak. \nWhen they are finished, I would like to make concluding comments, if I \nmight.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I can't promise that. If we have time \nleft, we will use it. It is there now for the proponents to make their \ncase.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we have 2 \nminutes remaining on our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senator has 1 \nminute 31 seconds. The opponents have 7 minutes 38 seconds.\n  Who yields time?\n  If neither side yields time, time runs equally.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I would like to have an opportunity to \nsummarize my remarks. I ask that my opposition yield back the remainder \nof their time so I can summarize my comments.\n  Apparently, they don't want to do that. I will briefly make comments \nso that we can move along.\n  First of all, we heard many arguments about voting against the \nbalanced budget amendment. Those who voted against the balanced budget \namendment said that we should not tie down the hands of the Senate, the \nSenate should have the discipline in order not to go into deficit \nspending. My argument has been that the Senate--I have always supported \nit because I never felt the Senate, although well-intentioned, would \never allow that to happen. We are asking for a simple amendment to pay \ndown the debt, and one of the arguments made against this is that it \nmay raise a point of order if the Senate goes into deficit spending. \nMost of us, I think, in this Chamber agree that we should not have \ndeficit spending. So it points out again how very important it is to \nhave these types of plans before us if we really are serious about \neliminating deficit spending and pay down the debt. If we want a secure \neconomy and we want to make sure that our children and grandchildren \nhave a secure future and we want to continue to see economic growth, \nthe way we do that is to make a commitment to pay down the debt. So I \nam here to ask for an aye vote on the Allard amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the pending amendment is not germane \nand I, therefore, raise a point of order that the amendment violates \nsection 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  Is the time available all on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Having made the point of order, all time has \nelapsed.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, if the Senator from Colorado is not \ngoing to move to waive, I will.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I was going to do that, but the chairman can do it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to waive the Budget Act, and I \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2195\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2195.\n  Mr. President, I want to point out that we have the following \ncosponsors on our amendment. They include Senators Daschle, Kerry, \nBaucus, Bingaman, Boxer, Graham, Moynihan, Leahy, Reid, Wyden, \nLieberman, and Murray.\n  Mr. President, this amendment would establish a reserve fund that \nwould allocate funding from a reinstated Superfund tax on polluters for \nseveral important environmental initiatives.\n  Mr. President, President Clinton has made environmental protection a \ntop priority. And the American people agree with that. Americans feel \nstrongly about the need to keep our water and air clean, and our \nnational parks well maintained. And, in my view, they're right.\n  The President has urged that several related environmental \ninitiatives be funded by reinstating the Superfund tax on polluters. \nBut the resolution before us largely rejects this approach. It does \nallow for spending up to $200 million next year from this tax, if it is \nreinstated, and if the reinstatement is part of broader Superfund \nreauthorization legislation.\n  However, the Superfund tax raises $1.7 billion per year. And the \nResolution would allow the extra $1.5 billion per year to be used for \npurposes that have nothing to do with environmental protection.\n  By contrast, my amendment would use these environmental taxes for \nenvironmental objectives.\n  My proposal largely incorporates the President's Environmental \nResources Fund for America, as proposed in his budget.\n  Under the proposal, revenue from a reinstated Superfund tax could be \nused for a variety of environmental priorities. These include, but are \nnot limited to the following: cleanup of hazardous waste sites; clean \nwater initiatives to assist states in protecting waterways from \npolluted runoff; construction and maintenance for our deteriorating \nnational parks, forests, refuges, public lands and tribal schools; and \npurchases of valuable natural resources through the Land and Water \nConservation Fund.\n  The funding for hazardous waste cleanup would increase the Superfund \nbudget by 40%. This would double the pace of cleanups, bringing the \ntotal number of cleanups to 900 by the end of 2001.\n  Let me be clear, also, that this amendment does not raid the \nSuperfund program to pay for other initiatives. Under the amendment, we \nwould still appropriate more money for hazardous waste cleanup than is \ncollected from the Superfund tax, as has been our practice in the past.\n  Mr. President, let me take a moment to highlight the Clean Water and \nWatershed Restoration Initiative. Today, the major source of pollution \nof our rivers, lakes and other sources of drinking water is not \nindustry, and it's not municipal sewage treatment plants. It's polluted \nrunoff from our cities and farms.\n  This program would provide funds--not to increase the federal \nbureaucracy--but to aid states and localities in their efforts to \naddress this problem.\n  Mr. President, I want to emphasize that this amendment would not \nincrease the deficit or reduce a surplus by one penny. It's entirely \ndeficit neutral.\n  I would also note that the amendment is broad enough to allow the \nappropriate committees to make the specific decisions about where this \nadditional $1.5 billion per year would be spent. The amendment does not \nlimit the committees to the particular proposals in the President's \nbudget. Rather, it allows them flexibility to shape programs based on \ntheir needs and priorities when the Superfund tax is passed.\n  I would note that the amendment is supported by the League of \nConservation Voters, the Natural Resources Defense Council and the \nAmerican Planning Association.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, the American people want us to protect \nthe environment and to protect our investments in our national parks, \nrefuges and forests. This amendment could go a long way toward meeting \nthese goals in a deficit-neutral manner. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport it.\n  We have a letter from the Council on Environmental Quality responding \nto our request for administration views on the proposed amendment.\n\n\n[[Page S2959]]\n\n\n       Please be assured that the Administration strongly supports \n     your efforts to secure adequate funding for pressing \n     environmental challenges facing this country.\n\n  I submit that and the letter from the League of Conservation Voters, \nas well as a letter signed by 44 environmental groups.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Council on \n           Environmental Quality,\n                                    Washington, DC, April 1, 1998.\n     Hon. Frank Lautenberg,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Budget, U.S. Senate, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: I am writing in response to your \n     request for the Administration's views on your proposed \n     amendment to the Senate budget resolution. Please be assured \n     that the Administration strongly supports your efforts to \n     secure adequate funding for pressing environmental challenges \n     facing this country.\n       As you are well aware, the President's Fiscal Year 1999 \n     budget proposes significant investments to protect our \n     environment and public health. It would accelerate Superfund \n     cleanups, provide new resources for the President's Clean \n     Water Action Plan, and continue our efforts to restore and \n     protect our national parks and other public lands.\n       Despite your efforts in the Budget Committee, however, the \n     resolution now before the Senate fails to provide adequate \n     funds for each of these priorities. The effect of the \n     resolution would be quite serious. It would jeopardize public \n     health by delaying cleanup of Superfund sites in communities \n     across the country. It would significantly limit nationwide \n     efforts to curb polluted runoff, the largest remaining threat \n     to the health of our lakes, rivers and coastal waters. And it \n     would hamper our ability to repair deteriorating \n     infrastructure at national parks and other facilities, posing \n     a threat to the health and safety of visitors and workers.\n       Your proposed amendment to correct these deficiencies by \n     securing $1.7 billion in Fiscal Year 1999 and a total of $7.4 \n     billion over five years is consistent with the \n     Administration's budget request. Furthermore, it is important \n     to note that your amendment is budget-neutral because it \n     would ensure that reinstatement of the Superfund tax is \n     committed to these environmental priorities.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises me that this \n     letter is consistent with the President's program.\n       I greatly appreciate your effort to ensure that these vital \n     environmental priorities are met.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Kathleen A. McGinty,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                League of Conservation Voters,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 30, 1998.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Re  Senate Concurrent Resolution 86, Supporting the \n         Lautenberg amendment to fund environment and national \n         resource protection.\n\n       Dear Senator: The League of Conservation Voters is the \n     bipartisan, political arm of the national environmental \n     movement. Each year, LCV publishes the National Environmental \n     Scorecard, which details the voting records of Members of \n     Congress on environmental legislation. The Scorecard is \n     distributed to LCV members, concerned voters nationwide and \n     the press.\n       Last year's balanced budget agreement contemplated \n     decreasing spending every year until at least 2003 for \n     natural resources and environmental programs. The American \n     public has made clear that clean water, our public lands, \n     fisheries and wildlife management, and other environmental \n     programs require a higher priority than was reflected in this \n     agreement.\n       During consideration of the Budget Resolution, S. Con. Res. \n     86, LCV urges you to support an amendment by Senator \n     Lautenberg (D-NJ) that would restore funding for critical \n     environment and natural resource programs that were proposed \n     in the President's budget but omitted from the Resolution. \n     This amendment would address the following crucial \n     environmental initiatives.\n       The Clear Water Action Plan, which will provide increased \n     resources to states, tribes and individuals in order to \n     address polluted runoff from urban areas, agriculture, mining \n     and other sources.\n       A continuation of funding for the Drinking Water and Clean \n     Water State Revolving Loan Funds which will help to ensure \n     that our drinking water and wastewater treatment \n     infrastructure can meet water quality and public health needs \n     for the next century.\n       The Land, Water and Facility Restoration Initiative, which \n     provide increased funding for ``Safe Visits to Public Lands'' \n     and ``Supporting the Land and Water Conservation Fund \n     Vision''.\n       An increase in funding to continue progress in cleanups at \n     Superfund sites around the nation, where many communities \n     have been waiting for over a decade to have toxic and \n     hazardous sites restored to safety.\n       In addition, LCV urges you to support any amendments to \n     address the following:\n       We understand that an amendment may be offered to reduce or \n     eliminate the existing tax subsidy for mining on public and \n     patented lands--known as the percentage depletion allowance.\n       The Budget Resolution assumes that landowner incentives \n     programs for endangered species would be funded from the \n     proceeds of the sale of public lands under the Interior \n     Department's Bureau of Land Management. This proposal would \n     set an unacceptable precedent regarding the sale of public \n     lands and would fail to provide a sustainable, long-term \n     revenue mechanism for endangered species protection.\n       America's land, water, fish, wildlife and plants are \n     irreplaceable natural assets that belong to, and benefit, our \n     entire nation; their protection and stewardship warrant the \n     modest increase in funding that Senator Lautenberg's \n     amendment would allow. LCV's Political Advisory Committee \n     will consider including votes on S. Con. Res. 86 in compiling \n     LCV's 1998 Scorecard. Thank you for your consideration of \n     this issue. If you need more information please call Paul \n     Brotherton in my office at 202/785-8683.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Deb Callahan,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   March 27, 1998.\n\n   Support the Lautenberg Amendment to Fund Environment and Natural \n                               Resources\n\n     Attention: Environmental LA.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the undersigned organizations, \n     we strongly urge your support for the amendment to the Budget \n     Resolution, S. Con. Res. 86, that will be offered by Senator \n     Lautenberg during Floor consideration. Senator Lautenberg's \n     amendment would provide funding for critical environment and \n     natural resource programs proposed in the President's budget. \n     America's land, water, fish, wildlife, and plants are \n     irreplaceable natural assets that belong to, and benefit, our \n     entire nation; their protection and stewardship warrant the \n     modest investment of funds that will be provided by Senator \n     Lautenberg's amendment.\n       Some of these crucial environmental initiatives fall under \n     the President's proposed Environmental Resources Fund for \n     America and include:\n       The ``Clean Water Action Plan'', which will provide \n     increased resources (a total of $568 Million for this multi-\n     agency initiative) to States, tribes and individuals in order \n     to address polluted runoff from urban areas, agriculture, \n     mining and other sources. Polluted runoff is the single \n     biggest cause of water quality impairment in the nation \n     today. The ``Clean Water Action Plan'' will help to reduce \n     its impacts through improved coordination among different \n     levels of government and through increased spending to help \n     farmers and other individuals improve their water quality \n     management practices.\n       A continuation of funding for the Drinking Water and Clean \n     Water State Revolving Loan Funds (a total of $1.875 Billion \n     for both) which will help to ensure that our drinking water \n     and wastewater treatment infrastructure can meet water \n     quality and public health needs for the next century.\n       The ``Land, Water and Facility Restoration Initiative'', \n     which provides increased funding for ``Safe Visits to Public \n     Lands'' and supports the ``Land and Water Conservation Fund \n     (LWCF) Vision''. ``Safe Visits to Public Lands'' would begin \n     to address the critical multi-billion dollar maintenance \n     backlog on our public lands by providing a $92 Million (eight \n     percent) increase in funding to repair and refurbish the \n     aging infrastructure in our national parks, forests, wildlife \n     refuges and other public lands. Supporting the ``LWCF \n     Vision'' would provide a 43% increase in LWCF spending over \n     the next five years to continue acquisition and permanent \n     protection of key land, water, and open space resources for \n     future generations. Even this modest increase still falls far \n     below the level of $900 Million authorized yearly for LWCF.\n       An increase in funding to continue progress in cleanups at \n     Superfund sites around the nation, where many communities \n     have been waiting for over a decade to have toxic and \n     hazardous sites restored to safety. The Environmental \n     Resources Fund for America proposes $2.1 Billion in spending, \n     which would be a forty percent increase over 1998.\n       In addition, the Senate Budget Resolution does not include \n     crucial FY99 increases requested for the Fish and Wildlife \n     Service (FWS). The Lautenberg amendment would provide funding \n     for these increases including:\n       An increase in funding for Enhancing Endangered Species Act \n     (ESA) Efforts. In the last five years, the number of listed \n     U.S. species has doubled and a growing number of species \n     require management to survive. The requested increase will \n     allow the FWS to carry out necessary activities to conserve \n     species, to provide more efficient implementation for \n     regulated interests, and to offer new incentives for private \n     landowners. The FY99 increase for FWS is $38.8 million.\n       An increase in funding for FWS National Wildlife Refuge \n     System Operations. The nearly 93 million acre National \n     Wildlife Refuge System is the only federal public lands \n     system dedicated primarily to the conservation of fish and \n     wildlife; yet chronic and severe funding shortfalls threaten \n     its mission. The requested $15 Million increase for FY99 \n     would take a small step in addressing the current $410 \n     Million shortfall in operating needs.\n       Last year's balanced budget agreement contemplated \n     decreasing spending every year until at least 2003 for \n     natural resources\n\n[[Page S2960]]\n\n     and environmental programs. The American public has made \n     clear that clean water, stewardship of our public lands, \n     fisheries and wildlife management, and other environmental \n     programs require a higher priority than was reflected in this \n     agreement. At the same time, we would be happy to work with \n     the Senate to weed out environmentally destructive spending \n     that would more than pay for the funding increases reflected \n     in the Lautenberg amendment to fund environment and natural \n     resources.\n       A `yes' vote on the Lautenberg Amendment will send a clear \n     signal of your support for protection of the environment and \n     public health, and in particular for clean water, vibrant \n     public lands, and protection of species and habitat.

But while it has done a good job of controlling \n     pollution from so-called ``point sources'' like factories and \n     waste treatment plants, the act has failed to stem poisonous \n     runoff from ``non-point'' sources like farms and city \n     streets. This runoff is the main reason why nearly 40 percent \n     of the nation's lakes and streams remain unfishable and \n     unswimmable.\n       The Clinton Administration has now offered a strategy to \n     remedy this flaw. Given the hostility of this Congress to new \n     environmental legislation, the President has chosen to attack \n     the problem with a series of administrative actions by the \n     Environmental Protection Agency, the Interior Department and \n     other agencies. But Congress will be asked to provide about \n     $2.4 billion in new money over five years to make the plan \n     work. We urge it to do so. This is a modest, common-sense \n     strategy that merits bipartisan support.\n       For the first time, the plan would establish enforceable \n     limits on runoffs of nitrogen and phosphorus--two destructive \n     nutrients found in fertilizers, sewage and animal wastes. At \n     the same time, Washington would make available hundreds of \n     millions of dollars to states and individual landowners to \n     pay for setting aside land for stream buffers that prevent \n     the nutrients from entering the water in the first place. \n     These nutrients have been linked not only to outbreaks of \n     Pfiesteria piscicida, a fish-killing microbe, in Maryland and \n     North Carolina, but also to the 6,000-square-mile ``dead \n     zone'' of oxygen-depleted water in the Gulf of Mexico.\n       The plan would also impose new restrictions on huge \n     corporate farming operations that generate mountains of waste \n     that are typically stored in ``lagoons'' the size of several \n     football fields. These gigantic pits, which sometimes \n     overflow during rainstorms, would be regarded as ``point \n     sources'' subject to regular inspections and, when violations \n     occur, heavy fines.\n       Another ambitious element of the plan seeks to add 100,000 \n     acres a year to the nation's declining inventory of valuable \n     wetlands. To do so, however, the Administration must win the \n     cooperation of the Army Corps of Engineers, which oversees \n     wetlands policy and has been parceling out the land bit by \n     bit to developers. One of the more attractive features of the \n     Clinton strategy is that it promises to involve every Federal \n     agency in the fight for cleaner water. Without the corps, the \n     strategy will be incomplete.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [The Washington Post, March 3, 1998]\n\n                      The President on Clean Water\n\n       The Country's leading water pollution problem is no longer \n     the industrial and municipal waste that flows from particular \n     pipes but the elusive agricultural and urban runoff that \n     accumulates across entire watersheds. The Clean Water Act \n     provides only indirect authority to deal with it, and the \n     current Congress is hardly likely to strengthen the relevant \n     provisions. In the last Congress, House Republicans tried \n     instead to weaken them. The clean-water initiative the \n     president announced the other day is thus an effort to make \n     the most of a limited arsenal. Within those limits, it does a \n     reasonable job.\n       The government will use existing authority to set new \n     standards for nutrients in lakes, streams and estuaries--the \n     nitrogen and phosphorus that are byproducts of agricultural \n     operations especially. Excessive amounts do harm. The states \n     are then meant to apply the standards to water within their \n     jurisdiction, and to draw up plans to reduce them where \n     required. If the plans are too weak, the Environmental \n     Protection Agency can disapprove them, but it lacks the power \n     to enforce them except indirectly if the states default. The \n     administration seeks to fill the enforcement hole with \n     financial inducements both to the states and to farmers to \n     reduce the spread of the pollutants. It has assembled a \n     fairly impressive package of money, much of it from existing \n     programs. Some of the largest are in the Agriculture \n     Department, including the mighty Conservation Reserve Program \n     which each year pays farmers to idle vast amounts of \n     vulnerable land across the country and now supports such \n     things as water quality projects as well.\n       Watersheds extend across state boundaries, and the \n     president's initiative includes some fuzzy talk about the \n     need for interstate cooperation. Among much else, a program \n     embracing an entire watershed can liberate states from the \n     fear that if they take strong action, neighboring states may \n     use weaker environmental standards to lure away industry. \n     That's part of the argument that Congess has ignored for a \n     stronger federal law. The administration uses what it has--\n     mostly words and a little money--to push in this useful \n     direction.\n       The initiative also promises, again a bit fuzzily, to \n     convert the current annual loss of wetlands across the \n     country into a net gain within a few years. Exactly how is \n     left unclear. The last time anyone looked, the Corps of \n     Engineers was proposing to ease the rules under which \n     developers and others are allowed to invade wetlands. This \n     would mark a more aggressive policy, if it occurs. Likewise, \n     there is a promise to do a better job of managing the \n     government's own lands. Because the government is such a \n     large landowner, this would be important.\n       This administration generally has pushed in the right \n     directions on environmental issues. But its penchant for show \n     over substance--this report trumpets ``more than 100 major \n     new actions''--often gets the best of it. Many of these are \n     neither major steps nor new. We hope they take them anyway.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, in conclusion, the American people \nwant to protect the environment and to protect our investments in our \nnational parks and refuges and forests. This amendment could go a long \nway toward meeting these goals in a deficit-neutral manner.\n\n[[Page S2961]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the proposal by \nthe distinguished Senator from New Jersey.\n  At the appropriate time I will raise a point of order.\n  First, let me say that this proposal exceeds the spending caps set in \nthe balanced budget amendment by $600 million in budget authority, and \n$900 million in outlays.\n  The budget before us assumes $1 billion in additional spending over 5 \nyears of the Superfund as originally agreed upon in the balanced budget \namendment.\n  The budget resolution provides $1.4 billion in budget authority, and \n$1.3 billion in outlays to fund critical construction programs within \nthe Corps of Engineers rejecting the proposal of the President to cut \nit 47.4 percent.\n  It fully funds the President's request for National Park Service \noperations at $1.3 billion; $1.2 billion in outlays. It fully funds the \nPresident's request for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, NOAA, with $2.3 billion in budget authority; $2.19 \nbillion in expected expenditures.\n  It assumes funding for the Landowner Incentives Program of the \npending Endangered Species Recovery Act, a step forward for both the \nenvironmental community and private owners and protecting the Nation's \nendangered species.\n  It rejects the President's proposed reductions in the Environmental \nProtection Agency and tribal assistance grant funds; $2.7 billion above \nthe President's budget over 5 years for clean water, drinking water, \nand targeted wastewater funds.\n  It provides $1.1 billion more in budget authority over 5 years than \nthe alternative that was provided in the committee by the minority.\n  Frankly, when all of that is said and done, this is another one of \nthese funds that is set up. The money that is going to be needed to do \nall the things that Senator Lautenberg contends should be done is not \nprovided for, nor are cuts in programs provided for that would go into \nthe fund.\n  I guess while it sounds good, I firmly believe that it will never \nreally happen.\n  But, in all events, it is not germane. I will make that point of \norder as soon as time is available.\n  I yield any additional time that I may have.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, there is no additional spending that \nis provided for by virtue of the Superfund tax. These are not \nentitlements. We are talking now about direct appropriations. If the \nfunds aren't there obviously out of this fund, out of this reserve \nfund, if money doesn't come in, it can't be spent. There were programs \ndeveloped by the Environment and Public Works Committee. I assume the \nSenator is aware that we have finished a Superfund reauthorization bill \nout of the committee. I didn't support it. But it is due to come to the \nfloor sometime after our recess. The committee has mandatory spending \nauthority for minimum allocation for ISTEA, the orphans' share funding \nfor Superfund, and funding for landowner incentives under the proposed \nEndangered Species Act. Under current law the committee has mandatory \nspending authority for the Wallop-Breaux Sports Fishery Act and other \nlegislation.\n\n  So this isn't a casual proposal. It is going to be paid for by taxes \nthat accrue to the Superfund reserve fund. It will be used for \nenvironmental purposes. That is what we are talking about. It is fairly \nsimple. We offer the amendment, and we are ready to have it processed \nand hope that our colleagues will vote for it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I make a point of order that the pending \namendment violates the Budget Act and is not germane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Until the time has been used or yielded, a \npoint of order is not in order.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield all time back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I make a point of order, as I previously indicated, \nthat it violates the Budget Act and is not germane.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to waive the point of order, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays on my motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2213, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I call up the Bond-Mikulski amendment, \nas modified.\n  Mr. President, Senator Bond has argued this at length here on the \nfloor of the Senate during the pendency of this budget resolution, and \ndoes not desire any time tonight.\n  I would merely indicate that amendment No. 2213, as modified, opposes \nthe President's proposed reduction in elderly housing by expressing the \nsense of the Senate that the budget resolution levels for elderly \nhousing programs shall be funded between 1999 and 2003 at no less than \nthe 1998 level of $645 million dollars.\n  I yield any time that Senator Bond might have with reference to his \namendment.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We have no comment. We yield any time that we have in \nresponse.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for the yeas and nays on the Bond amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2205\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

I appreciate the cooperation of the Chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, Mr. Domenici, in working with me on this matter. My purpose \nin offering the original amendment in Committee was truth in budgeting. \nThe truth I am seeking has been masked by inflation. With inflation \nbeing lower than anticipated, the CBO and GAO estimate there is as much \nas a $3 billion inflationary windfall surplus in the budget for 1999, \nand as much as a $26 billion surplus over the next five years. My \nconcern is the American taxpayer never sees this inflationary windfall \nand probably doesn't even know it exists. The money is not accounted \nfor by the agencies and is not returned to the taxpayer. Unfortunately, \nthe windfall appears to end up as walk-around money in the pockets of \nbureaucrats. That is why I am pleased that together with the Chairman \nof the Budget Committee we will request the General Accounting Office \nto tell Congress by May 15 the exact amount of the inflationary \nwindfall for FY99, how the agencies intend to use the inflationary \nwindfall and how CBO can go about making this calculation for future \nyears. Our request will also direct the GAO by August 15 to develop for \nus a methodology for correctly calculating inflationary estimates that \nis applicable to both defense and non-defense spending and how the \nagencies expect to use the additional funds. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave printed in the record the GAO's chart for FY99 Economic \nAdjustments as well as the CBO's March 24, 1998 letter to me on the \ninflationary windfall.\n  There being no objection, the material is ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 24, 1998.\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: At your request, the Congressional Budget \n     Office (CBO) has estimated adjustments to budget authority \n     for defense programs, as allocated under last year's budget \n     resolution for the 1999-2002 period, that would preserve its \n     implied purchasing power for nonsalary expenses given the \n     changes in CBO's estimates of inflation. Specifically, you \n     asked us to adjust the year-by-year amounts in the budget \n     resolution using actual inflation during 1997 and new \n     estimates of inflation for the 1998-2002 period.\n       Last year's budget resolution called for defense budget \n     authority of $271.5 billion for 1999 and $289.6 billion for \n     2002. A year ago, CBO projected that the chain-type price \n     index for the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) would grow by an \n     average of 2.5 percent a year during the 1997-2002 period. \n     CBO currently projects that annual inflation, as measured by \n     the GDP index, will grow by an average of 2.2 percent over \n     that six-year period. Thus, the budget authority in last \n     year's budget resolution could be reduced and still maintain \n     the same inflation-adjusted levels.\n       Under its current inflation projection, CBO estimates that \n     lowering last year's budget resolution for defense \n     appropriations by $1.7 billion in 1999 and $9.8 billion over \n     the 1999-2002 period would provide about the same level of \n     real resources for nonsalary purchases as assumed a year ago \n     for that period. Similarly, we also calculated adjustments \n     for 2003 given the assumptions specified in your request. If \n     last year's defense budget authority for 2003 was pegged at \n     $297.8 billion, reducing that figure by $3.5 billion would \n     maintain the purchasing power for nonsalary expenses. The \n     enclosed table shows the adjustments to budget authority and \n     the corresponding changes in outlays for the five-year \n     period.\n       CBO does not attempt to forecast the prices of defense-\n     related goods and services. Instead, we follow the common \n     practice of using a general measure of inflation--The GDP \n     price index--to adjust purchasing power. The lower growth in \n     our inflation forecast stems from an unexpectedly rapid \n     decline in import and computer prices and slower growth in \n     medical care prices.

Mr. President, I share the Senator's concern about this \nissue. It is correct that when inflation increases less than projected, \nthe buying power of a dollar increases. According to CBO, inflation \nprojections for the National Defense Budget Function for 1999 through \n2003 have decreased from the 2.6 percent of the GDP Price Index \nprojected last year to rates varying from 2.2 percent to 2.4 percent. \nThis translates into a 1999 inflation ``dividend'' for National Defense \nof $1.7 billion in budget authority and $0.8 billion in outlays. For \n1999-2003, the amounts are $13.2 billion in budget authority and $10.3 \nbillion in outlays.\n  The Department of Defense reports to us that it has already \nreinvested this dividend in other defense programs. Therefore, taking \nthis money out of the 050 budget this year will cause real program \nreductions, and I would strongly oppose that. However, DoD does not \nroutinely report these budgetary data to Congress, and I agree that it \nis important for us to have the data for oversight purposes. I also \nagree it would be useful to have similar data for both defense and \nnondefense purchases.\n  I am concerned, however, that an appropriate methodology needs to be \ndeveloped that is applicable to both defense and nondefense agencies. I \nam also concerned that we collect information from each major agency \nand analyze what they do with the additional funds, when such \n``dividends'' are generated. Also, I would argue that when inflation is \nincreasing faster than projected, we need to know from the Department \nof Defense and others what constraints this imposes on purchases.\n  I believe the appropriate agency to develop the methodology and to \nperform the agency-by-agency research is the General Accounting Office. \nOnce appropriate methodologies have been developed for making estimates \nof economic changes, we could ask CBO and GAO to perform further \nresearch.\n  I am happy to work with the Senator from Oregon on this issue, and I \nwill gladly join with him to request the GAO to perform the needed \nwork. I look forward to starting this research in a timely fashion and \nmaking it a part of the information we use to exercise our oversight.\n  Mr. President, I ask that Senator Wyden's amendment, No. 2203, be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2203) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2226\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I want to go on record today in support \nof the amendment to the Fiscal Year 1999 Budget Resolution offered by \nthe Ranking Member of the Veterans Affairs Committee, Senator \nRockefeller.\n  Mr. President, since the VA was founded, we have fought a World War, \na Cold War and a Gulf War. From the World Wars to Korea, Vietnam to the \nPersian Gulf, each conflict produced a new generation of veterans with \nunique needs.\n  The particular needs may vary somewhat for veterans of different \neras, but one thing should never change - the commitment that we make \nto our veterans.\n  Our veterans entered into a covenant with this nation when they \nagreed to risk their lives for our freedom.\n  We must ensure that promises made must be promises kept. Our veterans \nmust receive quality medical care, effective services and timely \nprocessing of benefits.\n  I have fought for many years, and continue to fight, to ensure that \nour veterans receive the medical care and benefits that they have \nearned.\n  Mr. President, our veterans didn't waiver when they put their lives \non the line. When they were fighting to defend our liberty, risking \ndeath to ensure that we could sleep easy at night, they didn't waiver.\n  Mr. President, we should not waiver on our veterans. The VA General \nCounsel issued a ruling in 1997 that veterans who develop illnesses \nlinked to nicotine dependence developed while in service were entitled \nto compensation benefits.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs, beginning in Fiscal Year 1998, is \ndue to begin paying those benefits. There is now a proposal before us \nto eliminate the VA's obligation to pay those benefits.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that by eliminating the \nbenefits, the government would save $10 billion.\n  Well, apparently that money was too attractive to resist, and is \nincluded in the Budget Resolution to offset ISTEA spending.\n  Mr. President, let me be clear. I support the much needed money that \nis going to provide critical infrastructure work throughout the \ncountry. And like many Senators, I am pleased to see federal support of \ntransportation spending in my home state of Maryland.\n  But Mr. President, our benefits for our veterans should not be traded \nand bartered. The funds that are due for our veterans must be \nprotected.\n  It is wrong to take money that is targeted for the benefits that our \nveterans have earned and use it for anything else - no matter how noble \nit may be.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Rockefeller \namendment and prevent the raiding of these veterans benefits.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from New \nMexico, the Chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Domenici, for the \nbudget resolution that he has brought to the Senate floor. It is not \nexactly as I would have written it--and my hope is that we will be able \nto make some improvements during the course of debate over the next few \ndays--but I believe it is generally on the right track and compares \nfavorably to the alternative budget submitted by President Clinton.\n  First and foremost, the Senate budget resolution would balance the \nunified budget and keep it in balance during each of the next five \nyears. We will even run a small surplus.\n  By comparison, President Clinton's budget appears to throw fiscal \ndiscipline out the window with proposals to spend billions of dollars \non new government programs. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, the Clinton budget would take us back into deficit as early as \nthe year 2000.\n  Second, the Senate budget would adhere to the spending limits that \nboth Congress and the President agreed to just last year. The Clinton \nplan, by contrast, would bust the spending caps outright--by $12 \nbillion in FY99, and a total of $68 billion over the next four years. I \nthink we ought to keep our word and stick to the spending limits, and \nwe do.\n\n[[Page S2964]]\n\n  Third, the Senate budget would reserve the anticipated surplus for \nSocial Security. The President said that is what he wanted, too, but he \nthen submitted a budget that would spend down the unified budget \nsurplus on myriad new government programs. And of course, he is asking \nus to spend every dime of the Social Security surplus on general \noperating expenses of the government.\n  Fourth, our budget would set aside any proceeds from a tobacco \nsettlement to shore up the Medicare trust fund for our nation's senior \ncitizens. The Clinton budget would spend all of the tobacco money on \nother programs.\n  And fifth, the Senate budget would accommodate another, albeit small, \ninstallment of tax relief for hard-working Americans. By comparison, \nPresident Clinton's budget would raise taxes yet again.\n  Mr. President, let me turn for a moment to the portion of the Senate \nbudget resolution that deals with education, training, and employment \nprograms, since that seems to be what we are hearing about most from \nthe other side. Last year's budget agreement made education, training, \nand employment a protected category and called for spending--outlays--\nof $61 billion next year. It called for a total of $318.3 billion over \nfive years.\n  Here is what President Clinton said about the level of education \nspending in the budget agreement when he signed off on it last year. \nThese are comments the President made on the South Lawn of the White \nHouse on July 29, 1997:\n\n       . . . at the heart of this balanced budget [agreement] is \n     the historic investment in education--the most significant \n     increase in education funding in more than 30 years.\n\n  He went on to call it ``the best education budget in a generation and \nthe best for future generations.'' The level of spending the President \nwas referring to then is exactly what is included in the Senate budget \nresolution that is before us today. It is the exact level.\n  What about health research? Over the next five years, spending at the \nNational Institutes of Health would increase substantially under the \nSenate budget. We are talking about an 11 percent increase in 1999, on \ntop of the seven percent increase provided in 1998. And we would \nprovide these additional funds within the overall spending limits, and \nregardless of whether a tobacco settlement is passed later this year.\n  By contrast, President Clinton would link increased NIH spending to \nthe fate of the tobacco settlement. That means that if there is no \nsettlement, there is no increase for the NIH either. I do not think \nthat is good enough. We should devote more to health research whether \nor not we are able to achieve a tobacco settlement, and we do that in \nour budget.\n  If there is any revenue derived from the tobacco settlement, we say \nthat it ought to go into the Medicare trust fund. And that is what this \nbudget resolution would do. We all know that Medicare's long-term \nsolvency is still tenuous at best. We ought to shore up the system \nbefore tapping new sources of revenue for a multitude of new government \nprograms.\n  So these are some of the things I think the Senate does better than \nthe alternatives. But, in my opinion, it still does not do enough to \nlimit the growth of federal spending. It is true that the committee-\nreported budget is within the spending caps that were set last year, \nbut those caps are still too high. The caps allow total spending to \ngrow from $1.73 trillion next year to $1.95 trillion in 2003. That will \namount to a nearly 13 percent increase at the end of the five-year \nperiod.\n  And it comes on top of the 25 percent increase in spending that has \noccurred in just the last five years. What does that mean for \ntaxpayers?\n  The Tax Foundation estimates that the median income family in America \nsaw its combined federal, state, and local tax bill climb to 38.2 \npercent of income last year--up from 37.3 percent the year before. That \nis more than the average family spends on food, clothing, and shelter \ncombined. Put another way, in too many families, one parent is working \nto put food on the table, while the other is working almost full time \njust to pay the bill for the government bureaucracy.\n\n  Here is a different way to measure how heavy the federal tax burden \nis. Consider that federal revenues this year will claim about 19.9 \npercent of the nation's income, the Gross Domestic Product. Next year, \nthat portion would climb to 20.1 percent, according to the \nadministration's projections. That would be higher than any year since \n1945. It would be only the third year in our nation's entire history \nthat revenues have exceeded 20 percent of national income--and the \nfirst two times, our economy tipped into recession.\n  So the question we need to ask is whether a balanced budget is the \nonly goal, even if it means we achieve balance at a level where taxes \nand spending are too high? Or is the real goal of a balanced budget to \nlimit government's size and give people more choices and more control \nover their lives?\n  For me, there is not great achievement in balancing the budget if it \nmeans that hard-working families continue to be overtaxed. There is no \ngreat achievement in a balanced budget if the government continues to \ngrow, even as it balances its books. If it is doing that, it is \ncontinuing to take choice and freedom away from its citizens. A \nbalanced budget is really the means of right-sizing the government so \nthat it is more respectful of hard-working taxpayers' earnings and \ntheir desire to support their own families.\n  With that in mind, I believe we have got to do much better in \nproviding tax relief. Currently, this budget calls for tax relief \namounting to $30 billion over the next five years. Although that may \ninitially sound like a lot, let me put it into perspective.\n  The federal government expects to collect nearly $9.3 trillion--that \nis, $9.3 trillion--over the next five years. So a tax cut of $30 \nbillion really amounts to just about 0.3 percent. It is too little. We \nmust find a way to do more. And the way to do more within the confines \nof a balanced budget is to reduce non-priority spending and limit \nspending growth.\n  At the very least, if we cannot provide more tax relief, we should at \nleast be able to agree that taxes are high enough and should go no \nhigher. I intend to offer an amendment to express the sense of the \nSenate that it should be harder to raise taxes--at least as hard to \nraise taxes as it is to cut them.\n  Recall that President Clinton's record-setting tax increase in 1993 \nfailed to win support from even a simple majority of elected Senators--\nVice President Gore's vote in favor broke a 50 to 50 tie. By contrast, \nit would have taken a supermajority vote to provide tax relief two \nyears later; President Clinton vetoed our tax-relief bill, and it would \nhave required a two-thirds vote--67 votes in the Senate--to overcome \nthe President's resistance and provide tax relief. That is wrong. A \nsupermajority vote to raise taxes would ensure that future tax \nincreases, if they are needed, are approved with broad bipartisan \nsupport in Congress and around the country.\n  Mr. President, I again want to commend the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee for his work on this measure. It is a good proposal, and I \nthink we have an opportunity during the next few days to make it even \nbetter.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, how much time remains on the budget \nresolution with the completion of work?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 4 hours 58 \nminutes, and the Senator from New Jersey has 4 hours 58 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, while we have a minute, I must once \nagain apologize to the pages, who work so hard, for keeping them out of \nschool tomorrow by working them past 10 o'clock. I am sorry, really.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. They seem very happy to be excused today.\n  We will keep you slightly later tonight.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PARKER\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to rise and take this opportunity to \nsay farewell to an outstanding Non-Commissioned Officer of the \nMississippi Army National Guard, First Sergeant Charles W. Parker, upon \nhis retirement. Throughout his military career, First Sergeant Parker \nserved the people of Mississippi with valor and distinction. It is my \nprivilege to recognize his many accomplishments and to commend him for \nthe superb service he has provided the Mississippi Army National Guard \nand the Nation for the past 32 years.\n  First Sergeant Parker enlisted in the Mississippi Army National Guard \nin August 1965, and served as a federal technician from October 1971, \nuntil February 1981. He then began an active duty career in the Guard \nas a Training Non-Commissioned Officer from February 1981, until his \nretirement in April 1998. He served the majority of his military career \nwith Company B, 223rd Engineer Combat Battalion, in Calhoun City, \nMississippi. During his 32 years of service, First Sergeant Parker was \nactivated three times to provide relief due to flooding, ice storms and \ntornadoes.\n  First Sergeant Parker served the Great State of Mississippi with \nhonor. He received the Army Meritorious Service Medal, Army \nCommendation Medal, Army Achievement Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal \n(4), Reserve Components Achievement Medal (5), Armed Forces Reserve \nMedal (3), National Defense Medal (2), Army Physical Fitness Award (14) \nand achieved the highest score in his company, battalion, group and \nbrigade on more than one occasion.\n  During his 32 years of military service, First Sergeant Parker led \nhis men selflessly by continuously putting his subordinate soldiers \nbefore himself. He is known by all throughout the State of Mississippi \nin National Guard circles for helping young people get into the Guard \nand continue their education.\n  Most importantly, First Sergeant Parker is also a loving husband and \nfather to his wife Sandra, sons Brent and Kent, daughter Vanessa. While \nhe missed valuable time away from his family during his military \ncareer, he must look forward to spending many wonderful years with them \nin retirement.\n  I know his family and the Mississippi Army National Guard are proud \nof his many accomplishments. My colleagues in the Senate join me in \nwishing First Sergeant Parker well upon his retirement. The Great State \nof Mississippi and the Nation are indebted to him for his many years of \ndistinguished service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/01/senate-section/article/S2965-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              BELLA ABZUG\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wanted to rise very briefly and share \nwith my colleagues the fact that a colleague who served in the House \nhas passed on to God's glory. I knew her as a very dear friend. \nCongresswoman Bella Abzug died yesterday of complications of heart \ndisease. I knew Mrs. Abzug as friend. I knew her as a wonderful \nCongresswoman. I want to state on the Senate floor how much she will be \nmissed.\n  Congresswoman Abzug fought for the rights of women. She fought for \ncivil rights. She fought for human rights. She was known as ``Battling \nBella.'' She had a very big heart and a very large agenda.\n  I cannot believe that she died of heart disease, because if there was \none fault that Bella did not have, it was heart problems. In fact, it \nwas her very big heart that wanted to be sure that women were fully \nincluded in our society and enjoyed equal protection under the law in \nthe Constitution. She wanted to be sure that she spoke out for the \nwomen of this country and that we also included everyone else who was \nleft out and left behind.\n  Also, when she left the Congress, she spoke very eloquently and added \nto her agenda the human rights of women and children all around the \nworld.\n  She will be deeply missed. Her hat stood there. You could always find \nBella in a crowd. But when the history books are searched, we will find \nthat Congresswoman Abzug is the indelible mark on the history of the \nUnited States of America for those who worked with her. She will be \ngreatly missed. But, most of all, she will be missed by the people she \nfought for and championed all of her life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/01/senate-section/article/S2965-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DOUBLE CHARGING FOR ATM USE\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO.

In that report they indicate that \ndouble chargers in 28 States and the District of Columbia have shown \nthat 71 percent of all banks today are double charging consumers for \nthe privilege of getting their own money out. That percentage is more \nthan twice the number reported by the General Accounting Office in May \nof 1997. So, more and more people have less and less opportunity to be \nable to withdraw their money without that double charge.\n  Going further, it says the price of the average double charging has \nalso risen to $1.23. Keep in mind this charge is on top of a fee that \nthe consumer already pays to his or her own bank. The survey found that \n83 percent of the banks charged their own customer an average of $1.18 \nper transaction whenever they use another ATM. So that means a consumer \npays $2.41, on average, every time they use an ATM that does not belong \nto their own bank.\n  So what we have, if a person uses an ATM six times a month --a \nrelatively small utilization--they can be paying an average of $173 a \nyear more. What an April Fool's joke on the people of America.\n  This situation is not going to get better; it is going to get worse. \nWhat a windfall for the large banks who are now making profits of over \n$3 billion a year by charging people twice to get their own money.\n  I am not going to say more about this except to say we will be voting \non this issue. Make no mistake about it, we will be voting. When that \namendment comes to the floor--and I will pick what I consider to be \nlegislation that must be acted on--there will be hoots and hollers, why \non this bill? But make no mistake about it, the people are entitled to \nknow where their representatives stand with respect to this issue.\n  To date we have 10 cosponsors, evenly divided between Democrats and \nRepublicans. I know the power and the pressure of those who oppose \nthis, but I think it is about time we began to look at the little guy, \nand I'm talking about the American taxpayer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/01/senate-section/article/S2965-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2965-S2966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES WILSON, III\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I wanted to let my Senate colleagues know of \nthe retirement of Lieutenant Colonel Charles Wilson, III, a truly \noutstanding soldier in the United States Army. Colonel Wilson is most \ndeserving of our attention. His career accomplishments reflect the type \nof military leader this nation was depended upon for two hundred years \nduring peace and war.\n  Colonel Wilson has distinguished himself throughout his 23-year \ncareer as a soldier and officer in the United States Army. A native of \nBowling Green, Kentucky, Charles began his service as a Military Police \nenlisted soldier in October 1969. As a young soldier, Charles's \nBattalion Commander recognized his special skills in leading and \nworking with fellow soldiers. He received responsibility for key \npositions in his company, earning promotion quickly.\n  Within his first year he was already selected for leadership \nresponsibility within his military police platoon. Colonel Wilson only \nserved as a military policeman for two years before he was honorably \ndischarged in September 1971, to pursue his college degree, which \nincluded studies as a Reserve Officer Training Corps cadet. During this\n\n[[Page S2966]]\n\nshort period of duty, Charles had earned the rank of sergeant. He \ngraduated from the University of Tennessee-Chattanooga and the ROTC \nprogram as a distinguished military graduate, and he was commissioned a \nSecond Lieutenant in the Infantry in May 1977. After graduation as an \nInfantry Lieutenant, he was assigned to Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. \nAgain, Charles' inherent leadership skills were soon recognized. As a \njunior Second Lieutenant, his Brigade Commander selected him to command \nBravo Company, 5th Battalion, 3rd Basic Training Brigade.\n  Because of his mature and talented leadership and his competence, the \nCommanding General later designated Charles' company as the first at \nFort Leonard Wood to integrate women trainees into the basic training \nprogram. His hard work and enthusiasm as a company commander ensured \nthat his unit successfully accomplished the challenging task.\n  Subsequent assignments found Lieutenant Colonel Wilson with \nincreasing amounts of responsibility to include duties as a Company \nCommander with 197th Separate Infantry Brigade, Fort Benning, Georgia; \nG3 for Operations and Plans, Schweinfurt Military Community, 3d \nInfantry Division, Germany; and Deputy Division Comptroller for the \n101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), at Fort Campbell, Kentucky.\n  In September 1990, Charles deployed with the ``Screaming Eagles'' to \nDesert Shield and Desert Storm. He was one of only five Combat \nComptrollers in the desert. His expertise in resource management and \ncontracting was invaluable. The Division's units and soldiers had the \nitems they needed to go to war and the items they needed to maintain \nquality of life at Camp Eagle, Saudi Arabia.\n  The Army reassigned Colonel Wilson in 1993 to the Pentagon to work in \nthe Inspections Division of the Office of the Inspector General and \nlater with the Army Budget Office as the ``point man'' for developing \nand validating the Army's cost of conducting contingency operations. \nHis current and final assignment has been as the Deputy Chief of the \nCongressional Budget Liaison Office, Army Budget Office. Through his \ntireless effort and positive ``can do'' personality, Wilson ensured \nthat soldiers were well represented on Capitol Hill.\n  Speaking for Kentucky and the nation, I wish to thank this \ndistinguished soldier, his wife Melissa, sons Jason, Andy and daughter \nKathryne, and to wish him continued success in future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/01/senate-section/article/S2965-4", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DEATH OF COLLEEN CLEARY-MYERS\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to offer tribute to the \nlate Ms. Colleen Cleary-Myers and to offer condolences to her family on \ntheir loss.\n  Mrs. Cleary-Myers was a beloved wife, daughter and mother. I describe \nher this way not only because it is true, but because, in a very \nliteral way, it was these ties to these people that helped to define \nher life. It is these ties which are her legacy.\n  Mrs. Cleary-Myers, only 30 years old, died of complications \nassociated with a rare form of leukemia called chronic myleogensis. \nWhen she learned she was suffering from this illness, she was joyfully \npregnant with her first child. Her husband, Michael, shared in this joy \nand grateful anticipation. In this way, she resembled most other young \nmothers. But unlike them, she was faced with a cruel choice: she could \nbe treated immediately and risk the life of her baby or she could delay \nchemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant, be treated after the child's \nbirth and be unable to have more children. When faced with this \ndilemma, she did a noble thing. She chose to postpone treatment and \nlooked forward to the birth of her son, Derek Vincent.\n  Upon learning the news, Mrs. Cleary-Myers' family resolved to support \nher in any way that they could. Two of her sisters were compatible \nmatches for the required bone marrow transplant and both were eager to \nassist her.\n  Tragically, Mrs. Cleary-Myers died on March 15th. While I join her \nfamily in mourning her untimely death, I also am uplifted by the \nexample and the standard she sets for all of us. Her example is the \nexample of unselfish love and the standard she sets of willing and \nuncomplaining sacrifice for the sake of another life is one to which we \ncan all aspire. Because this young woman knew, in an intimate way, a \nsimple truth: Every life is infinitely precious and valuable.\n  Too often, when confronted with an example of courage and sacrifice, \nwe tell ourselves that others are capable of , and perhaps called to, \nsuch behavior, but we, most surely, are not. I believe this conclusion \nis a mistake. The example of Mrs. Cleary-Myers, a young woman living \nhappily and without notoriety, reminds us that we are all capable of \nsuch gallantry and, in different ways, are called to it. Her son, Derek \nVincent, provides us with eloquent testimony that such gallantry can \nsometimes mean nothing less than the protection of life itself. May God \nbless her, her husband and little Derek Vincent.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/01/senate-section/article/S2966-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2966-S2967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FOOD STAMPS TO LEGAL IMMIGRANTS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the 1996 welfare law unfairly reduced \nSSI, Medicaid and food stamp benefits for legal immigrants. Food stamps \nalone were cut by $25 billion. No other program has been cut as deeply.\n  Last year, recognizing that these cuts were too extreme, Congress \nrestored SSI and Medicaid to many elderly and disabled immigrants. It's \ntime to finish the job and ensure that those whose Medicaid and SSI \nwere restored, do not go hungry. And we should do the same for children \nof legal immigrants.\n  Last week, the conferees on the Agricultural Research bill made a \ndown payment toward restoring food stamps for the needy legal \nimmigrants. The conference report on the bill includes $818 million for \nthis program. It is far less than the $2 billion proposed in the \nPresident's budget, and it covers a much smaller group of immigrants.\n  The conferees' proposal is a bipartisan effort. Both Republicans and \nDemocrats urged them to take this step as soon as possible.\n  Yet, the Republican leadership in the Senate is ignoring the urgent \nneed. The Republican budget does not include a single penny to restore \nfood stamps to immigrant children, refugees, Hmong veterans, or elderly \nand disabled legal immigrants, and the Republican leadership has \ndeclined to allow the Senate to pass on the Agricultural Research bill.\n  According to Department of Agriculture estimates, at least 935,000 \nlow-income legal immigrants lost their federal food stamps in 1997 as a \nresult of the 1996 welfare law. Nearly two-thirds are immigrant \nfamilies with children.\n  Many legal immigrants live in poverty and have great difficulty \nfeeding their families. In fact, according to the Department of \nAgriculture, the average legal immigrant denied food stamps has an \nincome equal to just 62 percent of the poverty line, or about $8,000 \nfor a family of three.\n  In addition, thousands of refugees who have applied for citizenship \ncould lose food stamps as they wait in the naturalization backlog for \ntheir applications to be processed if the 5 year limit on food stamps \nfor this group is not extended to 7 years.\n  The effects of these food stamps terminations is not limited to legal \nimmigrants. Their children born here are American citizens but they too \nare facing sharp reductions in their food stamps. Their children remain \neligible for food stamps themselves, but the removal of their parents \nfrom the program has meant that the food stamp benefits for their \nfamilies have been cut by 50 to 70 percent in many cases. 600,000 poor \nchildren who are American citizens live in families where food stamp \nbenefits have been reduced for this reason, resulting in less food for \nall family members, including the children.\n  The food stamp cut-off has hurt immigrant families, and it has also \nhurt state and local governments, who must fill the gap. As a result, \ngovernors and state legislatures have joined Congress to restore these \nfood stamp benefits. As Governor Bush of Texas said, ``Food stamps are \na federal program and the federal responsibility, but the federal \ngovernment is shirking its responsibility. The rules have changed \nunfairly and retroactively for those least able to help themselves.''\n  It is time for the Senate to act on the bill. It is unconscionable \nthat these benefits can continue to be denied.\n\n[[Page S2967]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/01/senate-section/article/S2966-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2966-S2967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FOOD STAMPS TO LEGAL IMMIGRANTS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

A bill to amend the Alcoholic Beverage Labeling Act of 1988 \nto improve a warning label requirement; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n               alcoholic beverage labeling act amendments\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce \na bill to amend the Alcoholic Beverage Labeling Act of 1988. Current \nlaw requires all containers of alcoholic beverages to display the \nfollowing warning on the label:\n\n       GOVERNMENT WARNING: (1) According to the Surgeon General, \n     women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy \n     because of the risk of birth defects. (2) Consumption of \n     alcoholic beverages impairs your ability to drive a car or \n     operate machinery, and may cause health problems.\n\n  For nine years this warning has made consumers aware of some of the \npotential dangers associated with the consumption of alcohol. While I \nam confident that this warning appropriately illustrates the hazards of \ndrinking during pregnancy and drinking and driving, I am concerned that \nit does not adequately describe the negative health effects associated \nwith drinking alcohol. There is no shortage of well-substantiated \ninformation about the detrimental health effects of drinking. Excessive \nconsumption of alcohol can raise the risk of stroke, heart disease, \nhigh blood pressure, certain cancers, malnutrition, cirrhosis of the \nliver, inflammation of the pancreas, and damage to the brain and heart. \nObviously, there are so many adverse consequences of excessive alcohol \nconsumption that it would be impossible to include them all on the face \nof a label. The bill I am introducing today, however, will warn \nconsumers of the dangers associated with moderate consumption of \nalcohol. I am concerned that citizens may not realize that even \nmoderate consumption of alcohol can put their health at risk. A recent \nstudy conducted by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and \nAlcoholism (NIAAA) indicates that there is an increased risk of breast \ncancer associated with moderate drinking. Specifically, there is a 40 \npercent increase in the risk of breast cancer associated with an \naverage intake of one drink per day, and a doubling of the risk of \nbreast cancer with an average consumption of three drinks per day. The \nNIAAA study also revealed that a moderate alcohol intake of about two \ndrinks per day can lead to an increase in blood pressure.\n  Mr. President, the use of alcoholic beverages, even in moderate \namounts, can have very serious health consequences that might \nultimately be fatal. The government has a legitimate and important role \nto play in helping to assure that Americans understand these dangers. \nThe legislation I am introducing today will supplement the current \nwarning on labels to inform consumers of the dangers of moderate \nalcohol consumption. Further, this legislation will require that the \nwarning label indicate that consumption of alcohol may lead to \nalcoholism. Alcohol has an addictive effect much like illegal drugs, \nand it is important that consumers are aware of this fact.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this critical \nlegislation and look forward to its speedy passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1894\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. LABELING REQUIREMENT.\n\n       Section 204(a) of the Alcoholic Beverage Labeling Act of \n     1988 (27 U.S.C. 215(a)) is amended by striking ``may cause \n     health problems'' and inserting ``may lead to alcoholism. (3) \n     Moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages may cause health \n     problems such as hypertension and breast cancer''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL:\n  S. 1896. A bill to transfer administrative jurisdiction over Land \nBetween the Lakes National Recreation Area to the Secretary of \nAgriculture; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n           the land between the lakes protection act of 1998\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President I have come to the floor today to \nintroduce a bill known as the Land Between the Lakes Protection Act. \nLand Between the Lakes is a national treasure that must be protected. \nIt is visited by more than 2 million tourists a year who enjoy its \nnatural beauty, whether by camping, fishing, hunting, or just taking a \nlong hike with the family.\n  That's why, after studying this issue for over a year, we have \ndrafted a bill to ensure that the LBL, which so many Kentuckians enjoy \ntoday, will be there for them--unchanged--tomorrow.\n  As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, my top priority \nhas been to provide LBL the money it needs to operate--including $6.9 \nmillion last year. I remain committed to providing that funding to \nensure that LBL remains a national treasure just like Mammoth Cave or \nDaniel Boone National Forest.\n  But because of TVA Chairman Craven Crowell's harmful and ill-\nconsidered request last year to zero-out LBL's funding, it may be that \nCongress will deny funding to TVA's non-power budget this year. Because \nof this reality, LBL needs a safety net. That's what this bill is--a \nsafety net.\n  If Congress decides to fund TVA then TVA will remain LBL's steward. \nIf TVA is denied funding, my bill will safely and seamlessly transition \nLBL to a less controversial steward without interrupting the myriad of \nrecreational activities that millions of visitors have come to enjoy \nevery year.\n  There may be some who want to gamble everything on TVA receiving its \nappropriation. But I believe LBL is far too precious for such an all or \nnothing gambit. That's why our bill provides for both contingencies.\n  Mr. President, let me take a moment to explain some of the provisions \nI have included in this legislation based on the input I have received \nfrom area residents, and those who enjoy LBL. The goal of this bill is \nto ensure that the day to day operations of LBL remain the same for its \nvisitors. Therefore, this bill codifies LBL's 1972 mission statement \nand ensures that the Forest Service continues to manage LBL for \nmultiple use with a focus on recreation, conservation and environmental \neducation.\n  This legislation also gives the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service the \nauthority\n\n[[Page S2969]]\n\nto assist the Forest Service in managing the wildlife populations and \neducating visitors on the unique species at LBL, with an emphasis on \nendangered species, like the American bald eagle. LBL is home to over \n100 eagles.\n  One of the most important aspects of this bill is the creation of a \n17-member citizen advisory board that will assist the Forest Service in \nestablishing a management plan at LBL. I believe this will ensure that \nLBL managers are more responsive to the local concerns about \ndevelopment at LBL. This will ensure that proposals like the ``Five \nConcepts'' proposed by TVA in 1995 will never be considered again.\n  We have given the authority to Federal, State and local officials to \nappoint the members to the board. While the board will represent a \nvariety of interests, I am confident that each will have the best \nintentions for LBL foremost in mind.\n  The Secretary will appoint 4 individuals, two from each state. The \nGovernors from Kentucky and Tennessee will each nominate two \nindividuals from their state. The Kentucky and Tennessee Fish and \nWildlife Commissioners will each nominate 1 person. The Land Between \nthe Lakes Association, which is a non-profit organization that operates \nthe gift shops, planetarium and welcome stations at LBL, will nominate \none individual. The County Judge Executives from each of the three \ncounties, which make up LBL will each nominate two individuals.\n  This bill also protects existing TVA payments to counties, and \nincreases federal payments in lieu of taxes. This will ensure that \ncounty schools and county services are not negatively impacted.\n  This bill creates a $5 million trust fund to be used for internships, \neducation grants, and regional economic and tourism promotion.\n  Finally, the bill also seeks to minimize any disruption to the \nemployees working at LBL. We have sought to ensure that all eligible \nbenefits provided to an employee will not be diminished or lost as a \nresult of transferring this facility. This bill also provides a \ngenerous severance package based on a previous downsizing package \noffered by TVA.\n  Mr. President, we are rapidly nearing the end of the fiscal year and \nwe need to ensure that this safety net is available if TVA doesn't \nreceive sufficient funding. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in the House and Senate, Republican and Democrat alike, \nputting aside politics and doing right by all those who treasure LBL.\n  Finally, I want to thank the hundreds of Kentuckians who have worked \nso closely with us in drafting this bill. I believe the plan we have \narrived at together will help secure LBL's future for a long, long \ntime.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1896\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require accurate billing by telecommunications \ncarriers with respect to the costs and fees resulting from the \nenactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                      THE CONSUMER protection act\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it took Congress a decade to forge \nconsensus necessary to pass the 1996 Telecommunication Act. This bold \nlaw was designed to promote competition in the dynamic \ntelecommunications industry, but such competition is to be balanced by \nmaintaining the commitment to universal service, a fundamental \nprinciple which has ensured affordable access to communications for \nevery American, especially those in rural areas.\n\n  I voted for this historic legislation because in my view it struck \nthe right balance.\n  I support competition, but I will insist on universal service.\n  And I will insist on time to fully implement the Act. This bold law \nseeks to move the $200 billion telecommunications industry to a more \ncompetitive market, but it will not happen overnight. President Clinton \nsigned this major legislation into law in February 1998, just two years \nago. This started the telecommunications industry on the path toward \ncompetition, but there have been some road blocks along the way with \nimplementation snags, mergers instead of competition, and excessive \nlitigation.\n  The current result, unfortunately, is confusion.\n  I do not want to reopen the Telecommunications Act, but I do want to \nrelieve the confusion among consumers who seem to be bearing the brunt \nof this transition. Today, I am introducing bipartisan legislation \ncalled the Consumer Protection Act to ensure ``truth in billing.'' I \nbelieve that consumers deserve to have the truth, the whole truth about \nchanges in billings.\n  As the telecommunications industry moves from a regulated, \nmonopolistic model into a more competitive model, we need to ensure \nthat consumers get the information they need to make wise decisions in \nselecting their telecommunications carriers. In a regulated market, the \nregulations are intended to protect consumers' interests. Under a more \ncompetitive model, we need to ensure that accurate information is \nprovided to consumers so they can protect themselves and use their \nability to choose in the market place.\n  This legislation is very simple. It directs the Federal \nCommunications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) \nto investigate billing practices, and report on the findings to \nCongress. If this investigation exposes misleading practices, we need \nto have disciplinary action to protect consumers.\n  If telecommunications companies choose to use line-items on phones \nbills, those companies must accurately report all regulatory actions, \nincluding how federal actions reduce costs, such as the $1.5 billion in \naccess reductions provided in July 1997.\n  This legislation ensures that telecommunications companies cannot \nselectively disclose only those pieces of information that are in the \ncompanies' interest. When federal actions bring rates down, consumers \nhave the right to know. As the industry makes the transition to a more \ncompetitive market, consumers deserve a full accounting so they can \nmake informed decisions when they choose their telecommunications \nprovider.\n  The Consumer Protection Act will ensure that consumers will see on \ntheir own bill how companies allocate savings resulting from \nderegulation of the industry, as companies are required to disclose how \nsavings are passed along to residential rates, small business rates and \nother customer payment\n\n[[Page S2974]]\n\nplans. This is not re-regulation. Nothing in this dictates how much \ncompanies can charge for their services. And nothing prevents companies \nfrom putting line items on bills. Those choices are still entirely at \nthe companies' discretion. This legislation simply requires them to \ntell the whole truth if they choose to put a line item on customers \nbills.\n  The legislation has a third provision that requires companies using a \nline-item on customer bills to file with the FCC all the revenue and \ncompany reports they now file with the Securities and Exchange \nCommission (SEC).\n  The idea behind this requirement is simple. Since we require \ncompanies to report their revenues to the SEC in order to protect \nstockholders, shouldn't we provide the same information to the FCC in \norder to protect consumers?\n  During this period of transition from a monopoly-based system to a \nmarket-based system, there will be some ups and downs. But we should \nact to minimize confusion and protect consumers as the new market \nevolves.\n  At the state level, public service commissions are beginning to take \nsteps to provide fuller, more accurate information to consumers. In \nJanuary of this year, New York Administrative Law Judge Eleanor Stein \nrecommended that telecommunications carriers be required to disclose \nfully, in bills of all classes of customers, the fee increases and fee \nreductions resulting from the enactment of the 1996 Telecommunications \nAct.\n  In February the National Association of Regulatory Utility \nCommissioners (NARUC) passed a resolution that clearly noted that line-\nitems are a business choice made by companies not a mandate from the \nfederal government. The NARUC resolution called on the FCC to take \naction to require interstate carriers to provide accurate customer \nnotice and the purpose of line-items.\n  Some state officials are taking action. NARUC is calling on the FCC \nto lead. Now Congress needs to end the confusion, and tell consumers \nthe truth.\n  I am proud that the Consumers Union supports this bipartisan \nlegislation. I welcome the support of my colleagues, Senator Snowe of \nMaine and Senator Kerrey of Nebraska.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1897\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Billing practices by telecommunications carriers may \n     not reflect accurately the cost or basis of the additional \n     telecommunications services and benefits that consumers \n     receive as a result of the enactment of the \n     Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-104) and other \n     Federal regulatory actions taken since the enactment of that \n     Act.\n       (2) Congress has never enacted a law with the intent of \n     permitting providers of telecommunications services to \n     misrepresent to customers the costs of providing services or \n     the services provided.\n       (3) Certain providers of telecommunications services have \n     established new, specific charges on customer bills commonly \n     known as ``line-item charges''.\n       (4) Certain providers of telecommunications services have \n     described such charges as ``Federal Universal Service Fees'' \n     or similar fees.\n       (5) Such charges have generated significant confusion among \n     customers regarding the nature of and scope of universal \n     service and of the fees associated with universal service.\n       (6) The State of New York is considering action to protect \n     consumers by requiring telecommunications carriers to \n     disclose fully in the bills of all classes of customers the \n     fee increases and fee reductions resulting from the enactment \n     of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and other regulatory \n     actions taken since the enactment of that Act.\n       (7) The National Association of Regulatory Utility \n     Commissioners adopted a resolution in February 1998 \n     supporting action by the Federal Communications Commission to \n     require interstate carriers to provide accurate customer \n     notice regarding the implementation and purpose of end user \n     charges.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to require the \n     Federal Communications Commission and the Federal Trade \n     Commission to protect consumers of telecommunications \n     services by assuring accurate cost reporting and billing \n     practices by telecommunications carriers nationwide.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill entitled ``Chippewa Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's \nReservation Indian Reserved Water Rights Settlement Act of 1998''; to \nthe Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\nTHE CHIPPEWA CREE TRIBE OF THE ROCKY BOY'S RESERVATION INDIAN RESERVED \n                  WATER RIGHTS SETTLEMENT ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Chippewa \nCree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's Reservation Indian Reserved Water Rights \nSettlement Act of 1998'' along with my colleague Senator Burns.\n  This bill represents the culmination of sixteen years of intensive \ntechnical studies and six years of negotiations involving the Chippewa \nCree Tribe, the State of Montana, local governments, water districts \nand ranchers as well as the United States Departments of justice and \nInterior.\n  The 108,000 acre Rocky Boy's Reservation is located west of Havre, \nMontana in the Bears Paw Mountains with portions extending onto the \nplains between the mountains and the Milk River in north-central \nMontana. Historically, the area was part of the large territory north \nof the Missouri and Musselshell Rivers designated for the Blackfeet \nNation in the treaty of 1855.\n  In 1880 the Fort Assiniboine military reservation was established. In \n1916 Congress set aside 56,035 acres for the Chippewa and Cree Bands of \nChief Rocky Boy. In 1947 it was expanded by 45,523 acres bringing it to \nnear its current size. None of the land has been allotted although some \nindividual assignments have been made.\n  The reservation is home to over 3,000 tribal members and has an \nannual population growth exceeding 3%. While unemployment is estimated \nat nearly 70% the tribe has made important progress in economic \ndevelopment. Production of cattle and grain, development of timber and \ntourism provide solid sources of tribal income.\n  The reservation is located in an area of scarce water supply. Studies \nhave demonstrated that the reservation could not sustain tribal \nmembership without additional supplies of water for drinking, \nagricultural and municipal purposes.\n  Since 1992, the tribe, state and federal government have worked hard \nto reach an equitable water rights settlement.\n  The tribe and state reached tentative agreement on the compact in \nJanuary 1997. The tribal Council passed a resolution supporting \nratification of the agreement shortly thereafter. In the spring of \n1997, the Montana State Senate unanimously ratified the compact and the \nState House gave its approval on a 91-9 vote. It was signed into law by \nthe Governor of Montana on April 14, 1997.\n  This legislation ratifies the compact and settles the tribe's claims \nagainst the United States. The bill provides for:\n  (1) quantification of the tribe's water rights including 10,000 acre \nfeet from surface and groundwater sources on the reservation as well as \nreserving 10,000 acre feet for the tribe from Lake Elwell, a US Bureau \nof Reclamation Project located approximately 50 miles from the \nreservation. The settlement does not provide for transport of this \nwater to the reservation;\n  (2) mitigation of impacts on off-reservation water use including \ndesignating two pools of water stored in Bonneau Reservoir on the \nreservation for irrigation, stockwatering and maintenance of water \nquality on Box Elder Creek. Additional water will also be made \navailable for protecting the Brook Trout fishery in upper Beaver Creek;\n  (3) authorization of two feasibility studies by the Bureau of \nReclamation to examine water and related resources for both reservation \nand off-reservation water supplies in the area, and;\n  (4) authorization of $25 million in Federal funding for development \nof reservation water supplies including enlargement of Bonneau, Towe, \nBrown and East Fork Reservoirs; a $3 million dollar economic \ndevelopment fund for the tribe and $15 million for future importation \nof drinking water to the reservation, a much needed project in north \ncentral Montana. Additionally, $3 million will be provided for tribal \nadministration of the agreement.\n  This legislation would never have become a reality without the hard \nwork and cooperation of many people. I would especially like to \nrecognize the staff and tribal council of the Chippewa Cree Tribe, the \nstaff of the Montana Water Rights Compact Commission, the Department of \nInterior and the Native American Rights Fund. I am particularly \ngrateful for the efforts of David Hayes, Special Counselor to Secretary \nBabbitt. Mr. Hayes' involvement was like a breath of fresh air, he \nmoved forward when others were ready to give up on negotiations.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with Senator Burns to \nexpedite passage of this historic settlement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1899\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join with my \ncolleagues from Montana, Senator Baucus, to introduce the The Chippewa \nCree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's Reservation Indian Reserved Water Rights \nSettlement Act of 1998, a bill to settle the claims and quantify the \nwater rights of the Chippewa Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's Reservation. \nThis bill is the culmination of many years of work and negotiations in \nour state and will result in the federal government sanctioning the \nwater rights compact that has been adopted by the Montana State \nLegislature. This settlement may represent a textbook example of how \nstate and tribal governments, together with off-reservation local \nrepresentatives, can sit down and resolve their differences. I am \npleased that local ranchers were involved in every step of the \ndiscussions.\n  The Rocky Boy's Indian Reservation, the present homeland of the \nChippewa Cree Tribe, is located in area of scarce water supply. The \nregion is arid with an average annual precipitation of 12 inches \nsuitable for growing hay. However, an average annual precipitation of \n30 inches of snowpack in the Bearpaw Mountains contributes to a \nsignificant spring runoff. A more efficient and effective utilization \nof that runoff is a critical part of this package. The state \nlegislation authorized funding for efficiency improvements that \nmitigate the impact of tribal water development on off-reservation \nwater use.\n  By reaching an out of court settlement, the parties will--once this \npackage is implemented--go to the state water court and ask that all \npending litigation involving claims by the Tribe, and by the United \nStates on behalf of the Tribe, be dropped. The quantification of the \nTribe's water right will also clearly benefit upstream and downstream \nusers of water in the effected drainage, including the Big Sandy and \nBeaver Creek as well as the Milk River. These other users will be able \nto plan for their future because they will know precisely how much \nwater the Chippewa Cree Tribe is entitled to. One of the progressive \ncomponents of this settlement is a Water Compact Board made up of three \nmembers, a tribal representative, an off-reservation representative and \na third person mutually agreed to by the state and tribe. This Board \nwill be tasked with resolving disputes between users of the tribal \nwater right and users of water rights recognized under state law.\n  The bill set ups a Chippewa Cree Fund that will include funds for the \nadministration of the compact, a tribal economic development account \nand a future water supply facilities account. The bill allows for \nincreased on reservation storage at existing dams and two feasibility \nstudies for alternative sources and methods of delivery for MR water \nsupplies for both the reservation and the region. Finally, all parties \nto this settlement agree that the Tribe will need more water in the \nfuture for drinking purposes. While the settlement reserves 10,000 acre \nfeet of water in Tiber Reservoir, it does not propose a method of \ndelivery. We are all committed to revisiting the on-reservation \ndrinking water matter in the near future either through a pipeline or \nother methods that will be part of the authorized studies.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a \nletter from our state's Governor, Marc Racicot, endorsing this \nlegislation. Senator Baucus and I will soon be asking the Indian \nAffairs Committee to hold hearings and then to act favorable on this \nbill as expeditiously as the Committee's schedule will allow.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           Office of the Governor,\n\n\n                                             State of Montana,\n\n                                       Helena, MT, March 30, 1998.\n     Hon. Conrad Burns,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Burns: I write to express my strong support \n     for Congressional ratification of the compact settling the \n     water rights of the Chippewa Cree Tribe of the Rocky Boy's \n     Reservation, and to express my appreciation for your efforts \n     in this process. The settlement of reserved water rights \n     claimed within the State of Montana is of utmost importance \n     to the State, particularly the reserved water rights claimed \n     within the water-short Milk River basin where the Rocky Boy's \n     Reservation lies. The Rocky Boy's Compact provides for the \n     development of much needed water resources on the \n     Reservation, while at the same time protecting existing water \n     development adjacent to, and downstream from the Reservation. \n     The federal funding for development will help alleviate some \n     of the very dire needs of Montana citizens who are Tribal \n     members living on the Reservation.\n       Thank you again for your efforts in helping us finalize \n     this historic agreement.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Marc Racicot,\n                                                         Governor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. Shelby, Mr. \n        Faircloth, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n        Kerry, Mr. Bryan, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Reed, and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 1900. A bill to establish a commission to examine issues \npertaining to the disposition of Holocaust-era assets in the United \nStates before, during, and after World War II, and to make \nrecommendations to the President on further action, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n            the u.s. holocaust assets commission act of 1998\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senators Moseley-\nBraun, Shelby, Faircloth, Bennett, Hagel, Sarbanes, Dodd, Kerry, Bryan, \nBoxer, Reed and DeWine to introduce the U.S. Holocaust Assets \nCommission Act of 1998. This legislation will create the ``Presidential \nAdvisory Commission on Holocaust Assets in the United States,'' that \nwill examine the disposition of assets of Holocaust victims, survivors, \nand heirs here in the United States.\n\n  For two years now, I have worked closely with Ambassador Stuart \nEizenstat who has labored tirelessly to close this difficult chapter of \nhistory in an honorable, speedy, and satisfactory manner. He cares \npassionately that the survivors receive justice and I could not agree \nmore. I am pleased to say that the Administration fully supports this \nlegislation and we have worked with them closely over the past four \nmonths to craft the language to bring this commission to reality.\n  While we have sought answers from Switzerland and other nations on \nthe disposition of dormant bank accounts and Nazi gold, we have not \npursued the issue here in the United States. Today, we begin this \nsearch. Now we are obliged to set history straight and correct any \ninjustices in our own country. The United States has a moral \nresponsibility to address the same issues to which we have sought \nanswers from Switzerland and other nations in Europe. The spirit of \nAmerican decency demands no less.\n  If we are to provide long overdue justice to Holocaust survivors and \nthe heirs of the victims, we must do so as expeditiously as possible. \nTime is of the essence if we are going to provide the necessary \nrestitution to this already aged and rapidly dwindling survivor \ncommunity. Moreover, by creating this commission we establish even \ngreater moral authority and diplomatic credibility with other nations \nfrom which we seek answers on these important questions. Thus far, \ntwelve nations have already set up national commissions to look into \nthese issues.\n  With this legislation we will create a commisison that will seek to \nfind the disposition of the following assets in this country: dormant \nbank accounts of Holocaust victims in U.S. banks; brokerage accounts, \nsecurities, & bonds; artwork & religious/cultural artifacts; German-\nlooted gold shipped to the U.S. through the Tripartite Gold Commission; \nand insurance policies.\n  As far as funding is concerned, the Commission will be funded for \n$3.5 million, with the costs split by the interested agencies of the \nU.S. Government. The Commission will operate through December 31, 1999, \nthe date its final report is due to the President.\n  The Commission will comprise members appointed by both the Congress \nand the President, as well as private citizens who have demonstrated \ntheir leadership on issues relating to the financial community, public \nservice, and the history of the Holocaust.\n\n[[Page S2979]]\n\n  Mr. President, we need this Commission. We must leave no stone \nunturned. If we are to fully examine the disposition of the assets of \nthe victims of the Holocaust, we cannot ignore what happened in this \ncountry. While it is not within our power to change what happened \nduring WWII, it is within our power to correct a historic wrong by \nproviding answers to questions that have remained unanswered for over \nfifty years. If we do at least this much now, then we will provide a \nmeasure of comfort and justice for the survivors of the greatest evil \nmankind has ever known. I encourage my colleagues to join me in this \nlegislation and I urge its speedy passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1900\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Funds made available to the Commission pursuant to \n     this section shall remain available for obligation until \n     December 31, 1999.\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I am very proud to introduce this \nlegislation along with my colleague, Chairman D'Amato. The \nestablishment of this commission is the next logical step in the work \nwe have been doing on this issue, and it is something that should have \nbeen done in 1948 rather than 1998.\n  This bill will establish an independent Presidential Commission to \ncomprehensively examine issues pertaining to the disposition of \nHolocaust assets in the United States before, during, and after World \nWar II. It will investigate the disposition of Holocaust victims' \nassets in the United States, including but not limited to: dormant bank \naccounts, securities, bonds, insurance policies, artwork, and German-\nlooted gold shipped to the U.S. through the Tripartite Gold Commission, \nas revealed in the Eizenstat report. The Commission will issue reports, \nand make recommendations to the President on further action.\n  The amount of assets the Commission finds is likely to be \nsignificantly smaller than that discovered in other countries, but \nthere are certainly assets here. This matter even touches my hometown \nof Chicago. Currently, there is a dispute about the origins of a Degas \npastel, ``Landscape with Smokestacks,'' owned by a trustee of the Art \nInstitute of Chicago. Heirs of Freidrich and Louise Guttman, who were \nkilled by the Nazis, are litigating this issue and expect to have a \nverdict later this spring.\n  It is vitally important that the U.S. lead by example. As citizens of \nthe world, we must ensure that all of the relevant financial \ntransactions of this era are brought to light. Then, as now, those who \nenslave their own populations often try to use the international \nbanking system to further their own illegitimate ends. We cannot fully \navoid repeating the tragedies of history until we have entirely \nuncovered and have a full understanding of the past.\n  We all have a responsibility to deal with the consequences of that \nhorrific act, no matter how much time has passed, and no matter how \nmuch effort it takes. We have an obligation to ensure that the Swiss, \nand other neutral countries that played a role in hiding the stolen \npossessions of innocent Jewish families continue to work with the U.S. \nso that restitution is made. The vast majority of our work in the \nCommittee focused on the actions of other countries, especially the \nSwiss banks. Now it is time to look in the mirror. In the Eizenstat \nreport, released last year, we learned that the actions of the United \nStates before, during and after the war were not all that could have \nbeen desired. I am saddened to learn that America did not work as hard \nas it could to ensure compensation for Holocaust survivors and other \nrefugees, but I realize that the goal of that report was to unearth the \ntruth, and that is what it has done, and what we will continue to do \nwith the establishment of this Commission.\n  Already, a dozen countries have formed similar commissions. This is \ndue in no small part to the leadership role the United States has taken \nin searching for the truth. We would not have come this far without the \ncommitment of the Clinton Administration, the efforts of the Senate \nBanking Committee and, especially, the tenaciousness of our Committee \nChairman, Alfonse D'Amato.\n  Over the past several years, the Banking Committee has held many \nhearings on the disposition of the assets of Holocaust victims. Each \nhearing has brought to light valuable but distressing information about \nevents surrounding the tragedy that was the Holocaust. It has been over \n50 years since the nightmare of the Holocaust, during which, over 7 \nmillion Jewish men women and children were stripped of their homes, \nbusinesses, their possessions, the very clothes off their backs and, \nultimately, their lives--by a government that industrialized death and \nliterally attempted to exterminate the Jewish people.\n  We have made a tremendous step through our commitment to finding the \ntruth. We must now commit to work together to do everything possible to \nput whatever assets belonging to victims or survivors into the proper\n\n[[Page S2981]]\n\nhands before it is too late. Time is of the essence. With the passing \nof each day, the few remaining Holocaust survivors continue to age and \ntheir numbers decrease. This is why it is imperative that we enact this \nlegislation quickly and allow this commission to begin work as soon as \npossible.\n  It will not be possible to track down every asset, but complete \nsuccess is not required. What is required is that everyone who had a \nrole in this tragedy does their best to right the wrongs that have been \ncommitted, and that they understand that much more than money is at \nstake.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Reid, and Mr. \n        Wyden):\n  S. 1901. A bill to amend the Freedom of Information Act to provide \nelectronic access to certain Internal Revenue Service information on \nthe Internet, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n\n             THE TAXPAYERS INTERNET ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is time for the Internal Revenue Service \n(IRS) to use the latest technology to deliver better service to the \nAmerican people. Our nation's taxpayers deserve no less.\n\n  Today, Senator Ashcroft and I are introducing the Taxpayers Internet \nAssistance Act of 1998. I am pleased that Senator Reid and Senator \nWyden are original cosponsors of our bill.\n  Our bipartisan legislation requires the IRS to provide taxpayers with \nspeedy access to tax forms, publications, regulations, and rulings via \nthe Internet. It also authorizes the Treasury Department, with input \nfrom the public, to develop more online services to help taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I want to praise the Senate Finance Committee, \nChairman Roth, Senator Moynihan, Senator Kerrey and Senator Grassley \nfor their leadership in moving the IRS reform legislation to the full \nSenate. I strongly support the bill approved by the Finance Committee \nlast night.\n  As the Senate prepares to debate IRS reforms, we must use technology \nto make the IRS more effective for all taxpayers. What better way to do \nthat then to require the IRS to maintain online access to the latest \ntax information. Every citizen in the United States, no matter if he or \nshe lives in a small town or big city, should be able to receive \nelectronically the latest tax ruling or download the most up-to-date \ntax form.\n  The IRS web page at > http://irs.ustreas.gov < provides timely \nservice to taxpayers by increasing electronic access to some tax forms \nand publications. I commend the IRS for its use of Internet technology \nto improve its services. More information and services should be \noffered online and not just as a passing fad. Our legislation is needed \nto build on this electronic start and lock into the law for today and \ntomorrow comprehensive online taxpayer services.\n  Our bipartisan bill protects the privacy of taxpayers by amending the \nFreedom of Information Act (FOIA), which already calls for the deletion \nof identifying details to prevent an unwarranted invasion of personal \nprivacy. For more than 30 years, the FOIA has served the nation well in \nmaintaining the right of Americans to know what their government is \ndoing--or not doing--while protecting personal privacy. Our legislation \ndoes not give new access to private tax information, but merely \nprovides a new, easier method of receiving public tax information.\n  Under the FOIA, the IRS must maintain public access to Treasury \nRegulations, Internal Revenue Manuals, Internal Revenue Bulletins, \nRevenue Rulings, Revenue Procedures, IRS Notices, IRS Announcements, \nGeneral Counsel Memorandum and other taxpayer guidance. Under our \nlegislation, the IRS must post this public tax information on the \nInternet in a searchable database, giving all taxpayers quick access to \nit. In addition, our bipartisan bill requires the IRS to post on its \nweb site all Tax Forms, Instructions and Publications, the most \nessential information for the average taxpayer.\n  To keep any administrative burden and taxpayer cost to a minimum, our \nlegislation limits the Internet posting of past tax information. For \ninformation available under the FOIA, our legislation requires online \nposting of documents created on or after November 1, 1996, the same \ndate electronic access is required under the Electronic Freedom of \nInformation Act Amendments of 1996. I am proud to have been the chief \nSenate sponsor of that new law enacted in the last Congress.\n  For Tax Forms, Instructions and Publications, our legislation \nprovides for online posting of documents created during the most recent \nfive years, the same period of time that the IRS now keeps these \ndocuments on CD-ROM for Congressional offices.\n  With these common sense requirements, the IRS will be able to enhance \nits web page with comprehensive tax guidance in a matter of days at \nlittle cost to taxpayers under our bipartisan bill. In fact, the \nCongressional Budget Office has scored our legislation as adding no new \ndirect spending.\n  We strongly believe that the IRS must prepare itself for the next \nmillennium now. That is why our legislation authorizes the Treasury \nDepartment to study and report back to the American people on online \naccess to taxpayer information, the protection of online taxpayer \nprivacy rights, the security of online taxpayer services and public \ncomments on online taxpayer services.\n  Thomas Jefferson observed that, ``Information is the currency of \ndemocracy.'' Let's harness the power of the information age to make the \nIRS a truly democratic institution, open to all our citizens all the \ntime.\n  I thank Senator Ashcroft for his support and I look forward to \nworking with him on other high technology issues to help the Internet \nreach its full potential such as encryption legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Taxpayers Internet Assistance Act \nof 1998.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, one of my fundamental beliefs is that we \nshould labor to make sure that the collective voice of our constituents \nis heard and followed in everything we do here. That is to say, the \nvalues of Washington, D.C. should not be imposed on the country, but \ninstead the values of the country should be imposed on Washington. One \nof the best ways to make sure we follow this principle is to provide \nthe country with best information possible about what we do and how we \ndo it.\n  We must do what we can to open the doors to government so that all \nmay access the available information. In 1995, I introduced an on-line \nterm limits petition. Thousands of people singed petition. In 1996, I \nbegan an effort to educate Missouri's students on how to access the \nfederal government's available information on the Internet. This \nprogram, Gateways to Government, was presented by myself or my staff in \nevery county of Missouri, and in more than 135 individual schools. My \nhomepage continues to act as a ``gateway'' to a great wealth of \nelectronic information about congress and the federal government.\n  In this same spirit I rise today to join with Senator Leahy to \nintroduce the Taxpayers Internet Assistance Act of 1998. He has been a \nreal leader on technology issues and shares a great interest in \nguaranteeing that U.S. citizens enjoy an environment that allows them \nto know the operations of their federal government. In addition, he has \nfor years championed the rights of individuals to keep their private \naffairs private, particularly with his principal sponsorship of the \nElectronic Freedom of Information Act.\n  I am also pleased that several other senators are joining our effort \nas original co-sponsors. Our intent is to provide to the American \npublic an easy and inexpensive way to receive the latest information \nrelated to the IRS, including forms, instructions, and recent rulings.\n  Under the Taxpayers Internet Assistant Act individuals will be able \nto access a great deal of material from the IRS beginning in November \nof 1996. Revenue rulings, treasury regulations, internal revenue \nbulletins, and IRS general counsel memorandum are just a few of the \ndocuments that will routinely be made available in an easy to use \nformat. This information should provide for an easier and more \nunderstandable approach to tax planning and preparation. Individuals \nwill be able to see rulings that may be similar to a situation they are \nin currently and plan accordingly.\n  ``The difference between death and taxes,'' quipped Will Rogers, ``is \nthat\n\n[[Page S2982]]\n\ndeath doesn't get worse every time Congress meets.'' Unfortunately, Mr. \nRogers' observation has held true for more than six decades. The tax \ndoe has become increasingly complex and onerous. My wife is a tax \nattorney, she even teaches tax law at Howard University, and we do not \neven prepare our own tax forms. My hope is that this modest effort will \nprovide the public with timely, reliable information that may assist in \ntheir efforts to prepare their taxes.\n  In fact, taxpayers are working longer than ever to pay their taxes. \nAccording to the non-partisan Tax Foundation, the average American now \nworks until May 9--a full week longer than when Bill Clinton assumed \nthe presidency--to pay federal, state, and local taxes. I can't help \nbut think of President Reagan's definition of a taxpayer as ``someone \nwho works for the federal government but doesn't have to take a civil \nservice examination.'' At the very least we can assist taxpayers with \neasy to access, timely and inexpensive information that can help them \nin preparing their individuals taxes.\n  In addition, our legislation amends the Freedom of Information Act, \nwhich maintains the personal privacy of individuals by guaranteeing \nthat any reference to identifying details be deleted to prevent an \ninvasion of personal privacy. Importantly, this legislation does not \ngive any new access to tax information, but instead provides an \nadditional means of receiving the same information already made \navailable in hard copy form or, in some cases, on CD.\n  Finally, the legislation requires that the Department of Treasury \nevaluate the process to ensure that all technical advances are being \nused that would provide more timely and efficient service to taxpayers. \nIn addition, a further consideration of individual privacy will occur \nand a process developed to receive comments from the public regarding \nthe on-line taxpayer services.\n  This bipartisan approach to continuing the opening of the federal \ngovernment to all citizens should be viewed as a first step in changing \nour fundamental interaction with the IRS. We can pass this legislation \nand provide greater information to anyone who can gain access to a PC. \nI urge all senators to support and pass this year the Taxpayers \nInternet Assistance Act of 1998.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 1902. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nthe first $2,000 of health insurance premiums to be fully deductible; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  THE HEALTH INSURANCE TAX RELIEF ACT\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nallow individuals to deduct up to $2,000 a year for the costs of health \ninsurance (for themselves and their dependents). If health insurance \ncosts are shared by an individual and an employer, the individual could \ndeduct the amount of his or her share. If an individual pays the full \ncost of health insurance, the entire amount could be deducted, subject \nto the $2,000 annual limit.\n  The Joint Tax Committee has estimated that my bill would reduce \nrevenues to the federal government by approximately $11 billion per \nyear.\n\n\n                        Why This Bill is Needed\n\n  Every year, as employers continue to roll back health benefits, and \nas the costs of those benefits keep rising, the number of uninsured \nAmericans increases. There are now 41 million Americans lack health \ninsurance. That number increases by one million each year. An estimated \neighty percent of the uninsured are workers or the dependents of \nworkers.\n  Under the current tax code, corporations can deduct the cost of \nproviding health insurance for their employees. The Taxpayer Relief Act \nof 1997 also expanded the deductibility of health insurance for the \nself-employed. Health insurance-related tax deductions for corporations \nand the self-employed are now taken to the tune of about $50 billion \nannually.\n  But for the 16 million Americans who purchase health insurance for \nthemselves and their dependents, the current tax code is much less \ngenerous. They may deduct only the cost of health insurance if their \ntotal health care expenditures exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross \nincome--a threshold few Americans meet.\n\n\n                     How the Boxer Bill would Help\n\n  My bill would create an ``above the line'' deduction, which would be \nlisted on all tax returns. Taxpayers need not itemize in order to \nreceive ``above the line'' deductions.\n  The benefit to an individual taxpayer will depend on the amount of \nhealth insurance expense claimed and on the individual's tax bracket. \nThose claiming the full $2000 deduction could save $300 or more.\n  For example, if Jane Doe makes $30,000 a year, has no investment \nincome, and pays for her own health insurance, she currently pays, \n$3,476 in federal income taxes. Under my bill, assuming Ms. Doe takes \nthe full $2,000 deduction, she would pay only $3,176, a savings of \n$300, or nearly 10 percent of her tax bill.\n  Another example is Joe and Sally Smith, a married couple who file \njointly, have two children, and have a total income of $75,000 a year. \nThey purchase an insurance policy that covers the entire family. \nCurrently, they pay $10,751 in federal income taxes. Under my bill, \nassuming they take the entire $2,000 deduction, they would pay only \n$10,191, a savings of $560 off their tax bill.\n  I hope that senators will join with me to help expand opportunities \nfor all Americans to acquire health insurance by cosponsoring this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1902\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce S. \n1903, a bill to prohibit the return to a foreign country of any portion \nof a memorial to American veterans without the express authorization of \nCongress.\n  I would not have thought that a bill like this was necessary, Mr. \nPresident. It would never have occurred to me that an American \nPresident would even briefly consider dismantling part of a memorial to \nAmerican soldiers who died in the line of duty in order to send\n\n[[Page S2983]]\n\na piece of that memorial to a foreign country. But a real possibility \nof just that happening exists in my state of Wyoming involving what are \nknown as the ``Bells of Balangiga.''\n  In 1898, the Treaty of Paris brought to a close the Spanish-American \nWar. As part of the treaty, Spain ceded possession of the Philippines \nto the United States. At about the same time, the Filipino people began \nan insurrection in their country. In August 1901, as part of the \nAmerican effort to stem the insurrection, a company of 74 officers and \nmen from the 9th Infantry, Company G, occupied the town of Balangiga on \nthe island of Samar. These men came from Ft. Russell in Cheyenne, \nWyoming--today's F.E. Warren Air Force Base.\n  On September 28 of that year, taking advantage of the preoccupation \nof the American troops with a church service for the just-assassinated \nPresident McKinley, a group of Filipino insurgents infiltrated the \ntown. Only three American sentries were on duty that day. As described \nin an article in the November 19, 1997 edition of the Wall Street \nJournal:\n\n       Officers slept in, and enlisted men didn't bother to carry \n     their riffles as they ambled out of their quarters for \n     breakfast. Balangiga had been a boringly peaceful site since \n     the infantry company arrived a month earlier, according to \n     military accounts and soldiers' statements. The quiet ended \n     abruptly when a 23 year old U.S. sentry named Adolph Gamlin \n     walked past the local police chief. In one swift move, the \n     Filipino grabbed the slightly built Iowan's rifle and smashed \n     the butt across [Gamlin's] head. As PFC Gamlin crumpled, the \n     bells of Balangiga began to peal.\n       With the signal, hundreds of Filipino fighters swarmed out \n     of the surrounding forest, armed with clubs, picks and \n     machete-like bolo knives. Others poured out of the church; \n     they had arrived the night before, disguised as women \n     mourners and carrying coffins filled with bolos. A sergeant \n     was beheaded in the mess tent and dumped into a vat of \n     steaming wash water. A young bugler was cut down in a nearby \n     stream. The company commander was hacked to death after \n     jumping out a window. Besieged infantrymen defended \n     themselves with kitchen forks, mess kits and baseball bats. \n     Others threw rocks and cans of beans.\n       Though he was also slashed across the back, PFC.\n  . . Gamlin came to and found a rifle. By the time he and the other \nsurvivors fought their way to the beach, 38 US soldiers were dead and \nall but six of the remaining men had been wounded.\n\n  The remaining soldiers escaped in five dug-out canoes. Only three \nboats made it to safety on Leyte. Seven men died of exposure at sea, \nand another eight died of their wounds; only twenty of the company's \nseventy-four members survived.\n  A detachment of fifty-four volunteers from 9th Infantry units \nstationed at Leyte returned to Balangiga and recaptured the village. \nThey were reinforced a few days later from Companies K and L of the \n11th Infantry Regiment. When the 11th Infantry was relieved on October \n18 by Marines, the 9th Infantry took two of the church bells used to \nsignal the attack with them back to Wyoming as a memorial to the fallen \nsoldiers.\n  The bells have been displayed in front of the base flagpole on the \ncentral parade grounds since that time. The bells were placed in two \nopenings in a large, specially-constructed masonry wall with a bronze \nplaque dedicating the memorial to the memory of the fallen soldiers.\n  Since at least 1981, there have been on-and-off discussions in \nvarious circles in Cheyenne, Washington, and Manila about the future of \nthe bells, including the possibility of returning them to the \nPhilippines. Most recently, the Philippine government--having run into \nbroad opposition to their request to have both bells returned to them--\nhas proposed making a copy of both bells, and having both sides keep \none copy and one original.\n  Opposition to this proposal from local and national civic and \nveterans groups has been very strong. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the text of a letter from the national office of the \nVeterans of Foreign Wars dated January 6, 1998; from the VFW's \nDepartment of Wyoming dated December 5, 1997; and from the United \nVeterans Council of Wyoming dated March 27, 1998; be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, in the last few months, developments have \nindicated to me that the White House is seriously contemplating \nreturning one or both of the bells to the Philippines. This year marks \nthe 100th anniversary of the Treaty of Paris, and a state visit by \nPresident Fidel Valdes Ramos--his last as President--to the United \nStates has been planned for this month. The disposition of the bells \nhas been high on President Ramos' agenda; he has spoken personally to \nPresident Clinton and several members of Congress about it over the \nlast three years, and has indicated he will do so on this visit. Since \nJanuary, the Filipino press has included almost weekly articles on the \nbells' supposed return, including one in the Manila Times last week \nwhich reported that a new tower to house the bells is being constructed \nin Borongon, Samar, to receive them in May.\n  In addition, inquiries to me from various agencies of the \nAdministration soliciting the opinion of the Wyoming congressional \ndelegation on the issue have increased in frequency. I have also \nlearned that the Defense Department, perhaps in conjunction with the \nJustice Department, has recently prepared a legal memorandum outlining \nits opinion of who actually controls the disposition of the bells.\n  In response to this apparent groundswell, the Wyoming congressional \ndelegation wrote a letter to President Clinton on January 9 of this \nyear to make clear our opposition to removing the bells. Mr. President, \nI ask unanimous consent that the text of that letter be inserted in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, in response to that letter, on March 26 I \nreceived a letter from Sandy Berger of the National Security Council \nwhich I think is perhaps the best indicator of the direction the White \nHouse is headed on this issue. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the text of that letter be inserted in the Record.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection.\n  MR. THOMAS. Mr. President, I cannot fathom that this issue has gotten \nto this point. First, it is very evident to me that the Constitution \nprecludes the President from returning the bells without Congressional \nassent. Article IV, section 3, clause 2 provides: ``The Congress shall \nhave Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations \nrespecting . . . Property belonging to the United States.'' The bells \nare certainly property of the United States as contemplated by this \nclause, and thus clearly can only constitutionally be disposed of by \nCongress--not by the President.\n  Second, I was amazed to find, even in these days of political \ncorrectness and revisionist history, that a U.S. President--our \nCommander-in-Chief--would appear to be ready to ignore the wishes of \nour veterans and tear down a memorial to U.S. soldiers who died in the \nline of duty in order to send part of it back to the country in which \nthey were killed. Amazed, that is, until I recalled this President's \nfondness for sweeping apologies and what some might view as flashy P.R. \ngestures, as most recently evidenced by his Africa trip.\n  Third, I was amazed to learn that during a state visit when our two \ncountries should be discussing the on-going Asian financial crisis and \nits ramifications, East Asian security issues, and other issues of \nlong-range significance, President Ramos has proposed discussing only \nthree topics, all parochial: the bells, pension payments to Filipino \nveterans, and a Subic Bay-related waste issue. Amazed, that is Mr. \nPresident, until I was reminded that the candidate President Ramos is \nsupporting in the upcoming presidential elections is running in third \nplace in the polls and might just get a much-needed boost if his mentor \ncould return from Washington with a bell or a check from the U.S. \nTreasury in hand.\n  Mr. President, to the veterans of Wyoming, and the United States as a \nwhole, the bells represent a lasting memorial to those fifty-four \nAmerican soldiers killed as a result of an unprovoked insurgent attack \nin Balangiga on September 28, 1901. In their view, which I share, any \nattempt to remove either or both of the bells--and in doing so actually \nphysically dismantling a war memorial--is a desecration of that memory. \nHistory brought the bells to Wyoming, and it is there they should \nremain.\n  Consequently, I am introducing S. 1903 today to protect the bells and\n\n[[Page S2984]]\n\nsimilar veterans memorials from such an ignoble fate. The bill is not \ncomplicated, and in my view simply restates what already appears in \nblack and white in the Constitution; it prohibits the transfer of a \nveterans memorial, or any portion thereof, to a foreign country or \ngovernment unless specifically authorized by law.\n  The bill is supported by all of Wyoming's veterans groups, and I am \npleased to be joined in this effort by my good friend and colleague \nfrom Wyoming Senator Enzi, as well as by the distinguished Chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee, Senator Thurmond; the distinguished \nChairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Helms; and my \nfellow subcommittee Chairmen on the Foreign Relations Committee Senator \nHagel and Senator Smith of Oregon, as original cosponsors. \nRepresentative Barbara Cubin is introducing similar legislation today \nin the House. I trust that my colleagues will support its swift \npassage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1903\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PROHIBITION ON RETURN OF VETERANS MEMORIAL OBJECTS \n                   WITHOUT SPECIFIC AUTHORIZATION IN LAW.\n\n       (a) Prohibition.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the President may not transfer a veterans memorial \n     object to a foreign country or entity controlled by a foreign \n     government, or otherwise transfer or convey such object to a \n     person or entity for purposes of the ultimate transfer or \n     conveyance of such object to a foreign country or entity \n     controlled by a foreign government, unless specifically \n     authorized by law.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Entity controlled by a foreign government.--The term \n     ``entity controlled by a foreign government'' has the meaning \n     given that term in section 2536(c)(1) of title 10, United \n     States Code.\n       (2) Veterans memorial object.--The term ``veterans memorial \n     object'' means any object, including a physical structure or \n     portion thereof, that--\n       (A) is located at a cemetery of the National Cemetery \n     System, war memorial, or military installation in the United \n     States;\n       (B) is dedicated to, or otherwise memorializes, the death \n     in combat or combat-related duties of members of the United \n     States Armed Forces; and\n       (C) was brought to the United States from abroad as a \n     memorial of combat abroad.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Veterans of Foreign Wars of\n\n\n                                            the United States,\n\n                                                  January 6, 1998.\n     Hon. Douglas K. Bereuter,\n     Chairman, East Asia Subcommittee, Committee on International \n         Relations, U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     RE: Bells of Balangiga\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Recently, we learned that Mr. Robert \n     Underwood, U.S. Representative from Guam, has introduced \n     House Resolution 312 urging the President to authorize the \n     transfer of ownership of one of the Bells of Balangiga to the \n     Philippines. In brief, the Bells of Balangiga, which serve as \n     a war memorial to U.S. Army soldiers killed by insurgents in \n     the Philippines in 1901, are located at E.E. Warren Air Force \n     Base in Cheyenne, Wyoming. The proposal of the Philippine \n     Ambassador to return one of the bells to the Philippines is \n     opposed by veterans and the supporting community in Wyoming.\n       Although the 98th National Convention of the Veterans of \n     Foreign Wars of the United States did not adopt a Resolution \n     on this issue, the VFW does have a position on the Bells of \n     Balangiga. After carefully reviewing the history and \n     background of the issue involving the Bells of Balangiga, the \n     VFW opposes and rejects any compromise or agreement with the \n     government of the Philippines which would result in the \n     return of any of the Bells of Balangiga to the Philippines. \n     The church bells were paid for with American blood in 1901 \n     when they were used to signal an unprovoked attack by \n     insurrectionists against an American Army garrison which \n     resulted in the massacre of 45 American soldiers. The Bells \n     serve is a permanent memorial to the sacrifice of the \n     American soldiers from Fort D.A. Russell (Wyoming) who gave \n     their lives for their country while doing their duty. We do \n     not think any of the bells should be given back to the \n     Philippines. To return the bells sends the wrong message to \n     the world. In addition, local Wyoming veterans and other \n     citizens are opposed to dismantling the sacred monument and \n     returning any part of it to the Philippines.\n       In the past several years, the Philippine Government has \n     made several attempts to get the Bells of Balangiga returned \n     to their country. To date, they have not been successful in \n     any their attempts to get the bells returned. For the past 95 \n     years, two of the bells have been enshrined at Fort Russell/\n     Warren AFB in Wyoming. The third is with the U.S. Army's 9th \n     Infantry in the Republic of Korea.\n       Recently, Philippine President Fidel Ramos ordered his \n     United States Ambassador, Paul Rabe, to step up his effort on \n     the bells hoping to have them returned in time for next \n     summer's celebration of 100 years of Philippine independence. \n     In October 1997, Ambassador Paul Rabe suggested a compromise \n     solution. He suggested returning one of the bells to the \n     Philippines thereby giving both nations an original and the \n     opportunity to make a replica. In fact, the justification for \n     the latest proposal of the Philippine government is fatally \n     flawed. The Bells of Balangiga played no part at all in \n     Admiral Dewey's defeat of the Spanish Navy at Manila Bay in \n     1898. Subsequently, that naval defeat forced the Spanish to \n     relinquish control of the Philippine Islands to the U.S. The \n     soldiers killed were from Fort D.A. Russell and were ordered \n     to the Philippine Islands because a savage guerrilla war had \n     broken out after the conclusion of the Spanish-American War \n     of 1898. Therefore, we believe the bells have no significance \n     or connection to the celebration of Philippine independence.\n       Kenneth Weber, Commander of the VFW Department of Wyoming, \n     expressed the feelings of local Wyoming veterans and \n     supporters when he said, ``The members of the Veterans of \n     Foreign Wars of the United States . . . will not stand idle \n     and allow a sacred memorial to those soldiers killed while \n     doing their duty to be dismantled.''\n       We believe the Wyoming veterans are correct on this issue. \n     The bells should stay right where they are--in Wyoming and \n     with the 9th Regiment.\n           Respectfully,\n     Kenneth A. Steadman, Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    VFW, Department of Wyoming\n\n                                                 December 5, 1997.\n     Kenneth Weber,\n     Torrington, WY.\n       The VFW Department of Wyoming is making the following \n     statement on behalf of its veterans for immediate media \n     release:\n       As the Commander of the Department of Wyoming Veterans of \n     Foreign Wars, I have followed the current debate concerning \n     the Bells of Balangiga with a great deal of interest. It is \n     becoming apparent that this issue is not going away soon. Two \n     of three bells are located at the Cheyenne's F.E. Warren Air \n     Force Base as a permanent memorial to Fort D.A. Russell \n     soldiers who lost their lives in 1901 as a result of hostile \n     action during the Philippine rebellion. American soldiers \n     stationed at then Fort D.A. Russell, now Warren Air Force \n     Base, were ordered to the Philippine Islands because of a \n     savage guerrilla war which had broken out following the \n     Spanish-American War of 1898.\n       Now the Republic of the Philippines, as they have several \n     times in the past, has requested the return of one or both \n     bells to their country. This time, their justification is \n     apparently to celebrate their 100 year anniversary of \n     independence from Spain. The interesting part of their \n     argument, is the simple fact that the Bells of Balangiga \n     played no role in Admiral Dewey's defeat of the Spanish Navy \n     at Manila Bay in 1898 and Spain's subsequent relinquishing \n     control of the Philippine Islands to the United States \n     government.\n       Evidently, the current posturing by the Republic of the \n     Philippines is only another attempt to have the Bells of \n     Balangiga returned. The United States government has \n     repeatedly, and for all the right reasons, refused to return \n     the bells to them.\n       The members of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, a veterans \n     organization whose roots go back to the Spanish-American War \n     of 1898, will not stand idle and allow a sacred memorial to \n     those soldiers killed while doing their duty be dismantled. \n     We can only continue to hope that the people who have taken \n     the time to speak out in favor of returning the bells would \n     get their facts straight before engaging the media in any \n     further debate. When all the facts are known regarding the \n     circumstances surrounding the Bells of Balangiga, any \n     compromise offer with the Philippine government remains \n     unacceptable.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                    Kenneth Weber,\n     Commander.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            United Veterans Council of Wyoming\n\n                                     Cheyenne, WY, March 27, 1998.\n     The President of the United States,\n     William Jefferson Clinton\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Clinton: Member organizations of the United \n     Veterans Council of Wyoming, Inc. are in receipt of White \n     House letter dated March 26, 1998 asking the Wyoming \n     Congressional Delegation to reevaluate the compromise \n     approach to resolving the bells of Balangiga question, and we \n     would like to respond.\n       Wyoming veterans are aware of the long-standing ties with \n     the Philippines during World War II, and after. We have taken \n     into account the fact that U.S. veterans and our allies lived \n     among the Filipinos during the war, fought shoulder to \n     shoulder with them, and together defeated the Japanese \n     invaders to preserve Philippine freedom and way of life. Many \n     died retaking the Philippine islands from Japanese forces. \n     Veterans who believe the bells should remain in Wyoming do so \n     without malice towards the people of the Philippines. No one \n     denies the contributions and sacrifices made by the Filipinos \n     during\n\n[[Page S2985]]\n\n     the war effort and to continued prosperity afterwards. We \n     clearly understand honor, comradeship, and the sacrifices \n     veterans of both countries have made.\n       We believe that we have made our reasons for not \n     compromising on the return of the bells very clear. As the \n     VFW and others have continually pointed out, the bells of \n     Balangiga played no part in Admiral Dewey's defeat of the \n     Spanish navy at Manila Bay in 1898, three years before the \n     bells were used to signal the 1901 massacre of US soldiers \n     garrisoned within the village of Balangiga. The premeditated \n     massacre was particularly brutal on the surprised and \n     outnumbered soldiers. We believe that the bells have no \n     significance or connection to this centennial year of \n     celebration of the Philippine's independence from Spain.\n       As stated in a recent article from the Manila Times, it is \n     known that the Philippine government is designing a war \n     memorial to the Balangiga Bells, rather than for their use as \n     a symbol of independence from Spain. It appears that \n     representatives of the Philippine government are not being \n     straightforward regarding their true intentions, if a bell is \n     returned.\n       The Philippine government has yet to present a compelling \n     argument justifying a reversal of the U.S. government's long-\n     standing decision to not return the bells. Mr. Berger says, \n     ``he understands the concerns of those who are worried that \n     any altercation of the existing monument might cause present \n     day Americans to forget the sacrifices of past generations.'' \n     Though Mr. Berger shares our worries, it appears that our \n     government, by continuing on its present course, will allow \n     such sacrifices to be forgotten sooner than later. It is an \n     affront to the soldiers who died, and their survivors, to \n     suggest that a permanent memorial be dismantled for no better \n     reasons than are being provided by the Philippine government.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                        Jim Lloyd,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           Wyoming Delegation,\n\n                                                  January 9, 1998.\n     President Bill Clinton,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Clinton: The Wyoming delegation wishes to \n     express our opposition to any plan to remove the Bells of \n     Balangiga from F.E. Warren Air Force Base in Cheyenne, \n     Wyoming, to the Philippines. Many times and for many years, \n     the government of the Philippines has tried to have the bells \n     returned. The United States government has rightfully \n     rejected every attempt. Most recently, there have been \n     proposals by the Philippine government and in Congress to \n     transfer one of the original bells to the Philippines and \n     keep one at F.E. Warren. We find this ``compromise'' proposal \n     wholly unacceptable and an affront to the soldiers massacred \n     in Balangiga.\n       The Philippines became an American possession after the \n     Spanish-American War, but peace in the islands was delayed by \n     a bloody civil war. American soldiers at Fort D.A. Russell, \n     now F.E. Warren Air Force Base, were sent to the Philippines \n     as part of the American military force dispatched to the \n     area. On September 29, 1901, guerilla forces on the island of \n     Samar used the bells to sound a surprise attack on American \n     troops stationed in the village of Balangiga. Of the 76 \n     Americans stationed in Balangiga, only 20 returned home. The \n     survivors brought the bells back to Wyoming as a memorial to \n     their fallen comrades.\n       Wyoming's many veterans, represented by the Veterans of \n     Foreign Wars and the American Legion, strongly oppose \n     removing the bells. For our veterans the bells serve as a \n     constant reminder of the men who died in that surprise \n     attack. The Wyoming delegation has always opposed desecrating \n     this memorial for the same reason.\n       Preserving this memorial will serve as a symbol that \n     American troops who serve around the world will not be \n     forsaken. It also reaffirms to the world that the United \n     States will protect its forces serving around the world if \n     they are attacked.\n       On behalf of America's soldiers who have made the ultimate \n     sacrifice, please join with us in refusing all present and \n     future efforts to dismantle this memorial.\n           Sincerely,\n     Craig Thomas,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Michael B. Enzi,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Barbara Cubin,\n       Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      The White House, Washington,\n                                                   March 26, 1998.\n       Dear Senator Thomas: Thank you for your letter concerning \n     the bells of Balangiga and the proposed compromise solution \n     for addressing this issue. I am writing on behalf of the \n     President to request that you not oppose the compromise \n     solution. We believe it effectively takes into account the \n     interests and sensitivities of both American veterans and the \n     people of the Philippines.\n       I understand American forces brought the two bells of \n     Balangiga to Wyoming following the Philippine insurrection of \n     1901, and that they currently are on display at F.E. Warren \n     Air Force Base in Cheyenne. As you may know, Philippine \n     President Fidel Ramos is eager to explore the possibility of \n     returning at least one of the bells during this centennial \n     year of the Philippines' declaration of independence from \n     Spain. President Ramos will be the President's guest at the \n     White House on April 10, 1998. The bells of Balangiga will be \n     one of the principal issues on the discussion agenda.\n       I appreciate the importance of the bells to Wyoming \n     veterans who consider them to be symbols of the supreme \n     sacrifice American soldiers, sailors and airmen often have \n     had to make far from home. At the same time, Filipinos see \n     the bells as representative of a struggle for national \n     independence lasting more than five centuries.\n       Our longstanding ties with the Philippines were forged in \n     the intense combat of World War II by tens of thousands of \n     Americans and Filipinos. Growing out of this experience is a \n     relationship, which is closer on a person-to-person level \n     than with any other country in East Asia. The Philippines is \n     a key ally in the Asia Pacific and shares our commitment to \n     democratic and free market principles. Presidential elections \n     in May of this year will re-enforce the democratic traditions \n     and institutions Filipinos have so eagerly embraced.\n       I believe a compromise solution, by which the United States \n     and the Philippines would each retain custody of one of the \n     original bells, offers a unique opportunity to honor both the \n     American soldiers who gave their lives in the town of \n     Balangiga and the centennial celebration of the Philippines' \n     first step toward democracy. I understand the concerns of \n     those who are worried that any alteration of the existing \n     monument might cause present day Americans to forget the \n     sacrifices of past generations. But the historical \n     significance of Balangiga rests on the fact that today the \n     United States and the Philippines are united in a common \n     cause of promoting stability and prosperity throughout the \n     Asia Pacific region. I urge you and your colleagues from the \n     Wyoming Congressional Delegation to reevaluate the compromise \n     approach to resolving the bells of Balangiga question.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Samuel R. Berger,\n         Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague, the senior \nSenator from my state of Wyoming, in the effort to safeguard the \nintegrity of the nation's military memorials from the politically \nexpedient demands of foreign governments--in this case the so-called \n``Bells of Balangiga'' war memorial located in Wyoming's capital city \nof Cheyenne. I too, am amazed that such legislation is necessary. \nAmazed, but not surprised. After all, this is a President who seems to \nhave no qualms about throwing overboard those states and communities \nwho have not proven politically valuable to him. I recall his \nunilateral Utah land grab of the Grand Escalante. I also recall that \nhe, with the Vice President at his side, signed the Presidential \ndirective for that action in Arizona, so unpopular was it in the State \nof Utah. His unilateral forest roads construction moratorium is another \nsuch example of his proclivity for government by executive fiat.\n  Many people contend that church bells are not a fitting subject for a \nwar memorial. The circumstances surrounding these particular bells, \nhowever, are not normal. As the Senior Senator from Wyoming related, \nthose bells were not used by Philippino insurgents to call the faithful \nto prayer that harrowing morning. They were used instead to signal the \nmassacre of Wyoming troops as they sat down, unarmed, to breakfast. Of \nthe 74 officers and men in the garrison, only twenty survived. Eye \nwitness accounts had some of the attackers disguised as women, their \nweapons hidden beneath their dresses. Many others smuggled their \nweapons into the village hidden in the coffins of children. Under those \ncircumstances, one must conclude that the bells in question were used \nto kill. Consequently I feel their use as the subject for a war \nmemorial is wholly appropriate.\n  This is especially true in light of their intended purpose if \nreturned to the Philippines. As everyone concedes, the Philippine \ngovernment desires the return of these bells in time for their 100th \nanniversary of independence. Apparently, these bells do not represent a \nreligious symbol for the Philippine government either.\n  Most significant of all, however, is the purpose they currently \nserve. Contrary to the assumptions of many, they do not memorialize \nAmerican foreign policies of the time. Nor do they serve as a tribute \nto our political system, America's turn of the century notions of race \nrelations, or the performance of the American troops who served there \nduring that conflict. Rather, these bells memorialize one thing and one \nthing only: The tragic and premature deaths of 54 young men who \nvolunteered to do the bidding of the American people. For this purpose \nI believe\n\n[[Page S2986]]\n\nthese bells serve as a most fitting memorial indeed and I am opposed to \nits dismantlement.\n  It is time to honor our veterans, our war dead, and the principle \nthat in this country, we do not submit to government by Presidential \nfiat. I ask the support of my colleagues for this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GORTON:\n  S. 1904. A bill to amend the Elwha River Ecosystem and Fisheries \nRestoration Act to provide further for the acquisition and removal of \nthe Elwha dam and acquisition to Glines Canyon dam and the restoration \nof the Elwha River ecosystem and native anadromous fisheries, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n    the elwha river ecosystem and fisheries restoration act of 1998\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, six months ago, I came to the floor of the \nUnited States Senate to announce my reluctant support for removing one \nof two dams on the Elwha River on the Olympic Peninsula. Today, after \nspending countless hours working with interested Washington State \nresidents, I am introducing legislation to accomplish this difficult \nand costly endeavor provided certain conditions are met.\n  As I mentioned in my statement last fall, I have never been \nenthusiastic about the idea of dam removal on the Elwha River as a \nmeans to enhance declining salmon runs on the river. For many years, \nnational environmental groups, the Clinton Administration, much of the \nNorthwest media, and many Northwest elected officials have pushed for \nremoval of both dams from the Elwha River. In 1992, I supported \nlegislation to begin the process of having the government acquire both \nof these dams with an eye toward removing them someday. While I have \nalways been enthusiastic about the federal government buying these two \ndams from a local paper company, I continue to be skeptical toward \nclaims that salmon runs will see a significant benefit through dam \nremoval on the Elwha River. Anyone who believes otherwise needs to ask \nhim why salmon runs on nearby rivers on the Olympic Peninsula with no \ndams are doing just as poorly.\n  I am quite certain, however, that there are clear costs to dam \nremoval. The taxpayers must pay at least $65 million to remove just one \ndam on the Elwha River. Power generation will be lost, and in the case \nof the Elwha River dams, serious questions remain about the potential \ndamage to the City of Port Angeles' water supply. As I weigh these \ncosts against the potential benefits to salmon, I have generally \ninclined against dam removal.\n  Unfortunately, the issue isn't as simple as a cost-benefit analysis. \nThere is a wild card over which I have no control that could have a \ndevastating effect on the Port Angeles community. The lower Elwha River \ndam produces a tiny amount of power--only a quarter of the amount of \npower produced by the upper Elwha River dam and a minuscule amount in \ncomparison to our productive Snake and Columbia River dams. In \naddition, the lower Elwha River dam is in poor physical condition.\n  These two factors, combined with the desire of the Interior Secretary \nto tear down a dam, have me concerned that there is a very real and \ngrowing threat that a federal judge or the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission (FERC) could order removal of the Elwha River dams without \nCongressional approval.\n  A court or agency ordered removal will impose all of the costs of \nremoving the dams on the local community, jobs will be destroyed, and \nPort Angeles' supply of clean drinking water will be threatened. The \nrisk of court or agency action is too great and will leave the local \ncommunity in a terrible position if a judge, or a Washington, DC \nbureaucrat, suddenly decides he needs to be in charge of this issue.\n  Instead, if Congress acts, we can remove the wild card and assure an \nimportant level of community protection. Thus, I have conditioned my \nsupport for this dam's removal on certain legislated protection for \nPort Angeles' water supply and protection for the jobs created by the \nlocal mill. No legislation to remove the dam will pass the U.S. Senate \nwithout these protections while I am a member.\n  As a result of these recent developments and circumstances beyond my \ncontrol, this comprehensive package will complete the federal \ngovernment's acquisition of both Elwha River dams, authorizes removal \nof one dam, while at the same time protecting local economic interests.\n  Over the last three years, the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee \nthat I chair has appropriated $11 million of the $29.5 million \nnecessary to complete the acquisition of the projects. Acquisitions of \nthe projects is extremely important to the future economic health of \nthe Port Angeles community. While the James River Corporation currently \nholds title to the projects, Daishowa America, as local owner of the \ndirectory paper mill and second largest employer in Clallam County, \nuses energy from the dams. Clearly, continued uncertainty over the fate \nof these dams reduces the competitive position of the mill and inhibits \nfuture investment in the plant and its equipment.\n  My bill amends the 1992 Act and calls for completion of acquisition \nof the projects. As Chairman of the Subcommittee that controls the \npurse strings for this project, I have every intention of allocating \nthe remaining $18.5 million needed to complete acquisition as part of \nthe $699 million worth of additional Land and Water Conservation Fund \ndollars that we appropriated last year and have yet to be spent.\n  In addition to committing to fund the removal of the Elwha project \nshould it become law, my bill prohibits the Secretary from removing the \nlarger dam, better known as the Clines Canyon Project, for 12 years. \nMany have asked why we can't remove both dams simultaneously. My answer \nis that I prefer the phased approach to restoration of the river \nspelled out by the Elwha Citizens Advisory Committee in its 1996 \nreport.\n  The Committee, which is comprised of a diverse array of local \ninterests, cautions against simultaneous removal of both dams. As an \nappropriations subcommittee chairman, I can tell them that they are \nabsolutely correct because it is simply unrealistic to expect \nsufficient funds immediately to remove both projects. More importantly, \nimmediate removal of both projects would have unpredictable \nconsequences for the community's water supply--something my bill is \ncareful to protect--and would needlessly forgo a valuable economic and \nrecreational resource that can be put to use to accomplish restoration \nactivities.\n  When the 12 year moratorium has expired, my bill allows the Secretary \nto remove the upper dam provided he determines that the benefits of dam \nremoval to salmon restoration and the natural state of the river \noutweighs the importance of the project's power generation capabilities \nand the recreational value of the lake that was created by its \nconstruction. The 12 year waiting period also spells out several \nimportant steps that the Secretary must take to evaluate the impact \nremoving one dam has on fish runs. I firmly believe that should we \ndecide one day to remove the second dam, we will do a far better job if \nwe take the time to learn from the challenges of removing the first dam \nbefore deciding on the fate of the second one. Should the Secretary \ndetermine that it is necessary to remove the Glines Canyon project \nbefore 12 years have gone by, nothing in the bill I am offering today \nprevents him from seeking Congressional approval to do so.\n  Finally with regard to the Elwha River, my bill takes several \nimportant steps to project the local community from the potentially \nadverse impacts of dam removal. They include: (1) protecting the \nquality and quantity of the community's existing water supply to meet \ncurrent and future demands; (2) continued protection of James River and \nDaishowa from potential liability; and (3) compensation for Clallam \nCounty for further loss of tax revenue due to federal acquisition of \nthe projects.\n  As a Senator who takes pride in trying to represent all interests in \nmy state, I have also taken great interest in the concerns of my \nconstituents in eastern Washington, who while not directly impacted by \nthe removal of the Elwha dam, have legitimate fears that something \nsimilar could happen to a dam on the Columbia or Snake Rivers. Clearly \nsome groups and agency officials within the Clinton-Gore Administration \nwant to use the removal of\n\n[[Page S2987]]\n\nElwha River dams as a first step toward removing or severely limiting \nthe effectiveness of Columbia River system hydroelectric dams. Already, \nthe Army Corps of Engineers is evaluating dam removal on the Snake \nRiver as a legitimate option. The Corps has even taken the \nunprecedented step of paying Pacific Northwest residents $12 to fill \nout a totally biased survey in favor of dam removal to build support \nfor this cause.\n  I will never support such efforts to cripple the world's most \nproductive hydro system. As the source of the nation's lowest power \nrates, water for irrigating productive farmland in three states, and a \ncost effective transportation system that moves our agricultural \nproducts to market, these dams are truly the lifeblood of our economy \nin the Pacific Northwest.\n  While Columbia River dams have hurt salmon runs, that damage was felt \nprimarily in the 1930's and 1940's. Since the last Columbia River dam \nwas constructed we still had large and healthy salmon runs. The last \ndecade's decline in Columbia River salmon runs cannot be honestly \nattributed solely to our hydroelectric facilities.\n  Nevertheless, we can and should do more for salmon especially by \nacting in a more coordinated way to restore this vital resource. But \nthe costs associated with removing dams on the Snake and Columbia \nRivers will vastly exceed any potential benefit that might occur in \nterms of salmon restoration.\n  Rather than working cooperatively with local communities directly \nimpacted by the Columbia-Snake Resource on a rational policy that \nbalances the rivers' important uses, the Clinton-Gore Administration \nhas chosen a combative policy. Its approach punishes people who make \ntheir livelihoods from this resource and who have made good faith \nefforts to reach out and work together.\n  Another example of the draconian actions federal agencies are using \nagainst ordinary people who depend on the Columbia Snake River System \nfor their livelihoods is the National Marine Fisheries Service's \nrecently announced Columbia Basin water policy. The NMFS approach seeks \nto discourage or even eliminate any new additional water withdrawals \nfor municipal, industrial, or irrigation development within the Basin. \nThe NMFS policy goes even further in challenging the legislative \nauthority of states to regulate, manage, and allocate water rights. If \nadopted, the NMFS policy would effectively abrogate state authority to \ngrant future water rights for such uses. By calling for a review of \nexisting water withdrawals, the policy postures toward challenging \nexisting state-granted water rights. The agency has completely ignored \nthe efforts of local irrigators to work together on a plan that \nbalances the rivers' competing uses. Moreover, the agency has taken \nthis direction without Congressional approval.\n  Given the out-of-control nature of agencies like the Corps and NMFS \nto go beyond their statutory authority to severely compromise the \nColumbia-Snake system as well as their eagerness to tear down a \nColumbia-Snake River dam, I would not be surprised to see this \nadministration try to fulfill its dream without Congressional approval.\n  The people of my state are simply fed up with this top down approach \nand my bill attempts to do something about it. In addition to \nprohibiting the removal or breach of any dam on the Columbia or Snake \nRivers, my bill prohibits any federal or state agency from taking the \nfollowing actions without an act of Congress:\n  (1) Impairing flood control activities on the Columbia-Snake system;\n  (2) Reducing the power and energy generating capacity of federally \nowned and federally licensed projects to unaffordable levels;\n  (3) Further restricting access to the Columbia or Snake River for \nirrigation and recreational use;\n  (4) Impairing the river navigation system; and\n  (5) Restricting state water rights.\n  I look forward to working with the Administration and my colleagues \nfrom the Pacific Northwest on building support for my proposal. If the \nAdministration can not bring itself to support something very close to \nwhat's in the Columbia-Snake River section of this bill, we will know \njust how serious it is about dam removal in eastern Washington. I have \nmade major concessions to bring myself to support removal of a dam even \nthough I find the policy a dubious one, and if the administration is \nserious about preserving the effectiveness of the Columbia-Snake system \nit will support my proposal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

SENSE OF THE SENATE TO MAINTAIN FULL FUNDING FOR \n                   THE SECTION 202 ELDERLY HOUSING PROGRAM.\n\n       ``(a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following--\n       ``(1) The Section 202 Elderly Housing program is the most \n     important housing program for elderly, low-income Americans, \n     providing both affordable low-income housing and supportive \n     services designed to meet the special needs of the elderly.\n       ``(2) Since 1959, the Section 202 Elderly Housing program \n     has funded some 5,400 elderly housing projects with over \n     330,000 housing units, with the current average tenant in \n     Section 202 housing being a frail, older woman in her \n     seventies, living alone with an income of less than $10,000 \n     per year.\n       ``(3) The combination of affordable housing and supportive \n     services under the Section 202 Elderly Housing program is \n     critical to promoting independent living, self-sufficiency, \n     and dignity for the elderly while delaying more costly \n     institutional care.\n       ``(4) There are over 1.4 million elderly Americans \n     currently identified as having ``worst case housing needs'' \n     and in need of affordable housing.\n       ``(5) There are 33 million Americans aged 65 and over, some \n     13 percent of all Americans. The number of elderly Americans \n     is anticipated to grow to over 69 million by the year 2030, \n     which would be some 20 percent of all Americans, and continue \n     to increase to almost 80 million by 2050.\n       ``(6) The President's Budget Request for fiscal year 1999 \n     proposes reducing funding for the Section 202 Elderly Housing \n     program from the fiscal year 1998 level of $645,000,000 to \n     $109,000,000 in fiscal year 1999.

SENSE OF THE SENATE SUPPORTING LONG-TERM ENTITLEMENT \n                   REFORMS.\n\n       (a) The Senate finds that the resolution assumes the \n     following--\n       (1) entitlement spending has risen dramatically over the \n     last thirty-five years.\n       (2) in 1963, mandatory spending (i.e. entitlement spending \n     and interest on the debt) made up 30 percent of the budget, \n     this figure rose to 45 percent by 1973, to 56 percent by 1983 \n     and to 61 percent by 1993.\n       (3) mandatory spending is expected to make up 68 percent of \n     the federal budget in 1998.\n       (4) absent changes, that spending is expected to take up \n     over 70 percent of the federal budget shortly after the year \n     2000 and 74 percent of the budget by the year 2008.\n       (5) if no action is taken, mandatory spending will consume \n     100 percent of the budget by the year 2030.\n       (6) this mandatory spending will continue to crowd out \n     spending for the traditional ``discretionary'' functions of \n     government like clean air and water, a strong national \n     defense, parks and recreation, education, our transportation \n     system, law enforcement, research and development and other \n     infrastructure spending.\n       (7) taking significant steps sooner rather than later to \n     reform entitlement spending will not only boost economic \n     growth in this country, it will also prevent the need for \n     drastic tax and spending decisions in the next century.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that that levels in this budget resolution assume that--\n       (1) Congress and the President should work to enact \n     structural reforms in entitlement spending in 1998 and beyond \n     which sufficiently restrain the growth of mandatory spending \n     in order to keep the budget in balance over the long term, \n     extend the solvency of the Social Security and Medicare Trust \n     Funds, avoid crowding out funding for basic government \n     functions and that every effort should be made to hold \n     mandatory spending to no more than seventy percent of the \n     budget.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2215\n\n       At the end of Title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING PASSAGE OF THE IRS \n                   RESTRUCTURING AND REFORM ACT.\n\n       (2) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) The House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed IRS \n     Reform Legislation (H.R. 2676), on November 5, 1997.\n       (2) The IRS Restructuring and Reform Act has the potential \n     to benefit 120 million Americans by simplifying the tax \n     process and making the IRS more responsive to taxpayer \n     concerns:\n       (3) The President has announced that he would sign H.R. \n     2676;\n       (4) The Senate plans to recess without considering \n     legislation to reform the IRS.\n       (5) The American people are busy preparing their taxes to \n     meet the April 15th deadline. They do not get to recess \n     before filing their returns; and\n       (5) Senators should keep their commitment to take up and \n     pass IRS reform legislation before they recess.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the assumptions \n     underlying the functional totals in this budget resolution \n     assume that the Senate shall not recess until it has \n     considered and voted on H.R. 2676, the IRS Restructuring and \n     Reform Act of 1997.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    MURRAY AMENDMENTS NOS. 2216-2217\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY proposed two amendments to the concurrent resolution, S. \nCon.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON EXPANDING MEDICARE BENEFITS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) In the 1997 Balanced Budget Agreement, changes were \n     made to Medicare that extended the solvency of the Trust Fund \n     for 10 years.\n       (2) The Medicare Commission, also established in the \n     Balanced Budget Agreement, has just started the task of \n     examining the Medicare program in an effort to make sound \n     policy recommendations to Congress and the Administration \n     about what needs to be done to ensure that Medicare is \n     financially prepared to handle the added burden when the baby \n     boomers begin retiring.\n       (3) The problems facing Medicare are not about more \n     revenues. The program needs to do more to improve the health \n     care status of retirees and give them more choices and better \n     information to make wise consumer decisions when purchasing \n     health care services.\n       (4) Improving the health care status of senior citizens \n     would ensure additional savings for Medicare. Helping seniors \n     stay healthier should be a priority of any legislation aimed \n     at protecting Medicare.\n       (5) In order to keep seniors healthier, Medicare has to \n     become more prevention based. Currently, Medicare offers very \n     few prevention benefits. As a result, seniors are often \n     sicker when they seek care or are hospitalized.\n       (6) If the objective is to use tobacco revenues to save \n     Medicare, a portion of these new revenues must be allocated \n     to expanding prevention benefits.\n       (7) Preventing illnesses or long hospital stays or repeated \n     hospital stays will save Medicare dollars.\n       (8) Medicare cannot be saved without structural changes and \n     reforms. Simply using a new Federal tax to prop up Medicare \n     will not extend solvency much beyond a few months and will do \n     little to improve the health status of senior citizens and \n     the disabled.\n       (9) Congress should use these new revenues to expand \n     prevention benefits to ensure that seniors are healthier and \n     stronger.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE TAX TREATMENT OF HOME \n                   MORTGAGE INTEREST AND CHARITABLE GIVING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) current Federal income tax laws embrace a number of \n     fundamental tax policies including longstanding encouragement \n     for home ownership and charitable giving;\n       (2) the mortgage interest deduction is among the most \n     important incentives in the income tax code and promotes the \n     American Dream of home ownership--the single largest \n     investment for most families, and preserving it is critical \n     for the more than 20,000,000 families claiming it now and for \n     millions more in the future;\n       (3) favorable tax treatment to encourage gifts to charities \n     is a longstanding principle that helps charities raise funds \n     needed to provide services to poor families and others when \n     government is simply unable or unwilling to do so, and \n     maintaining this tax incentive will help charities raise \n     money to meet the challenges of their charitable missions in \n     the decades ahead;\n       (4) legislation has been proposed to repeal the entire \n     income tax code at the end of the year 2001 without providing \n     a specific replacement; and\n       (5) recklessly sunsetting the entire income tax code \n     threatens our Nation's future economic growth and unwisely \n     eliminates existing tax incentives that are crucial for \n     taxpayers who are often making the most important financial \n     decisions of their lives.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the levels in this resolution assume that Congress supports \n     the continued tax deductibility of home mortgage interest and \n     charitable contributions.\n                                  ____\n\n       At the appropriate place in the resolution, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC.  .

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON LONG-TERM BUDGETING AND \n                   REPAYMENT OF THE PUBLIC DEBT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) today, there are 34,000,000 Americans over the age of \n     65, and by the year 2030, that number will grow to nearly \n     70,000,000;\n       (2) in 1963, mandatory spending represented 30 percent of \n     the Federal budget, while discretionary spending made up 70 \n     percent, and by 1998, those proportions have almost \n     completely reversed, in that mandatory spending now accounts \n     for 68 percent of the Federal budget, while discretionary \n     spending represents 32 percent;\n       (3) according to the 1997 Annual Report of the Board of \n     Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and \n     Disability Insurance (OASDI) Trust Fund--\n       (A) the difference between the income and benefits for the \n     OASDI program is a deficit of 2.23 percent of taxable \n     payroll;\n       (B) the assets in the Trust Fund are expected to be \n     depleted under present law in the year 2029;\n       (C) by the time the assets in the Trust Fund are depleted, \n     annual tax revenues will be sufficient to cover only three-\n     fourths of the annual expenditures;\n       (D) intermediate estimates are that OASDI will absorb \n     nearly 17.5 percent of national payroll by the year 2030; and\n       (E) the cost of the OASDI program is estimated to rise from \n     its current level of 4.7 percent of Gross Domestic Product to \n     6.7 percent by the end of the 75-year projection period;\n       (4) according to reports by the Congressional Budget \n     Office, the Economic and Budget Outlook: Fiscal Years 1999-\n     2008 (January 1998) and Reducing the Deficit: Spending and \n     Revenue Options (March 1997)--\n       (A) the Medicare Part A Trust Fund will be exhausted early \n     in fiscal year 2010;\n       (B) enrollment in Medicare will increase dramatically as \n     the baby boomers reach age 65;\n       (C) between the years 2010 and 2030, enrollment in Medicare \n     is projected to grow by 2.4 percent per year, up from the 1.4 \n     percent average annual growth projected through 2007;\n       (D) by the year 2030, Medicare enrollment will have \n     doubled, to 75,000,000 people; and\n       (E) the increase in Medicare enrollment caused by the aging \n     of the population will be accompanied by a tapering of the \n     growth rate of the working age population, and the number of \n     workers will drop from 3.8 for every Medicare beneficiary in \n     1997 to 2.02 per beneficiary by 2030;\n       (5) the demographic shift that is currently taking place, \n     and will continue for the next 30 years, will put a \n     tremendous burden on workers as the cost of programs such as \n     Social Security and Medicare are borne by proportionately \n     fewer workers;\n       (6) the current Budget Resolution, which projects revenues \n     and spending only for the next 10 years, does not give \n     Congress a clear picture of the budget problems that confront \n     the United States shortly after the turn of the century;\n       (7) currently, 14 percent of the Federal budget is spent on \n     interest payments on the national debt; and\n       (8) if projected surpluses are used entirely for debt \n     reduction and current tax and spending policies remain \n     unchanged, the share of Federal income needed to pay interest \n     would drop below 5 percent within 12 years, and in 1997, that \n     10 percentage-point reduction would have amounted to \n     $158,000,000,000 available for other priorities.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals in this concurrent resolution \n     assume that future budget resolutions and future budgets \n     submitted by the President should include--\n       (1) an analysis for the period of 30 fiscal years beginning \n     with such fiscal year, of the estimated levels of total \n     budget outlays and total new budget authority, the estimated \n     revenues to be received, the estimated surplus or deficit, if \n     any, for each major Federal entitlement program for each \n     fiscal year in such period; and\n       (2) a specific accounting of payments, if any, made to \n     reduce the public debt, or unfunded liabilities associated \n     with each major Federal entitlement program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                MOSELEY-BRAUN AMENDMENTS NOS. 2238-2240\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG (for Ms. Moseley-Braun) proposed three amendments to \nthe concurrent resolution, Senate Concurrent Resolution 86, supra; as \nfollows:\n\n                          Amendment No.  2238\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING LEGISLATION THAT \n                   INCREASES COMPLEXITY OF TAX RETURNS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) As part of the consideration by the Senate of tax cuts \n     for the families of America, the Senate should also examine \n     the condition of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.\n       (2) According to the Congressional Research Service, the \n     Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1997 added 1,000,000 words and \n     315 pages to the Internal Revenue Code.\n       (3) The Internal Revenue Code continues to grow more \n     complex and difficult for the average taxpayer to understand, \n     and the average tax return has become more time-consuming to \n     prepare.\n       (4) The average taxpayer will spend 9 hours and 54 minutes \n     preparing Form 1040 for the 1997 tax year.\n       (5) The average taxpayer spends between 21 and 28 hours \n     each year on tax matters.\n       (6) In 1995, 58,965,000 of the 118,218,327 tax returns that \n     were filed, almost 50 percent, were filed by taxpayers who \n     utilized the help of paid tax preparers.\n       (7) The average taxpayer spends $72 each year for tax \n     preparation.\n       (8) The total burden on all taxpayers of maintaining \n     records, and preparing and filing tax returns is estimated to \n     be in excess of 1,600,000 hours per year.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budgetary levels in this resolution assume that the \n     Senate should give priority to tax proposals that simplify \n     the tax code and reject proposals that add greater complexity \n     in the tax code and increase compliance costs for the \n     taxpayer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2239\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following;\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING PRESIDENT'S BUDGET.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the budgetary levels in \n     this resolution assume that the President should submit, as \n     part of the budget request of the President that is submitted \n     to Congress, a study of the impact of the provisions of the \n     budget on each generation of Americans and its long-term \n     effects on each generation.\n\n[[Page S2995]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 2240\n\n       At the end of title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE VALUE OF THE \n                   SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM FOR FUTURE RETIREES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The social security system has allowed a generation of \n     Americans to retire with dignity. Today, 13 percent of the \n     population is 65 or older and by 2030, 20 percent of the \n     population will be 65 or older. More than \\1/2\\ of the \n     elderly do not receive private pensions and more than \\1/3\\ \n     have no income from assets.\n       (2) For 60 percent of all senior citizens, social security \n     benefits provide almost 80 percent of their retirement \n     income. For 80 percent of all senior citizens, social \n     security benefits provide over 50 percent of their retirement \n     income.\n       (3) Poverty rates among the elderly are at the lowest level \n     since the United States began to keep poverty statistics, due \n     in large part to the social security system.\n       (4) 78 percent of Americans pay more in payroll taxes than \n     they do in income taxes.\n       (5) According to the 1997 report of the Managing Trustee \n     for the social security trust funds, the accumulated balance \n     in the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund is \n     estimated to fall to zero by 2029, and the estimated payroll \n     tax at that time will be sufficient to cover only 75 percent \n     of the benefits owed to retirees at that time.\n       (6) The average American retiring in the year 2015 will pay \n     $250,000 in payroll taxes over the course of a working \n     career.\n       (7) Future generations of Americans must be guaranteed the \n     same value from the social security system as past covered \n     recipients.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the budgetary levels in this resolution assume that no \n     change in the social security system should be made that \n     would reduce the value of the social security system for \n     future generations of retirees.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 DURBIN (AND CHAFEE) AMENDMENT NO. 2241\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG (for Mr. Durbin, for himself and Mr. Chafee) proposed \nan amendment to the concurrent resolution, S.

FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING AFFORDABLE, \n                   HIGH-QUALITY HEALTH CARE FOR SENIORS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Seniors deserve affordable, high quality health care.\n       (2) The medicare program under title XVIII of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) has made health care \n     affordable for millions of seniors.\n       (3) Beneficiaries under the medicare program deserve to \n     know that such program will cover the benefits that they are \n     currently entitled to.\n       (4) Beneficiaries under the medicare program can pay out-\n     of-pocket for health care services whenever they--\n       (A) do not want a claim for reimbursement for such services \n     submitted to such program; or\n       (B) want or need to obtain health care services that such \n     program does not cover.\n       (5) Beneficiaries under the medicare program can use \n     doctors who do not receive any reimbursement under such \n     program.\n       (6) Close to 75 percent of seniors have annual incomes \n     below $25,000, including 4 percent who have annual incomes \n     below $5,000, making any additional out-of-pocket costs for \n     health care services extremely burdensome.\n       (7) Very few beneficiaries under the medicare program \n     report having difficulty obtaining access to a physician who \n     accepts reimbursement under such program.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     resolution assume that seniors have the right to affordable, \n     high-quality health care, that they have the right to choose \n     their physicians, and that no change should be made to the \n     medicare program that could--\n       (1) impose unreasonable and unpredictable out-of-pocket \n     costs for seniors or erode the benefits that the 38,000,000 \n     beneficiaries under the medicare program are entitled to;\n       (2) compromise the efforts of the Secretary of Health and \n     Human Services to screen inappropriate or fraudulent claims \n     for reimbursement under such program; and\n       (3) allow unscrupulous providers under such program to bill \n     twice for the same services.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       DORGAN AMENDMENT NO. 2242\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG (for Mr. Dorgan) proposed an amendment to the \nconcurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON SOCIAL SECURITY SOLVENCY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Social Security system provides benefits to \n     44,000,000 Americans, including 27,300,000 retirees, over \n     4,500,000 people with disabilities, 3,800,000 surviving \n     children, and 8,400,000 surviving adults, and is essential to \n     the dignity and security of the Nation's elderly and \n     disabled.\n       (2) the Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors \n     Insurance and Disability Insurance Trust Funds have reported \n     to Congress that the ``total income'' of the Social Security \n     system ``is estimated to fall short of expenditures beginning \n     in 2019 and in each year thereafter . . . until [trust fund] \n     assets are exhausted in 2029'';\n       (3) intergenerational fairness, honest accounting \n     principles, prudent budgeting, and sound economic policy all \n     require saving Social Security first, in order that the \n     Nation may better afford the retirement of the baby boom \n     generation beginning in 2010;\n       (4) in reforming Social Security in 1983, Congress intended \n     that near-term Social Security trust fund surpluses be used \n     to prefund the retirement of the baby boom generation;\n       (5) in his State of the Union message to the joint session \n     of Congress on January 27, 1998, President Clinton called on \n     Congress to ``save Social Security first'' and to ``reserve \n     one hundred percent of the surplus, that is any penny of any \n     surplus, until we have taken all the necessary measures to \n     strengthen the Social Security system for the twenty-first \n     century'';\n       (6) the nation will engage in a national dialogue during \n     1998 on the future of Social Security, which will include 4 \n     regional conferences organized by the Concord Coalition and \n     the American Association of Retired Persons, a White House \n     summit on private retirement savings in July, and a White \n     House Conference on Social Security in December; and\n       (7) saving Social Security first would work to expand \n     national savings, reduce interest rates, enhance private \n     investment, increase labor productivity, and boost economic \n     growth.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the levels in this resolution assume that:\n       (1) Congress should save Social Security first by reserving \n     any unified budget surplus until legislation is enacted to \n     make Social Security actuarially sound and capable of paying \n     future retirees the benefits to which they are entitled;\n       (2) enactment of such legislation will require a broad base \n     of public support that should be developed during 1998 \n     through a national bipartisan discussion of alternative \n     approaches to ensuring Social Security solvency; and\n       (3) since that discussion has just begun, Congress should \n     not act now to foreclose policy options that could help \n     ensure Social Security solvency.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               LAUTENBERG (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 2243\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Biden, Mr. Roth, and Mr. \nTorricelli) proposed an amendment to the concurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING AMTRAK FUNDING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) on November 13, 1997 the Senate unanimously passed the \n     Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997, P.L. 105-134, \n     authorizing appropriations of $1,058,000,000 for FY99; \n     $1,023,000,000 for FY00, $989,000,000 for FY01; and \n     $955,000,000 for FY02, totaling $4.025 billion FY99-02;\n       (2) in P.L. 105-134 the Congress declared that ``intercity \n     rail passenger service is an essential component of a \n     national intermodal passenger transportation system'';\n       (3) section 201 of the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act \n     of 1997 has now statutorily formalized prior Congressional \n     directives to Amtrak to reach operating self-sufficiency by \n     fiscal year 2002;\n       (4) the Congress and the President, through enactment of \n     this legislation, have effectively agreed that Congress will \n     provide adequate funding to permit Amtrak to achieve the goal \n     of operating self-sufficiency;\n       (5) capital investment is critical to reducing operating \n     costs and increasing the quality of Amtrak service;\n       (6) capital investment is essential to improving Amtrak's \n     long-term financial health;\n       (7) the $2.2 billion provided to Amtrak through the \n     Taxpayer Relief Act is for the sole purpose of capital \n     expenditures and other qualified expenses and is intended to \n     supplement, not supplant, annual appropriations.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the assumptions underlying the functional totals in this \n     budget resolution assume that Congress and the Administration \n     will fulfill the intent of the Amtrak Reform and \n     Accountability Act of 1997 and appropriate sufficient funds \n     in each of the next five fiscal years for Amtrak to implement \n     its FY 1998-FY 2003 Strategic Business Plan, while preserving \n     the integrity of the $2.2 billion provided under the Taxpayer \n     Relief Act for the statutory purpose of capital investment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       DASCHLE AMENDMENT NO. 2244\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG (for Mr. Daschle) proposed an amendment to the \nconcurrent resolution, S.

EXERCISE OF RULEMAKING POWERS.\n\n       Congress adopts the provisions of this title--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such \n     they shall be considered as part of the rules of each House, \n     or of that House to which they specifically apply, and such \n     rules shall supersede other rules only to the extent that \n     they are inconsistent therewith; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change those rules (so far as they relate to \n     that House) at any time, in the same manner, and to the same \n     extent as in the case of any other rule of that House.\n\n              TITLE III--SENSE OF CONGRESS AND THE SENATE\n\n     SEC. 301. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON SAVING SOCIAL SECURITY \n                   FIRST.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the Social Security program, created in 1935 to provide \n     old-age, survivors, and disability insurance benefits, is one \n     of the most successful and important social insurance \n     programs in the United States, and has played an essential \n     role in reducing poverty among seniors;\n       (2) the Social Security system will face significant \n     pressures when the baby boom generation retires, which could \n     threaten the long-term viability of the program;\n       (3) Congress needs to act promptly to ensure that Social \n     Security benefits will be available when today's younger \n     Americans retire;\n       (4) under current budget law, the Federal budget is still \n     in deficit;\n       (5) to the extent that a budget surplus may someday \n     materialize in the future, current budget law and rules that \n     were established to ensure fiscal discipline, including caps \n     on discretionary spending and the pay-as-you-go system (which \n     requires that all new tax breaks and mandatory spending be \n     fully offset) would prevent Congress from using any projected \n     budget surplus; and\n       (6) President Clinton has called on Congress to save Social \n     Security first by taking action to reform and strengthen the \n     Social Security system, and by holding in reserve any \n     projected budget surpluses that may materialize in the future \n     rather than using them for new spending or tax breaks, while \n     Congress and the Administration work toward a long-term \n     solution for the challenges facing Social Security.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals in this resolution assume that, to \n     the extent that any budget surplus is realized in the future, \n     that surplus should not be decreased for any purpose other \n     than reducing the national debt, while Congress and the \n     Administration work together to ensure that Social Security \n     is financially sound over the long term and that it will be \n     available for future generations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  TORRICELLI AMENDMENTS NOS. 2245-2246\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG (for Mr. Torricelli) proposed two amendments to the \nconcurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE OF THE FUTURE OF SOCIAL SOCIAL \n                   SECURITY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Public confidence in the long-term viability of the \n     Social Security System is low, with opinion polls repeatedly \n     indicating that a majority of non-retired young adults do not \n     believe they will receive Social Security when they retire;\n       (2) In the year 2012, outlays for Old Age Survivors and \n     Disability Insurance will exceed its tax revenues;\n       (3) Early action by the Congress is needed in order to \n     strengthen public confidence in Social Security and address \n     the long-run actuarial deficit of the program;\n       (b) Sense of the Senate--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that:\n       (1) the Committee on Finance should at the earliest \n     possible date hold hearings on and begin consideration of \n     legislation to preserve the Social Security program and \n     ensure its long-run solvency; and that no policy options, \n     affecting either revenues, outlays, or the manner of \n     investment of funds, should be excluded from consideration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        BOND AMENDMENT NO. 2248\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Mr. Bond) proposed an amendment to the concurrent \nresolution, S.

This is not \n     a specific recommendation that any new program be added to \n     Medicare;\n       (2) the Federal Government should take all appropriate \n     steps to inform the public about the financial risks posed by \n     long-term care costs and about the need for families to plan \n     for their long-term care needs;\n       (3) the Federal Government should take all appropriate \n     steps to inform the public that Medicare does not cover most \n     long-term care costs and that Medicaid covers long-term care \n     costs only when the beneficiary has exhausted his or her \n     assets;\n       (4) the appropriate committees of the Senate, together with \n     the Department of Health and Human Services and other \n     appropriate Executive Branch agencies, should develop \n     specific ideas for encouraging Americans to plan for their \n     own long-term care needs; and\n       (5) the upcoming National Summit on Retirement Income \n     Savings should ensure that planning for long-term care is an \n     integral part of any discussion of retirement security.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               FAIRCLOTH (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 2251\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Mr. Faircloth, for himself, Mr. Domenici, Mrs. \nHutchison, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Thurmond, and Mr. \nKempthorne) proposed an amendment to the concurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING OUTLAY ESTIMATES OF \n                   THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE BUDGET.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created a new era for \n     federal spending and forced the Department of Defense to plan \n     on limited spending over the five year period from fiscal \n     year 1998 through 2002.\n       (2) The agreements forged under the Balanced Budget Act of \n     1997 specifically defined the available amounts of budget \n     authority and outlays, requiring the Department of Defense to \n     properly plan its future activities in the new, constrained \n     budget environment.\n       (3) The Department of Defense worked with the Office of \n     Management and Budget to develop a fiscal year 1999 budget \n     which complies with the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n       (4) Based on Department of Defense program plans and policy \n     changes, the Office of Management and Budget and the \n     Department of Defense made detailed estimates of fiscal year \n     1999 Department of Defense outlay rates to ensure that the \n     budget submitted would comply with the Balanced Budget Act of \n     1997.\n       (5) The Congressional Budget Office outlay estimate of the \n     fiscal year 1999 Department of Defense budget request exceeds \n     both the outlay limit imposed by the Balanced Budget Act of \n     1997 and the Office of Management and Budget's outlay \n     estimate, a disagreement which would force a total \n     restructuring of the Department of Defense's fiscal year 1999 \n     budget.\n       (6) The restructuring imposed on the Department of Defense \n     would have a devastating impact on readiness, troop morale, \n     military quality of life, and ongoing procurement and \n     development programs.\n       (7) The restructuring of the budget would be driven solely \n     by differing statistical estimate made by capable parties.\n       (8) In a letter dated March 31, 1998, the Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget identified multiple \n     differences between the Office of Management and Budget's \n     estimated outlay rates and the Congressional Budget Office's \n     estimated outlay rates.\n       (9) New information on Department of Defense policy changes \n     and program execution plans now permit the Office of \n     Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office to \n     reevaluate their initial projections of fiscal year 1999 \n     outlay rates.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the Sense of the Senate \n     that not later than April 22, 1998, the Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget, and Secretary of Defense, \n     and the Director of the Congressional Budget Office shall \n     complete discussions and develop a common estimate of the \n     projected fiscal year 1999 outlay rates for Department of \n     Defense accounts.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   SPECTER AMENDMENTS NOS. 2254-2256\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Mr. Specter) proposed three amendments to the \nconcurrent resolution, S.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON VA COMPENSATION AND POST-\n                   SERVICE SMOKING-RELATED ILLNESSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the President has twice included in his budgets not \n     permitting the program expansion that the Veterans \n     Administration (referred to as the ``VA'') is proposing to \n     allow post-service smoking-related illness to be eligible for \n     VA compensation;\n       (2) Congress has never acted on this program expansion;\n       (3) the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of \n     Management and Budget have concluded that this change in VA \n     policy would result in at least $10,000,000,000 in additional \n     costs to the VA;\n       (4) these increased number of claims and the resulting \n     costs may present undue delay and hardship on veterans \n     seeking claim review; and\n       (5) the programs expansion apparently runs counter to all \n     existing VA policy, including a statement by former Secretary \n     Brown that ``It is inappropriate to compensate for death or \n     disability resulting from veterans' personal choice to engage \n     in conduct damaging to their health.''.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the function totals and assumptions underlying this \n     resolution assume the following:\n       (1) The support of the President's proposal to not allow \n     post-service smoking related illnesses to be eligible for VA \n     compensation until the study annd report required by \n     paragraph (2) are completed.\n       (2) The Veterans Administration and the Office of \n     Management and Budget are jointly required to--\n       (A) jointly study (referred to in this section as the \n     ``study'') the VA General Counsel's determination (O.G.C. 2-\n     93) and the resulting actions to change the compensation \n     rules to include disability and death benefits for conditions \n     related to the use of tobacco products during service; and\n       (B) deliver an opinion as to whether illnesses resulting \n     from post-service smoking should be considered as a \n     compensable disability.\n       (3) The study should include--\n       (A) the estimated numbers of those filing such claims, the \n     cost resulting from such benefits, the time necessary to \n     review such claims, and how such a number of claims will \n     affect the VA's ability to review its current claim load;\n       (B) an examination of how the proposed change corresponds \n     to prior VA policy relating to post-service actions taken by \n     an individual; and\n       (C) what Federal benefits, both VA and non-VA, former \n     service members having smoking-related illnesses are eligible \n     to receive.\n       (4) The study shall be completed no later than July 1, \n     1999.\n       (5) The Veterans Administration shall report its finding to \n     the Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate and the \n     chairmen and ranking minority members of the Senate Budget \n     and Veterans' Affairs Committees.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               COVERDELL (AND SHELBY) AMENDMENT NO. 2262\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Mr. Coverdell, for himself and Mr. Shelby) proposed \nan amendment to the concurrent resolution, Senate Concurrent Resolution \n86, supra; as follows:\n\n       At the end of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON COLOMBIAN DRUG WAR \n                   HELICOPTERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) Colombia is the leading illicit drug producing country \n     in the Western Hemisphere;\n       (2) 80 percent of the world's cocaine originates in \n     Colombia;\n       (3) based on the most recent data of the Drug Enforcement \n     Administration (DEA), more than 60 percent of the heroin \n     seized in the United States originates in Colombia;\n       (4) in the last 10 years more than 4,000 officers of the \n     Colombian National Police have died fighting the scourge of \n     drugs;\n       (5) in one recent year alone, according to data of the \n     United States Government, the United States had 141,000 new \n     heroin users and the United States faces historic levels of \n     heroin use among teenagers between the ages of 12 and 17;\n       (6) once Colombian heroin is in the stream of commerce it \n     is nearly impossible to interdict because it is concealed and \n     trafficked in very small quantities;\n       (7) the best and most cost efficient method of preventing \n     Colombian heroin from entering the United States is to \n     destroy the opium poppies in the high Andes mountains where \n     Colombian heroin is produced;\n       (8) the elite anti-narcotics unit of the Colombian National \n     Police has the responsibility to eradicate both coca and \n     opium in Colombia, including the reduction and elimination of \n     cocaine and heroin production, and they have done a \n     remarkably effective job with the limited and outdated \n     equipment at their disposal;\n       (9) more than 40 percent of the anti-narcotics operations \n     of the Colombian National Police involve hostile ground fire \n     from narco-terrorists and 90 percent of such operations \n     involve the use of helicopters;\n       (10) the need for better high performance helicopters by \n     the Colombian National Police, especially for use in the high \n     Andes mountains, is essential for more effective eradication \n     of opium in Colombia;\n       (11) on December 23, 1997, one of the antiquated Vietnam-\n     era UH-1H Huey helicopters used by the Colombian National \n     Police in an opium eradication mission crashed in the high \n     Andes mountains due to high winds and because it was flying \n     above the safety level recommended by the original \n     manufacturer;\n\n[[Page S3001]]\n\n       (12) in the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and \n     Related Programs Appropriations Act, 1998 (Public Law 105-\n     118), amounts were appropriated for the procurement by the \n     United States for the Colombian National Police of three UH-\n     60L Blackhawk utility helicopters that can operate safely and \n     more effectively at the high altitudes of the Andes mountains \n     where Colombian opium grows at altitudes as high as 12,000 \n     feet;\n       (13) the Blackhawk helicopter is a high performance utility \n     helicopter, with greater lift capacity, that can perform at \n     the high altitudes of the Andes mountains, as well as survive \n     crashes and sustain ground fire, much better than any other \n     utility helicopter now available to the Colombian National \n     Police in the war on drugs;\n       (14) because the Vietnam-era Huey helicopters that the \n     United States has provided the Colombian National Police are \n     outdated and have been developing numerous stress cracks, a \n     sufficient number should be upgraded to Huey II's and the \n     remainder should be phased-out as soon as possible;\n       (15) these Huey helicopters are much older than most of the \n     pilots who fly them, do not have the range due to limited \n     fuel capacity to reach many of the expanding locations of the \n     coca fields or cocaine labs in southern Colombia, nor do they \n     have the lift capacity to carry enough armed officers to \n     reach and secure the opium fields in the high Andes mountains \n     prior to eradication;\n       (16) the elite anti-narcotics unit of the Colombian \n     National Police has a stellar record in respecting for human \n     rights and has received the commendation of a leading \n     international human rights group in their operations to \n     reduce and eradicate illicit drugs in Colombia;\n       (17) the narco-terrorists of Colombia have announced that \n     they will now target United States citizens, particularly \n     those United States citizens working with their Colombian \n     counterparts in the fight against illicit drugs in Colombia;\n       (18) a leading commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces \n     of Colombia (``FARC'') announced recently that the objective \n     of these narco-terrorists, in light of recent successes, will \n     be ``to defeat the Americans'';\n       (19) United States Government personnel in Colombia who fly \n     in these helicopters accompanying the Colombian National \n     Police on missions are now at even greater risk from these \n     narco-terrorists and their drug trafficking allies;\n       (20) in the last six months four anti-narcotics helicopters \n     of the Colombian National Police have been downed in \n     operations;\n       (21) Congress intends to provide the necessary support and \n     assistance to wage an effective war on illicit drugs in \n     Colombia and provide the equipment and assistance needed to \n     protect all of the men and women of the Colombian National \n     Police as well as those Americans who work side by side with \n     the Colombian National Police in this common struggle against \n     illicit drugs;\n       (22) the new Government of Bolivia has made a commitment to \n     eradicate coca and cocaine production in that country within \n     5 years;\n       (23) the United States should support any country that is \n     interested in removing the scourge of drugs from its \n     citizens; and\n       (24) Bolivia has succeeded, in large measure due to United \n     States assistance, in reducing acreage used to produce coca, \n     which is the basis for cocaine production.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the functional totals underlying

Police three UH-60L Blackhawk utility \n     helicopters solely for the purpose of assisting the Colombian \n     National Police to perform their responsibilities to reduce \n     and eliminate the production of illicit drugs in Colombia and \n     the trafficking of such illicit drugs, including the \n     trafficking of drugs such as heroin and cocaine to the United \n     States;\n       (2) if the President determines that the procurement and \n     transfer to the Colombian National Police of three UH-60L \n     Blackhawk utility helicopters is not an adequate number of \n     such helicopters to maintain operational feasibility and \n     effectiveness of the Colombian National Police, then the \n     President should promptly inform Congress as to the \n     appropriate number of additional UH-60L Blackhawk utility \n     helicopters for the Colombian National Police so that amounts \n     can be authorized for the procurement and transfer of such \n     additional helicopters; and\n       (3) assistance for Bolivia should be maintained at least at \n     the level assumed in the fiscal year 1998 budget submission \n     of the President and the Administration should act \n     accordingly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   SANTORUM AMENDMENTS NOS. 2263-2264\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Mr. Santorum)

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING MARKET ACCESS PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The Market Access Program (MAP) continues to be a vital \n     and important part of U.S. trade policy aimed at maintaining \n     and expanding U.S. agricultural exports, countering \n     subsidized foreign competition, strengthening farm income and \n     protecting American jobs. Further, the Senate finds that:\n       (A) The Market Access Program is specifically targeted \n     towards small business, farmer cooperatives and trade \n     associations.\n       (B) The Market Access Program is administered on a cost-\n     share basis. Participants, including farmers and ranchers, \n     are required to contribute up to 50 percent or more toward \n     the cost of the program.\n       (2) The Market Access Program has been a tremendous success \n     by any measure. Since the program was established, U.S. \n     agricultural exports have doubled. In FY 1997, U.S. \n     agricultural exports amounted to $57.3 billion, resulting in \n     a positive agricultural trade surplus of approximately $22 \n     billion, and contributing billions of dollars more in \n     increased economic activity and additional tax revenues.\n       (3) The Market Access Program has also helped maintain and \n     create needed jobs throughout the nation's economy. More than \n     one million Americans now have jobs that depend on U.S. \n     agricultural exports. Further, every billion dollars in \n     additional U.S. agricultural exports helps create as many as \n     17,000 or more new jobs.\n       (4) U.S. agriculture, including farm income and related \n     jobs, is more dependent than ever on maintaining and \n     expanding U.S. agricultural exports as federal farm programs \n     are gradually reduced under the FAIR Act of 1996.\n       (5) In addition to the Asian economic situation and \n     exchange rate fluctuations, U.S. agricultural exports \n     continue to be adversely impacted by continued subsidized \n     foreign competition, artifical trade barriers and other \n     unfair trade practices.\n       (6) The European Union (EU) and other foreign competitors \n     continue to heavily outspend the U.S. by more than 10 to 1 \n     with regard to export subsidies.\n       (A) In 1997, the EU budgeted $7.2 billion for export \n     subsidies aimed at capturing a larger share of the world \n     market at the expense of U.S. agriculture.\n       (B) EU and other foreign competitors also spent nearly $500 \n     million on market promotion activities. The EU, spends more \n     on wine promotion than the U.S. currently spends on all \n     commodities and related agricultural products.\n       (C) The EU has announced a major new initiative aimed at \n     increasing their exports to Japan--historically, the largest \n     single market for U.S. agriculture exports.\n\n[[Page S3002]]\n\n       (7) U.S. agriculture is the most competitive industry in \n     the world, but it can not and should not be expected to \n     compete alone against the treasuries of foreign governments.\n       (8) Reducing or eliminating funding for the Market Access \n     Program would adversely affect U.S. agriculture's ability to \n     remain competitive in today's global marketplace. A reduction \n     in U.S. agricultural exports would translate into lower farm \n     income, a worsening trade deficit, slower economic growth, \n     fewer export-related jobs, and a declining tax base.\n       (9) U.S. success in upcoming trade negotiations on \n     agriculture schedule to begin in 1999 depends on maintaining \n     an aggressive trade strategy and related policies and \n     programs. Reducing or eliminating the Market Access Program \n     would represent a form of unilateral disarmament and weaken \n     the U.S. negotiating position.\n       (10) The Market Access Program is one of the few programs \n     specifically allowed under the current Uruguay Round \n     Agreement.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that funding for the Market Access Program (MAP) should be \n     fully maintained as authorized and aggressively utilized by \n     the U.S. Department of Agriculture to encourage U.S. \n     agricultural exports, strengthen farm income, counter \n     subsidized foreign competition, and protect American jobs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  GRAMM (AND BIDEN) AMENDMENT NO. 2266\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI (for Mr. Gramm, for himself and Mr. Biden) proposed an \namendment to the concurrent resolution, S.

Mr. President, today is National Breast Cancer \nSurvivors Day and I want to take this opportunity to focus my \ncolleague's attention on the importance of continued research and early \ndetection efforts for this tragic disease.\n  Mr. President, one out of nine American women will suffer the tragedy \nof breast cancer. It is today the leading cause of death for women \nbetween the ages of 35 to 54.\n  Alaskan women are particularly vulnerable to this disease. We have \nthe second highest rate of breast cancer in the Nation. One in 7 Alaska \nwomen will get breast cancer and tragically it is the Number One cause \nof death among Native Alaskan women.\n  Mr. President, these tragic Alaska deaths are not inevitable. Health \nexperts agree that the best hope for lowering the death rate is early \ndetection and treatment. It is estimated that breast cancer deaths can \nbe reduced by 30 percent if all women avail themselves of regular \nclinical breast examination and mammography.\n  But for many Alaska women, especially native women living in one of \nour 230 remote villages, regular screening and early detection are \noften hopeless dreams.\n  For more than 20 years, my wife Nancy has recognized this problem and \ntried to do something about it. In 1974, she and a group of Fairbanks' \nwomen created the Breast Cancer Detection Center, for the purpose of \noffering mammographies to women in remote areas of Alaska--regardless \nof a woman's ability to pay.\n  Now, the Center uses a small portable mammography unit which can be \nflown to remote areas of Alaska, offering women in the most rural of \nareas easy access to mammographies at no cost. Additionally, the Center \nuses a 43-foot long, 14 foot high and 26,000 pound mobile mammography \nvan to travel through rural areas of Alaska. The van makes regular \ntrips, usually by river barge, to remote areas in Interior Alaska such \nas Tanana.\n  Julie Roberts, a 42-year-old woman of Tanana, who receives regular \nmammographies from the mobile mammography van, knows the importance of \nearly screening:\n\n       There's a lot of cancer here (in Tanana)--a lot of cancer. \n     That's why it's important to have the mobile van here . . . I \n     know that if I get checked, I can catch it early and can \n     probably save my life. I have three children and I want to \n     see my grandchildren.\n\n  I am proud to say that the Fairbanks Center now serves about 2,200 \nwomen a year and has provided screenings to more than 25,000 Alaska \nwomen in 81 villages throughout the state. To help fund the efforts of \nthe Fairbanks Center, each year Nancy and I sponsor a fishing \ntournament to raise money for the operation of the van and mobile \nmammography unit. After just three years, donations from the tournament \nhave totalled $830,000.\n  Mr. President, Nancy and I are committed to raising more funds for \nthis important program so that every woman in Alaska can benefit from \nthe advances of modern technology and reduce their risk of facing this \nkiller disease.\n  Mr. President on this day that we recognize survivors of breast \ncancer, I want take a moment to discuss legislation that I am \ncosponsoring with Senator D'Amato to end the practices of so-called \n``drive-through'' mastectomies.\n  In too many cases women who survive the trauma of a mastectomy are \nbeing forced to get out of the hospital only hours after their surgery. \nHow can medical care professionals allow this? Simply because many \ninsurance companies demand that the procedure of a mastectomy be \nconsidered an out-patient service.''\n  Here's the horror that many insurance companies cause:\n  Nancy Couchot, a 60 year old woman had a radical mastectomy at 11:30 \na.m. She was released from the hospital five hours-- even though she \nwas not able to walk or use the rest room without assistance.\n\n  Victoria Berck, had a mastectomy and lymph node removal at 7:30 a.m. \n7 hours late. She was given instructions on how to empty two drains \nattached to her body and sent home. Ms. Berck concludes, ``No civilized \ncountry in the world has a mastectomy as an out-patient service.''\n  Mr. President that is why I am proud to co-sponsor the Women's Health \nand Cancer Rights Act of 1997, which would put an end to the drive-\nthrough mastectomies.\n  Specifically, the Act will require health insurance companies to \nallow physicians to determine the length of a mastectomy patient's \nhospital stay according to medical necessity. In other\n\n[[Page S3009]]\n\nwords, the bill makes it illegal to punish a doctor for following good \nmedical judgment and sound medical treatment.\n  Another important provision of this bill ensures that mastectomy \npatients will have access to reconstructive surgery. Scores of women \nhave been denied reconstructive surgery following mastectomies because \ninsurers have deemed the procedure to be cosmetic'' and, therefore, not \nmedically necessary.\n  Mr. President, far too often breast cancer victims, who believe that \nthey have adequate health care coverage, are horrified when they learn \nthat reconstruction is not covered in their health plan.\n  In Alaska, of the 324 mastectomies and lumpectomies performed in \n1996, reconstruction only occurred on 11 of the patients. That means \nthat only 3.4% of women who have their breast removed have \nreconstructive surgery, compared to the national average of 23%.\n  Mr. President, the simple reason for this tragically low figure is \nsimple: women can't afford the procedure.\n  Breast reconstruction costs average about $5,000 for just the \nprocedure. If hospital, physician and other costs are included--the \ncosts escalate to around $15,000.\n  Dr. Sarah Troxel, of Providence hospital, the only doctor in the Mat-\nSu Valley who does breast reconstruction, states the importance of \nreconstruction:\n\n       Women who are unable to receive reconstructive surgery, \n     suffer from depression, a sense of loss, and need more cancer \n     survivor counseling . . . Additionally reconstructive surgery \n     can be preventative medicine--women who don't have \n     reconstructive surgery often develop other medical problems \n     or complications with their spine.\n\n  Mr. President, these issues are not partisan issues. We may have our \ndifferences regarding managing and financing health reform, but I think \nwe all endorse accessible and affordable health care that preserves \npatient choice and physician discretion. Cancer does not look to see \nthe politics of its victims.\n  It is my hope that we will adopt this legislation this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/01/senate-section/article/S3008-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3009]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE U.S. AIR FORCE RESERVE\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the United \nStates Air Force Reserve on its 50th Anniversary, which will be \ncelebrated across the country on April 14, 1998. The United States Air \nForce Reserve can trace its heritage back to the National Defense Act \nof 1916 which authorized a reserve corps of 2,300 officer and enlisted \naviators. In 1917, the War Department established the First Reserve \nAero Squadron. However, the Air Reserve was not formally established \nuntil after World War II.\n  On July 26, 1947, the National Security Act was signed into law by \nPresident Truman. This act established the United States Air Force as a \nseparate branch of our Nation's armed forces. On April 14, 1948, just \nseven months later, the U.S. Air Force Reserve was established. On \nApril 27, 1948, the Air Reserve was transferred to the Air Force. In \nOctober 1948, President Truman directed the services to revamp their \nreserve components. As a result, the Air Force established the position \nof Special Assistant to the Chief of Staff for Reserve Forces to \noversee the Air Reserve. The first person to fill this position was Lt. \nGen. Elwood R. Quesada. On December 1, 1948, the Air Force established \nthe Continental Air Command (CONAC) at Mitchell Air Force Base, New \nYork. The CONAC's mission was to administer all Air Reserve programs. \nAfter the establishment of the CONAC, the Air Reserve's mission became \nmore coherent and diversified.\n  Since its humble beginnings during World War I, the Air Force Reserve \nhas seen many dramatic changes as it has built itself into the world-\nclass force it is today. Over the past fifty years the men and women of \nthe Air Force Reserve have served with honor and distinction during the \n1961 Berlin Crisis and the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, and in the major \nconflicts of Korea, Vietnam and in the Persian Gulf. Major General \nRobert A. McIntosh, the Commander of the Air Force Reserve Command, \nrecently summarized the remarkable accomplishments of the Air Force \nReserve. He said, ``In five decades, we moved from a standby force, \ntraining on obsolete and war-weary airplanes, to a front-line force \nthat is more capable than the air forces of many nations. We are a role \nmodel for keeping unique capabilities in a military framework without \nspending the money that a large full-time military requires.''\n  As the Air Force Reserve celebrates its Golden Anniversary this \nmonth, we recognize that the Air Force Reserve truly does have a golden \nlegacy. It is a legacy that we should all take time to reflect upon and \nhonor. Regardless of any future threat our Nation may face, the Air \nForce Reserve will meet the challenge just as they always have. Air \nForce Reservists deserve the respect and gratitude of all Americans for \ntheir service and their sacrifice for our country. These volunteers \nexemplify daily their dedication to the ideals that make our country \ngreat.\n  In Michigan, the 927th Air Refueling Wing at Selfridge Air National \nGuard Base will celebrate the Air Reserve's 50th Anniversary. The 927th \nARW flies KC-135E Stratotankers to fulfill its mission of providing \nGlobal Reach for United States air power. The 927th has a rich history \nof service which includes missions in Vietnam, the Persian Gulf and \nBosnia. We in Michigan are very proud of the job the 927th is doing for \nour nation.\n  I know my Senate colleagues join me in celebrating the 50th \nAnniversary of the United States Air Force Reserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/01/senate-section/article/S3009-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3009-S3010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NATIONAL BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS' DAY\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to highlight to \nthe Senate and to the American people the importance of this day--\nNational Breast Cancer Survivors' Day--a day commemorating breast \ncancer awareness and the celebration of life.\n  Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women of all ages. \nThere is scarcely an American family that in some way has not been \ntouched by this disease. In fact, it is estimated that over 180,000 \nwomen and men are diagnosed with breast cancer and over 43,000 die from \nthe disease each year. Women have a 12 percent lifetime risk for \ndeveloping breast cancer, and one in 25 women will develop the disease \nby age 60. While these statistics are grim, today we pause to focus our \nattention on the hundreds of thousands of success stories--individuals \nwho have survived and even prospered despite breast cancer.\n  I salute every brave woman and man who has battled and beaten this \ndisease. Only someone who has had cancer can really know what it is \nlike--the fear, the doubt, and the often painful and debilitating \ntreatments and medical procedures. But beat it they have. And to those \nwho are still in the fight, I say: ``Hang in there. You can do it, and \nthe chances are ever greater that you will do it.''\n  When detected early and when confined to the breast, the five-year \nsurvival rate for this disease is over 95 percent. Mr. President, this \nis a remarkable statistic, and represents a dramatically improved \npicture than that of even a few years ago. It is also important to note \nthat, for the first time in years, the mortality rate for both \nCaucasian and African-American women is also declining. With continued \nadvancements in early detection and treatment procedures, and with the \ngrowing hope that a cure might be found in a matter of years, not \ndecades, women today certainly do have cause to celebrate.\n  But our work is far from done. I and many of my Senate and House \ncolleagues are doing all we can to ensure that adequate federal \nresources are being allocated to research, education, and treatment of \nbreast cancer. Through research grants and direct research conducted at \nthe National Institutes of Health, promising leads and even occasional \nbreakthroughs are being pursued with vigor by the best and brightest of \nthe medical and scientific worlds. We can of course do more, and I am \njoining many of my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee in \nsupporting a significant increase in the fiscal year 1999 budget for \nthe NIH so that this important work can move forward. Put simply, we \nwill not rest until a cure is found.\n  But until a cure is found, let me say to every woman in America that \nyou are your own best ally in the fight against breast cancer. Self-\nexams and\n\n[[Page S3010]]\n\nregular breast cancer screenings for high risk women and women over 40 \nis absolutely crucial. I was pleased that last year the National \nInstitutes of Health joined me and others in recognizing the importance \nof annual screening of women over 40, and the availability and \naffordability of mammography and other promising detection techniques \ncontinues to increase.\n  So today, I join my colleagues and all Americans in celebrating those \nwho have won the battle against breast cancer. We salute and celebrate \ntheir courage, optimism, and often selfless commitment to help those \nnewly diagnosed to overcome the challenges that lay ahead. Mr. \nPresident, these individuals are not just survivors, they are beacons \nof inspiration and hope for all of us. With the heart and spirit of \nthese survivors leading our way, I know that we will eventually win and \nconquer this disease. That will be the best Survivors' Day of all\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/01/senate-section/article/S3009-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            VIOLENT AND REPEAT JUVENILE OFFENDER ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the recent shootings outside a \nschool in Jonesboro, Arkansas, that left four young students and a \nteacher dead and scores of others wounded in both body and mind are \nshocking. Just over the last few months, we have seen deadly shootings \ncarried out by juveniles in rural communities in Kentucky, in \nMississippi and now in Arkansas. Clearly, juvenile crime is not just an \nurban problem. These shootings leave scars on the loved ones of those \nkilled and injured and on the communities involved that take a long \ntime to heal.\n  We may never fully comprehend how such crimes against children could \nbe executed by other children. But one thing should be clear: The issue \nof juvenile crime should not be used for cheap grandstanding or short-\nsighted political gain. We need to find constructive approaches to this \nproblem that builds upon past successes and respects the proper roles \nof State, local and Federal authorities.\n  In the last session, and again at the beginning of this session, I \nhave spoken about the need to address the nation's juvenile crime \nproblem on a bipartisan basis. Politicizing the juvenile crime problem \ndoes a disservice to the citizens in this country who want constructive \nresponses.\n  I have spoken about the need to address the flaws in the juvenile \ncrime bill, S. 10, which the Judiciary Committee voted on last summer. \nIn floor statements and in the extensive minority views included in the \nCommittee report, I have outlined those areas in which this bill needs \nsignificant improvement.\n  In short, the bill reported by the Committee to the Senate would \nmandate massive changes in the juvenile justice systems in each of our \nStates, and it would invite an influx of juvenile cases in Federal \ncourts around the country. The repercussions of this legislation would \nbe severe for any State seeking federal juvenile justice assistance. \nThe bill also removes core protections that have been in pace for 25 \nyears to keep juvenile offenders out of adult jails and away from the \nharmful influences of seasoned adult criminals.\n  The need for significant improvements to this bill is no secret. \nVirtually every editorial board to consider the bill has reached the \nsame conclusion. Just in recent days, the Philadelphia Inquirer \nconcluded that the bill ``is fatally flawed and should be rejected.'' \nOn Monday, March 23, the Los Angeles Times described the bill as \n``peppered with ridiculous poses and penalties'' and taking a ``rigid, \ncounterproductive approach.'' The Chattanooga Times, on March 14, \nlabeled the bill ``misguided'' with ``flaws so far-reaching that the \nbill requires substantial surgery.'' The Houston Chronicle, on March \n10, observed that this bill ``at the very least, needs serious \nrethinking.'' The Legal Times, on March 2, called S. 10 ``the crime \nbill no one likes.'' The St. Petersburg Times, on February 23, \ndescribed the bill as ``an amalgam of bad and dangerous ideas.'' A \nFebruary 10 opinion piece in the Baltimore Sun described S. 10 as a \n``radical'' and ``aberrant bill.''\n\n  The criticisms leveled at S. 10 are, unfortunately, well-deserved. \nConsequently, eight months after this bill was voted out of Committee, \nthe Committee held a belated hearing on some of the new controversial \nmandates in the bill. At that hearing, on March 9, Senator Sessions \nannounced a number of changes that he planned to make to the new \njuvenile record-keeping and fingerprinting mandates in the bill. I had \nrecommended a number of these changes during Judiciary Committee mark-\nup of the bill, and I am pleased that, finally, my cautions are being \nheeded.\n  I will be glad to see removed the requirement of photographing every \njuvenile upon arrest for an act that would have been a felony if \ncommitted by an adult, and the new fingerprinting and record-keeping \nmandates limited to felony acts that occur in the future.\n  I continue to oppose the imposition of these new requirements as \nmandates. These mandates will cost States more to implement than they \ncan hope to receive in federal assistance. Those who believe that $250 \nmillion over 5 years, or $50 million per year, will be sufficient to \npay for the record-keeping mandates in S. 10 have not studied the \ncomprehensive report recently released by the National Center for \nJuvenile Justice and that the bill, as currently drafted, would cost \nthe states far more than that, especially through its new \nfingerprinting and record-keeping mandates.\n  Many of the States are way ahead of the federal government in finding \ninnovative ways to address juvenile crime and need resource assistance, \nand not bullying, from Washington. They need help to do what they \ndecide is the right balance.\n  While it is a better practice to hold hearings and examine issues \nbefore legislation is voted on and reported out of committee, I look \nforward to working with Senators Hatch and Sessions to improve this \npackage, now that the bill has been reported but finds itself off the \nmain track and stalled on a siding. I again urge the sponsors of this \nlegislation not to politicize the important issue of juvenile crime but \nto work in an open, fair and bipartisan way to make S. 10 a better bill \nthat will truly do what we all say we want it do to: Reduce youth \ncrime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/01/senate-section/article/S3010-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3010-S3011]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ASYLUM\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concerns \nabout the implementation of the immigration laws that Congress passed \nin 1996, since we are fast approaching an important deadline. Today is \nthe deadline for those immigrants who have lived in the United States \nfor one year who wish to apply for political asylum.\n  The concerns I raised and shared during the debate on the 1996 \nImmigration bill are even more relevant today. People who have the most \ncredible asylum claims--those under threat of retaliation, those \nsuffering physical or mental disability, possibly as a result of \ntorture they endured in their home country--may find themselves barred \nfrom ever applying for asylum if they miss this deadline.\n  To protect those who flee persecution and abuse and seek refuge in \nthe United States, the INS should, at the very least, promulgate a \nfinal rule that includes the broad ``good cause'' exceptions from the \nSenate-passed version of the 1996 immigration law. Senators Kennedy, \nFeingold, and I sent a letter on February 12, 1998 to INS urging that \nthe final rule include the Senate's more expansive definition of ``good \ncause'' exceptions for missing that deadline.\n  The INS should not issue regulations that might exclude the very \napplicants that the concept of asylum was meant to include. For this \nreason, our letter urges INS to promulgate a final rule that adopts the \nSenate's entire definition of ``good cause'' for missing the one-year \nfiling deadline:\n\n       ``Good cause'' may include, but is not limited to, [1] \n     circumstances that changed after the applicant entered the \n     United States and that are relevant to the applicant's \n     eligibility for asylum; [2] physical or mental disabilities; \n     [3] threats of retribution against the applicant's relatives \n     abroad; [4] attempts to file affirmatively that were \n     unsuccessful because of technical defects; [5] efforts to \n     seek asylum that were delayed by the temporary unavailability \n     of professional assistance; [6] the illness or death of the \n     applicant's legal representative; or [7] other extenuating \n     circumstances as determined by the Attorney General. [Section \n     193 of Senate bill; *numbers added for reference].\n\n  Mr. President, the very least our country should offer these victims \nof\n\n[[Page S3011]]\n\npersecution, are clearly and fairly stated exceptions to this one-year \nfiling deadline.\n  My second concern is that the implementation of the summary exclusion \nor expedited removal provisions of the new immigration law may prove to \nbe even more harmful to those who flee from persecution and seek refuge \nin the United States. When this bill was being debated in 1996, Senator \nLeahy and I sponsored an amendment that would have limited such \nexpedited removal procedures to only emergency situations. While that \namendment passed by one vote in the Senate, it unfortunately did not \nsurvive in conference.\n  I said in May of 1996, and I still believe today, that victims of \npolitically motivated torture and rape are the very ones who are most \nlikely to have to resort to the use of false documents to flee from \nrepressive governments--yet the use of such fraudulent documents \nsubjects them to summary exclusion under the 1996 law.\n  I also remain concerned that while the INS may instruct its \ninspectors not to assess the credibility of an asylum claim--but \ninstead refer the claim to an asylum officer--who can say how this \nprocess is actually being implemented nationwide at all of our 260 \nports of entry? Other outside agencies are not permitted to monitor \nthis process. Some credible cases are being assessed at secondary \ninspection sites by INS officials who are not trained asylum officers. \nAs a result, I urge the Attorney General to appoint someone from her \noffice to oversee the functioning of secondary inspection sites to \nensure that anyone stating a fear of persecution or abuse is not forced \nonto the next plane back to his or her persecutors.\n\n  DOJ oversight could also prevent future inhumane actions--cases of \nphysical and mental abuse that some INS officials have allegedly \ninflicted on asylum seekers who are shackled to benches at JFK \nAirport--or at least provide accountability for a process sorely \nlacking such oversight. A man from Somalia, Mohamoud Farah, who was \nrecently granted asylum, yesterday described his ordeal during a press \nconference sponsored by the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights. I will \nask that his full statement be printed in the Record at the conclusion \nof my remarks, but I will highlight some of it now. While Mohamoud \nendured 14 and a half hours shackled to a chair at JFK Airport, without \nfood or water or even restroom breaks, he experienced abuse from INS \nofficials and saw them abuse others who had been detained in the \nsecondary inspection waiting area.\n  Being kicked, cursed at, and shackled to a chair is not how any of us \nenvision proper treatment of people who seek refuge in our great \nnation--in fact, I imagine that kind of treatment as only occurring at \nthe hands of the persecutors in the very countries from which these \nrefugees flee.\n  Finally, I am concerned about the consistency with which INS \nimplements its own rules and regulations in compliance with the 1996 \nimmigration law. For example, in the General Accounting Office's report \nthat was sent to me yesterday, the GAO describes inconsistencies among \nthe eight asylum offices in the process of conducting ``credible fear'' \ninterviews. Some offices failed to document whether a required \nparagraph on torture was read to the asylum seeker, or whether \nquestions about torture were asked. I am concerned about these \ninconsistencies--especially since information about torture would \nprovide a solid basis on which to grant asylum.\n  INS should also be consistent in allowing for effective \nrepresentation when an asylum applicant appears before an immigration \njudge. This means that immigration judges should allow the attorney or \nrepresentative of the asylum seeker to participate at the hearing by \nspeaking or asking questions.\n  The right to have a trained asylum officer hear an asylum claim or to \nhave counsel speak during a review hearing before an immigration judge \nshould be a consistent right of all asylum seekers--not just a right \nthat depends on which airport a person lands in or which immigration \njudge that person ends up appealing to.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, the Senate must remain vigilant in its \noversight duties if we want to keep our asylum system working. We have \nto remember that there's a reason for having an asylum system in the \nfirst place--and that is to keep the torch of liberty lit for truly \noppressed people. This is a basic American value, and America should \nnot turn its back on this fundamental principle.\n  I ask that the statement of Mohamoud Farah be printed in the Record.\n  The statement follows:\n\n                      Statement of Mohamoud Farah\n\n        (represented by the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS))\n\n       I arrived at JFK airport in New York City on October 31, \n     1997, on an Egypt Air flight from Cairo. When the plane \n     landed, I informed someone at the airport that I was a \n     refugee without a visa to enter the United States. I \n     overheard this person tell a uniformed INS officer that I was \n     ``illegal''. This INS officer insulted me, cursed at me, and \n     asked me why I came to the United States. He pushed me \n     backwards, and I fell down. Before I knew what was happening, \n     three or four INS officers were putting shackles on my arms \n     and legs. They bound my wrists and ankles to the legs of a \n     chair. As the shackle was short, I was forced to lean forward \n     in an uncomfortable position. The officers yelled and cursed \n     at me. One of them pulled my ear. I tried to explain that I \n     was a refugee from Somalia, but they just continued to shout. \n     I saw the officers kick some other people, who were then \n     taken away.\n       I remained shackled to the chair, leaning forward, for \n     fourteen and a half hours. During that time, despite my \n     requests, I was not given any food or water, nor was I \n     allowed to use the restroom. I saw two shift changes take \n     place while I was still bound to the chair. At one point, \n     employees from Egypt Air came with my luggage and ticket and \n     said they were trying to send me back. I was afraid that if I \n     were sent to Egypt, I might be put in jail. I told them I \n     would rather be in jail in the United States.\n       They eventually sent me to another office where someone \n     from INS began to take a statement from me about why I left \n     Somalia. This statement would be used by the Immigration \n     Judge in my proceedings. I was expected to discuss very \n     painful experiences with the same people who were being \n     abusive to me. This interview took a long time, as there was \n     another shift change, and a new officer had to finish the \n     statement. After they took the statement, I had to wait in \n     that office for three more hours. I still was not allowed \n     water or given permission to use the restroom. Finally, I was \n     transported to the detention facility, near the airport in \n     Queens, NY, at about 3:30 a.m. At that point, I was finally \n     able to have some water and use the restroom, but received no \n     food until lunch the next day. In the detention center, I \n     began the process of applying for asylum in the United \n     States. I was represented by Olga Narymsky, an attorney with \n     the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (HIAS). After 101 days in \n     detention, on February 9, 1998, I was granted political \n     asylum.\n       I never expected that I would be treated this way in the \n     United States. I know America is a great nation and that the \n     way I was treated is not normal. I hope that by telling my \n     story, I can help prevent anyone else from having to endure \n     what happened when I arrived seeking refuge in this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/01/senate-section/article/S3010-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3011-S3012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH, EXTENSION AND EDUCATION REFORM\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am here to support the Senator \nfrom Iowa in asking that we be allowed to vote on S. 1150, so that we \nmay provide crop insurance to the farmers in this country and begin to \nrestore food stamps to some legal immigrants who lost eligibility under \nwelfare reform. It is a bill financed primarily by funds from reducing \nthe federal dollars for the administration of food stamps and provides \nthe perfect opportunity to start correcting the mistakes made under \nwelfare reform in denying legal immigrants access to the food stamp \nprogram. In addition it could allow full funding for crop insurance for \nnext year and beyond. The only way Congress could avoid leaving farmers \nexposed in this way, would be to provide significant increases to crop \ninsurance during the appropriation process. It will be incredibly \ndifficult to increase crop insurance through the appropriations process \nbecause of the tight discretionary caps and the tremendous pressure on \nall programs.\n  As currently drafted, S. 1150 would provide just over $800 million \nfor FY1999-FY2003 to restore benefits to approximately 250,000 people. \nThat is less than a third of those who lost their eligibility under \nwelfare reform. It is a step in the right direction and we as the \nSenate should have the right to vote on this legislation.\n  We are not a country built on denying food to children and their \nparents. Yet that is essentially what we did when we passed Welfare \nReform. Estimates suggest that around 900,000 legal\n\n[[Page S3012]]\n\nimmigrants lost their eligibility. In addition, 600,000 citizen \nchildren with legal immigrant parents have seen their family's food \nstamps reduced. Denying access to nutrition will indeed affect \nchildren. It might be in terms of reducing children's food or it might \nbe in terms of family dynamics, job performance or children's \naccomplishments. The reality is food is a basic need that if lost or \nreduced has rippling effects on a family.\n  The legislation that has been stopped would, if passed, begin to \nreturn food stamps to the neediest of those immigrants who lost \neligibility under welfare reform: children, elderly and disabled. In \naddition it extends eligibility of asylees and refugees from 5 to 7 \nyears to allow them the time required to apply for citizenship. The \nremaining $1.1 billion would ensure the much needed funding for crop \ninsurance and increase the much needed funds for agriculture research. \nAgriculture research funds are critical to improving food safety and \nproviding a better quality food supply for all consumers. I encourage \nthe President to allow the Senate to vote on this legislation so that \nwe may improve food stamp eligibility to legal immigrants and ensure \ncrop insurance to our farmers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/01/senate-section/article/S3011-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONGRATULATING TUBBY SMITH\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a \nnative son of Southern Maryland, Tubby Smith, who, as a first year head \ncoach, led the Kentucky Wildcats to victory in this year's NCAA \nBasketball Tournament. This event is a historic one as Tubby Smith \nbecomes only the third African-American to coach an NCAA men's \nchampionship basketball team at an institution that, at one time, did \nnot allow African-Americans students to participate in basketball. It \nis for these reasons that I am particularly proud to congratulate Tubby \nSmith, a fellow small-town Marylander, on behalf of athletes and \ncitizens nationwide who appreciate the value of opportunity and \nvictory. Mr. President, I ask that an article on Tubby Smith, his \nfamily and life in Scotland, St. Mary's County, Maryland from the April \n1, 1998 edition of the Washington Post be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Apr. 1, 1998]\n\n             In St. Mary's, a Champion's Family Celebrates\n\n                         (By Jessie Mangaliman)\n\n       In the modest one-story cinder-block home in Scotland near \n     St. Mary's County's southernmost point, Tubby Smith's large \n     family--he has 16 brothers and sisters, 10 of whom still live \n     in Southern Maryland, and 38 nieces, nephews, grandnieces and \n     grandnephews--gathered yesterday at the family home to \n     celebrate a victory by one of their own.\n       It was family-style: in the kitchen over a cup of coffee or \n     in the den in front of a television tuned to a sports \n     channel.\n       But in some ways, this victory encompasses a larger family. \n     That's because Tubby Smith, the winning coach of the NCAA \n     champion University of Kentucky Wildcats, was the first \n     African American coach of a school that once barred blacks \n     from playing on its basketball team. On Monday, he brought \n     honor to that school and the country when his team, which \n     included his son, Saul, won the national basketball title, \n     defeating Utah 78-69.\n       ``I think he's proved them all wrong,'' said his jubilant \n     sister Ramona Smith, who lives in Scotland, the tiny farming \n     community of several hundred people six miles from the \n     Chesapeake Bay. ``He's made a believer out of everybody. His \n     coaching record speaks for itself; he just happens to be \n     black.''\n       ``Yes, my God, we are proud of Tubby Smith,'' declared \n     Frank Dove, manager of the Mixx Lounge and Grill in Dameron, \n     a nearby community, where more than 100 of Smith's friends \n     gathered Monday night to watch the game and toast him in his \n     victory. A sign outside the lounge on Route 235 proclaimed: \n     ``Congratulations, Tubby Smith.''\n       ``You can't help but smile to think that Tubby, who is \n     liked by everyone here, came from being a farm boy to what he \n     is now. We are proud,'' said Dove, who opened the lounge, \n     usually closed on Mondays, to Smith's friends and family.\n       ``You want to talk about the coach of the year? He's my \n     coach of the year . . . for life,'' said William Smith, one \n     of Tubby Smith's younger brothers who joined the crowd at the \n     Mixx.\n       ``He's the greatest!'' said Guffrie Smith Sr., Smith's \n     father, who worked three jobs while helping to raise his \n     family: He drove a school bus, fired boilers at Patuxent \n     River Naval Air Station and barbered.\n       Guffrie, 79, and Parthenia, 72, still live in the five-\n     bedroom home where Tubby grew up. Guffrie, with the help of \n     his uncle, a share-cropper, built that house in 1963 so that \n     the family could move out of a farmhouse that lacked indoor \n     plumbing.\n       The Kentucky coach might be known as Tubby--the young boy \n     who liked sitting in his grandmother's wash bin so much that \n     he didn't want to leave--but his given name is Orlando.\n       ``He was an obedient child,'' Parthenia Smith said. \n     ``Weekdays he went to school, and on Sundays he went to \n     church. He was not allowed to play ball on Sundays.''\n       But he was also a hard-working child, said Dove, who has \n     known Tubby since he was an infant. Even at a young age, he \n     helped his father plant fruits and vegetables on the family's \n     five acres of land.\n       ``The whole family is like that--a churchgoing, hard-\n     working good family. That's the bottom line,'' Dove said. \n     Yesterday afternoon at the Smith home, there was only one \n     subject of conversation: Tubby.\n       ``Every time Tubby came on, somebody holled, `Tubby's on!' \n     '' said Ramona Smith, a guidance counselor at Great Mills \n     High School. ``We're still flying high, and we haven't quite \n     calmed down yet.''\n       Neither Guffrie nor Parthenia finished high school, but \n     from the beginning, education was one of the family's most \n     important values, the parents said. It paid off, Guffrie \n     Smith Sr. said yesterday, for most of his 17 children have \n     college degrees, including Tubby.\n       ``He called last night after the game, and he said, `Hey, \n     Mama, did you see me on TV? I told him, yeah and I thanked \n     the Lord [for the win] because I was so nervous,'' said \n     Parthenia Smith, who conceded that she could not stop smiling \n     in disbelief.\n       At Great Mills High, Tubby Smith scored 1,000 points in \n     three seasons before graduating, helping unite a racially \n     divided school in 1967 with his athleticism, according to his \n     brother Odell, who was in Texas to watch the game Monday \n     night.\n       Tubby Smith played for four years at High Point University \n     in North Carolina. Then he coached in high schools, including \n     at Great Mills. One of his college coaches, J.D. Barnett, \n     later hired him as an assistant at Virginia Commonwealth \n     University. Barnett went on to the University of Tulsa, where \n     he was fired as head coach and replaced by Smith in 1991.\n       Under Smith's coaching, Tulsa went to the middle rounds of \n     the NCAA tournament. He went to the University of Georgia in \n     1995, leading his teams to two NCAA tournaments.\n       Last year when Smith became the first African American \n     coach of the men's team at the University of Kentucky, a \n     paper there published an open letter from a black staff \n     member warning him that the school was not ready for a black \n     coach. ``I fear for your safety,'' she wrote.\n       ``There are good and bad people everywhere you go,'' \n     Parthenia Smith said. ``I told him that I didn't like what \n     she said. But that made me nervous more than anything else.''\n       ``He's a good man,'' Smith's father said. ``The boys \n     believe in him.''\n       Guffrie Smith, who has had multiple bypass surgery, said he \n     had no doubt his son would come through a champion, but the \n     thrill of Monday night's game was too much for his heart.\n       At halftime, when the Wildcats were behind 10 points, \n     Guffrie Smith stood up, paced around the living room and the \n     shut himself in the bedroom. He came out only after the \n     Wildcats had won.\n       After the game Monday night, Tubby Smith said: ``It's \n     obviously something that is special. It's probably the most \n     noteworthy thing that has happened in our family as far as \n     family achievements.\n       Smith said he plans to visit his family in St. Mary's \n     County in the next several days.\n       On national television, he thanked his relatives in St. \n     Mary's because he knew they were watching. The family \n     gathered at the Mixx lounge hooted and hollered, toasting \n     with champagne.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/01/senate-section/article/S3012-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3012-S3013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN WOLVERINES\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nUniversity of Michigan Wolverines on the completion of a perfect 1997 \nfootball season. In September, the Wolverines began one of the toughest \nschedules in the Big Ten. The team was prepared to play some of the \nstrongest teams in NCAA football. From their first victory against \nColorado (27-3) to their last game of the season against Ohio State \n(20-14), Michigan dominated the field, surrendering few touchdowns with \ntheir top-rated defense. By November, the Wolverines had finished their \nregular season undefeated, with a Big Ten Championship, a Rose Bowl \nberth and their first chance at a National Championship in fifty years.\n  In January, the Michigan Wolverines faced the Washington State \nCougars in the 1998 Rose Bowl. Although the University of Michigan has \nmore Rose Bowl appearances than any other Big Ten school, the \nWolverines were appearing in Pasadena for the first time in five years. \nSenior quarterback Brien Griese led the team with 18 for 30 passing for \n251 yards and three touchdowns. The Wolverines celebrated a 21-16 \nvictory over Washington State, giving\n\n[[Page S3013]]\n\nthem their ninth straight win against opponents ranked in the \nAssociated Press Top 10 and finishing with a perfect 12-0 season.\n  The Rose Bowl victory clinched the Wolverines the Associated Press \nNational Championship trophy and secured the co-national championship. \nThe season became even sweeter for the Wolverines when University of \nMichigan junior Charles Woodson won the 1997 Heisman Trophy, football's \nmost prestigious individual honor, and head coach Lloyd Carr was \nrecognized as Coach of the Year. 1997 was undoubtedly an outstanding \nyear for Michigan football, and possibly the best in school history. On \nApril 9, President Bill Clinton will honor the University of Michigan \nWolverines at the White House for their extraordinary athletic \naccomplishments and remarkable teamwork. I extend my heartiest \ncongratulations to the University of Michigan football team on a \nperfect 1997 season--Let's Go Blue!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/01/senate-section/article/S3012-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3013-S3014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   UNITED NATIONS INTERNATIONAL DAY IN SUPPORT OF VICTIMS OF TORTURE\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would like to call the \nSenate's attention to a recent initiative that addresses a very \nimportant international issue: the use of torture. At its last session, \nthe United Nations General Assembly decided to proclaim June 26th as \n``United Nations International Day in Support of Victims of Torture.'' \nThe General Assembly proclaimed the day ``with a view to the total \neradication of torture and the effective functioning of the Convention \nagainst Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \nPunishment, which entered into force on 26 June 1987.'' Governments and \nnon-governmental organizations are developing plans on how to observe \nthis day in a manner that will recognize the needs of torture victims \nand the necessity of preventing torture.\n  Torture is a most effective weapon against democracy. Torture victims \nare often in the forefront of the struggle for human rights and \ndemocracy in their own country. The advocates for these ideals are \ntortured in order to disable them and instill fear in anyone who might \naspire for human rights and democracy. As a refuge for the persecuted, \nthe United States may have as many as 400,000 victims of torture. They \ncome from all regions of the world. Many come from Iraq, Iran, China, \nEthiopia, Liberia, El Salvador, Guatemala and many other countries too \nnumerous to mention. Because of their experience with torture, they \noften have special difficulties applying for asylum and adjusting to a \nnew country. They must overcome the physical and mental effects of \ntorture--the latter often requiring months or years of therapy. \nNightmares, flashbacks, anxiety attacks, and depression are just some \nof the mental consequences of torture. In some cases it may be years \nbefore the victim recognizes that treatment is necessary to overcome \nthese psychological roadblocks.\n  Plans are being made around the world to recognize the contribution \nof torture victims. In Denmark, the International Rehabilitation \nCouncil for Torture Victims and the Rehabilitation and Research Centre \nfor Torture Victims are planning a series of event and activities. In \nGreece, where torture was prevalent not so many years ago, the Medical \nRehabilitation Center for Torture Victims (MRCT) will hold an event at \nwhat was, during the dictatorship, the Special Interrogating Unit of \nthe Military Police (a notorious torture and detention center). The \nbuilding is now used for historical memorial purposes, and symbolically \nthe area has been renamed Park of Freedom. A variety of activities are \nplanned, including speeches by torture victims and refugees.\n  I am very proud that the first and most comprehensive treatment \ncenter for victims of torture in the United States, the Center for \nVictims of Torture, is located in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It now treats \nan average of 150 clients a year who come from all regions of the world \nand are now settled in Minnesota. Many of the Center's clients and \nformer clients are now making significant contributions to our \ncommunities and we are grateful to have them. The Center is planning a \nspecial event for June 26th.\n  Mr. President, on February 4th I introduced the Torture Victims \nRelief Act (S.1606). My bill is co-sponsored by Senators Tom Harkin, \nEdward Kennedy, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Barbara Boxer, Byron Dorgan, \nand Richard Durbin. The legislation provides a focus and a framework of \nthe debate about where torture survivors, and our response to the \npractice of torture by other countries, fit within our foreign policy \npriorities. Providing treatment for torture survivors is one of the \nbest ways we can show our commitment to fighting human rights abuses \naround the world.\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge this administration and this Congress \nto undertake activities on June 26th to recognize the important \ncontributions torture victims have made on behalf of human rights and \ndemocracy and the contributions they have made to our country as well. \nI suggest that President Clinton invite some torture victims to attend \na ceremony at the White House where they would be recognized for their \ncontributions. The invitees should be from countries representing a \nwide geographic and political distribution.\n  On that occasion the President could announce some initiatives the \nadministration is taking to support torture victims and prevent \ntorture. I would suggest that the President consider taking the \nfollowing initiatives: (1) Increase the U.S. contribution to the United \nNations Voluntary Fund from $1.5 million to $3.0 million, as \nrecommended in the conference report of the State Department \nauthorization bill; (2) Direct the Agency for International Development \nto set aside $5 million in fiscal year 1998 funds to assist treatment \ncenters for torture victims abroad; (3) Direct the Department of Health \nand Human Services to set aside $5 million in fiscal year 1998 funds to \nassist treatment centers for victims of torture in the United States; \nand (4) Announce administration support for the Torture Victims Relief \nAct (S. 1606).\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to mention the valuable \ncontribution being made by the United Nations Voluntary Fund for \nVictims of Torture. It provides financial assistance to treatment \ncenters for victims of torture throughout the world. These centers are \nproviding both an essential humanitarian assistance program as well as \nan important strategic instrument for advancing human rights and \ndemocracy around the world. In 1997 the Fund assisted 104 projects in \nabout 70 countries on a budget of little more than $3 million dollars. \nAn article that appeared in Human Rights, a publication initiated by \nthe new U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mary Robinson, tells \nwhy we need to increase our contribution to the Fund. I ask that the \ntext of the article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                   U.N. Support to Victims of Torture\n\n                          (By Daniel Premont)\n\n       Torture continues to occur on a worldwide basis, despite \n     enhanced efforts by Governments and organizations in keeping \n     with provisions contained in domestic law and international \n     human rights conventions whose objective is its total \n     eradication.\n       The practice of torture was first prohibited in 1948 by the \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights and by the \n     International Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of \n     the Crime of Genocide; the concept was reaffirmed in 1966 by \n     the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; and \n     more recently, in 1984, by the Convention against Torture and \n     Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.\n\n\n           what is the voluntary fund for victims of torture?\n\n       The effects of torture should not be under-estimated. \n     Physical and mental consequences of torture can endure for \n     several years and may be irreversible, often affecting not \n     only thousands of victims themselves, but also their \n     relatives. One of the means of mitigating the subsequent \n     effects of torture on victims and their families is to \n     provide them with medical, psychological, social, legal and \n     economic aid. With this in mind, the General Assembly created \n     the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture in \n     1982. The purpose of the Fund is to receive voluntary \n     contributions and distribute them to non-governmental \n     organizations and treatment centres for assisting victims of \n     torture and their relatives whose human rights have been \n     severely violated as a result of torture, as well as for the \n     funding of projects for training healthcare professionals \n     specialized in the treatment of victims of torture.\n       The Fund is administered by the United Nations Secretary-\n     General with a Board of\n\n[[Page S3014]]\n\n     Trustees acting in an advisory capacity and comprising five \n     members with wide experience in the field of human rights. \n     The members serve in their personal capacity and are \n     appointed by the Secretary-General for a renewable three-year \n     term of office on the basis of equitable geographical \n     distribution. Currently, members of the Board of Trustees are \n     Jaap Walkate, Chairman, from The Netherlands; Ribot Hatano \n     from Japan; Elisabeth Odio-Benito from Costa Rica; Ivan \n     Tosevsky from the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; and \n     Amos Wako from Kenya.\n       The inadequacy of available resources is a limiting factor \n     in the field of assistance of victims; as a consequence, \n     programmes of assistance are subjected to interruptions. For \n     some 100 organisations the support of the United Nations \n     Voluntary Fund remains essential.\n\n\n                   how does the voluntary fund work?\n\n       The Fund receives projects which focus on providing \n     medical, psychological, economic, social and legal assistance \n     to victims of torture and to members of their families. A \n     few projects also share the objective of organizing \n     training seminars for health professionals specialized in \n     the treatment of torture victims.\n       Each May, the Board of Trustees makes recommendations on \n     grants to the High Commissioner for Human Rights. \n     Subsequently, in the following month, on the basis of those \n     recommendations, the High Commissioner takes decisions on \n     behalf of the Secretary-General. As a final step, grants are \n     made available at the end of July.\n       From 1983 to July 1997, the Fund has financed 255 projects \n     for direct assistance to torture victims. From US$ 2.5 to US$ \n     3 million of voluntary contributions received from about 30 \n     Governments and a few individuals are disbursed every year to \n     projects in some 60 countries representative of all the \n     regions of the world. Further information on the activities \n     of the Voluntary Fund can be found in the latest annual \n     reports of the Secretary-General to the General Assembly (UN \n     document A/52/387) and to the Commission on Human Rights (UN \n     documents E/CN.4/1998/37 and Add.1).\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                      Additional\n                                                                    Grants       Grants     Percent     amount\n                                                                  requested     awarded     granted    required\n                                                                    (US$)        (US$)                  (US$)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1997...........................................................    6,800,000  \\1\\ 3,036,0    44.64     3,765,946\n                                                                                       54\n1996...........................................................    5,618,645  \\1\\ 2,535,5    45.1      3,083,145\n                                                                                       00\n1995...........................................................    5,827,645  \\1\\ 2,719,6    46.6      3,107,965\n                                                                                       80\n1994...........................................................    5,476,959  \\1\\ 3,698,0    67.5      1,778,879\n                                                                                       80\n1993...........................................................    5,289,413  \\1\\ 2,111,8    39.9      3,177,533\n                                                                                       80\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Each year, the grants awarded correspond to the total amounts which the Board of Trustees is able to\n  recommend to the Secretary-General for allocation. In view of the insufficient contributions received, the\n  Board avoids the practice of carrying forward a reserve from one year to the next. The Secretary-General\n  follows this recommendation by the Board.\n \nAs at 30 November 1997 only US$ 1,174,499 has been paid into the Fund. Provided that the number of grant\n  requested is maintained at the 1997 level, the Fund will need an additional amount of US$ 5,6 million to meet\n  all requests.\n\n                    some projects recently submitted\n\n       Torture involves not only physical but also psychological \n     forms, sometimes with long-term sequelae: in this regard, the \n     Fund is supporting a project whose objective is to provide \n     global assistance to formerly disappeared children of victims \n     of torture in Latin America. The organization identifies \n     disappeared children as those born in detention, abducted by \n     security forces and illegally adopted. Once located by the \n     organization, the children may be returned to their \n     biological families. The best interests of the child have to \n     be taken into consideration. This project consists of two \n     main parts: investigation--some 1,030 interviews were carried \n     out in the past year in conjunction with blood tests and \n     analyses of genetic data--and psychological support provided \n     to some 431 persons during 1996. Most of these persons suffer \n     from sequelae of post-traumatic stress disorder including \n     anxiety, nightmares, depression, as well as affective and \n     intellectual inhibitions and benefit from individual \n     psychotherapy. The number of youths seeking assistance \n     remains high while many children have yet to be found: to \n     date, 172 children still need to be located and 6 who were \n     found have yet to be returned to their biological families.\n       Another project which was being implemented in Asia in 1996 \n     focused on providing physical and mental relief to torture \n     survivors and their families. Firstly, fact-finding \n     missions on the incidence of torture were carried out \n     establishing that people had been subjected to torture by \n     the police and other law enforcement agencies: this \n     involved methods such as beatings all over the body, \n     kicking them with police boots, applying electric shocks, \n     scalding them with hot water, suspending them by the legs \n     from roofs and inflicting them with bullet injuries. Long-\n     term consequences, apart from obvious physical complaints, \n     were psychological and included phobia, depression, sexual \n     problems and mental disorders. The more commonly occurring \n     complaints were social maladjustments at work, in the \n     family and society in general, through the overall loss of \n     social dignity and a departure from social values. In \n     1995, 263 victims between 15 and 45 years of age received \n     treatment. The drug therapy included prescription of \n     antipsychotics, physiotherapy as well as psychotherapeutic \n     assistance. Parallel to the main objective of providing \n     physical and mental relief to the victims, the Care Center \n     organized other activities such as seminars on torture for \n     health professionals, missions in collaboration with the \n     national Human Rights Commission in order to establish \n     contact with victims, encourage them to visit the Car \n     Center and prepare a report for submission to governmental \n     authorities asking for justice. The organization also \n     established a legal division which has already \n     successfully assisted in five cases.\n       In North America, a treatment centre is currently providing \n     clinical services to victims of torture who are now refugees, \n     mainly from Africa and the Caribbean. 167 persons were \n     assisted who had been subjected to rape, electric shocks, \n     deprivation of human needs, as well as being obliged to eat \n     excrement or perform acts of violence or murder often \n     targeting their own family members. The treatment provided \n     ranges from psychiatric and medical examination, to treatment \n     in the form of crisis intervention and support counselling, \n     psychotherapy, physiotherapy, social service, education, \n     medical referrals, social support interpreters and legal \n     assistance. In 1996, the center also established a children's \n     art therapy branch as a medium for treating anxiety and \n     dysfunctions related to traumatic experiences which children \n     were unable to express verbally in the family setting.\n       The Commission on Human Rights, by its resolution 1997/38 \n     of 11 April 1997, requested that the General Assembly \n     proclaim 26 June a United Nations international day in \n     support of the victims of torture and appealed to all \n     Governments, organizations and individuals in a position to \n     do so to contribute annually to the Fund.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/01/senate-section/article/S3013-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "01", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3014]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      1998 APRIL QUARTERLY REPORTS\n\n  The mailing and filing date of the April Quarterly Report required by \nthe Federal Election Campaign Act, as amended, is Wednesday, April 15, \n1998.

The Convention will \nnot require implementing legislation for the United States.\n  The Convention should be an effective tool to assist in the \nhemispheric effort to combat corruption, and could also enhance the law \nenforcement efforts of the States Parties in other areas, given the \nlinks that often exist between corruption and organized criminal \nactivity such as drug trafficking. The Convention provides for a broad \nrange of cooperation, including extradition, mutual legal assistance, \nand measures regarding property, in relation to the acts of corruption \ndescribed in the Convention.\n  The Convention also imposes on the States Parties an obligation to \ncriminalize acts of corruption if they have not already done so. \nEspecially noteworthy is the obligation to criminalize the bribery of \nforeign government officials. This provision was included in the \nConvention at the behest of the United States negotiating delegation. \nIn recent years, the United States Government has sought in a number of \nmultilateral fora to persuade other governments to adopt legislation \nakin to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. This Convention \nrepresents a significant breakthrough on that front and should lend \nimpetus to similar measures in other multilateral groups.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Convention, and that it give its advice and consent to \nratification, subject to the understandings described in the \naccompanying report to the Department of State.\n                                                  William J.

Mr. President, Senator Snowe has a substitute amendment \nat the desk. I ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Ms. Snowe, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2276.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of HR 629, \nthe Texas Compact Consent Act of 1997, which addresses the disposal of \nlow-level radioactive nuclear waste for Maine, Vermont and Texas--and \nto thank the cosponsors of this bill: Senators Collins, Leahy, and \nJeffords, as well as Senators Hutchison and Gramm of Texas for their \ninvaluable assistance and support.\n  In 1980, Congress told the states to form compacts to solve their \nlow-level waste disposal problems. Subsequently, Congress authorized a \nmeans of establishing these compacts without violating the Interstate \nCommerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n  As you can see from the chart behind me, 41 states have now joined \ntogether to form nine different compacts across the country. Forty-one \nstates. The compact before us today will simply add three more states \nto the nation's compact network, and carry out what these 41 other \nstates have already been allowed to do.\n  As the law requires, Texas, Vermont and Maine have negotiated an \nagreement that was approved by each state: in the Texas Senate by a \nvote of 28 to zero, and voice voted in the House; in Vermont, the bill \nwas also voice voted by large margins in both bodies.\n  In Maine, the Senate voted 26 to 3 to pass the compact; in the House, \n131 to 6. In addition, 73 percent of the people in a state-wide \nreferendum approved the Compact. All three Governors signed the bill. \nAnd, last October 7th, the House passed the Texas Compact by an \noverwhelming vote of 309 to 107. Decisive victories on all counts, and \nby any measure.\n  So, we have before us a Compact that has been carefully crafted and \nthoroughly examined by the state governments and people of all three \nstates involved. Now all that is required is the approval of Congress, \nso that the State of Texas and the other Texas Compact members will be \nable to exercise appropriate control over the waste that will come into \nthe Texas facility.\n  Let me be clear: the law never intended for Congress to determine who \npays what, how the storage is allocated, and where the site is located. \nTo the contrary: the intent of the law is for states to develop and \napprove these details, and for Congress to ratify the plan. A quick \nreview of history bears this out--for the nine compacts that have been \nconsented to by the United States Congress, not one of them was \namended. Not one of them.\n  It is very important for my colleagues to know that the language \nratified by each state for this Compact is exactly the same language, \nand if any change is made by Congress, the Compact would have to be \nonce again returned to each state for reratification.\n  And let me take this opportunity to clear up some other \nmisconceptions about this compact, which are being used by our \nopponents to cast discredit on this legislation.\n  The Compact before us does not discuss any particular site for the \ndisposal facility. Let me repeat that--this bill has nothing to do with \nthe location of a facility in Texas, as some would have us believe. It \nonly says that Texas must develop a facility in a timely manner, \nconsistent with all applicable state and federal environmental, health, \nand public safety laws.\n  This is being done. The Texas Office State Office of Administrative \nHearings is presently conducting several evidentiary hearings at \nvarious locations all around the state of Texas to evaluate a proposed \nsite. All voices are being heard, and the state of Texas will decide, \nas it should.\n  Opponents of the Texas Compact would have you believe that should we \nratify this Compact it will open the doors for other states to dump \nnuclear waste at a site, in the desert, located five miles from the \ntown of Sierra Blanca, exposing a predominantly low-income, minority \ncommunity to health and environmental threats.\n  The truth is that Texas has been planning to build a facility for its \nown waste since 1981, long before Maine first proposed a Compact with \nTexas. That is because whether or not this Compact passes, Texas still \nmust somehow take care of the waste it produces.\n  Further, absent the protection of this Compact, Texas must, I repeat \nmust, open their borders to any other state for waste disposal or they \nwill be in violation of the Interstate Commerce Clause of the U.S. \nConstitution. The Compact gives Texas the protection that oversight \ncommissioners, mostly appointed by the elected Governor of\n\n[[Page S3016]]\n\nTexas but also with a say from Maine and Vermont, will decide what is \nbest for Texas.\n  Local support for the Compact was evidenced just last month in state \nelections held in Texas. The Hudspeth County judge, who is the top \nelected official who runs county business where the site has been \nproposed, and who has strongly declared his support for the Compact, \nwon his race for reelection. Two candidates for county commissioner who \nalso support the Compact won their races over two opponents of the \nCompact.\n  The opponents of the Compact would have you believe this issue is \nabout politics. It is not about politics, it is about science: sound \nscience. It is very dry in the Southwest Texas area, where the small \namount rainfall it receives mostly evaporates before it hits the \nground. The aquifer that supplies water to the area and to nearby \nMexico is over 600 feet below the desert floor and is encased in rock.\n  The proposed site has been designed to withstand any earthquake \nequaling the most severe that has ever occurred in Texas history. \nStrong seismic activity in the area is non-existent. All these factors \nmean that the siting of this facility is on strong scientific grounds.\n  Our opponents say we will be bad neighbors if we pass this Compact \nbecause the proposed site is near the Mexican border. In fact, the U.S. \nand Mexico have an agreement, the Las Paz Agreement, to cooperate in \nthe environmental protection of the border region. The Las Paz \nAgreement simply encourages cooperative efforts to protect the \nenvironment of the region.\n  Any proposed facility will be protective of the environment because \nit will be constructed in accordance with the strictest U.S. \nenvironmental safeguards. In addition, both the Mexican National Water \nCommission and the National Nuclear Security and Safeguards Commission \nhave stated that the proposed site meets the Mexican government's \nrequirements.\n  Without question, the far bigger threat to the border environment is \nthe untreated sewage dumped into the Rio Grande River by poor border \ncommunities on both sides of the river, and large factories, or \nmaquiladoras on the Mexican side of the river that do not adhere to \nthese stringent U.S. environmental standards.\n  Mr. President, when this Compact is adopted--and it is clear that it \nshould be adopted without amendments--the States of Texas, Maine and \nVermont will become the forty second, forty third and forty fourth \nstates to be given Congressional approval for forming a compact. And \nthey will meet their responsibilities under federal law for the \ndisposal of their low-level waste from universities, hospitals, medical \ncenters, and power plants and shipyards.\n  I, along with my colleagues from the Texas Compact states, urge the \nSenate to give us this reasoned opportunity, which has widespread \npublic support in Texas, Maine and Vermont. I urge the Senate to adopt \nS. 270.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several letters relating to this subject \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   State of Texas,\n\n\n                                       Office of the Governor,\n\n                                        Austin, TX, July 15, 1997.\n     Dear Senator: \n       As the Governors of the member states, we strongly urge \n     passage by the U.S. Senate of S. 270, the Texas Low-Level \n     Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact Consent Act.\n       The 1980 Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act and its \n     1985 amendments make each state ``responsible for providing, \n     either by itself or in cooperation with other states,'' for \n     disposal of its own commercial low-level radioactive waste. \n     In compliance with this federal legislation, the states of \n     Texas, Maine and Vermont have arranged to manage their waste \n     through the terms of the Texas Compact. This compact passed \n     the legislatures of the states involved and is supported by \n     all three Governors. Texas, Maine and Vermont have complied \n     with all federal and state laws and regulations in forming \n     this compact. For the Congress to deny ratification of the \n     Texas Compact would be a serious breach of states' rights and \n     a rejection of Congress' previous mandate to the states.\n       It is important to remember that S. 270 is site neutral--a \n     vote on S. 270 is neither a vote to endorse nor oppose the \n     proposed site in Texas. Federal legislation leaves the siting \n     of a facility to state governments and should be resolved \n     during formal licensing proceedings. Currently, the Texas \n     Natural Resource Conservation Commission is conducting the \n     appropriate hearings.\n       Please vote to supply the member states of the Texas \n     Compact with the same protections that you have already given \n     42 states in the nine previously approved compacts. Thank you \n     for your time and attention on this very important matter. We \n     appreciate all efforts made on behalf of states' rights.\n           Sincerely,\n     George W. Bush.\n     Howard Dean, M.D.\n     Angus S. King, Jr.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                 Maine Yankee,\n\n                                      Augusta, ME, March 12, 1998.\n     Hon. Olympia J. Snowe,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: Thank you for contacting me to let us \n     know that debate on the Texas Compact legislation is \n     scheduled to begin this Friday. I appreciate the leadership \n     role you have taken on this difficult issue. I am also \n     grateful to the other members of Maine's congressional \n     delegation for being sensitive to the unique issues presented \n     by Maine.\n       Since the House vote in December, Texas has issued a fee \n     schedule that appears to make the Texas facility comparable \n     in cost to Barnwell, South Carolina, so long as there are no \n     delays in the scheduled opening of the facility. In addition, \n     we are pleased to see the public hearing process in Texas \n     going forward on schedule, which gives us greater confidence \n     that the site may begin accepting waste in 1999 as projected. \n     Given the foregoing, Maine Yankee can support ratification of \n     the Texas Compact, on the following basis: Maine Yankee has \n     the flexibility to ship waste to South Carolina prior to the \n     operation of the Texas facility; Maine Yankee has the ability \n     to use the Envirocare facility in Utah throughout our \n     decommissioning; and the Compact passes with no amendments.\n       Please let me know if you have any questions regarding our \n     position on the Texas Compact legislation. Once again, thank \n     you for taking the lead on this issue which is so important \n     to electric ratepayers.\n           Yours truly,\n                                                David T.

Paul Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: It is an honor for me to write to \n     U.S. Senators, whose title and energy is devoted to important \n     national and international issues. There are several facts I \n     want you to consider as the U.S. Senate takes up floor action \n     on SB 270, a low-level waste Compact between Texas, Maine and \n     Vermont.\n       First, I am the County Judge for Hudspeth County, Texas, \n     the site of the proposed low-level radioactive waste \n     facility. Second, I am a strong and vocal supporter of the \n     proposed site and compact. Third, the voters of Hudspeth \n     County overwhelmingly reelected me on March 10th. I won with \n     54% of the vote in a three person race.\n       The people of Hudspeth County know my position on these \n     issues and spoke clearly and forcefully the best way can--\n     through the electoral process. I won. My opponents are \n     against the proposed facility. They lost.\n       In the County Commissioner races, both losing candidates \n     publicly opposed the proposed facility.\n       Finally, the only candidate on the ballot for Chairman of \n     the Hudspeth County Democratic Party was defeated by a write-\n     in candidate. Billy Addington, a long time an outspoken \n     opponent of the proposed facility, could not win. The \n     democratic process has clearly shown that the citizens of \n     Hudspeth County continue to accept the string of the \n     facility, despite the loud but false claims by the \n     opposition.\n       I urge you to listen to what the voters of Hudspeth County \n     are saying, as well as the past actions of the legislatures \n     in Maine, Texas and Vermont. This facility has wide support. \n     Please ratify the Compact to enable these states to safety \n     and permanently manage their low-level waste and to help \n     stimulate economic development in Hudspeth County. At least \n     that's what the grass-roots level wants.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   James A. Pease,\n     Hudspeth County Judge.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                                    March 2, 1998.\n       Dear Member of Congress:\n       On behalf of the National Governors' Association, we urge \n     you to adopt S. 270 without amendment. This bill provides \n     congressional consent to the Texas-Maine-Vermont Low-Level \n     Radioactive Waste Compact. The National Governors' \n     Association (NGA) policy in support of this compact is \n     attached. We are convinced that this voluntary compact \n     provides for the safe and responsible disposal of low-level \n     waste produced in the three member states.\n       As you know, under the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy \n     Act (LLRWPA) of 1980. Congress mandated that states assume \n     responsibility for disposal of low level radioactive waste, \n     and created a compact system that provides states with the \n     legal authority to restrict, dispose of, and manage waste. \n     Since 1995, forty-one states have entered into nine \n     congressional approved compacts without amendments or \n     objections. The Texas-\n\n[[Page S3017]]\n\n     Maine-Vermont Compact deserves to be the tenth.\n       Your support for this bipartisan measure, which has the \n     full support and cooperation of the Governors and \n     legislatures of the three participant states, will be \n     crucial.\n       If you have any questions concerning this matter, please \n     don't hesitate to contact Tom Curtis of the NGA staff at \n     (202) 624-5389.\n           Sincerely,\n     Governor George V. Voinovich,\n       Chairman.\n     Governor Tom Carper,\n       Vice Chairman.\n                                            National Conference of\n\n\n                                           State Legislatures,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 11, 1998.\n     Re S. 270, the Texas Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal \n         Compact Consent Act NCSL urges you to support this bill \n         without amendment.\n\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: The National Conference of State \n     Legislatures (NCSL) urges you to support S. 270, the Texas \n     Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact Consent Act, \n     which will allow the states of Maine, Texas, and Vermont to \n     continue to work together to develop a facility in Hudspeth \n     County, Texas for the disposal of the low-level radioactive \n     waste produced in those three states. NCSL has consistently \n     reiterated its firm belief that states must be allowed to \n     exercise their authority over the storage and disposal oflow-\n     level radioactive waste, authority that was granted to them \n     by Congress in the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of \n     1980 and the Low-Level Waste Policy Act Amendments of 1985.\n       NCSL is concerned about H.R. 629, the version of the Texas \n     Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal Compact Consent Act \n     which passed through the House of Representatives last \n     October. H.R. 629 was amended with language that was not in \n     the compact as approved by the Maine, Texas and Vermont state \n     legislatures. No low-level radioactive waste compact between \n     states has ever been amended by Congress. We believe that the \n     amendments to H.R. 629 would establish an unfortunate \n     precedent for Congressional tinkering with agreements that \n     have already been passed by their relevant state \n     legislatures.\n       The states of Maine, Texas, and Vermont have already \n     expended significant time and resources in order to negotiate \n     an agreement on the Hudspeth County facility. It would be \n     inappropriate for Congress to attempt to alter a valid effort \n     by the Compact states to meet their responsibilities under \n     the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act. We urge you to \n     support S. 270 without amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n     Craig Peterson,\n       Utah State Senate,\n       Chair, NCSL Environment Committee.\n     Carol S. Petzold,\n       Maryland House of Delegates,\n       Chair, NCSL Energy & Transportation Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Nuclear\n\n\n                                        Regulatory Commission,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 20, 1998.\n     Hon. Olympia J. Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Snowe: In response to the request from your \n     staff, here are the views of the Nuclear Regulatory \n     Commission (NRC) on two proposed amendments to S. 270, a bill \n     to provide the consent of Congress to the Texas Low-Level \n     Radioactive Waste (LLW) Disposal Compact. The proposed \n     amendments would add two new conditions to the conditions of \n     consent to the compact: (1) that no LLW may be brought into \n     Texas for disposal at a compact facility from any State other \n     than Maine or Vermont (referred to below as the ``exclusion'' \n     amendment); and (2) that ``the compact not be implemented . . \n     . in any way that discriminates against any community \n     (through disparate treatment or disparate impact) by reason \n     of the composition of the community in terms of race, color, \n     national origin, or income level'' (referred to below as the \n     ``discrimination clause''). These amendments raise some \n     significant questions of concern to the NRC.\n       First, no other Congressional compact ratification \n     legislation has included such conditions to Congress' \n     consent. Making the Congressional consent for this compact \n     different from that for other compacts would create an \n     asymmetrical system and could lead to conflicts among \n     regions. In the past, Congress has set a high priority on \n     establishing a consistent set of rules under which the \n     interstate compact system for LLW disposal would operate.\n       With respect to the exclusion condition, while the Low-\n     Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980 and the Low-Level \n     Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985 authorize \n     compact States to exclude LLW from outside their compact \n     region, the terms of doing so are left to the States. This is \n     consistent with the intent of these statutes to make LLW \n     disposal the responsibility of the States and to leave the \n     implementation of that responsibility largely to the States' \n     discretion. Thus, the addition of the exclusion condition to \n     the compact would deprive the party States of the ability to \n     make their own choices as to how to handle this important \n     area. In addition, restriction on importation of LLW into \n     Texas to waste coming from Maine or Vermont could prevent \n     other compacts (or non-compact States) from contracting with \n     the Texas compact for disposal of their waste (such as has \n     occurred between the Rocky Mountain and Northwest compacts). \n     This type of arrangement with existing LLW disposal \n     facilities may well become a preferred economical method of \n     LLW disposal. It is also important to note that the exclusion \n     condition may hamper NRC emergency access to the Texas \n     facility pursuant to section 6 of the Low-Level Radioactive \n     Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1985.\n       With respect to the discrimination clause, the Commission \n     supports the general objectives of efforts to address \n     discrimination involving ``race, color, national origin, or \n     income level.'' However, it is unclear how a condition \n     containing broad language of the type contained in the \n     proposed amendment would be applied in a specific case \n     involving a compact. This lack of clarity is likely to create \n     confusion and uncertainty for all parties involved, and could \n     lead to costly, time-consuming litigation. Including such a \n     provision in binding legislation may have broad significance \n     for the affected States and other parties would appear to \n     warrant extensive Congressional review of its implications.\n       In light of the above, the NRC opposes the approval of \n     amendments to S. 270 that would incorporate the exclusion \n     condition or an undefined discrimination clause into the \n     Texas compact bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Shirley Ann Jackson,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I join the senior Senator from the State \nof Maine, Senator Snowe, in urging my colleagues to enact H.R. 629, \nlegislation that would ratify the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Disposal \nCompact, also known as the Texas Compact.\n  In entering into an agreement for the disposal of low-level \nradioactive waste, the States of Maine, Texas, and Vermont followed the \ndirection established by the Congress in the Low-Level Radioactive \nWaste Policy Act and its 1985 amendments. That legislation contemplated \nthat states would form agreements of this nature for the disposal of \nlow-level waste, and thus, by ratifying the compact, Congress will be \ncompleting a process that it set in motion.\n  Mr. President, since 1985 Congress has ratified nine compacts \ninvolving 41 states. Put differently, 82 of the 100 members of this \nbody live in states with compacts that have been ratified by the \nSenate, and with the approval of the Texas Compact, that number will \nrise to 88. In short, what Maine, Texas, and Vermont are seeking today \nhas already been routinely granted to the vast majority of the states.\n  While the disposal of radioactive waste is bound to generate \ncontroversy, this agreement has been overwhelmingly approved by the \nLegislatures of the three compacting states, signed by their governors, \nand in the case of Maine, endorsed by the voters in a referendum. This \nis consistent with the congressional determination that the states bear \nresponsibility for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste, and \nthat in the interest of limiting the number of disposal sites, they \nwork together to carry out this responsibility. Indeed, ratification by \nCongress is necessitated only because state-imposed limitations on the \nimportation of waste would otherwise violate the Commerce Clause.\n  Mr. President, a member of this body has criticized the proposed \ndisposal site to be established pursuant to this compact. Apart from \nthe fact that the location of the site is a matter for the states to \ndetermine, that criticism is unsupported by the facts.\n  In the selection of the proposed site in Hudspeth County, Texas, \nthere was extensive public involvement, as well as thorough \nenvironmental and technical reviews. Hudspeth County was found to have \nthe two critical characteristics for a disposal site, namely, very \nlittle rainfall and very low population density. Indeed, the county is \nthe size of the State of Connecticut and has a population of only 2800 \npeople.\n  While some may wish to use this legislation to pursue a larger \nideological agenda, it does not square with the facts. The choice of \nHudspeth County had nothing to do with who lives there; it had \neverything to do with the fact that very few people live there.\n  Mr. President, this body has been presented with nine low-level \nradioactive waste compacts. It has ratified each one without change. In \nkeeping with congressionally established policy\n\n[[Page S3018]]\n\nfor the disposal of low-level waste, Maine, Texas, and Vermont are \nseeking the same treatment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the predicament \nVermont, Maine and Texas find themselves in, simply because they are \nfollowing Congress' directions. In 1985, we amended the Low-Level \nNuclear Waste Policy Act to encourage states to enter into interstate \ncompacts to develop disposal facilities for low-level waste by \nDecember, 1995, or to assume responsibility for safe waste disposal in \ntheir own states. Following our direction, Vermont began looking for an \nin-state depository location. The sites examined in Vermont were not \nsuitable because of both their geology and their proximity to large \npopulations. At about the same time, Texas offered to enter into a \ncompact with Vermont and Maine and to use a site they were already \ndeveloping for Texas waste.\n  The state legislatures of Vermont, Maine and Texas agreed to enter \ninto this compact in the early 1990s. The Compact is a contractual \nagreement among the three states, but it requires Congressional \napproval in order to allow the member states to exclude waste from \noutside their compact. According to our Constitution, these compacts \nmust be approved by Congress. Article 1 clearly states that ``No state \nshall, without the Consent of Congress, . . . Enter into any Agreement \nor Compact with another state, . . . .''\n  Since 1985, nine interstate low-level waste compacts have been \napproved by Congress, encompassing forty-one states. They were ratified \nwithout change and without a single recorded negative vote. I am \npleased to see that the Vermont, Maine and Texas Compact will follow in \nthat tradition.\n  I first introduced legislation to approve our Compact in the 103rd \nCongress. Passage of H.R. 629 finally ratifies the clear will of the \nVermont Legislature when it entered in the Compact. At that time, I \nbelieve we all recognized that there was no perfect solution for \ndealing with low-level nuclear waste, but as long as we are generating \npower from nuclear facilities and as long as our research universities, \nhospitals and laboratories use nuclear materials, we are going to have \nto dispose of the waste. We cannot continue to ignore the need to \nsafely store nuclear waste. To pretend otherwise would be to ignore the \ngrowing environmental problem of storing this waste at inadequate, \ntemporary sites in Vermont, Maine and Texas.\n  Instead, we need to make a commitment to developing and building the \nsafest facility for long-term storage of waste. That is what our States \nhave done, and Congress should not stand in their way. I have talked \nwith our Vermont state geologist. We have looked at maps of Vermont and \nwe have looked at our geology, hydrology and meteorology in Vermont. \nThere is only one conclusion from all of these discussions: there is \nnot an acceptable site for nuclear waste storage in our state.\n  The Compact also makes economic sense. The residents of Vermont have \nalready committed themselves to this Compact, and the twenty-five \nmillion dollar price tag that goes along with it. Since Vermont \ngenerates such a small amount of waste, it would be economically \nunfeasible to build a facility that would meet all the environmental \nrequirements and only store waste generated in Vermont. Building such a \nfacility would put Vermont in a position of looking to other states to \nhelp support the facility.\n  It is also important to remember that under the Compact, Texas has \nagreed to host the waste facility, but it does not name a specific \nsite. That is an issue to be decided by the people of Texas, as it \nshould be. This Compact also allows the states of Vermont, Maine and \nTexas to refuse waste from other states. Specifically, Texas will be \nable to limit the amount of low-level waste coming into its facility \nfrom out-of-state sources. Maine and Vermont together produce a \nfraction of what is generated in Texas, but by entering into this \nCompact, our states will share the cost of building the facility.\n  Finally, building the facility does not end Vermont's obligation to \nthe safety of this site. We have a long-term commitment to the site, \nfrom ensuring that the facility meets all of the federal construction \nand operating regulations, to making sure the waste is transported \nproperly to the site, and to ensuring that the surrounding area is \nrigorously monitored. Vermont will not send its waste to Texas and then \nclose it eyes to the rest of the process.\n\n\n      Amendments No. 2277 and 2278, En Bloc, To Amendment No. 2276\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 493, the \nCellular Telephone Protection Act, and urge the President to sign this \nimportant piece of legislation without delay. This bill makes it easier \nfor federal law enforcement to stop cell phone cloning by targeting \ncloning at its source--the equipment (``black boxes'') used to alter or \nmodify the ESN (electronic serial number) of a cellular phone.\n  I am particularly pleased that this bill has the support of the U.S. \nSecret Service, the Department of Justice, the wireless phone industry, \nand Congress.\n  This bill is not only a victory for law enforcement, but also for the \n56 million Americans who currently use wireless/cellular service. \nAccording to the cellular telecommunications industry, consumers lose \nin excess of $650 million a year due to fraud, much of it as a result \nof cloning. This results in increased costs to cellular customers.\n  S. 493 is the first in a series of anti-crime initiatives I \nintroduced that are aimed at modernizing U.S. law to reflect changes in \ntechnology. It is another step to assure that law-abiding citizens \ndon't inadvertently become part of a criminal activity.\n  Wireless fraud is not a victimless crime. It strikes at the heart of \ntechnology that is improving the safety, security and business \nproductivity of the entire Nation. This bill will help stop the \ncriminal cloning of wireless phones by giving law enforcement the tools \nthey need to combat wireless fraud.\n  The Secret Secret--the Federal agency charged with investigating \ncloning offenses--has doubled the number of arrests in the area of \nwireless telecommunications fraud every year since 1991, with 800 \nindividuals charged for their part in the cloning of cellular phones in \n1996.\n  At a House Subcommittee on Crime hearing law year, the Secret Service \nconducted a demonstration in which a phone was cloned in approximately \n30 seconds. At that hearing, law enforcement officials testified at how \ncloning technology is increasingly being used in various types of \ncriminal activity--especially in drug crimes.\n  On February 24, 1998, I chaired a hearing of the Senate Subcommittee \non Terrorism, Technology, and Government Information in which the \nSecret Service testified that foreign terrorists were financing their \noperations in the U.S. with the aid of ``cloned'' cellular telephones. \nDeputy Assistant Director Richard Rohde testified that foreign \nterrorists often make money by running illegal ``cell-sell'' rings. \nThese rings involve the illegal sale of long-distance telephone access \nusing fraudulently-obtained service. One common method is ``renting'' \nthe use of a cellular phone which has been ``cloned,'' or modified to \ndirect billing identification to the user of a different phone.\n  While the current cell phone law (18 U.S.C. 1029) has been useful in \nprosecuting some cloners, the statute has not functioned well in \nstopping those who manufacture and distribute cloning devices. In \ntestimony before the House Subcommittee on Crime, Michael C. Stenger of \nthe Secret Service stressed the need to revise our current cell phone \nstatute:\n\n       Due to the fact that the statute presently requires the \n     proof of ``intent to defraud'' to charge the violation, the \n     distributors of the cloning equipment have become elusive \n     targets. These distributors utilize disclaimers in their \n     advertising mechanisms aimed at avoiding a finding of \n     fraudulent intent. This allows for the continued distribution \n     of the equipment permitting all elements of the criminal \n     arena to equip themselves with free, anonymous phone service.\n\n  Under S. 493, a prosecutor would need to prove that an individual\n\n       knowingly uses, produces, traffics in, has control or \n     custody of, or possesses hardware or software, knowing it has \n     been configured to insert or modify telecommunications \n     identifying information associated with or contained in a \n     telecommunications instrument so that such instrument may be \n     used to obtain telecommunications service without \n     authorization.\n\n  The removal of the ``intent to defraud'' language in 18 U.S.C. 1029 \nonly applies to the possession and use of the hardware and software \nconfigured to alter telecommunications instruments. It does not apply \nto those who are in the possession of cloned phones. Nor does it apply \nto those in the possession of scanning receivers (which do have some \nlegitimate uses). Someone who does not know that a telecommunications \ndevice has been altered to modify a telecommunications instrument would \nnot be criminally liable under this section.\n  I am very proud of this important crime-fighting legislation and look \nforward to its prompt signature by the President.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in 1994, I authored the first law to \nprovide specific protection against ``clone'' telephones. While the \nmain focus of the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act, or \nCALEA, was to help our law enforcement agencies deal with the challenge \nof new digital telecommunications equipment and services, the law also \ncontained important bans on the use and trafficking of clone phones, \nscanning receivers, and hardware and software used to steal cellular \nservice.\n  Specifically, in CALEA, we amended the Counterfeit Access Device law, \n18 U.S.C. Sec. 1029, by adding a provision to criminalize the use and \npossession, with intent to defraud, of altered telecommunications \ninstruments, or scanning receivers, hardware or software, to obtain \nunauthorized access to telecommunications services. This law also\n\n[[Page S3021]]\n\nadded to the federal criminal code a definition of scanning receivers \nto mean devices used to intercept illegally wire or electronic \ncommunications.\n  ``Clone'' telephones are used illegally to allow free riding on the \ncellular phone system and result in theft of that service. The cellular \ntelephone industry estimates that it loses $650 million per year due to \nclone phones. I recall testimony at hearings I chaired jointly with \nRepresentative Don Edwards on CALEA about the need to address this \nproblem in CALEA. Tom Wheeler, President of the Cellular \nTelecommunications Industry Association, testified in 1994 about:\n\n       . . . people being surprised by ``humongous'' cellular \n     bills because somebody had snatched their electronic code out \n     of the air, cloned that into another phone, and was charging \n     phone calls to Colombia or wherever onto their phone.\n\nS. Hrg. 103-1022, at p. 148 (August 11, 1994).\n  In short, the theft of cellular telephone services amounts to \nmillions of dollars of losses to wireless service providers and to \nconsumers.\n  Just as disturbing, clone phones are used by drug dealers and other \ncriminals trying to evade police surveillance of their phone \nconversations. The fraudulent use of electronic serial numbers, which \nare critical in identifying the cellular phone subject to wiretap \norders, represented a real threat to privacy. Mr. Wheeler explained in \n1994, ``If you have a situation where there is floating around out \nthere multiple users of the same electronic serial numbers, you don't \nknow who you are tapping.'' S. Hrg. 103-1022, at p. 148 (August 11, \n1994).\n  Given the financial losses and the threats to privacy posed by clone \nphones, I urge the cellular telephone industry to consider the \ntechnical means available to better protect cellular phone service. In \nparticular, if strong encryption were used to encrypt the radio waves \ntransmitted from cellular phones to the nearest cell tower, stealing \nthose signals for use in a clone phone would be much more difficult, if \nnot impossible.\n  I have long been a proponent of more widespread use of strong \nencryption. Clone phones are a perfect example of where the use of \nstrong encryption would be far more effective to prevent this crime \nfrom occurring than all the criminal laws we could consider passing.\n  This bill, as modified by the House, builds upon the work we \naccomplished in CALEA.\n  Current law contains an ``intent to defraud'' requirement that has \napparently posed a stumbling block for law enforcement to crack down on \nthe cloning of cellular phones. This bill would remove this intent \nrequirement and make it illegal to use, sell or possess hardware or \nsoftware knowing it has been configured for the purpose of altering a \ntelephone to steal service.\n  The House of Representatives made a number of significant \nimprovements to S. 493 to ensure that, upon removal of the ``intent to \ndefraud'' requirement, the bill did not sweep too broadly. Indeed, I \nunderstand that even some cellular companies were concerned that the \noriginal bill introduced by Senator Kyl might inadvertently have \napplied to machinery used by legitimate companies to test or reprogram \ntheir equipment.\n  Removal of the ``intent to defraud'' scienter requirement may still \npose problems for those legitimate companies that with to offer \n``extension'' telephones for cellular telephones. In fact, the Federal \nCommunications Commission has a proceeding underway to determine \nwhether companies may be allowed to alter the electronic serial number \nof a cellular telephone to allow more than one phone to have the same \ncontact number.\n  Passage of this law may be interpreted as prejudging the outcome of \nthat proceeding by making illegal the use of clone phones, even by \nlegitimate subscribers who pay their bills. That would be regrettable. \nThis bill should not affect the outcome of the FCC proceeding, since \nthe public interest may be well served by allowing competition into the \nextension cellular telephone business. Depending on the outcome of the \nFCC proceeding, we may be revisiting this legislation.\n  This bill, as modified by the House, is supported by the FBI, Secret \nService and the Cellular Telephone Industry Association (CTIA). We made \nimportant progress in this area when we passed CALEA, and I am glad to \nsupport legislation that will further help law enforcement combat \ncellular telephone fraud by those who steal cellular service.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.
