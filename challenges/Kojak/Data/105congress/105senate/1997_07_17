The able Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 896\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the chance to \nspeak again about my amendment. Let me take just a few minutes to \ndescribe what this amendment does and then reserve a couple of the 5 \nminutes that is allotted for my side for any rebuttal I need to make.\n  This amendment is very modest. It tries to do three things. It is \naimed at assisting the Cuban-American families that reside in our \ncountry, some of whom are citizens--some individuals are citizens, some \nare residents. It tries to assist in three respects.\n  First of all, it says with regard to family support payments, that \nresidents of the United States shall not be prohibited from sending to \ntheir parents, their siblings, their spouses, or their children who \ncurrently reside in Cuba, small amounts of money, not to exceed $200 \nper month, to be used for the purchase of basic necessities, including \nfood, clothing, household supplies, rent, medicines, and medical care.\n  Mr. President, I think this is self-explanatory. We had a policy \nuntil the shootdown of the plane some 2 years ago, nearly, at this \npoint--we had a policy of permitting, I believe, $100 per month to be \nremitted by Cuban-Americans living in this country to their families in \nCuba for these types of purposes. That is no longer permitted at any \nlevel. This amendment would say up to $200 per month could be sent by\n\n[[Page S7624]]\n\na person in this country to a family member in Cuba.\n  Second, compassionate travel--that is the second item in this \namendment. It says essentially that U.S. citizens and permanent \nresidents here can travel without limitation for periods not to exceed \n30 days for each trip to attend either a medical emergency or a funeral \nof that person's parent, sibling, spouse, or child. As I understand it, \nthe present law in this country is that you can go to Cuba for a very \nshort time once a year, if you are a resident of this country, for this \nkind of purpose. It doesn't take a great deal of ingenuity to conjure \nup a situation where you would have a person's parent getting sick, \nhaving a medical emergency that required that person to return early in \nthe year, and then have a funeral later that year which would require a \nreturn again to Cuba. This amendment says that you could do both of \nthose trips. Neither could be more than 30 days in duration. It is a \nvery limited provision. It is only applicable to people who have \nspouses, parents, siblings, and children in Cuba.\n  And the third item here, which I think is not just aimed at the \nCuban-American community, it says that the United States Government \nshall not be prohibited from participating in humanitarian relief \nefforts of multilateral organizations of which the United States is a \nmember, where such humanitarian relief efforts are made in the \naftermath of a natural disaster in Cuba.\n  All we are saying here is that if there is a hurricane, if there is \nsome natural catastrophe in Cuba, and multilateral organizations that \nwe are a member of decide to take some action to assist the Cuban \npeople, then we can participate along with the other members of that \nmultilateral organization.\n  As I indicated when I started, this is a very, very modest amendment. \nIt is trying to deal with some very specific problems I see in our \ncurrent law, and I would very much appreciate it if our colleagues \ncould agree to this amendment. I understand it is objectionable, and I \nwill, at this point, yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime to allow the opponents of the amendment to explain why this is \ngoing to undermine our great democracy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). Who yields time in opposition \nto the amendment?\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, on February 24, 1996, under the \ndirections of Fidel Castro, the Cuban Air Force encountered and \ndestroyed a civilian aircraft in the Florida straits. Murdered on that \nday were four innocent civilians, including Americans. At almost the \nsame time, 100 brave Cuban citizens demonstrating in the streets of \nHavana were arrested for demanding democratic reforms, and they remain \nin jail.\n  In response to these actions, President Clinton, with the strong \nbipartisan support of this country, on that day made several changes in \nAmerican policy. First, we suspended the very remittances that would be \nexpanded by the Bingaman amendment today, and canceled flights that \nwere encouraging tourism and travel in Cuba. It was a modest response \nto an egregious act. We were united then; I do not know what would \ndivide us now.\n  Since the murders on that day, there has been no change in Cuban \npolicy. Although the price of progress in American relations has always \nbeen clear--a single opposition newspaper, the scheduling of a free \nelection, the allowing of any dissent, the opening of Cuba's jails to \nanyone; not all of these things, not even in their entirety, but any \none of these things, to any extent, would have brought about a change \nin our policy.\n\n  I know people are impatient for democratic reform in Cuba and an \nending of the embargo. It has been 5 years since we strengthened \nAmerican law. I know patience is not always our greatest national \nattribute. But now--in the face of Fidel Castro, 5 years after \nembarking on this policy, only 18 months after the murder of these \ncitizens, with no Cuban response, no concession and no change--to \nsimply abandon our policy, I believe, would undermine a foreign policy \nobjective of the United States for a free Cuba.\n  Mr. President, does the Senator from Florida--we have consumed 3 \nminutes, I believe, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes remain.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Does the Senator from Florida request the 2 minutes?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Torricelli.\n  I rise today to oppose the amendment offered by our colleague from \nNew Mexico. The policy of the United States toward Cuba is too serious, \nit is too delicate, it has too many ramifications to be settled in \ndebate which this morning will provide 5 minutes per side to discuss \nthe nuances of what is entailed in this seemingly humanitarian and \nbenign amendment. If there is to be a change in policy, it should be \nthe result of studied consideration of all of the implications of \nspecific proposals, not extracting three items from a complex set of \nrelationships that involve not only Cuba but also many other nations in \nthe world.\n  Second, there is no need for this amendment. One of the principal \nparts of this amendment is related to humanitarian aid, particularly \nafter a natural disaster--a very appealing concept for Americans. It is \nso appealing that, in fact, the United States is already the largest \ndonor of humanitarian assistance to Cuba. In the last 4 years, the U.S. \nGovernment has licensed more than $150 million of humanitarian \nassistance to Cuba, more than the total of all other nations combined. \nSo the United States has not stood by in times of humanitarian need for \nthe people of Cuba.\n  With reference to travel to Cuba, American citizens already can \ntravel to Cuba once a year with virtually no restraints in order to \nattend to a humanitarian family need. This would open the gates beyond \nthat to allow unlimited visits to Cuba.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I urge the Senate defer the debate on what \nshould be our policy in the future toward Cuba to another day, when we \ncan give it the attention that it requires, and defeat this amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico controls 50 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me conclude by saying I am not trying to change \nUnited States policy toward Cuba. I am not trying to provide assistance \nto Fidel Castro. I am not trying to send a signal that Fidel Castro is \na favorite statesman of this country. I do think it is appropriate for \nus to separate out the concerns of Cuban-American citizens and \nresidents from this geopolitical issue, and say these modest efforts to \nassist Cuban-American citizens and residents to help their families and \nto visit their families are not something that a great nation like ours \nshould resist.\n  Clearly, the humanitarian assistance my colleague from Florida cites \nthat we have done is in the private sector. There is no public sector \nassistance at this time.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of my amendment.\n  While I have the floor, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Bob \nKerrey from Nebraska as a cosponsor of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I also ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By previous agreement, the vote will take \nplace at a later time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on the amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 890\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question recurs on the amendment of the \nSenator from Arkansas. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized for up \nto 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  It has been years since this body voted on the most-favored-nation \nstatus for China. It has been 8 years since\n\n[[Page S7625]]\n\nthe Tiananmen Square massacre, and it has been 4 years since this \nNation embarked on a policy of so-called constructive engagement which \ndelinked our China trade policy from human rights concerns.\n  During these years, years since we last voted on MFN, years since the \nTiananmen Square massacre, and the 4 years since we embarked upon \nconstructive engagement, this is what has happened in these years:\n  The struggling democracy movement in China has been thoroughly and \ncompletely squashed.\n  Those students at Tiananmen Square, which we watched on television \nall over this Nation, are all either imprisoned or executed.\n  All voices of freedom in China have since been silenced--all of \nthem--according to the 1996 State Department Report on China. All \nvoices of dissidents have been silenced.\n  Chinese workers have been systematically exploited.\n  Weapons of mass destruction have been exported around the world so \nthat the export of those weapons from China now poses the greatest \nmilitary risk in the world today.\n  And people of faith in China have been persecuted and driven \nunderground.\n\n  In addition, during these years, all political dissent has been \neffectively oppressed, and now there is mounting evidence that, in \nfact, during these years when we were year after year granting most-\nfavored-nation status, they were attempting to influence the American \npolitical process. There is mounting evidence that that was the case.\n  So I believe this vote is a vote of conscience. I believe it is a \nvote that we must have in this body. The abuses of the Chinese \nGovernment beg to be protested.\n  So when people ask me why this vote? I say because it is so egregious \nwhat is going on that we must vote, we must raise our voice, we must \nlet the people of China know that there are people standing up for them \nin the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 2 minutes.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I reserve my 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks to speak in opposition to the \namendment?\n  Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine. How much time does the \nSenator seek?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I seek 90 seconds, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Hutchinson's \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution. I want to make clear that my support of \nthis nonbinding resolution signifies my grave concerns about most-\nfavored-nation status for China rather than a final decision about this \nimportant policy question.\n  Last month, the House of Representatives debated a resolution of \ndisapproval that would have denied most-favored-nation status for China \nas proposed by President Clinton. The House rejected this measure, \nthereby supporting the Clinton administration's proposal to extend MFN \nstatus for China for another year.\n  Given this action by the House, the U.S. Senate will not have a \nformal debate and vote this year on the President's recommendation. \nNevertheless, I recognize that this issue raises some very serious \nissues that need more debate and consideration than the very brief \ndebate that the Senate has given this issue today.\n  Like many of my colleagues in the Senate, I am very troubled by the \nactions of the Chinese Government in Beijing. It has a very poor record \non human rights issues. It has repeatedly violated trade agreements.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for 90 seconds. Does \nshe seek additional time?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to proceed \nfor 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. It has a very poor record on human rights issues. It has \nrepeatedly violated trade agreements. It engages in unacceptable \nweapons proliferation activities. It denies the religious freedom of \nits citizens. It maintains an antidemocratic posture toward Taiwan and \nTibet. And, finally, our Senate investigation into campaign finance \nabuses has revealed a plan by China to funnel illegal political \ncontributions into American campaigns.\n  Given all of the ramifications, I believe that at an appropriate time \nand place, the Senate should engage in a full-fledged debate that gives \nthese matters the attention that they truly deserve.\n  In conclusion, I am withholding final judgment on the question of \nmost-favored-nation status for China, but in the meantime, I am \nexpressing my very serious concerns and reservations by supporting the \nnonbinding sense-of-the-Senate resolution offered by the Senator from \nArkansas.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Might I inquire as to how much time my side has \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 10 seconds. All time remains in \nopposition.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. It is my understanding Senator Ashcroft from Missouri \nis on the way to the floor to speak in favor of my amendment. I reserve \nthe final 1 minute and yield the floor to the opponents of the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition to speak in opposition \nto the amendment?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask permission to speak for up to 2 \nminutes in opposition to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just say this whole issue of \nmost-favored-nation status is not what the name implies. We have normal \ntrading relations with well over 100 countries in the world, and as to \neach of those countries, we have so-called most-favored-nation trading \nstatus with them.\n  What we need to maintain with China is a normalized trading situation \nwhich then allows us to deal with the specific problems that the \nproponents of this resolution have identified. I agree that there are \nmajor problems in the trade imbalance that we have with China, that \nthere are human rights abuses in China that are of concern, that there \nis missile proliferation that is of concern, and clearly the issue that \nis being raised about possible involvement by the Chinese Government in \nour elections is of concern. But those are specific issues that should \nbe dealt with by a rifle-shot approach. We should not try to cut off \nour trade activities with a very large economy, such as China, and \nhamper the economic opportunities of our own private sector and the job \ncreation that comes from that in this country through this kind of \ndevice.\n  So I very much oppose the notion that we should deny most-favored-\nnation status to China. I think we should get that issue behind us and \nget on to dealing with the more specific issues that do require \nattention in regard to our relations with China. I hope in future years \nwe can do that. It seems like we are caught in a time war. We get to \nwhere we have an annual debate about most-favored-nation status and \nthat is all we seem to be able to have when it comes to talking about \nChina, and that is, unfortunately, what is happening again this year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition to the \namendment?\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, with regard to the amendment of my good \nfriend from Arkansas, Senator Hutchinson, I, along with a number of \nother Senators, were in Hong Kong 10 days ago to watch the turnover of \nHong Kong to the Chinese. I mention Hong Kong because Hong Kong is \nreally the best indicator of what China is likely to become in the \ncoming years.\n  Some people suggest that the People's Republic of China will ruin \nHong Kong. Others suggest that Hong Kong will be the engine that \nchanges China. I think clearly the latter is most likely to be the \ncase. Even though the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas\n\n[[Page S7626]]\n\ndeals with MFN for China and not MFN for Hong Kong, I think it is \nworthy of note that no one in Hong Kong, no one, not the democracy \nactivists, the businessmen, no one, you can't find anybody in Hong Kong \nwho thinks terminating MFN for China is a good idea.\n  I cite, for example, Martin Lee, the person who most of us are \nfamiliar with who is the prodemocracy activist in Hong Kong and the one \nthe Chinese tend to fear the most and the one who says the greatest \nnumber of things that tend to irritate the regime in Beijing. Martin \nLee is not in favor of terminating MFN for China, because he believes \nthat the economic engine that is roaring in mainland China is pulling \nit inevitably in the direction of democracy and human rights.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that the Hutchinson amendment will not be \napproved. I think it sends the wrong signal.\n  Having said that, let me say that nobody that I know is entirely \nhappy with the internal government in the People's Republic of China. I \nmight say the same thing about some of the countries that are still \nreceiving foreign assistance from us. We are not entirely happy with \nwhat is going on in Russia these days. I, for one, am not happy with a \nnumber of things that have happened in Egypt recently, and these are \ncountries that are foreign aid recipients of the United States.\n  We are not talking about foreign aid for China; we are talking about \nMFN for China. It seems to me it makes no sense, in terms of our \ngrowing relationship with China, to send this kind of message by \nterminating the trade status which benefits American business and \nbenefits reformers in China who, in my judgment, will ultimately bring \nabout the kind of changes in China that we would all like to see.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains? We are set for three votes at \n10 o'clock, are we not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator controls 2 minutes remaining in \nopposition. We are set for two rollcall votes at 10 o'clock.\n  Who seeks time? Two minutes remain for those who desire to speak in \nopposition; 1 minute remains for those who seek to speak in support of \nthe amendment. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to voice my opposition to the \nsense-of-the-Senate offered by the Senator from Arkansas. I support the \nPresident's decision to extend most-favored-nation status, or normal \ntrading relations, to China.\n  The problems with China on trade, security, and human rights are well \ndocumented. And I won't take the time to repeat them here. But I'll \njust say that we are all concerned with China's poor record of \npromoting democracy, free enterprise and human rights. I'm especially \nconcerned with the persecution of Christians in China.\n  But I think the question comes down to what is the best way to \ninfluence policy within China. Is it more effective to have a policy of \nisolationism, where we have virtually no trading relationship with \nChina? This is what would happen if normal trading relations is \nrevoked.\n  Or is it more effective to build a closer relationship with China \nthrough our trade policy? Trade serves to promote free enterprise and \nraise the standard of living of the Chinese people. It allows us to \nexport our principles of liberty and democracy. I believe that the \nUnited States, and the Chinese people, are clearly better off by \nstrengthening our relationship through trade.\n  Integrating China into the world community has already paid \ndividends. Recognizing that China still has many problems, most people \nwould agree that significant progress has been made just in the last 10 \nto 20 years. I believe our economic and diplomatic relations with China \nhave helped push this progress along.\n  This is not to say that we shouldn't be tough with China. Retaliatory \nmeasures can be very effective in encouraging further reforms in China. \nBut retaliation should be targeted and specific.\n  I recall that last year at this time, USTR announced $2 billion in \nsanctions against China for breaching its commitment on intellectual \nproperty rights. Now I'm told by the administration that China has \ntaken significant strides in cracking down on the pirating of \nintellectual property. Firm sanctions targeted at specific behavior can \nforce change in China.\n  Revoking our normal trading relations is a blunt, ineffective tool. \nIt would also hurt American workers, businesses, and consumers. Our $12 \nbillion in annual exports to China would be put at risk, jeopardizing \nover 200,000 American jobs. And the increase in tariffs on China's \nexports into this county amounts to a stiff tax on American consumers.\n  The costs of revoking normal trading relations with China--to \nAmerican workers and consumers and in terms of our inability to \neffectuate change in China--clearly outweigh any perceived benefits. I \nfind it hard to believe that Beijing will suddenly promote democracy \nand human rights because the United States ends its trading \nrelationship with China.\n  Engagement is the right policy for encouraging change in China.\n  Some opponents of MFN are concerned, not with these other important \nissues, but with the trading relationship itself. They point to the \nUnited States' expanding trade deficit with China, which last year \namounted to just under $40 billion.\n  The current negotiations with China on its accession to the World \nTrade Organization is an opportunity to address the trade imbalance. We \nmust get meaningful market access concessions from the Chinese before \nthey are allowed into the WTO. American products deserve the same \naccess to the Chinese market as their products enjoy in the United \nStates.\n  The stakes are very high. In the agriculture sector, these \nnegotiations will determine whether China becomes our largest export \nmarket or our biggest competitor. We cannot afford to make the same \nmistakes made when Japan entered the GATT in 1945. The United States is \nstill shut out of the market in many respects. We need a tough, fair \nagreement with China.\n  It's time to move forward in our trading relationship with China. \nLet's get beyond this annual debate over trading status and focus on \nhow we can best improve access to China's market for American workers \nand businesses, while improving the lives of the Chinese people by \npromoting human rights and serving as an example of democracy.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, my colleague from Arkansas, Mr. \nHutchinson, has offered a sense-of-the-Senate amendment today regarding \nthe President's decision to extend most-favored-nation trading status \nto the People's Republic of China for another year. Mr. Hutchinson \nbelieves the President's decision was wrong and would like to see MFN \nfor China withdrawn. While I share my colleagues concerns about MFN for \nChina, I will not support his amendment today.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I have grave reservations about the \nUnited States' policy of engagement with China. The President's \ndecision to continue to provide China free and open access to the \nUnited States market and the House vote to approve that decision were, \nin my opinion, wrong. But, that is water under the bridge. Instead of \narguing against a decision that has already been made, we should be \nlooking forward to the MFN debate next year.\n  My State of Washington is on the cutting edge of trade with China. We \ndo more business with China than virtually any other State in the \nNation and rely on that business for thousands of well-paying jobs. \nDespite our successes, the Chinese continue to impose protectionist \ntrade barriers against Washington State products and play politics with \nour exports. My State is not alone in this dilemma.\n  I firmly believe that the administration's policy of engagement is \nfailing businesses throughout the United States. The United States \ntrade deficit with China has now grown to $40 billion and is increasing \nevery day. This is unacceptable, Mr. President. I challenge my \ncolleagues to take a closer look at our policy of engagement with China \nand urge them to join me in fighting for a tougher trade policy next \nyear. If we condition MFN on significant trade concessions from China \nnext year, I am convinced that China will back down.\n  Unless we stand firm against Chinese protectionism and condition MFN \nand access to the United States market on trade concessions from China, \nwe will never reap the potential benefits of truly free trade with the \nworld's largest emerging economy.\n\n[[Page S7627]]\n\n  So, Mr. President, I will vote against this amendment today, but look \nforward to working closely with my colleagues next year to change the \nway the United States does business with China.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to express my opposition to the \nsense of the Senate resolution opposing most favored nation [MFN] \nstatus to the People's Republic of China.\n  Mr. President, I hope everyone in this Chamber recognizes that \nterrible things continue to go on inside China. Religious persecution, \npolitical repression, and coercive family planning are only the most \nvisible Chinese Government policies that violate universal standards of \nhuman decency.\n  In response to these serious problems, some of my colleagues have \ncalled for an end to China's most-favored-nation trading status with \nthe United States.\n  But I believe that that is the wrong approach. I support a 1-year \nextension of MFN for China. Why? First, because it is the best policy \nfor American consumers. Those consumers will have a wider choice of \naffordable goods with MFN than without it. To revoke MFN would be to \nincrease tariffs on goods purchased by the American people. It would \namount to a tax hike, and I am not in favor of tax hikes, particularly \nthose imposed on the basis of another government's behavior.\n  Second, I am convinced that revoking MFN would target the wrong \nparties for punishment. We should keep in mind that it is not the \npeople of China with whom we have a quarrel; it is their Government. \nTrade and United States investment in China have a positive effect in \nproviding more opportunities for average Chinese citizens. According to \nHeritage Foundation China expert Stephen J. Yates, in China, \n``employees at U.S. firms earn higher wages and are free to choose \nwhere to live, what to eat, and how to educate and care for their \nchildren. This real and measurable expansion of freedom does not \nrequire waiting for middle-class civil society to emerge in China; it \nis taking place now and should be encouraged.''\n  Third, I am convinced that terminating MFN would be damaging to the \npeople of Hong Kong, recently returned to Chinese rule.\n  All of us in Congress are concerned that China may violate the 1984 \nSino-British Joint Declaration and squash freedom, both economic and \npolitical. However, in formulating United States policy with regard to \nHong Kong, we must remember that repealing MFN for China will hit Hong \nKong hard. Former Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten has said that \nrescinding MFN would devastate Hong Kong's economy.\n  Mr. President, I have another important reason for supporting a 1-\nyear extension of MFN: American jobs. Using the Commerce Department's \nrules of thumb, United States exports to China account for roughly \n200,000 American jobs. Should we stop doing business with China, I have \nno doubt but that other nations will step in to take our place, and to \ntake jobs now occupied by Americans both here and in China.\n  Thus, by revoking MFN, we would not significantly punish the Chinese \nGovernment, but we would visit hardship on our own workers.\n  This is not to say that I believe we must stand idly by while human \nrights abuses continue in the People's Republic of China. But, rather \nthan eliminate jobs and stifle growth through increased tariffs, in my \nview it would be better to take actions showing our displeasure \ndirectly with the Chinese Government.\n\n  That is why I have introduced S. 810, the China Sanctions and Human \nRights Advancement Act.''\n  This legislation would show our disapproval of Chinese Government \nactions, while at the same time encouraging worthwhile economic and \ncultural exchanges; exchanges that can lead to positive change in \nChina.\n  It would:\n  Prohibit issuance of United States visas to Chinese Government \nofficials who implement and enforce Chinese laws and directives that \npersecute religious groups.\n  Prohibit direct and indirect United States-taxpayer financed foreign \naid for China.\n  Require the United States Government to publish a list of Chinese \ncompanies backed by the People's Liberation Army and operating in the \nUnited States. This would allow informed consumers and other purchasers \nto choose whether they wish to do business with such companies.\n  Prohibit Polytechnologies Inc., known as POLY, and NORINCO, the China \nNorth Industries Group--two Chinese companies whose officials have been \nindicted for attempting to smuggle arms into the United States--from \nexporting to the United States, or maintaining a physical presence here \nfor 1 year.\n\n  In my judgment, the combination of these sanctions and a 1-year \nextension of MFN offers the best approach to change the behavior of the \nChinese Government. These measures will direct punishment where it \nbelongs, with the Chinese Government, not the Chinese people.\n  I understand my colleague from Arkansas' frustration with current \nChinese Government policies. I commend his desire to effect those \npolicies in a positive way. But it is my firm belief that we serve the \ncause of liberty best when we serve it most consistently. By \nmaintaining free trade, while showing our disapproval of tyrannical \npractices, we stay true to our principles. We make it possible for \nliberty to spread while maintaining our own economic freedom intact.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the sense of the Senate \nresolution, to support a 1-year extension of MFN, and also to join me \nin pursuing more positive ways by which to influence Chinese Government \npolicy.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered by \nSenator Hutchinson. The sense-of-the-Senate resolution now before the \nSenate, even if it passed, will not end China's most-favored-trading \nstatus with the United States. The House of Representatives has voted \nto retain MFN status for China. Our current trading status with China \nwill continue and based on all of the evidence I have seen, I believe \nthis is the correct policy.\n  We must not mistake the decision to maintain normal trading status \nwith China with acceptance or approval of China's abysmal policies \nregarding respect for human rights, religious freedom, nuclear \nproliferation, or respect for intellectual property rights.\n  I believe that by staying engaged in China, which the extension of \nMFN provides, is the best way to promote respect for human right, free \nenterprise, and democracy in the most populous country in the world. \nAmerican businesses in China are advocates of human rights on a daily \nbasis. By staying engaged in China, we can hear the cries for freedom \nof the Chinese people. If we as Americans cut ourselves off from China, \nwho will hear these pleas for reform and progress and who else will be \nable to press China to respect human rights?\n  It is important to note that leading advocates of reform in China, \nsuch as Martin Lee in Hong Kong, are strong advocates for the extension \nof MFN to China. We must continue to bombard the Chinese with \ncapitalism. But if we isolate China, as has been suggested, and cut off \nties to the free world, that's when you condemn the persecuted and \ntheir cries are not heard. Tiananmen Square was a prodemocracy movement \nby young Chinese because of their exposure to free enterprise and \ncapitalism. Exposure to democracy, not isolation from it, will allow \nchange to come from within.\n  I have seen first hand the value of talking with Chinese leaders \nabout human rights. Last year I traveled to China and I raised the \nissue of human rights violations with many of the officials I spoke \nwith, including President Jiang Zemin. Pursuing trade with China is \nimportant so we can expose the Chinese people to the free enterprise \nsystem, capitalism, and other important concepts of our free and \ndemocratic society. Just like I did with my meetings with Chinese \nleaders, each sale, each meeting, each phone call is an opportunity to \nmake our case for respecting human rights. Engaging the Chinese, not \nisolating them, is a faster way to achieve the reforms we all want.\n  I understand that many well-meaning groups oppose the extension of \nMFN to China because of China policies which suppress religious \nfreedoms. Many Idahoans have raised this issue with me but I would like \nto quote the words of Rev. Nelson E. Graham, the\n\n[[Page S7628]]\n\nson of Dr. Billy Graham, regarding his work in China, ``In the years we \nhave been traveling to China, we have seen a definite improvement in \nthe area of religious freedom for China's Protestant believers, and I \nbelieve it is a mistake to focus on the negatives and not reinforce the \npositive strides China has made in this area.''\n  I also know many folks are concerned about the findings coming out of \nthe hearings by the Governmental Affairs Committee regarding China's \nefforts to influence elections in the United States. The timing of this \nvote coincides with hearings by the Senate Government Affairs Committee \nwhere both Democrats and Republicans conclude that China has \nparticipated in efforts to directly and indirectly influence elections \nin the United States.\n  This is of enormous concern to me because of its threat to free and \nfair elections in our country without foreign influence. This should be \nthoroughly investigated by Congress and by Federal law enforcement \nagencies. Americans who may have assisted in espionage by China should \nbe prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. If the hearings and \ninvestigations prove the Government of China did in fact attempt to \ninfluence elections, this issue must be immediately and directly \nconfronted by diplomatic and international sanctions so that \nperpetrators are brought to justice and that it never, ever happens \nagain.\n  But a vote on MFN for China is not a vote on the issue of Chinese \nespionage. A vote on MFN for China is a vote about what is best for the \ninterests of the United States and its citizens.\n  Regarding the benefits of extending MFN to China, Governor Batt of \nIdaho states, ``There are valid concerns about China's human rights \nrecord; however, I think that to severely curtail trade with the U.S. \nwould move us backward on this issue, not forward.'' Likewise, a recent \neditorial in the Idaho Statesman endorsing the extension of MFN for \nChina states, ``The surest, long-term policy for ensuring a better life \nfor people here and abroad is to promote free markets and friendly \ntrading policies.''\n  I believe we must do what is best for ourselves and what is most \nlikely to promote progress toward freedom and democracy for the people \nof China and I therefore support the extension of most-favored-nation \ntrading status for China.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment. I \nhave serious concerns about our current trade relations with China. \nLast year, our merchandise trade deficit with China grew to $39.5 \nbillion, which is an increase of more than 213 percent over the past 5 \nyears. This year, our trade deficit with China is expected to reach $50 \nbillion.\n  It is clear that, in many cases, goods from the United States are \nlocked out of China's markets, while goods from China are allowed to \nenter United States markets at nondiscriminatory tariff rates. Last \nyear, the United States imported $51.5 billion in goods from China, \nwhile China imported only $12 billion in goods from the United States. \nMore than one-third of China's exports are sold to the United States, \nwhile only 2 percent of total United States exports are sold to China.\n  The piracy of intellectual property rights in China cost the United \nStates economy $2.3 billion last year. It is estimated that as much as \n97 percent of the entertainment software sold in China is counterfeit, \nand pirated goods produced in China have been found in Asia, the Middle \nEast, Europe, and North and South America.\n  At the same time, the Government of China continues to sell weapons \nof mass destruction, and abuse the human rights of its citizens. China \nhas sold missiles, missile technology, and chemical and biological \nweapons to countries such as Iran, Libya, Syria, and Iraq. These \nweapons threaten U.S. military personnel overseas, and our allies and \nfriends around the world. And the State Department report on human \nrights in China describes widespread human rights abuses which violate \ninternationally accepted standards. The report states that all public \ndissent against the Communist party and the Government of China has \nbeen silenced by intimidation, exile, prison terms, and other forms of \ndetention.\n  The legislation which the Senate is considering today is not the \nappropriate vehicle for this amendment. The Trade Act of 1974 already \nprovides a thorough mechanism for the consideration of MFN renewal for \nnonmarket economies such as China. This amendment is being offered \nwithout consideration by any committee of the Senate, and with limited \nopportunity for debate on the Senate floor.\n  In addition, this amendment would have no legal effect. The decision \nto renew MFN for China has already been made for this year. The \nPresident renewed MFN for China in May, and the House of \nRepresentatives rejected a joint resolution of disapproval. This \namendment would have no impact on that decision.\n  Mr. President, the Government of China should not expect the United \nStates to continue to provide nondiscriminatory tariff rates to goods \nfrom China, if China continues to restrict the access of United States \nproducts to markets in China. If the renewal of MFN for China is \nconsidered by the Senate next year under the Trade Act, I may be \ncompelled to continue to oppose MFN for China unless there is a \nsubstantial improvement in China's trade practices, proliferation \npolicies, and respect for human rights.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum, with the time to be \nequally charged to both sides.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, it is my understanding that Senator \nAshcroft is on his way to speak in favor of the amendment.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I withdraw my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, it is my understanding I have 1 minute \n10 seconds. I yield the remaining time to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized for \nthe remaining time.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I thank you very much, and I thank the \nSenator from Arkansas, not only for his courtesy in this matter, but \nfor his leadership in this matter.\n  It is apparent, the House of Representatives having voted in favor of \nmost-favored-nation status for China, that anything we do by expressing \nourselves in the Senate won't have a real impact in terms of denying \nthat standing to China. But it is essential that we register the \ndispleasure and dissatisfaction of this body with the conduct of China \nin three basic categories that I believe are an appropriate standard by \nwhich we would measure our relationship with a variety of nations.\n  The first of those categories is gross trade inequities that China \nand the United States have. Some have said that most-favored-nation \nstatus is just general trading status. As it applies to China, it is \nmost-favored status. We have a wide variety of other countries whose \ntrading relationships with the United States are nearly on a parallel \nbasis of balance. Not so with China.\n  Second is that the military buildup in China threatens peace and \nstability, not only in the Pacific rim but around the world.\n  And the third is that human rights abuses in China should be \nsomething we mention very clearly and we should express with deep \nconviction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there anybody who wishes to speak in \nopposition?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to each vote in the series \nfollowing the first vote, which I gather will be momentarily.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Does anybody desire to speak in opposition to the amendment?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me say one more word about the \namendment with regard to most-favored-nation status for China.\n  My own strong impression is that with regard to Russia and most of \nthe other major nations we deal with, we\n\n[[Page S7629]]\n\nhave a series of concerns that we deal with on a concern-by-concern \nbasis, a case-by-case basis. And that is exactly what we should do.\n  In the case of China, unfortunately, our debate has gotten to where \nit is sort of all or nothing, we are either going to have most-favored-\nnation status or we are not. And that is a very blunt instrument with \nwhich to try to deal with a very important and complex relationship. I \nbelieve it would be a great mistake for us to deny most-favored-nation \nstatus to China.\n  I hope very much the amendment is rejected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). All time has expired.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 896\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n896 offered by the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman. The yeas \nand nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

There are 2 minutes of debate equally divided \non the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I ask unanimous consent Senator Feingold be added as \na cosponsor to my bill\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, Members can see the beautiful tie I am \nwearing today. It was manufactured in Little Rock, AR. It is a family \nbusiness. The owner of the family business that manufactured this tie \ntold me that the greatest threat to his economic viability is the \nunfair trade practices of Communist China.\n  I ask you to vote for this sense-of-the-Senate resolution. Suffering \nis not a term of economics. You cannot add it up, you cannot deduct it, \nyou cannot redeem it in dollars.\n  Arguments for MFN always come down to dollars and cents. But to the \naverage Chinese person, you can't build a wall, you can't separate the \neconomics from the human rights violations that are going on. A product \nof slave labor is inexorably tied and linked to the shackled hands that \nmade it.\n  I ask my colleagues, think about the enslaved, think about the \noppressed, think about the imprisoned today, think about that voice of \nfreedom that has been silenced, think about that voice of freedom in \nprison today, and speak for that one who cannot speak for himself. \nPlease vote for this amendment.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against \nthe pending sense-of-the-Senate resolu- tion that China's most-favored-\nnation trading status should be revoked. This is the worst of all \npossible alternatives. Mr. President, you will recall that Teddy \nRoosevelt said speak softly and carry a big stick, well this resolution \nis just the opposite--it is speaking loudly, and carrying no stick. The \ntraditional resolution of disapproval for MFN has already been defeated \nin the House of Representatives. So this vote has no force. In my view, \nthat is the worst possible way to send a message to China.\n  Much has been written that this year the debate over MFN is \ndifferent, that the issues have changed, but I do not think the \nfundamental choice has changed: Do we choose engagement--striving to \nbring China into the international community on terms we support--or \nisolation--allowing China to enter the international arena on terms \nbeyond our control. I think the answer is obvious.\n  MFN should be renewed unconditionally not because it is a reward to \nthe Government of China, but because revocation of MFN hurts the very \npeople we want to help. We have many grave concerns with China ranging \nfrom the treatment of dissidents and Christians to weapons \nproliferation. But severing economic ties is not the right tool to \naddress these issues. Revoking MFN only succeeds in hurting Americans, \nhurting reformers, and hurting the people of Hong Kong and Taiwan.\n  But what I have to say about linking MFN to Hong Kong's future is far \nless important than what the people of Hong Kong themselves have told \nlawmakers. Martin Lee, Hong Kong's leading democrat described revoking \nMFN as punishing Hong Kong. Miss Denise Yue, Hong Kong's Secretary for \nTrade and Industry, best described the threat of MFN revocation as \ndouble jeopardy, ``[K]nowing that if China takes away their freedoms, \nthe United States will respond by taking away their jobs . . .'' \nSimilarly, Hong Kong's Chief Executive designee Tung Chee Hwa has \nstressed that unconditional renewal of MFN is in the best interests of \nHong Kong.\n  So I think we should listen very carefully to what those who live and \nwork in Hong Kong have said, rather than pretending we know better.\n  This also applies to the Chinese on the other side of the strait--the \npeople of Taiwan. This year, as in past years, the Government of Taiwan \nis quietly supporting the renewal of normal trading ties. One has only \nto look at investment in Southern China to understand that cutting \neconomic ties between the United States and the People's Republic of \nChina will have a significant and negative economic impact on Taiwan. \nTaiwan companies and individuals have invested more than $30 billion in \nover 30,000 enterprises.\n  My colleagues should also take note that the board of the United \nStates-Republic of China (Taiwan) Business Council, a collection of \nAmerican companies doing business in Taiwan, unanimously adopted a \nresolution supporting renewal of MFN. The council noted that ``renewing \nMFN for China is good for the United States in its business with China, \nwith Taiwan, and with Hong Kong.''\n  Supporters of Taiwan, and I put myself firmly in that category, \nshould also look at the history of the United States relationship with \nTaiwan, before rejecting the claim that economic liberalization leads \nto political liberalization.\n  This United States commitment to the people of Taiwan was \nindispensable to the development of the economic and democratic miracle \nthat is Taiwan today. This was not always the case. Martial law lasted \nfrom 1950 to 1987. During that period, individual rights and freedoms \nwere stifled and political opposition was silenced. Yet, today, once \nimprisoned opposition leaders such as Peng Ming-min have been released. \nIn fact, Peng was the DPP's\n\n[[Page S7630]]\n\nPresidential candidate in last year's March election.\n  During this less than free and open period, the United States stood \nby Taiwan, maintained normal trading relations, and gave the Republic \nof China economic aid. Most historians agree that United States aid and \ninvestment served to enhance market-oriented economic reforms that \ncontributed to rising living standards and expanded economic freedoms, \nand injected a liberalizing influence into Taiwanese society. But the \ntransition to an open, democratic society took 50 years on an island of \n20 million, and was the first democracy in 5,000 years of Chinese \nhistory.\n  Of course, Taiwan's success also depended on a leadership decision to \nreform the political structure. We certainly cannot predict what \ndirection the People's Republic of China leadership will take the 1.2 \nbillion mainland Chinese, but we can follow the formula that has worked \nbefore.\n  Hong Kong's and Taiwan's freedom and power as a model for China's \nfuture evolution rests on continued economic vibrancy. U.S. policy \nshould strive to maintain confidence, not destroy it.\n  I hope that next year we can have a more constructive debate over \nwhether this annual exercise should be scrapped in favor of a deal to \ngrant permanent MFN status for China if they make the necessary \ncommercial concessions to enter the World Trade Organization.\n  The yearly exercise of public handwringing over MFN renewal has \nproven a liability to a coherent China policy. MFN was never intended \nto serve as a weapon of punishment for every problem we have with \nnonmarket economies. Its original purpose of guaranteeing freedom of \nemigration from the former Soviet Union has been grossly distorted, and \nI would say without achieving any positive results. But there is a time \nfor everything, and unfortunately now is not the time to push permanent \nMFN.\n  Integrating China into the international community poses great risks \nand equally great opportunities. If we continue down the road of \ninconsistency and fail to deal honestly with the Chinese, in concert \nwith our allies, and based on a clear understanding of the United \nStates national interest, we will have failed the sacred trust of the \nNation.\n  The United States-China relationship is pivotal to the continued \nsecurity and prosperity of Asia and America. We must ground that \nrelationship in the solid foundation of the U.S. national interest--\nensuring stability and security in Asia to limit the potential for \nconflict and tension and to provide fertile soil for democracy and \neconomic prosperity. We must also work together with our Asian allies \nto design and raise its frame; their future is as much at stake as our \nown.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say that no one in Hong Kong is \nin favor of terminating MFN to China--not the democrats, not the \nreformers, no one. I don't think there is any chance that China will \nchange without continued economic engagement.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I hope that the Hutchinson amendment will \nnot be approved.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Kentucky yield time?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. SARBANES. My understanding is that amendment does not terminate \nMFN.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It's virtual reality. I might vote for an amendment on \nsubstance, but this doesn't do that; is that correct?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. That is correct, I say to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Hutchinson \namendment, which is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution stating that we \nshould revoke China's most-favored-nation status.\n  MFN status should not be a political issue. It is nothing more than \nthe normal trade status we give virtually all our trade partners. But \nif we are to consider MFN a political issue, a look at the facts shows \nthat MFN for China is legally right; it is morally right; and it is \nright for our American national interest.\n  Why? First, and most simply, renewal of MFN status is right under our \nlaw.\n  The Jackson-Vanik law has governed renewal of MFN status for non-\nmarket economies since 1974. It conditions MFN on two things--the \nexistence of a bilateral commercial agreement and freedom of \nemigration. And under the law, the President's choice is clear. We have \na bilateral trade agreement signed with China in 1980. And China allows \nfree emigration. Therefore, as a legal matter, the President was right \nto renew MFN and we should back him up.\n  Second, renewing MFN status is morally right.\n  At times people in Washington are tempted to see a vote to revoke MFN \nas something which might promote human rights in China. That is a fine \nsentiment. Senator Hutchinson's remarks indicate that human rights is \nthe central reason he wants to revoke MFN status. But while those who \nadvocate revoking MFN status to promote human rights are well-\nintentioned, if we actually went ahead and revoked MFN status we would \nsee the opposite of what they intend.\n  To revoke MFN status, very simply, is to raise tariffs from Uruguay \nround to Smoot-Hawley levels. To take one example, that means raising \ntariffs on toys and stuffed animals from zero to 70 percent overnight. \nThat hits one of China's major exports to the United States, at about \n$6 billion worth last year. And who makes them? On the whole, young \nChinese working people trying to improve their lives.\n  What will happen if we revoke MFN status? The result should be \nobvious. Millions of innocent Chinese workers in toy factories and \nother walks of life would lose their jobs. The Chinese Government would \ncertainly be hurt, but the lives of these workers would be ruined.\n  So, far from improving human rights, revoking China's MFN status \nwould cause immense human suffering. And as the Senator said, we would \nbe sending the Chinese people a message with his resolution. But it \nwould not be a message of support--it would be a threat to put them out \nof work.\n  And of course, that would discredit our human rights efforts with the \nChinese public. No rational person can expect anyone in China to thank \nus for harming their economy and inflicting misery on them, their \nfamilies, or their fellow citizens.\n  By contrast, if human rights is our motivation, MFN is an \nirreplaceable part of any effective policy. As the Democracy Wall \nactivist Wang Xizhe--until recently a political prisoner--says:\n\n       * * * the goal of exerting effective, long-term influence \n     over China can only be achieved by maintaining the broadest \n     possible contacts with China, on the foundation of MFN, thus \n     causing China to enter further into the global family and to \n     accept globally practiced standards of behavior.\n\n  A long-term policy may emotionally be hard to accept. There are real \nhuman rights problems in China. About 3,000 political prisoners remain \nin jail.\n  Strict limits on freedom of assembly. Very severe policies in Tibet. \nThe Senator from Arkansas is right to be concerned about these issues. \nWe would like to solve them all in a day. But the fact is, that won't \nhappen. This resolution will not help us solve these problems. Only by \nstaying involved, through trade and human exchange as well as \ndiplomacy, can we hope to make a difference.\n  Finally, we are Americans first and we are responsible to the \nAmerican public on our policy decisions. And renewing MFN status is \nright for our own national interest.\n  And let me give perhaps the most important example. I visited Seoul, \nSouth Korea, and Pyongyang, North Korea, during the last Memorial Day \nrecess. And I can say from firsthand experience that we have a very \ncomplex, very dangerous situation at hand in the Korean Peninsula.\n\n  North Korea is a politically isolated government, with very severe \nfood and economic problems, and a large and well-armed military \nmachine. We just considered an amendment addressing the most recent \nprovocation by North Korea. We have a commitment to joint defense of \nSouth Korea, and 37,000 men and women permanently on the line just a \nfew miles south of the DMZ.\n  I spoke with their Supreme Commander, General Tilelli. I met with\n\n[[Page S7631]]\n\nsome of the enlisted men. I got a threat briefing from a young Army \nmajor from Wolf Point, MT.\n  If you go there, you know how seriously these men and women take the \nresponsibility we have given them. You see it in their faces. It is a \nvery dangerous place. And we here in the Senate owe it to them to \npursue a very serious, responsible policy that can keep the peace, and \nensure a swift victory if, God forbid, there is any conflict.\n  Chinese cooperation is absolutely essential to that. China is the \nlargest country, with the most powerful army, in the region. It is \nprobably the only country that can help make sure the North Korean \nGovernment understands the realities on the peninsula. It has played a \ncritically important role in restraining North Korean military \naggression and in preventing nuclear proliferation. And deliberately \nantagonizing the Chinese Government and armed services by continually \nthreatening to revoke MFN will not help at all.\n  You can go on from there to many other issues. Take trade. We need a \nmore fair, more reciprocal, better trade relationship with China. We \nhave an opportunity to do that this year by bringing China into the \nWorld Trade Organization on a commercially acceptable basis. Cutting \noff MFN status would put us on the opposite track--it would balance \ntrade at close to zero, cutting off jobs and prosperity here as well as \nin China.\n  And as we look into the next century, we must work to slow global \nwarming, ocean pollution, and loss of biodiversity. To take just one \nstatistic, in the next 20 years, world greenhouse emissions will grow \nfrom 6 to 9 trillion tons a year. Fully 1 trillion of the additional 3 \ntrillion tons will come from China.\n  We have a chance now to moderate that trend. And a political crisis \ncaused by revoking MFN would make that mutually beneficial effort very \ndifficult.\n  Our own common sense should tell us China is a key player on all \nthese issues. Wantonly picking a fight with the world's largest country \nby revoking MFN status, when only six countries in the world lack MFN \nstatus and we give 151 countries and territories tariff rates better \nthan MFN, would be foolish.\n  And our allies tell us the same thing. During my trip last May, I met \ntop national security officials in the South Korean Government. I spoke \nwith senior officers of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces. And I met \nwith Chinese dissidents and democratic political leaders in Hong Kong.\n  These are our friends. Our strategic allies. People we work with \nevery day. People who wish us well. Not a single one of them supported \nrevoking MFN status. Not a single one.\n  The right course to take is very clear. We should reject the \nHutchinson amendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as someone gravely concerned with the \nhuman rights situation in East Timor, I am pleased to see strong \nlanguage regarding military sales to Indonesia included in the foreign \noperations appropriations. I would like to commend the managers of the \nbill, the Senator from Kentucky [Mr. McConnell] and the Senator from \nVermont [Mr. Leahy], for including this provision.\n  The bill states that any agreement to sell, license for export, or \ntransfer lethal military equipment or helicopters to Indonesia must \ninclude a statement that these items will not be used in East Timor.\n  I am pleased with this language because it is important to remind \nIndonesia that Congress is still very concerned about the situation in \nEast Timor. The May 29 Indonesian elections spurred new violence in \nEast Timor. In the weeks surrounding the voting, fighting between \nIndonesian troops and East Timorese rebels resulted in dozens of \ncasualties on both sides. These deaths were only the latest in the \ntroubled region, which has been occupied by Indonesia since 1975. Human \nrights monitors estimate that as many as 200,000 East Timorese have \ndied since the occupation.\n  Mr. President, as we all know, the Indonesian Government announced \nlast month that it was no longer interested in participating in IMET or \npurchasing F-16 fighters. Congress should not relax our scrutiny of \nIndonesia's human rights practices and policies in East Timor just \nbecause these high-profile deals have been canceled.\n  Human rights organizations have expressed concerns that helicopters \nmay be used against civilians in East Timor. Thus it is important to \nensure that any such hardware provided by the United States is not used \nfor internal repression. Certainly the answer to the East Timor problem \ndoes not lie in further arming the Indonesian military and police \nforces. Thus I am also pleased that the administration has reaffirmed \nits existing policy of precluding the sale to Indonesia of small arms, \nriot control equipment, and armored personnel carriers.\n  The bill's provision strengthens this policy, reflecting Congress' \ncontinued concerns.\n\n\n                                 LIBYA\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor the Lautenberg \namendment to cut foreign aid to any country that violates U.N. \nsanctions against Libya. You cannot seek to undermine important \npolicies of the United States and expect to receive economic \nassistance.\n  The international community imposed sanctions on Libya because of \ntheir failure to extradite their intelligence agents who were indicted \nfor the bombing of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. This one act of \nterrorism cost the lives of 270 people.\n  Libya provides sanctuary to their murderers. Yet Egypt--which \nreceives billions of dollars of United States aid--has allowed Libyan \nairlines to land on their soil. They also attempted to weaken U.N. \nsanctions and even to build a free trade zone with Libya.\n  The families of those murdered on Pan Am 103 need no reminder of why \nwe have sanctions on Libya. They live with this tragedy every day of \ntheir lives. Seven people from Maryland died in this tragedy. They were \nMichael Bernstein, Jay Kingham, Karen Noonan, Ann Lindsey Otenasek, \nLousie Rogers, Miriam Wolf, and Jordy Williams.\n  They were so young. They were college students, a young Army \nlieutenant, a businessman and a lawyer. They were sons, daughters, and \nfathers. We swore that we would never forget them. We would improve \nairline safety, we would fight terrorism--and most importantly, we \nwould seek justice.\n  One of the victims, Michael Bernstein, was a renowned Nazi hunter\n\n[[Page S7632]]\n\nworking for the Justice Department. Throughout his life, he sought \njustice for the victims of the Holocaust. How tragic that his family \nhas not yet had justice.\n  His wife continues to seek justice. I ask unanimous consent that \nStephenie Bernstein's letter to the Egyptian Ambassador be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 Bethesda, MD,\n\n                                                    July 16, 1997.\n     Ambassador Ahmed Maher El-Sayed,\n     Embassy of Egypt,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Ambassador: During the last few years I have \n     expressed my views to you, both in writing and in a meeting \n     with you at the embassy, about Egypt's position on the \n     Lockerbie bombing. I am writing now to express my concern to \n     you about the disturbing events which took place last week at \n     the United Nations Security Council during the discussions on \n     renewing the sanctions imposed on Libya for its refusal to \n     turn over the suspects wanted in the bombing. As you may \n     remember, my husband, Michael S. Bernstein, was one of the \n     270 people murdered.\n       To learn that Egypt, an ally of the United States, \n     requested measures leading to removal of the sanctions \n     against Libya is appalling. The request made by Egypt to \n     convene a special meeting of the Security Council to consider \n     outlandish proposals such as trying the suspects in a neutral \n     country, trying them before Scottish judges in The Hague, or \n     establishing a special court to try the cases is not the \n     behavior of a country which is a friend of the United States, \n     189 of whose citizens were murdered in the Lockerbie \n     disaster.\n       The suspects wanted in this heinous crime of mass murder \n     have been indicted by the United States and Scotland. The \n     only acceptable locations for their trial are in the \n     countries which brought the indictments against them. Over \n     the years your country, a leader in the Arab world, has \n     repeatedly promoted what Ambassador Nabil Elaraby called last \n     week ``alternative venues'' for a trial. He referred to the \n     suffering of ``the innocent people of Libya, the innocent \n     people of neighboring countries.'' Pointedly, the Ambassador \n     ignored the continuous suffering of those whose loved ones \n     were so brutally murdered. The way to end the inconvenience \n     posed by the sanctions for Libya and its neighbors is for the \n     suspects to be turned over for trial in either the United \n     States or Scotland.\n       Egypt's misguided efforts last week and in the years after \n     the murders have unfortunately undermined the quest for \n     justice, and given hope to the Libyans and others who sponsor \n     terrorism that their murderous acts will go unpunished. When \n     Libya's U.N. ambassador can say, as he did during last week's \n     debate that ``we can from now on behave as if these sanctions \n     were not there,'' he has been given hope by Egypt that \n     something short of full compliance with basic principles of \n     law and decency will extricate his country from the troubles \n     which its leader has brought upon his people.\n       I am appalled that my government continues to give billions \n     of dollars to a country which has so openly sought to \n     undermine international law. Please be assured that other \n     family members of those murdered in the Lockerbie bombing and \n     I will work tirelessly to see that U.S. aid to Egypt does not \n     continue at the present level.\n       On August 18, 1994, you wrote me that Egypt's position on \n     the Lockerbie bombing is based on ``The total respect and \n     adherence to the U.N. resolutions concerning Libya.'' The \n     actions taken by Egypt last week demonstrated a complete lack \n     of regard for the U.N. resolutions, for the family members of \n     those murdered, and lastly for the United States.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Stephanie L. Bernstein.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the Senate chose to reinstate the \nearmark for aid to Egypt. They cannot assume that we will continue to \ndo this unless they become partners in the fight against terrorism.\n\n\n             China MFN Renewal and Proliferation Violations\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I want to explain why I voted against the \namendment offered by the Senator from Arkansas, [Mr. Hutchinson] \ncalling for a revocation of China's most-favored-nation trading status. \nRevoking China's nondiscriminatory trading status is not a silver \nbullet we can fire to address our many legitimate concerns with China. \nMFN is ill-suited to carry single-handedly the burdens of our complex \nand multifaceted relationship.\n  Yet, simply extending China's most-favored-nation status does little \nto advance our interests with China. Moreover, it does nothing to \naddress those areas where China's conduct is inconsistent with \ninternational norms or in violation of their bilateral commitments.\n  In short Mr. President, engagement with China is not a policy, it is \njust a means to an end. It is the content of the engagement that \nmatters.\n  In the area of nonproliferation, for all of our engagement, China's \nconduct clearly remains unacceptable.\n  Just last May, the State Department belatedly imposed sanctions on \ntwo key Chinese chemical firms--Nanjing Chemical Industries Group and \nJiangsu Yongli Chemical Engineering and Technology Import Export \nCorp.--that knowingly and materially contributed to Iran's chemical \nweapons program.\n  If this case were the lone exception, it would still be troubling. \nUnfortunately, it appears to be the norm.\n  China has knowingly aided the development of weapons of mass \ndestruction, and the means to deliver them, in irresponsible states or \nin countries located in unstable regions of the world. China has \nprovided nuclear technology, cruise missiles, and ballistic missile \ntechnology to Iran. China has also exported M-11 missiles--which can be \nequipped with nuclear warheads--and missile production know-how to \nPakistan.\n  These exports appear to be part of a deliberate government policy \nthat traces its roots to the ancient Chinese strategy of balancing one \nbarbarian off against another, and we may be one of the barbarians \nBeijing has in mind.\n  A critical objective of our relationship with China must be to \nconvince Beijing not only to sign up to international nonproliferation \nregimes, but to follow through on its commitments.\n  In general, we should: stick to incentives and penalties we are \nprepared to deliver; act multilaterally, where possible, to avoid \nhaving our initiatives undercut; and replace our once-a-year debate on \nMFN with a sustained, high-level commitment to improving our overall \nrelationship.\n  I hope that diplomatic pressure, international suasion, and targeted \nsanctions will change Beijing's attitude toward nonproliferation. \nChinese compliance with international regimes appears to improve when \nthey are convinced that officials at the highest levels of the U.S. \nGovernment are scrutinizing their behavior.\n  But my patience is not limitless.\n  My vote today should not be interpreted as an expression of my \nsatisfaction with China's behavior or the administration's policy of \nengagement. Moreover, it should not be viewed as an indication of how I \nmight vote when MFN comes up for renewal next year.\n  If China fails to clean up its act, it may leave me no choice but to \nvote to revoke MFN. Sending a strong message--knowing full well that it \nwon't miraculously bring about positive changes in China--may prove \npreferable to doing nothing while China makes the world a more \ndangerous place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I \nsend the corrections to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 915), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 43, line 3 after the word ``(IAEA),'' insert the \n     following new section:\n\n     SEC.  . AUTHORIZATION REQUIREMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL \n                   INSTITUTIONS.\n\n       (a) The Secretary of the Treasury may, to fulfill \n     commitments of the United States, (1) effect the United \n     States participation in the first general capital increase of \n     the European Bank for Rconstruction and Development, \n     subscribe to and make payment for 100,000 additional shares \n     of the capital stock of the Bank on behalf of the United \n     States; and (2) contribute on behalf of the United States to \n     the eleventh replenishment of the resources of the \n     International Development Association, to the sixth \n     replenishment of the resources of the Asian Development Fund, \n     a special fund of the Asian Development Bank.

Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator from \nKentucky about committee report language directing that no peacekeeping \nfunds be made available for the Africa crisis response initiative \n[ACRI]. I understand the House version of this bill and the \naccompanying report contain no such restrictions.\n  I understand further that the Committee on Appropriations has raised \nseveral concerns about this initiative which are currently being \nresolved by the administration.\n  Therefore, I wonder if the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee \non Foreign Operations will be looking to support the House mark in the \npeacekeeping account and to revise the report language in conference to \nreflect this change, along with continuing concerns.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from Wisconsin is correct. I have had some \nstrong reservations about the potential duplication of this initiative \nwith respect to other military assistance programs of the United States \nand of other countries, as well as about the role of the United Nations \nin the initiative. Both the Departments of Defense and of State have \nbeen cooperative in addressing these potential problems.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for his cooperation \non this matter. I want to take a few moments to express my views on the \nACRI.\n  Mr. President, I was disappointed to read in the report on this bill \nthat the Committee on Appropriations directed ``that no funds be made \navailable for the Africa Crisis Response Force,'' an earlier title of \nwhat the administration now refers to as the Africa Crisis Response \nInitiative [ACRI]. This language would prohibit the administration's \nflexibility to use up to $15 million of the peacekeeping account for \nthis initiative.\n  The ACRI, in my view, is an inventive proposal on the part of the \nadministration. It seeks to expand the capacity of qualified African \nmilitaries to respond to peacekeeping needs in Africa by merging the \nresources of the United States and several of our European partners to \nprovide peacekeeping training. The ACRI would help create effective, \nrapidly deployable peacekeeping units that would be able to operate \ntogether. Such an initiative could ultimately reduce the burden on U.S. \nresources in the event of a major humanitarian or other crisis in the \nregion.\n  Let me elaborate on what we are talking about. The Africa Crisis \nResponse Initiative would provide training to selected African \nmilitaries to raise their capabilities to a common peacekeeping \nstandard derived from United States, British, Nordic, and United \nNations doctrine. In most cases, this will involve intensive training \nover a 2-month period in any single country, and will include important \ntrain-the-trainer activities so that additional instruction may take \nplace after the international representatives have departed.\n  Troops will be trained in tasks common to peacekeeping operations and \non how to utilize common communications equipment. Equally as \nimportant, they will also receive instruction in civil-military \nrelations and respect for human rights. U.S. trainers intend to use \nnongovernmental and private voluntary organizations in the training \nwhere possible. Any equipment that is provided to the participating \ncountries would be nonlethal in nature and could include items to \nsupport mine detection, water purification, or night vision.\n  Already several African countries have told United States officials \nthey would like to participate in the ACRI, including Ethiopia, Uganda, \nGhana, Mali, Senegal, and Malawi. Senegal and Uganda will begin \ntraining at the end of this month. It is also important that the \nSecretaries General of the United Nations and the Organization for \nAfrican Unity have indicated their support. I should also note that \nthis proposal is strongly supported by the U.S. Joint Staff and by our \nmilitary command in Europe--the United States European Command [EUCOM].\n  The ACRI proposal appeals to me because it provides a mechanism \nthrough which the United States can both contribute to the resolution \nof crises in the region, while at the same time, help ensure that the \nUnited States will not bear the total burden of doing so. By having \nready, trained troops on the ground in Africa, the ACRI would decrease \nthe time it takes to respond to local crises. But most importantly, if \nthe proposal is implemented as intended, it would decrease the amount \nof outside support the Africans would require and preclude the need to \nsend American combat troops to the region when there is a crisis. The \nACRI is a means to provide appropriate African governments with a \ncapacity they have said they want--the capability to respond to \nregional crises.\n  This is a concept that I have been pondering for several years. A \n1994 trip to Liberia later heightened my interest. At the time, many \nobservers were convinced that the only way to solve the crisis in \nLiberia, a country wracked with civil war since 1989, was to deploy a \nlarge force of American soldiers to stop the fighting and then maintain \nthe peace.\n  Like many other Americans, I opposed the deployment of American \ntroops for this purpose. But I became intrigued with an alternative \nthat had been employed in Liberia since 1990--an all African \npeacekeeping force. This force, the West African peacekeeping force \nknown by its French acronym ECOMOG, has not--by any definition--been a \nperfect mission, and has certainly had its share of problems. But after \nmany fits and starts, ECOMOG troops have succeeded in establishing \nsecurity in the country such that Liberians will have the opportunity \nto safely go to the polls this weekend to participate in an important \nnational election. The United States has made important contributions \nto this effort in the form of airlift and other logistical support to \nECOMOG.\n  While I do not want to put too much reliance in the ECOMOG experience \nitself, since its record has been mixed, I think we can draw at least \ntwo important lessons. First, African governments do want to contribute \nto maintaining peace in neighboring countries. Second, the United \nStates can support those efforts by sharing our strengths in areas such \nas technical assistance, logistics, and communications, for example. \nOur European partners would make similar contributions.\n  That is what this proposal is all about. It is a cooperative effort \nto which all participants contribute.\n  Despite my enthusiasm for this initiative, Mr. President, I would \nalso caution the administration on the tough choices it may soon have \nto make with respect to which countries can and should be invited to \nparticipate in the ACRI. When the administration first explored this \nproposal, it presented its preliminary ideas to 10 governments. These \ncountries were understood to have excellent relations with the United \nStates, as well as relatively disciplined militaries and democratic \ngovernments. It is my view that such qualities should represent the \nminimum standards for the United States to engage in the high-level \nmilitary contact envisioned by the ACRI proposal.\n  As beneficial as the ACRI will be for the United States, it is also \nbeneficial for the African countries involved. Congress will look \nharshly at any decisions that might be made to work with a government \nthat has come to power through military action or that abuses\n\n[[Page S7634]]\n\nthe rights of its citizens. I have concerns in particular about the \npossibility of including the Government of Nigeria in this initiative. \nWhile I recognize the strength of Nigeria's military and the important \ncontribution it has made to the peacekeeping effort in Liberia, the \nGovernment's continued disdain for the needs of its people and \ncontinued human rights abuses I believe should preclude it from \nparticipation in the ACRI.\n  Mr. President, in the long term, the administration anticipates that \nthe trained and ready forces that have benefited from the ACRI will be \nable to respond quickly to crises in the region with African troops led \nby Africans. Although I can foresee that the international community \nmight still be called upon to provide logistics assistance in certain \ncases, I believe strongly that technical assistance of that nature is \nan appropriate response for the United States.\n  With the rising number of conflicts in the post-cold-war era, \nAmerican troops are being called on more than ever to participate in \npeacekeeping operations that just are not tenable. The ACRI provides a \ncreative way to respond to these demands while decreasing the need to \ndeploy our own men and women.\n  Mr. President, I hope the conferees will agree on funding and \nlanguage that will allow the administration to continue to pursue this \ncreative approach to crisis intervention in Africa. The ACRI \nstrengthens regional abilities to respond in a rapid and effective \nmanner, rather than calling for direct United States or European \nintervention.\n\n\n            INTERNATIONAL FUND FOR AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise to ask whether the distinguished \nranking member, Senator Leahy, would be willing to engage in a colloquy \nwith me about the International Fund for Agricultural Development, or \nIFAD.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would be happy to engage in a colloquy \nwith the Senator about the good work that IFAD does.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member.\n  As my colleague knows, IFAD is a specialized agency of the United \nNations that has the mission of fighting hunger and poverty throughout \nthe world. Since 1977 IFAD has helped rural poor to increase their \nnutrition, their food production and their income. It has reached about \n160 million people through 429 different projects, mostly in Africa and \nAsia, the regions where most of the world's poor live. In its lending \nwork, IFAD has an overhead of less than 10 percent, and it has achieved \nloan repayments of 97 percent in countries as diverse as Bangladesh, \nBenin, and Dominica.\n  More importantly, IFAD has been an innovator in providing microcredit \nto vulnerable groups that are often difficult to reach, such as small \nfarmers, the landless poor and rural women.\n  Mr. President, that is why I was interested to read language related \nto IFAD in the report of the House Appropriations Committee on the \nHouse's version of the foreign operations bill. I was pleased to read, \non page 18 of the House report, that the House Appropriations Committee \n``requests that AID [the Agency for International Development] examine \nthe possibility of using the International Fund for Agricultural \nDevelopment as an implementing agency in providing microenterprise \nassistance.''\n  This is in the context of the House's $10 million increase over the \nadministration's request for the AID microenterprise account. As my \ncolleague knows, the Senate Appropriations Committee has increased the \nsame account by $15 million.\n  Mr. President, I wonder whether my distinguished colleague could tell \nme whether he would support the House position in conference, that the \nAgency for International Development should consider using IFAD as one \nof the implementing agencies in providing microenterprise assistance.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I concur with the Senator from North Dakota \non this matter. The International Fund for Agricultural Development has \nsupplied nearly 300 microfinance projects with almost $1 billion of \nfunding. I am particularly pleased that 40 percent of these projects \nhave been in sub-Saharan Africa, where the need for this type of \nassistance is greatest.\n  It seems to me that the Agency for International Development should \ncertainly consider using IFAD's capabilities. I therefore will likely \nsupport the House position on this matter and urge the conferees to \ninclude appropriate language in the statement of managers accompanying \nthe conference report.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I greatly appreciate the support of the Senator from \nVermont in this matter. I look forward to working with him to ensure \nthat the conference report provides appropriate guidance to the Agency \nfor International Development with respect to IFAD. I thank the \ndistinguished ranking member for his assistance, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading, and was \nread the third time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Do Senators yield back their time prior to the \nvote?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield any time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield any time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Shall the bill, as amended, \npass? On this question, the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the \nclerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Montana [Mr. Burns] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMontana [Mr. Burns] would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum).

(a) Findings.--Congress makes the following \n     findings:\n       (1) United States training of members of Latin American \n     military and security forces that occurred primarily at the \n     Army School of the Americas between 1982 and 1991 has been \n     severely criticized for promoting practices that have \n     contributed to the violation of human rights and have \n     otherwise been inconsistent with the appropriate role of the \n     Armed Forces in a democratic society.\n       (2) Numerous members of Latin American military and \n     security forces who have participated in United States \n     sponsored training programs, have subsequently been \n     identified as having masterminded, participated in, or sought \n     to cover up some of the most heinous human rights abuses in \n     the region.\n       (3) United States interests in Latin America would be \n     better served if Latin American military personnel were \n     exposed to training programs designed to promote--\n       (A) proper management of scarce national defense resources,\n       (B) improvements in national systems of justice in \n     accordance with internationally recognized principles of \n     human rights, and\n       (C) greater respect and understanding of the principle of \n     civilian control of the military.\n       (4) In 1989, Congress mandated that the Department of \n     Defense institute new training programs (commonly referred to \n     as expanded IMET) with funds made available for international \n     military and education programs in order to promote the \n     interests described in paragraph (3). Congress also expanded \n     the definition of eligibility for such training to include \n     non-defense government personnel from countries in Latin \n     America.\n       (5) Despite congressionally mandated emphasis on expanded \n     IMET training programs, only 4 of the more than 50 courses \n     offered annually at the United States Army School of the \n     Americas qualify as expanded IMET.\n       (b) Limitation on Use of Funds.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, none of the funds appropriated in this Act \n     under the heading relating to international military \n     education and training may be made available for training \n     members of any Latin American military or security force \n     until--\n       (1) the Secretary of Defense has advised the Secretary of \n     State in writing that 30 percent of IMET funds appropriated \n     for fiscal year 1998 for the cost of Latin American \n     participants in IMET programs will be disbursed only for the \n     purpose of supporting enrollment of such participants in \n     expanded IMET courses; and\n       (2) the Secretary of State has identified sufficient \n     numbers of qualified, non-military personnel from countries \n     in Latin America to participate in IMET programs during \n     fiscal year 1998 in consultation with the Secretary of \n     Defense, and has instructed United States embassies in the \n     hemisphere to approve their participation in such programs so \n     that not less than 25 percent of the individuals from Latin \n     American countries attending United States supported IMET \n     programs are civilians.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall report in \n     writing to the appropriate committees of Congress on the \n     progress made to improve military training of Latin American \n     participants in the areas of human rights and civilian \n     control of the military. The Secretary shall include in the \n     report plans for implementing additional expanded IMET \n     programs for Latin America during the next 3 fiscal years.\n\n\n                    LIBERATION TIGERS OF TAMIL EELAM\n\n       Sec. 594. Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Department of State should list the Liberation \n     Tigers of Tamil Eelam as a terrorist organization.\n\n\nLIMITATION ON INTERNATIONAL MILITARY EDUCATION AND TRAINING ASSISTANCE \n                                FOR PERU\n\n       Sec. 595. None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be provided to the Government of \n     Peru for international military education and training under \n     chapter 5 of part II of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, \n     unless the President certifies to Congress that the \n     Government of Peru is taking all necessary steps to ensure\n\n[[Page S7650]]\n\n     that United States citizens held in prisons in Peru are \n     accorded timely, open, and fair legal proceedings in civilian \n     courts.\n\n\n LIMIT AID TO THE GOVERNMENT OF CONGO UNTIL PRESIDENTIAL CERTIFICATION\n\n       Sec. 596. None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be provided to the Government of \n     Congo until such time as the President reports in writing to \n     the Congress that the Government of Congo is cooperating \n     fully with investigators from the United Nations or any other \n     international relief organizations in accounting for human \n     rights violations or atrocities committed in Congo or \n     adjacent countries.\n       Titles I through V of this Act may be cited as the \n     ``Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs \n     Appropriations Act, 1998''.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I see the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee in the Chamber. I just want to make the point \nthat I think we must have achieved some kind of record here in light \nof, in 3 days, having passed four bills. I congratulate him on his \nleadership, which has pushed us in that direction very skillfully.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I congratulate \nthe two managers of this bill, Senator McConnell and Senator Leahy, for \naccomplishing almost the impossible-- to have the foreign assistance \nbill passed in this manner.\n  We had a meeting at the beginning of this year when I became chairman \nand talked about trying to have a program of crisis avoidance, and this \nis a good example of it. These two Senators have worked with all \nMembers who had amendments and tried to accommodate them, at least \ndealt with most of them, and the result is on the floor being able to \npass this bill, and it is a great bill. What was the final vote?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It was 91 to 8.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I can remember the days when this bill was filibustered \nfor days and days and days. It is really a tribute to the two managers \nfor having accomplished this, and I congratulate them very much.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator from Alaska will yield, I \nsay for my colleagues one of the joys of the Appropriations Committee \nis that there are a lot of senior Members on both sides of the aisle \nwho are used to working with each other to build the kind of personal \nrelationships that are necessary. I cherish my own friendship with the \nSenator from Alaska and the Senator from Kentucky. We have worked \ntogether on a lot of different pieces of legislation, not just this one \nbut a lot of others, and I think we understand there are certain things \nthat can be done and certain things that cannot be done, and we go for \nthe possible.\n  I note that this is a record, and I commend the Senator from Kentucky \nfor getting it through so rapidly. But it is a case, again, I would say \nto the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who sat down with us \nand tried to give us leeway, a realistic schedule, of the ability to \nwork out many things even before they got to the floor.\n  I have been both a manager and the ranking member of a lot of pieces \nof legislation. What has been happening with the appropriations bills \nis a model of the way it should be done--move them, move them quickly. \nPeople have an issue; vote on it and move on to the next thing. The \nSenate is better served. The country is better served.\n  I commend my two colleagues for their help.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I, too, thank my good friend, Pat \nLeahy, for his marvelous cooperation and also extend my thanks to Steve \nCortese, director of the full committee, who has been a joy to work \nwith, and Tim Rieser of Senator Leahy's staff and, of course, long-time \nforeign policy adviser, now staff director of the subcommittee, Robin \nCleveland, and Billy Piper and Will Smith, who have done yeoman service \nand outstanding work on this. I thank them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I also want to compliment Robin Cleveland \nand Will Smith of the committee staff and Billy Piper of Senator \nMcConnell's staff, and, of course, as he has already mentioned, Tim \nRieser of my staff, who has done so much on this, Emily East from the \nappropriations staff; Lesley Carson, who is a Javits scholar with the \nappropriations subcommittee; Dick D'Amato, a long-time member of the \nappropriations staff, and John Rosenwasser from the Budget Committee. \nThere is an awful lot that goes on among staff to make this possible. \nWe do not have the expertise of the staff. We cannot move a bill this \nquickly no matter how hard we Senators may try, and I commend the staff \non both sides of the aisle in this case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/17/senate-section/article/S7623-5", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMMENDATION OF GEN. BARRY McCAFFREY\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, during the consideration of the foreign \noperations appropriations bill yesterday, I offered an amendment along \nwith Senator McCain on the drug certification issue. During the course \nof that debate, some references were made to Gen. Barry McCaffrey that \nI thought were unfortunate and incorrect.\n  John McCain, our colleague from Arizona, rightly stood up and pointed \nout that Barry McCaffrey, whatever one's views may have been on the \ncertification issue, enjoys, I think, without any question, the \ntremendous confidence of the Members of this body. We may disagree on \nvarious policy issues. I wanted to associate myself with Senator \nMcCain's remarks and express my gratitude to General McCaffrey for \ntaking on this job, one of the most difficult jobs in Government, that \nis, to be the drug czar.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to express my confidence, and I am confident \nthe confidence of my colleagues, in Barry McCaffrey. This is a very \ndifficult job he has taken on. It is tremendously complex. It is \nobviously a source of great, great disturbance in this country to watch \nthe ever-increasing proliferation of illegal drugs, and obviously there \nis a domestic feature to this and there is an international feature to \nit. His job is not an easy one and he has to deal with people all over \nthe globe. I think he does so with a great deal of integrity, \nseriousness, and forthrightness. He has been tremendously responsive to \nthose of us up here on Capitol Hill who care about this issue.\n  I thank Senator McCain for his remarks yesterday and associate \nmyself, as I said, with those remarks, and once again express my high \ndegree of confidence in the General and my appreciation as well for the \nwork he has done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, one of the truly great ideas that \nsomebody came up with back in 1872 was to establish the first national \npark. Ulysses Grant was President. Unhappily, that same year Ulysses \nGrant signed a bill called the mining law of 1872. But back to the \npoint. President Grant established the first national park in this \nNation. It has been a source of pride and usage and a great deal of \neuphoria for America's people ever since. We in the Senate and in the \nHouse profess our undying commitment to a National Park System second \nto none while we have routinely starved the park system to death.\n\n[[Page S7651]]\n\n  Now, US News and World Report, on top of report after report that has \nbeen issued over the past 10 to 15 years, in the current July 21 \nedition, has an article which I recommend to every Member of the Senate \ncalled ``Parks in Peril''. ``The national parks have been called the \nbest America had. But their wild beauty and historical treasures are \nrapidly deteriorating''--repeat, rapidly deteriorating--``from lack of \nfunds, pollution, encroaching development, overcrowding and \ncongressional indifference.''\n  Mr. President, these parks are being encroached on by development; \nthey are being stifled by pollution. On any given day in the winter, \nthe pollution at Yellowstone National Park from snowmobiles alone is \nequal to the smog in Washington, DC. And the infrastructure is falling \ndown. Buildings are rotting, buildings are decaying, and some of the \ntreasures such as Chaco Canyon in New Mexico, some of those ancient \nruins, are falling down for lack of money to restore them.\n  All this time, Mr. President, we allow the mining companies, the \nbiggest mining companies in the world, to buy Federal lands for $2.50 \nan acre, take billions of dollars of gold off those lands and not pay \nthe taxpayers of America one red cent. That is money that alone could \nreverse the deterioration of our National Park Service. We have grazing \nlaws in this country which are just short of scandalous, in which we \nallow some of the biggest corporations in America to lease grazing \nlands from BLM for a song. And one of the worst tragedies of all is \nthat we have a concessions policy where we allow the concession stands \nat national parks to be handed down from generation to generation. You \ncannot take one away from a concessionaire under existing law.\n  Mr. President, the return now to the Park Service on concessions is \nabout 6 percent. About the only park we have in our system with a \nconcession, which was let 3 years ago on a competitive basis, is \nYosemite, and last year Yosemite, the only park that has a concession \npolicy that was competitively let, produced 37 percent. That one park \nproduced 37 percent of all the return the Park Service got for all its \nconcessions.\n  We had a bill here that I sponsored that passed the Senate 99 to zip, \nwent over to the House and died. If you were to pass another one today \n99 to zip, it would probably go to the House and die, because this \nsuits the policy of too many Members of Congress while our Park System \ndeteriorates.\n  I strongly recommend everybody read this. The polls consistently show \nthat the people of this country are upset because we tolerate some of \nthe kinds of corporate welfare I just described--rich people, the \nbiggest corporations in the world, not paying their way. And \noftentimes, because of the way we finance campaigns in this country, we \ncan't stop it or do anything about it. Our priorities are terribly \nskewed when we allow some of these things to continue while the \nnational parks, the greatest treasury we possess in this country, \ndecline. We just passed a defense bill, $268 billion, and not an enemy \nin sight. There is not an enemy in sight; $268 billion, and we had one \nrollcall vote. I can remember when that bill would take 2 weeks to \npass.\n  So, Mr. President, I speak with a great deal of passion this morning \nbecause I chaired the National Parks Subcommittee for many years, and I \ndid everything I could to reverse the policy that was so patently \nobvious to me back then, years ago, that we were neglecting our \nnational parks and we were going to pay a price for it. One thing we \nhave done is, while we added a lot of parks, we have never added any \nfunding. We are either going to have to fish or cut bait. We either \nhave to get rid of parks, which I don't think anybody in this body \nfavors, or we are going to have to fund them. And finally, the last \nalternative is watch them fall apart before our eyes to the chagrin, \ndismay, disappointment, and outright animosity of the American people \nfor our indifference and negligence to our National Park System.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield? I was hoping to have a little \ndiscussion with the Senator. What is the time situation, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this time there is no limitation on debate.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I know there is a Senator waiting here, \nbut I would just like to ask my friend about the national parks, if he \nwould respond. I can remember so well, I helped, worked with, President \nEisenhower for what we called Mission 66, a 10-year period to improve \nthe parks. I think, if the Senator would look at that period, at the \nend of 1966 the parks were in the best condition they have been since \nthe turn of the century. Since that time, the vision of the Park \nService has been to add acreage to the parks. Today we see the parks in \nthe worst condition they have been in in my lifetime. Maintenance of \nthe parks, the accumulated maintenance that has been deferred, is just \noverwhelming. I think it would take the total annual appropriation of \nthe Park Service to catch up just on deferred maintenance at the \nhistoric park sites, Yosemite, Yellowstone, and all of those that are \nin the south 48.\n  But my question to the Senator is, we have now almost 80 percent of \nthe land that is in the Park Service in my State and we have about 1 \npercent of the Park Service money. I don't think anyone has looked at \nwhat has happened to the parks, in terms of this rush to add acreage to \nthe parks instead of maintaining discrete park areas that are \nabsolutely beautiful and need to be preserved.\n  One of my predecessors, Senator Gruening, introduced a bill to \nestablish parks in the State of Alaska. I did, too. Those parks that we \nsought were ignored and, instead, we have vast areas of parks that are \nout there. All they have in them is Park Service employees, \naccommodation for Park Service employees, no roads into them, no \nairports in them, but they are listed as national parks.\n  I ask you, if there is to be a rational park system in the country, \ndon't you think we ought to have accessibility to areas that are set \naside as national parks? Don't you think we ought to be concentrating \nnow on maintaining the parks that are there so visitors can use them?\n  The answer now to people who are in charge of the parks is to close \nthe parks, to limit the number of people that go into the parks because \nthe maintenance is so bad that they think the people coming in the \nparks will now destroy them. I agree, maintenance is very bad. But \nparks are for people, I thought.\n  I would like to have the Senator speak up. I do hope one of these \ndays we can have a long discussion about the National Park System and \nhow it has changed. It has changed to people who want to control land \nfrom people who want to preserve the very best and most beautiful \nportions of our country, and that disturbs me greatly.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Let me say, I could not agree with the Senator more, and \nI also say some of the damage that is occurring in the National Park \nSystem is not just to the infrastructure; that is, the buildings, which \ncan be replaced and repaired. Some of the irreversible damage is being \ndone to the natural beauty of the national parks, which cannot be \nundone. I could not agree more with the Senator that we have added a \nlot of land. I am not saying we did it wrongly. I am not saying we were \nin error when we did it. I am saying we can do both. We can have an \nexpanded park system and we can fund it. If the American people \nunderstand anything, in my opinion, it is our skewed priorities here, \nwhat we spend money for.\n\n  If you were to take a poll--not ask for an extemporaneous response, \nbut say, ``Which of the following do you consider the most important?'' \nI daresay the National Park System and the maintenance of it for the \nenjoyment of all the American people would rank very near the top. We \nsimply have not made a commitment.\n  You recall under President George Bush we did a very extensive study \non the National Park System, and they came back and said it would \ntake--that has been 8 years ago, a little over, about 8 years ago--they \nsaid it would take $2 billion just to start doing the infrastructure. \nThat had nothing to do with adding lands or anything else. They said, \nin order to bring our parks up to par right now--that was 8 years ago \nwith 8 years of inflation added to it now--it would take $2 billion.\n  As I say, everybody loves the parks. Everybody in the Senate, \neverybody in\n\n[[Page S7652]]\n\nthe House, would profess their undying love for the National Park \nSystem, but we simply are not putting the money where our mouth is.\n  That is the only point I want to make this morning, and that is the \npoint this article makes in U.S. News & World Report. I see the \ndistinguished Senator who is now the chairman of the same committee I \nmentioned I chaired for many years. I will be happy to yield to him.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask the Senator if he is aware that the \nsubcommittee is now in the process of seeking to put together a plan, a \nlong-term plan? All of us who understand that parks and their resources \nare one of the most valuable resources that we have, that there are \ntroublesome things happening and frankly there is no plan in place and \nwe need to have one--we need to talk about finances. There needs to be \nsome additional resources for finances in addition to the \nappropriations. We need to talk about how we do some bonding, how we do \nsome private investment, how we do some other kinds of things. In \naddition, we need to talk about the concessionaires. We need to get \nthat straightened out so it moves. We need to talk, frankly, about the \nmanagement of the parks so we have a plan that has measurable results \nso the plans that are set for the Nation will also be applied in the \nparks. And we have invited the administration to participate.\n  Fortunately, this morning we have a nominee for the Park Service. We \nhave not had a Park Service Director. So I want to assure the Senator \nthat there is underway an effort to basically reform and move forward \nand, also, I forgot to say, to have something that defines more clearly \nwhat kind of a park is appropriate to be part of the National System so \nwe are not taking in what is more appropriately local recreation areas \nto be managed by the National Park Service.\n  So I couldn't share more the concerns that people have, but I wanted \nto tell my colleague that we are moving forward with that and intend to \nhave a plan before this Congress by the end of the year.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Senator very much. I do not want to take any \nmore time of the Senator.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wonder if I could ask, colleagues \nhave been involved in an important discussion. I think they probably \nwould want to go on more, but I know Senator DeWine and I want to \nintroduce a bill. We thought we might have a little more time. I ask \nunanimous consent that morning business be extended for an additional \n15 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Would the Senator repeat his request?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I asked unanimous consent that morning business--we \nwere hoping we would be able to introduce a bill and talk about it a \nlittle while. Given the important discussion that took place, I asked \nwhether or not we could extend 10 minutes beyond what we had originally \nplanned for morning business.\n  Mr. DeWINE. That would be 11:40.\n  Mr. STEVENS. May I inquire, how many Senators are involved?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Senator DeWine and I wanted to introduce a bill. This \nwould give us altogether maybe 15 minutes between two people.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will not object if it's just 10 minutes past the half-\nhour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. DeWine and Mr. Wellstone pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 1029 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator yield back any time he might have?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I do.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask that we proceed with the regular \norder.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/17/senate-section/article/S7650-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7652-S7659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TREASURY AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport S. 1023.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1023) making appropriations for the Treasury \n     Department, the United States Postal Service, the Executive \n     Office of the President, and certain Independent Agencies, \n     for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1998, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Kohl, and I are \nbringing before the Senate today the Senate Appropriations Committee \nrecommendation for the fiscal year 1998 appropriations for the \nDepartment of the Treasury, U.S. Postal Service, the Executive Office \nof the President, and certain independent agencies. The bill we are \npresenting today contains a total funding of $25,206,539,000. This is \n$1,104,116,000 more than the fiscal year 1997 level, and $455,866,000 \nless than the President's request. We are recommending a total of \n$12,321,339,000 in discretionary spending and $12,885,100,000 for \nmandatory programs over which this subcommittee has no control.\n  Reaching this level has not been an easy task, and I certainly thank \nSenator Kohl, who has yet to arrive on the floor, for his hard work and \ncontinuing support and advice as we put this bill together.\n  Mr. President, this bill includes $11,315,801,000 for the Department \nof the Treasury. As my colleagues are aware, the Department of the \nTreasury has a wide range of responsibilities directed not only at the \nrevenues and expenditures of the Government, but law enforcement \nfunctions as well.\n  The Treasury Department is responsible for 40 percent of all Federal \nlaw enforcement, and adequate funding for this function has been a \npriority for both Senator Kohl and myself. The subcommittee has done \nwhat we can to ensure that law enforcement agencies funded in this bill \nhave the resources to do the job that we asked them to do in the so-\ncalled war against crime. In addition, we have provided a total of $131 \nmillion in the violent crime reduction trust fund. This is $12.7 \nmillion more than requested by the President and $34 million more than \nprovided in fiscal year 1997.\n  This bill includes $121,124,000 for payments to the U.S. Postal \nService to reimburse them for providing free mail for the blind and for \noverseas voters and for payment to the Department of Labor for \ndisability costs incurred by the old Post Office Department.\n  The Executive Office of the President and funds appropriated to the \nPresident total $485,225,000. This includes the Office of Drug Control \nPolicy.\n  As many of our colleagues know, the bill includes the \nadministration's proposal for a 1-year moratorium on new construction \nprojects through the General Services Administration Federal Buildings \nFund. It is unfortunate, when we need so many renovations on \ncourthouses, that the GSA calculation of rent income to the Federal \nbuilding fund has been so inaccurate in the past years that we are at a \npoint where there is just barely enough money to continue ongoing \nprojects.\n  There is also $12.7 billion in mandatory payments through the Office \nof Personnel Management for annuitants' life and health insurance, as \nwell as retirement benefits.\n  There has been considerable discussion over the past couple of years \nabout the funding level for the Internal Revenue Service. Many of us \nare very disturbed that significant amounts of money, over $4 billion, \nwas wasted on the tax modernization system. As a result, we have very \ncarefully reviewed the budget request from the IRS. We believe that the \nIRS should have sufficient resources to maintain and even increase \ncustomer service levels, and there must be enough to continue efforts \nto collect taxes due. As a result, we have proposed appropriations at \nthe level requested by the President for the three permanent accounts. \nHowever, we did not agree to the President's request for an advance \nappropriation of $500 million to set up an account for future computer \nmodernization efforts.\n  Although the IRS has developed and circulated a modernization \nblueprint, that is only a first good step. It was the judgment of the \nsubcommittee that\n\n[[Page S7653]]\n\nthere must be more detailed information before we agree to additional \nfunds for future computer modernization.\n  The most critical problem facing IRS is a century date change \nproject. As a result, we have set aside $325 million for this effort, \nin addition to funds already appropriated in fiscal year 1997 and \nrequested for fiscal year 1998.\n\n  Mr. President, this bill is the result of long, hard hours of work on \nthe part of the members and staff of this subcommittee. I want to thank \nthem for all of their efforts. I believe we have put together a very \nworthwhile bill and hope we will have the support of the Senate.\n  I now yield to our ranking member, my good friend, Senator Kohl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  As the distinguished Senator from Colorado has just indicated, we are \nbringing to the floor recommendations on the fiscal year 1998 \nappropriations level for the Treasury, general Government agencies.\n  First, I thank Senator Campbell for his dedicated work on this bill. \nHe has worked long and hard on the difficult issues that he has just \noutlined for our colleagues. As a result of his efforts, I believe the \ncommittee has developed a balanced approach for dealing with the many \nprograms and activities under the jurisdiction of the subcommittee, \nwhile staying within the budget allocation.\n  Since this budget allocation was $489 million below the \nadministration's request, we have been required to make some \nsubstantial reductions. However, the subcommittee actions have resulted \nin a bill that is both fiscally responsible and I also believe very \nreasonable.\n  Senator Campbell has discussed the major funding highlights, and \nrather than repeating those highlights, I will limit my comments to a \nfew areas that I would like to emphasize.\n  First, the funding provided for IRS activities. Tax processing, tax \nlaw enforcement and information systems is at the President's request. \nAdditionally, $325 million has been provided for an information \ntechnology fund. While we continue to have concerns over the IRS \nmodernization efforts, we believe that it is important to provide the \nIRS with the tools necessary to collect taxes owed. By providing full \nfunding, we can be assured that the critical century date change and \ndata center consolidation occur in a timely manner and allow the IRS to \ncontinue smooth operations into the year 2000.\n  Second, the national media campaign proposed by the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy is not fully funded. I fully support, of \ncourse, the efforts to combat the drug problem in this country, and I \nsupport the efforts in leadership of Gen. Barry McCaffrey, but I am \nreluctant to provide billions of dollars for an untried and untested \nmedia program. So I supported funding at a smaller pilot program level, \nwhich would provide the administration and Congress with the evidence \nof the success that is necessary when we are committing such huge \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  However, Senator Campbell and I have come to a compromise position: \nfunding the national media program for 1 year at $110 million, after \nwhich the program will be evaluated.\n  We are also providing over $35 million for community-oriented drug \nprevention programs, such as a drug-free prison zone program and the \ninitiation of the Drug Free Communities Act grants.\n  Finally, I want to highlight that no funds are provided for the \nGeneral Services Administration's Construction and Acquisition Program. \nThe Federal buildings fund is experiencing a shortfall in revenue \nresulting from GSA miscalculating rent income and miscalculating \nconstruction completion dates. While I am concerned over the financial \nsituation generating this shortfall, I believe it provides a good \nopportunity to review the principles applied to the Courthouse \nConstruction Program. As a result, the report accompanying the bill \ncontains criteria that the General Services Administration and the \nAdministrative Office of the Courts must apply to future courthouse \nconstruction projects.\n  According to these criteria, projects included in future requests \nmust:\n  One, meet the design guide standards for construction;\n  Two, reflect the priorities of the Judicial Conference of the United \nStates;\n  Three, be included in the approved 5-year construction plan;\n  And four, must be accompanied by a standardized courtroom utilization \nstudy.\n  It is hoped that the application of these criteria will result in a \nwell-justified Courthouse Construction Program in the future.\n  Mr. President, that concludes my highlights of the bill's funding \nlevels. We believe we have provided the best funding levels possible \nunder the funding restrictions.\n  Before I yield the floor, I also want to acknowledge the fine work \ndone by the staff on this bill:\n  Pat Raymond, Tammy Perrin, Lula Edwards, Frank Larkin, and Barbara \nRetzlaff, and others. I thank them for all their hard work in helping \nto bring this bill before the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Colorado.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing individuals be granted privilege of the floor for the \nduration of the consideration of S. 1023, the Treasury and General \nGovernment Appropriations Act of 1998: Patricia Raymond, Tammy Perrin, \nLula Edwards, Barbara Retzlaff, Frank Larkin and Jay Kimmitt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 921\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Campbell] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 921.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.  .

Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Kansas, Mr. \nBrownback, for the purpose of offering a second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 922 to Amendment No. 921\n\n(Purpose: To provide that Members of Congress shall not receive a cost \n          of living adjustment in pay during fiscal year 1998)\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 922 to amendment No. 921.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the amendment, insert the \n     following new section:\n       Sec.   . Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no \n     adjustment shall be made under section 601(a) of the \n     Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946 (2 U.S.C. 31) \n     (relating to cost of living adjustments for Members of \n     Congress) during fiscal year 1998.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I have put forth this amendment in \nworking with the manager of the bill, the author of the first-degree \namendment. I believe he has agreed to it being a second-degree \namendment. And I ask for its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, to my knowledge, there is no opposition \non the majority side. We are prepared to accept this by a voice vote.\n  Mr. KOHL. Likewise.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment No. 922.\n  The amendment (No. 922) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Does the Senator have further comments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there debate now on the first-degree \namendment, as amended?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I would like to speak for 2 minutes on \nthe amendment, my amendment that was just agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I would like to say that the amendment that was just agreed to was to \neliminate the cost-of-living adjustment for the Members of Congress.\n  I think it is important that at this time when we are seeking to \nbalance the budget, we not be seen as giving ourselves a pay raise, to \nbe able to establish this as an important issue. I do not say that \nMembers are overpaid, because I do not believe they are. But I do think \nwe are moving forward to balance this budget, and we need to show \nleadership by not receiving this COLA. And that is why I put this \namendment forward. I am very appreciative that the author of the first-\ndegree amendment, the manager of the bill, has agreed to it and that it \nhas been accepted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I also ask unanimous consent to have Senator Wellstone \nand myself added as cosponsors to the Brownback amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, several Senators have said they wish to \nspeak on this issue. Senator Byrd has indicated he would like to. He is \nin a meeting and will not be here for a short period of time. But those \nSenators who would like to make comments on that, we will do that. And \nwe will take something else up if he does not get here in a reasonable \ntime.\n  I would like to point out to my colleague from Kansas that this issue \nof so-called pay raises has always interested me. As I looked up some \nof the figures, I am sure that most of my colleagues are aware that \nthey do not have to take the cost-of-living increase allowance. They \ncan turn it back to the Treasury if they do not want it. They can give \nit to charities. There are all kinds of things they can do with it.\n  But to put it in some perspective, since it seems to get an awful lot \nof discussion, particularly in election years, about Congress people \nand Senators getting an increase in salaries, I thought I would contact \nthe Congressional Research Service and find out just how much \ntaxpayers' money goes into salaries for Congressmen and Senators.\n  They tell me that one-tenth of one penny--one-tenth of one penny--is \nthe average amount a taxpayer pays to congressional salaries.\n  I know some people think we are not even worth that much, so we \nprobably did a good thing by passing this amendment on a voice vote. \nBut I would like to point out a couple of things that might put it in \nperspective.\n  For example, in Senator D'Amato's and Senator Moynihan's State, the \ngreat State of New York, the mayor of New York City earns $31,400 more \nthan they do, the Senators of that State.\n  In Dade County, FL, Senator Mack's and Senator Graham's State, the \nsuperintendent of the county gets $51,400 more than the Senators of \nthat State or the Congressmen.\n  The sheriff of Los Angeles County receives $88,400 more than anybody \nin the congressional delegation from California.\n  I guess my message to the average voter would be, if you are really \nconcerned about elected officials, you ought to look at all of them, \ntop to bottom, and not just because Congress gets so much media \nattention whenever they deal with this COLA or so-called pay raise.\n\n  Many of the other areas of the country--I do not have the numbers \nright in front of me--but if you track the increases from 1970 to 1998, \nin fact, the amount that congressional salaries have increased has been \nless than postal workers, Social Security recipients, military wages, \nprivate-sector employees, Federal employees, most civilian employees, \nand literally everybody else. But I would like to put that in context.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. We will have some discussion on this issue, I gather. \nAnd I wanted to say to my colleagues, that several days ago I sent a \nletter out to every colleague saying that I was going to have an \namendment out here opposing the cost-of-living adjustment for members \nof Congress--and you are quite right, I say to my colleague from \nColorado, this is not a pay increase. This was just a cost-of-living \nadjustment. I would like to explain a little bit about why I did this.\n  Senator Brownback has now come out with the same amendment, so we \nwill work together. And it does not matter to me who does the \namendment. What matters is the effect of it all. But I think that I may \nhave somewhat of a different framework than my colleague from Kansas, \nand so I want to spell out my reasons why I support this amendment. And \nI am not going to spend a lot of time on it.\n  First of all, when I sent this letter out, I sent it only to my \ncolleagues. I was not interested in this becoming a major public issue, \nalthough when we work this out on the floor, I suppose it is a public \nissue. The reason for addressing my colleagues is that I really think \nthat if this amendment becomes a bashing of public service--and I know\n\n[[Page S7655]]\n\nsome colleagues will interpret it that way--then it is a big mistake. \nIf that is what the net effect of this amendment is, I made a big \nmistake.\n  I think there are people here--Republicans and Democrats; Democrats \nand Republicans--who have a highly developed sense of public service. \nIf this amendment, which is likely to be accepted, contributes to an \nacross-the-board denigration of public service and all people in public \nservice, then sending this letter out to my colleagues and saying that \nI would introduce this amendment would have been a mistake. But I now \njoin in sponsoring this amendment.\n  This amendment will not make some people feel better about it. The \nreason I introduced it, and I wish to make this very clear--is because \nthis past year, in our deficit-reduction plans, as the Center on Budget \nAlternatives and Priorities points out, 93 percent of the cuts we made \nin discretionary spending affect low-income people and some of the most \nvulnerable citizens in our country.\n  In the welfare bill that we passed, $55 billion of cuts \ndisproportionately hurt legal immigrants--not illegal--many of them \nelderly, many of them living alone, many of them with a combined income \nof $525 a month--all their Federal assistance was eliminated. Only part \nof it was restored.\n  And the other major area that suffered was in food nutrition \nprograms--the vast majority of the cuts in the welfare reform bill \npassed last Congress were in the Food Stamp Program. Most of the \nbeneficiaries hurt were working poor people, many of them children.\n  So it just seems to me that if we are going to be making, in the name \nof deficit reduction, cuts in programs, and the disproportionate share \nof those cuts affect the most vulnerable people in our country, many of \nthem children, many of them poor, I just cannot see how we can give \nourselves a cost-of-living increase.\n  I do not even know what we make--I guess around $130,000 a year. I \nput high value on the work we do here. But I just want to point out \nthat a colleague asked me yesterday, after I sent this letter out, \n``Well, come on, Paul. Would there be a time where you would vote for \nthis? Isn't this just what you do every year?'' Well, I do not offer \nthis amendment every year. So I said, ``Absolutely, yes, but not in the \ncontext of what we have done as a Senate and a House.''\n\n  I am sure some people believe we have done the right things here in \nCongress. No one has a corner on political truth. Maybe people felt the \nvotes we have made, for deficit reduction and for cuts in different \nprograms, were the right thing to do and had to be done. But it does \nseem to me that it is just not right, if we are going to call on many \ncitizens to sacrifice for deficit reduction, and in particular, call on \nlow- and moderate-income families to sacrifice all in the name of \ndeficit reduction, and if we are going to make cuts in the most \neffective child nutrition safety program that we have ever had, then I \njust do not think this is a time for us to be giving ourselves a cost-\nof-living increase.\n  In some context, I can see how the argument over this cost-of-living \nincrease can be said to be about apples and oranges. I really can. But \nthe way I see it as a Senator, in the context of still calling for \npeople to make sacrifices in our country, that there ought to be shared \nsacrifice. And I think, given the fact that we all do well financially \nin Congress, that it is a mistake to go forward with the cost-of-living \nincrease. That is why I sent the letter to my colleagues 2 days ago and \nwhy I announced my intention to introduce an amendment.\n\n  Senator Brownback has now come out with an amendment. We will join \ntogether on this. The Senator can speak for himself, but I wanted to \nmake my framework clear on why I am against a cost-of-living increase.\n  If there is further debate on this, I have a more complete statement, \nbut I have stated what I believe and there is no reason to speak at any \ngreater length now.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I understand the temper of the times, but \nI think some of us who have been through this time and again have the \nduty to come forth and warn the Senate what it is doing.\n  Since 1970 to this year, 27 years, in 17 of those years the Senate \nhas denied itself the cost-of-living adjustment. The net result is that \nwhile Social Security recipients' pay, whatever you want to call it, \ntheir checks have gone up by 421.3 percent in that period, the pay for \nMembers of Congress have gone up 214.4 percent.\n  I will mention a lot of statistics here, Mr. President, so I ask \nunanimous consent the two documents I have, one entitled ``Increases, \n1970-1997,'' and the other, ``Percent Changes 1970-97,'' be printed in \nthe Record after my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the last time congressional salaries were \ngiven a cost-of-living adjustment--and this is not a pay raise--was in \n1993. The pay raise for Federal employees that year was 3.7 percent, \nthe COLA's for Congress were 3.2 percent. In 1992, the cost-of-living \nadjustment for Federal employees was 4.2 percent, and for Members of \nCongress it was 3.5 percent.\n  We are now in a situation where, in my judgment, if we don't take \nthis cost-of-living adjustment for this year, I am sure we will not \ntake it next year being an election year. That means we will not take \nit until 1999. Since that is the year before a Presidential election \nyear, we will not take it then either. We will not take it in the year \n2000, which is a Presidential election year. I suggest we are going \ninto the next century with this maladjustment, as far as congressional \nsalaries.\n  It does not make any difference to me. It does not make any \ndifference to any of us. We are here. We made our commitment. What \nabout those out there who should come and serve their country by being \npart of the legislative branch of this Federal Government? We have \nraised the salaries of the people who are Federal civilians downtown. \nWe have raised the salaries of the Federal employees. We have raised \nthe payments made to Federal retirees. We have raised Social Security \nrecipients. We have not raised for Members of Congress, and I predict \nwe will not do it unless we face up to the problem now.\n  The problem is not ours. The problem is what is going to be the \njudgment of the people who want to serve in the Congress when they \nstart looking at the income levels here in Congress compared to their \nown income levels.\n  Now, Mr. President, in 1970--and I was here then--my wife and I had \njust bought a home here in Washington the year before for $65,000. At \nthe time, our pay was $42,500. That house has now sold--we sold it some \ntime ago--but I know that it sold for $450,000. Our pay here is \nroughly--not quite, but roughly--three times the salary we had then.\n  What I am trying to make people in the Senate think about is, what \nwill be the decision made by young people who are thinking about coming \nhere when they look at the cost of living in Washington, DC, which is \nthe highest now in our Nation--the cost of property here, the cost of \nrenting a home or a condominium. I am talking about family people. When \nwe came down here, we came down here with five children and had to have \na home that five children could live in. There is no way a person can \ncome here now at the salary level we have now and buy a home for that, \nwhere five children can live with their mother and father, unless they \nare extremely wealthy.\n  What the Senate is doing, in my judgment, is setting the course to \nassure that the people serving in this body will either be \nmultimillionaires or they will be the people who are not capable of \nearning over $100,000 anyway. Now, maybe I am being too tough about \nthis, but I think it is time to get tough about this issue and have \npeople understand that the cost-of-living adjustment is less than the \nConsumer Price Index increase--less. In other words, it means for \npeople living here now, we are adjusting their salaries now with a \ncost-of-living adjustment, for the cost increase, really, for the \nperiod starting 18 months ago until 6 months ago, and we are trying to \nadjust it now for what the costs were back then. It is not a salary \nincrease. This is for the cost of living in this area.\n\n[[Page S7656]]\n\n  Now, people talk to me, well, you can live in Minnesota or maybe you \ncan live in Kansas, maybe you can live somewhere else for a lot less \nmoney. It happens to be, in my case, my cost of living in Alaska is \njust slightly higher than this. But as a practical matter, the \njudgments made by future generations will be: We, as a family member, \ncannot take that job.\n  Now, we get a lot of demagogic type of letters--they come in from my \nconstituents, too--``You are not worth that money; why don't you come \nhome?'' The real question is, what would they do if the people were \nhere that they believe should be here? The people would either work for \nnothing, because they are so rich they can, or the people that could \nnot make the money that they would make here would come for the pay. \nNow, Mr. President, we have to make up our mind what kind of a body we \nwant in the Congress. From my point of view, we want people with \ncapabilities who can perform jobs that are needed to be performed.\n  Take my colleague from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, the only accountant in \nthis body--the only accountant in the Senate. What are we dealing with \nnow? Massive, complex tax issues, complex problems of accounting. The \npeople that are going to come here are going to be motivated by trying \nto do a job. The ones who cannot come here, despite that motivation, \nwill be the ones who cannot afford to live a family life in this town \nat that salary.\n  Keep in mind something else. We don't come here permanently. As a \nmatter of fact, most people who would vote for this do not want us to \ncome for more than two terms anyway. But as a practical matter, we all \nmaintain a home in our home States. We have expenses there and we have \nexpenses here. There is no one in the employment scene today that has \nthat situation other than Members of Congress.\n\n  Now, I voted--it was a voice vote--but I voted against it and I would \nvote against it on a recorded vote because we were taking an action to \ndeny Members of Congress, for the fifth time, a cost of living, which \nis a structural change. What it will mean is, downstream someone will \nhave to have the courage to make the adjustment. Incidentally, we have \nhad three times when that happened. In 1977, the Congress made a 28.9-\npercent change. That was a salary increase, but it was to make up for \nthe fact that in 6 of the previous 7 years Congress had not taken the \ncost-of-living adjustment. Again, in 1982, we took a 15-percent change. \nIt was because in 3 of the previous 4 years Congress had not taken a \ncost-of-living adjustment. In 1987, we again took a change. It was \nbecause, again, we had in 2 of the previous 4 years not taken the cost-\nof-living adjustment. Again, in 1991, we had a 27.1-percent increase.\n  What I am saying is, you kid yourself as much as you want, the time \nwill come when Congress will have to recognize that this structural \nchange in the salary, vis-a-vis the salaries of comparable jobs in the \neconomy, that the salary increase must come. So instead of recognizing \nthis as a cost-of-living adjustment and treating it as such and \nproviding that we take a minimum amount--and by the way, in most \ninstances we have taken less than was available. For instance, in 1979, \nthe Federal employees got a 7-percent increase, Federal retirees got \n11.1, Congress gave itself 5.5. We kept the cost of living down each \ntime. But when we did it, we did not have the total structural impact \nof denying it altogether.\n  Now, the structural situation will be, if I am right, that we will \nnot have a cost-of-living increase next year or the next 2 years. We \nwill go into the 21st century with a salary level of 1993. In that \nyear, again, we had a 3.2-percent COLA and Federal employees had 3.7 \npercent. If you look at my charts that are included in the Record, \nusing the CPI in this period of 27 years, which has been 315.7 percent, \nwe have taken a 214.4-percent total cost-of-living change. Social \nSecurity recipients had 421.3 percent; postal workers, 370 percent; the \nmilitary, 360 percent; Federal retirees, 328 percent; private-sector \nemployees, 265 percent; Federal civilians, 334 percent. We are at least \n100 percent structurally below the comparable salary base in this 27-\nyear phase.\n  What does that say to young people about serving in the Congress? \nEven if it is on a two-term basis limit, to be here for 12 years and \ntake a structural level of 15 years to start with and serve with people \nwho will not take the cost-of-living adjustment while you are here \nanyway, I think this is destroying the system that we have today of \ncitizens who commit themselves to be part of a great democracy. We have \nnot done this to the people who work downtown for the President. \nPresidential salaries have changed and so have the salaries of the \nexecutives on a Presidential appointment level.\n  We have, by the way, impacted the Judiciary, and I think that is \nsomething other people will talk about and I will talk about later, \ntoo, because the Federal Judiciary, while it does have a better system \nin the sense there is no contribution for a Federal judge for his or \nher retirement, as we contribute, it is lifetime pay. When they retire, \nthey get the full amount of their salary, not a percent as we do based \non the number of years we have been here. But as a practical matter, \nwith the three branches of Government, the only part, through self-\nflagellation, that destroys the future of the body is the Congress \nitself. It is a great mistake. It is a great mistake. I think we all \nmake sacrifices to come to this job, anyway.\n  I can tell the Senate that when I came to the Senate, I was making \nmore than three times my salary as a private lawyer in Alaska. Many \npeople come here and take a reduction in income. There are others who \ncome here and it makes no difference, because of either their great \nwealth or their inability to earn the same amount of money before they \ngot here. Many people take a sizable decrease in income to come here. \nBut what we are telling the younger people now--and we are trying to \nattract younger people. When I came here, the average age was almost \n70; today, I think it is down to almost 50. We are still trying to \nattract younger people. This is a dynamic society and we should do \nthat. But can you do that, Mr. President? Can you look a young man or \nwoman in the eye and say: You can move to Washington, you can afford to \nlive there and serve for 2 years in the House or 6 years in the Senate, \nor maybe two terms. You can keep your family there, and you can keep \nyour house at home, and you can be able to return to your life when you \nfinish the service, without having lost your future as far as your \ncareer is concerned.\n  This is not right. It is not right. I have made this speech before \nand it doesn't seem to make any difference to anybody. But I am \ncompelled to do it again because I have served here longer than any \nMember of our side of the aisle on the committee that has jurisdiction \non this subject. I cannot believe we would continue to make this error. \nI believe that Members have left this body--and there are some leaving \nit now --not because they have served too long, or they don't like the \njob, or they haven't done a good enough job, but they cannot plan for \ntheir future. At one time, I had five children in college. At that \ntime, thank God, there were jobs they could get during the summer, and \nwe were able to help them and they all got through. But, today, a \nSenator with five children, with the cost of housing, and five going to \ncollege, why, that person would have to vote from the poor house, Mr. \nPresident.\n  This job ought to pay what it is worth to society. This is the job of \nthe continuity of the American system. We serve for 6 years. We \nvolunteer for that job and we are the institutional memory of the \nAmerican democracy. I am alarmed that there are not enough people on \nthis floor that realize that. I am truly alarmed at the number of \npeople that, for political reasons, or other reasons, or campaign \npromises, would harm the future of the Senate, would harm the democracy \nby telling the American people that you will either turn the Senate \nover to the very, very wealthy or those who could not earn as much \nanywhere else.\n  Now, the time will come when we will face up to this. It will \nprobably be in 2001. As I add it up, roughly, the percentage of pay \nincrease then to recover the structural balance will be in the vicinity \nof 35 percent. How many people are going to want to do that in their \nfirst term? How many people are going to want to do that, who are just \nup for election? I have just mentioned two-thirds of the body then.\n  So I say the demise of the American democracy is here. That is why \nthe\n\n[[Page S7657]]\n\nConstitutional Convention argued about who should determine what \nMembers are paid. They were talking about citizen legislators then, not \npeople who came here and stayed 7, 8 months a year. They are talking \nabout people who could go home, people who lived within the original 13 \nStates. My home is closer to Beijing than it is to Washington, DC, and \nthis is a 50-State Union now. My colleague from Hawaii lives almost as \nfar away. If anyone wants to look at costs, they ought to look at the \ncost of representing those two States. But the main thing is, we think \nabout the structural salary level for the future. I am not going to be \naround here that long--maybe longer than some people think. But, Mr. \nPresident, we will witness the decline in the value of the Congress and \nthe American society if we don't have the guts to stand up to the \ndemagogs and tell them that pay for the Congress ought to be sufficient \nto attract the most capable people in our society. The capability is \nwhat counts.\n  I am disturbed that, once again, we will deny the economic cycle that \ncauses an adjustment being necessary, and we will say, as soon as we \nbalance the budget in 2002, if I am hearing right, it may be 2003 \nbefore it is changed. That would be 10 years. How many people will \ndecide not to come because of that, Mr. President? How many brilliant \nminds will be denied the American Congress because of that? I think it \nis wrong.\n  I am going to speak at length when the time comes, and I am going to \nshow what has happened to other countries when they followed and \npursued this course and how they have deteriorated. The deterioration \nof America is something that we should worry about in terms of \ndemocracy. My predecessors used to go take the train across the country \nand then take a steamship up to Seward in our State and a railroad up \nto Fairbanks and go home once a year. I go home 15 to 30 or 35 times a \nyear. It is a different society.\n  I am telling the Senate, unless we are willing to recognize this \ndifferent society and the dynamic society that needs people who are \nfamily people, who must make sacrifices to start with, but should not \nhave to make this kind of sacrifice, to accept a structurally \nimbalanced salary caused by the inability of each successive Congress \nto face up to reality.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                               INCREASES, 1970-97                                               \n

                \n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, as I said earlier, I sent a letter out \nto my colleagues a couple of days ago and now this amendment has been \nintroduced. I spoke earlier about it, and I will again. I want to \nrespond to some comments--if the word ``demagog'' is going to be used, \nI want to respond.\n  I said earlier that if the net effect of this amendment is to \nencourage the denigration of public service and people in public \nservice, then I am mistaken in offering this amendment--the Wellstone-\nBrownback amendment. Several days ago, I felt that I needed to get \nstarted on this and announced I would do it when this bill came to the \nfloor. I then went on to say that in the context of what we have been \ndoing here in the Congress, and the sacrifices that we have asked of \nall Americans, especially low- and moderate-income people that I \nbelieve it is wrong for the Members of Congress to receive a cost-of-\nliving increase. We have made a lot of cuts in programs. Again, in the \n104th Congress, more than 90 percent of the budget reductions in \nentitlement programs came from programs affecting low-income people. If \nwe are going to argue that that has to be a part of the sacrifice, I \ndon't see how we can then go forward with a cost-of-living increase. We \nwill still be making more than $133,000 next year without the increase.\n  But, Mr. President, my colleague from Alaska has come to the floor \nand has made several arguments that I have to address. First of all, \nMr. President, my colleague suggests that if young people know they can \nonly make $133,000 a year, why would they want to serve in the Senate \nor House? He goes on to suggest that the only people are going to come \nhere are either millionaires or people who could not make $100,000 a \nyear.\n  I was a teacher. I didn't make anywhere near $100,000. By my \ncolleague's standard, 95 percent of the people of the United States of \nAmerica are the people who can't make $100,000 a year, because they \nclearly don't. Let's not assume that because someone was a teacher or a \nwage earner, and didn't make $100,000 a year, that somehow they don't \nhave that much value. What in the world does that comment mean? You \nknow, with all due respect, I think most people in the country would \nthink $133,000 a year is a darn good salary, because 95 percent of the \npeople in this country don't even make $100,000 a year. Maybe we just \nneed to get a little bit more real about this for a moment.\n  I didn't want to get into this argument, but if that's the kind of \nargument that is going to be made, I would like to make it clear that, \nhaving been one of those individuals that falls into my colleague's \ncategory of not being able to make $100,000 a year, I think that this \nis an argument that is way out of whack with reality.\n  I doubt whether, if you took a poll, most of the people in the \ncountry would believe that a salary of $133,000 a year is a \ndisincentive for somebody wanting to take this job. I don't believe \nthat. I don't believe that most young people in this country would not \nrun for the U.S. Senate because they are only going to be able to make \n$133,000 a year. I don't believe that for a moment. When some of my \ncolleagues say that this would be a reduction in salary, the vast \nmajority of the people in the country would not view it that way. That \nargument just doesn't make sense to me. As I said, I didn't want to get \ninto these arguments, but if the word ``demagog'' is going to be used, \nthen I do want to respond.\n  Second of all, Mr. President, if we are going to start talking about \nthe financial pressures that we as Senators feel\n\n[[Page S7658]]\n\nwith our income, for those of us who aren't independently wealthy, and \ntalking about our need for two homes or to send children to college, \nthat's a valid point. A lot of people feel that pressure. The median \nincome in our country is around $36,000 a year. There are a lot of \npeople with two or three children. There are a lot of people trying to \nfigure out how to afford to send their kids to college. There are a lot \nof people who are trying to get affordable child care or to figure out \nhow to buy a home or pay rent. And by the way, when we talk about \ntrying to pay rent, I note that we have also been cutting low-income \nhousing assistance. So when I hear this argument that the only people \nthat are going to come here are millionaires or people who can't make \n$100,000 a year, there is an implication that these aren't the people \nyou want to have come here. I think it would be good if we have lots of \nthose people here. I sure didn't feel like I was not of value to this \nbody because I didn't make anywhere close to $100,000 a year before I \ncame here.\n\n  When I hear the argument made that people would not want to serve, \nthat young people would not want to serve, and people don't want to run \nfor office because they would only be able to make $133,000 a year \nwithout this cost-of-living increase, I frankly think it is not a \ncredible argument. I think 99.999 percent of the people in the country \nthink they could get along on our salaries. The third point, Mr. \nPresident, that I want to make is that if we are going to talk about \nthe squeeze that we feel at $133,000 a year, then how come in some of \nthe decisions that we have made about sacrifice, cuts in health care \nprograms, nutrition programs, housing programs--which basically affect \nand end up lessening opportunities for low- and moderate-income \nfamilies--how come we then don't have the same concern for those \nfamilies?\n  If we are worried about how, on $133,000 a year, we can send our kids \nto college or afford housing, why aren't we as worried about middle-\nincome and working families? I think this is a slippery-slope argument. \nWe had better get to work thinking about the couple who work, in their \nearly thirties and who make, combined, $35,000 a year. We had better \nstart thinking about them because if all of a sudden we are going to be \ntalking about how we just can't make it on $133,000 a year, then surely \nwe must understand how people--middle-income and working families with \nincomes of $35,000 to $38,000 a year--feel a terrible squeeze. It is \njust an inconsistent argument for us to make.\n  Mr. President, if I am wrong about why we should not have a cost-of-\nliving increase, I have made a big mistake and apologize. But if not \nhaving a cost-of-living increase this year and staying at $133,000 is \nthe reason why people are not going to run for office, which my \ncolleague from Alaska thinks is the case, he is right, and I am wrong. \nBut I don't think that is the major reason why people aren't running.\n  I think that one of the major reasons people are not running for \noffice is it costs so much money to run for office. If we really want \nmore women and men from all sorts of different social and economic \nbackgrounds to run for office in our country, it doesn't have much to \ndo with whether or not we make $133,000 or $134,000 a year. Most people \nthink that is a fine salary. It has much more to do with the fact that \npeople know that they have to raise millions and millions of dollars. \nEither they themselves are millionaires and they have the money--and we \nhave some people in this Senate who are independently wealthy, who are \nsome of the best Senators. That is a fact. I don't think that is the \nissue. The issue is all of this money that people have to raise.\n  Give me a break. Don't tell me that the reason people do not run for \noffice and young people aren't interested in public life is because \nthey are now finding out they are only going to make $133,000 a year. I \nthink that is ridiculous.\n  I think the reason many people don't run for office is twofold: \nFirst, it costs so much money. It is obscene, and a lot of people do \nnot have the stomach for it. They don't want to do it. And I don't \nblame them. I think they wonder how we have the stomach for it. I think \nthey think that maybe we are a little off. Or second, and just as \nimportant--and I could sure draw from some examples, but I will not \nbecause I might be violating Senate etiquette if I do--is why in the \nworld when we have this search-and-destroy, slash-and-burn politics, \nwhere people do anything to win--that anybody wonders why people do not \nwant to run for office? Does anybody here, Democrat or Republican \nalike, really believe that the reason younger people, and not such \nyoung people, do not run for office is because they can only make \n$133,000 a year? Don't you think it might have something to do with our \nfailure to clean up this mess, to come together and pass some kind of \ngood campaign finance reform bill? And don't you think it has a lot to \ndo, Republicans and Democrats alike, with the way in which we have let \nall of these handlers move in and run our campaigns, putting attack ads \non television which try to destroy candidates? Don't you think this is \nwhat makes most people in the country just a little bit skeptical about \nwhether or not they would want to run for office and serve? I would \njust suggest to my colleagues that this situation is far more the issue \nthan a cost-of-living increase.\n  Finally, I will just go back to the first point I made today. I was \njust responding to what was said by my friend from Alaska--and to the \nconcern about demagoguery on this issue. I admire people who come out \nhere and say, ``I disagree.'' I am quite often on the side of something \nthat is not popular. But I do believe that the arguments so far that \nhave been given in opposition to this amendment don't make any sense. \nThey really do not make any sense.\n  I believe that it is important that people be able to make a decent \nincome. We should vote, at the right time, for a cost-of-living \nincrease, and not try to do this through the back door. People believe \nthis is the right way to do an increase. But I don't see how we can do \nit in the context of the decisions that we have made and the sacrifice \nthat we have called for from the people in this country that have been \nmost affected by the decisions. I don't see how, if we are going to \nmake the argument that people feel an economic squeeze at $133,000 a \nyear, while most of the cuts we make in discretionary programs hurt \nlow- and moderate-income families and their children in the name of \nsacrifice and in the name of deficit reduction, that this is the right \ntime for us to go forward with a cost-of-living increase.\n\n  That is the purpose of what I called the Wellstone-Brownback \namendment, or whatever we wish to call it--it's name doesn't matter.\n  Obviously, this amendment is going to be accepted. Is my \nunderstanding correct that this amendment is going to be accepted?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will just say before I yield the floor that I \nthought it would be done in a short period of time. Are other \ncolleagues going to come out and speak--I understand they are. Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Senator Byrd has said he wishes to speak on it. He is \nin a meeting now, however.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will yield the floor for now. If \nother colleagues are going to speak, I will want to come back--I think \nthey may want to take part in this discussion--only because I want to \nbe clear why I am doing this and why I think it is the right thing for \nCongress. Other people may have very different arguments to make, and \nif anyone else is going to use the word ``demagogue'' then I am \ncertainly going to come back out here to debate on this amendment.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Wellstone, \nfor his comments.\n  Just to clarify where we are, the Brownback-Wellstone-Campbell \namendment has been accepted by a voice vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent, if there are no further comments right now, \nthat the pending amendment be set aside to offer two technical \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 3 days ago, the heavens opened over \nnorthern Vermont. Torrential rains sent floodwaters ripping through \ncommunities and over farmland, tearing bridges from their foundations, \nshredding roads and stranding hundreds of people. The floods that swept \nthrough sections of northern Vermont were the worst in over 70 years. \nUp to 6 inches of rain fell overnight. Flash floods turned quiet rivers \nand streams into raging waterways in the early morning darkness, \ndisrupting the peaceful existence of thousands of Vermonters.\n  Yesterday, I spoke with several town officials and residents who were \nhit the hardest. They gave me firsthand accounts of the damage to their \ncommunities. In some towns, bridges were swept away, roads were washed \nout, pavements were ripped up, cars and trucks were overturned, perhaps \nwere destroyed, trees were uprooted, homes were lifted from their \nfoundations and filled with water.\n  Monday night's torrential rains were followed by a day of heroism--\nneighbors, rescue workers, families and friends came together in \nVermont's close communities. In Eden, 300 Cub Scouts were evacuated \nafter the bridge into their camp was washed away. In Cambridge, rescue \nworkers saved a 14-year-old girl and her dog who were stranded on a \nwashed out roadway. In Montgomery, 11 people were pulled from a mobile \nhome roof and carried to safety in a bucket loader moments before the \ntrailer was swept away. Volunteers made 1,000 sandwiches for rescue \nworkers, and neighbors opened their homes to those who were driven from \ntheir own.\n  There are many courageous stories and events that took place during \nthe crisis, and knowing Vermonters like I do, I know there were many \nmore heroic stories long after the rivers had receded and the officials \nhad left town.\n  Mr. President, I am proud of and commend the Vermonters who united \nduring this time of disaster to save lives and communities. The damage \nhas been substantial and much work still needs to be done. I stand \nready in every way to assist, if possible, the people of Vermont to \nhelp rebuild their communities and lives. I know our Governor has \nsurveyed the situation and he has made recommendations to the President \nfor Federal help. I know the congressional delegation from Vermont is \ndoing all it can to make sure the lives that have been disrupted are \nput back as close to normal as possible as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for this time. I yield the floor and make \na point of order that a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson]. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I recognize and appreciate the hard work \nof the Appropriations Committee staff in putting together this detailed \nlegislation. Members' attention to detail is easily apparent in the \nthoroughness with which they have presented the committee's \nrecommendations.\n  There are many good provisions in this bill, particularly the \nlanguage which would continue the limitations on courthouse \nconstruction that are designed to ensure lower costs and standard \ndesigns. However, there are many aspects of this bill which cause me \nserious concern.\n  First, this bill increases the funding for these agencies by $1.1 \nbillion over last year's level. Frankly, I believe it is ill-advised \nfor the Senate to increase spending for these Federal agencies at a \ntime when we are struggling to reach agreement on tax relief and \nspending bills and balancing the budget.\n  I am sorry to say that this bill and report contain numerous earmarks \nof new funds for particular States, as well as language designed to \nensure the continued flow of Federal funds into certain States.\n  Let me just mention a few of those projects.\n  The earmark of an additional $3 million for Rocky Mountain High \nIntensity Drug Trafficking Assessment Center.\n  The earmark of $2.5 million for Globe Trade and Research Program at \nthe Montana World Trade Center, which is described in the report as a \none-time appropriation to support the center's research and information \ndissemination activities on ``issues designed to explore, define, and \nmeasure contributions to economic globalization.''\n  Mr. President, let me run that by you again. That is $2.5 million--\n2.5 million taxpayer dollars--to support the Montana World Trade \nCenter's research and information dissemination activities on issues \ndesigned to explore, define, and measure contributions to economic \nglobalization.\n  A prohibition on IRS field support reorganization in Aberdeen, SD, \nuntil the IRS toll-free help line reaches an 80 percent service level.\n  A prohibition on reducing the number of IRS criminal investigators in \nWisconsin below the 1996 level.\n  A requirement to establish the port of Kodiak, AK, as a port of entry \nand requiring U.S. Customs Service personnel in Anchorage to serve the \nKodiak port of entry.\n  The earmark of $4 million for repairs and restoration of the Truman \nLibrary in Independence, MO, and $3 million earmarked for repairs to \nthe Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library in Austin, TX, and, very \ndisturbing, various protectionist Buy-America provisions, which are in \nsections 509, 510 and 511.\n\n[[Page S7660]]\n\n  In the report language, Mr. President, there is $750,000 earmarked \nfor additional part-time and temporary positions in the Honolulu, HI, \nCustoms District.\n  There is language stating that the committee expects Customs to work \nwith other agencies to successfully implement a dedicated commuter lane \nat the Stanton Street Bridge in El Paso, TX.\n  There is language directing the Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy to conduct pilot programs in Colorado and Wisconsin--Colorado \nand Wisconsin--to control methamphetamine trafficking.\n  I note with interest that that directs the National Drug Control \nPolicy to conduct those programs in Colorado and Wisconsin. It might be \nof some interest that it is a huge problem in the State of Arizona, \nlarger than it is certainly in Wisconsin and I believe larger than \nColorado. That is the view of the experts.\n  There is language recommending that the National Archives consider \nproviding $50,000 to their Alaska Region to prepare an interpretive \nexhibition on their Alaska Gold Rush collections for the 1998 \ncentennial celebration and a similar recommendation that the National \nHistorical Publications and Records Commission consider a grant of \n$100,000 for the Alaska Gold Rush Centennial projects.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire list of \nearmarks and protective language be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Objectionable Provisions in S. 1023 fiscal year 1998 Treasury/Postal \n                          Appropriations Bill\n\n       Overall funding is $1.1 billion higher than last year's \n     levels.\n\n\n                             bill language\n\n       Earmark of additional $3 million for Rocky Mountain High \n     Intensity Drug Trafficking Assessment Center.\n       Earmark of $2.5 million for Globe Trade and Research \n     Program at the Montana World Trade Center, which is described \n     in the report as a one-time appropriation to support the \n     center's research and information dissemination activities on \n     ``issues designed to explore, define, and measure \n     contributions to economic globalization.''\n       Prohibition on IRS field support reorganization in \n     Aberdeen, South Dakota, until the IRS toll-free help line \n     reaches an 80 percent service level.\n       Prohibition on reducing the number of IRS criminal \n     investigators in Wisconsin below the 1996 level.\n       Requirement to establish the port of Kodiak, Alaska, as a \n     port of entry and requiring U.S. Customs Service personnel in \n     Anchorage to serve the Kodiak port of entry.\n       Earmark of $4 million for repairs and restoration of Truman \n     Library in Independence, Missouri, and $3 million earmarked \n     for repairs to Lyndon Baines Johnson Presidential Library in \n     Austin, Texas.\n       Various protectionist ``Buy America'' provisions (Sections \n     509, 510, and 511).\n\n\n                            report language\n\n       Earmark of $4 million to allow Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \n     and Firearms to comply with requests from states and local \n     law enforcement entities for technology under the CEASEFIRE/\n     IBIS program;

Mr. President, in just a few bills we have now managed to \nput in 5 billion dollars worth of earmarks and add-ons to the five \nappropriations bills that have come before the Senate. We have eight \nmore appropriations still to be considered.\n  The $5 billion is quite a bit of money, even here in Washington. And \nI urge my colleagues to recognize that the American people do not \napprove of these practices. Every time I ask any of them about it, they \nresoundingly reject these practices.\n  I hope we can stop them. I do not know if we will or not, but I \nreally am concerned about the continued practice of earmarking funds \nwithout any meritorious screening, without any requirements or any \nauthorization process in many cases.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions).

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call.\n\n[[Page S7661]]\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues time is running \non. We have been here over 3 hours. We have about three or four \namendments filed. Senators have not come to the floor to offer them. On \nbehalf of Senator Kohl and myself, I urge Members to come down to the \nfloor with their amendments so we can finish this bill. If we do not \nwant to be here in the middle of the night working on this, we ought to \nmove ahead.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 927\n\n (Purpose: To allow postal patrons to contribute to funding for breast \n  cancer research through the voluntary purchase of certain specially \n                  issued United States Postage stamps)\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Feinstein], for herself, \n     Mr. Conrad, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. \n     Feingold, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Mack, Mr. Reid, Mr. \n     Thurmond, and Mr. Torricelli, proposes an amendment numbered \n     927.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . (a) Special Postage Stamps.--In order to afford \n     the public a convenient way to contribute to funding for \n     breast-cancer research, the United States Postal Service \n     shall establish a special rate of postage for first-class \n     mail under this section.\n       (b) Higher Rate.--The rate of postage established under \n     this section--\n       (1) shall be 1 cent higher than the rate that would \n     otherwise apply;\n       (2) may be established without regard to any procedures \n     under chapter 36 of title 39, United States Code, and \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law; and\n       (3) shall be offered as an alternative to the rate that \n     would otherwise apply.\n\n     The use of the rate of postage established under this section \n     shall be voluntary on the part of postal patrons.\n       (c) Use of Funds.--\n       (1) In General.--\n       (A) Payments.--The amounts attributable to the 1-cent \n     differential established under this section shall be paid by \n     the United States Postal Service to the Department of Health \n     and Human Services.\n       (B) Use.--Amounts paid under subparagraph (A) shall be used \n     for breast-cancer research and related activities to carry \n     out the purposes of this section.\n       (C) Frequency of payments.--Payments under subparagraph (A) \n     shall be paid to the Department of Health and Human Services \n     no less than twice in each calendar year.\n       (2) Amounts attributable to the 1-cent differential.--For \n     purposes of this subsection, the term ``amounts attributable \n     to the 1-cent differential established under this section'' \n     means, as determined by the United States Postal Service \n     under regulations that it shall prescribe--\n       (A) the total amount of revenues received by the United \n     States Postal Service that it would not have received but for \n     the enactment of this section, reduced by\n       (B) an amount sufficient to cover reasonable administrative \n     and other costs of the United States Postal Service \n     attributable to carrying out this section.\n       (d) Special Postage Stamps.--The United States Postal \n     Service may provide for the design and sale of special \n     postage stamps to carry out this section.\n       (e) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) nothing in this section should directly or indirectly \n     cause a net decrease in total funds received by the \n     Department of Health and Human Services or any other agency \n     or instrumentality of the Government (or any component or \n     other aspect thereof) below the level that would otherwise \n     have been anticipated absent this section; and\n       (2) nothing in this section should affect regular first-\n     class rates or any other regular rate of postage.\n       (f) Annual Reports.--The Postmaster General shall include \n     in each annual report rendered under section 2402 of title \n     39, United States Code, information concerning the operation \n     of this section.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield to the Senator \nfrom Colorado for a unanimous-consent request, and I would appreciate \nregaining the floor.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be 1 \nhour of debate regarding the Feinstein amendment regarding breast \ncancer stamps, equally divided in the usual fashion, without any \nsecond-degree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado. I'm \ndelighted to see the Senator from New York on the floor. I am hopeful \nthat Senator Faircloth will join us here, since the Senator moved this \nas an amendment to the appropriations bill in committee. I very much \nappreciate that and have enjoyed working with him on this matter.\n  Mr. President, I want to talk for a moment about breast cancer. I \nthink every Member of this body was aware that we unanimously passed a \nsense-of-the-Senate not too long ago urging that more money be devoted \nto research for cancer. Also, in the women's community, and, really, I \nthink still the majority population of this country, there is rising \nand enormous concern about breast cancer.\n  The amendment I am making today on behalf of myself and a number of \nothers. I want to mention that just before the recess, in this very \nChamber, 51 Senators said they would cosponsor the breast cancer \nresearch stamp bill (S. 726) which creates a breast cancer research \nstamp with 1 cent above the rate of first-class postage. Members \nthought it was a good idea. Well, I need to move this because I very \nmuch fear it will not happen if I don't take the opportunity that we \nhave today to bring this matter forward.\n  Let me begin by saying that this is a wellspring from the breast \ncancer community. This measure is supported by the American Cancer \nSociety, the American Medical Association, the American Hospital \nAssociation, Association of Operating Room Nurses, California Health \nCollaborative, the YWCA, and I could go on and on.\n  Representative Fazio in the House has introduced the same legislation \nwith 100 cosponsors in January of this year. It is my understanding \nthat Representative Molinari talked to the Speaker and is putting it on \na calendar which will move it rapidly in the House.\n  The idea for this legislation came from a physician in Sacramento, \nCA, an oncologist; and Representative Fazio brought it to the attention \nof the House as the original sponsor. This oncologist has treated some \n1,000 women for breast cancer. And he, like physicians all over this \ncountry in the health community, has seen a really startling rise in \nbreast cancer. In the 1950's, 1 in 20 women developed breast cancer. \nToday, the incidence is one in eight, and growing. It kills 46,000 \nwomen a year. Every 12 minutes an American woman dies of breast cancer. \nIt is the leading cause of cancer death for women between the ages of \n35 and 52, and it is the second leading cause of death in all women.\n  So, today, 1.8 million women in America are diagnosed with breast \ncancer, and 1 million women, in addition to that, don't know they have \nbreast cancer. This year, 184,300 new breast cancer cases will be \ndiagnosed, and 17,100 of those in California.\n  One of the interesting things is that the breast cancer rates differ \nthroughout the United States. The San Francisco Bay Area has one of the \nhighest breast cancer rates in the world. Rates in the Northeastern \nUnited States are substantially higher than in the South. Some believe \nin the medical community that environmental factors may contribute as \nmuch as 90 percent to breast cancer. The rates vary among countries. \nWomen in Japan have about five times less breast cancer than women in \nthe United States. And when people migrate they tend to acquire the \ncancer rates closer to those of the newly adopted countries within a \ngeneration. So within a generation, we find that reduced tendency for \ncancer increases.\n\n[[Page S7662]]\n\n  We have invested as a country, about $2 million in breast cancer \nresearch. The funding has quadrupled since 1990. There is still no \ncure. The national commitment to cancer research has been stagnant \nsince 1980. Today, NIH can fund only 23 percent of their applications. \nThe NIH budget is less than 1 percent of the Federal budget. And I \nbelieve the latest polls show that 80 percent of the people of this \ncountry believe that cancer research and medical research is an \nappropriate cause of action for the Federal Government.\n  The National Cancer Institute in 1996 could fund 26 percent of their \napplications. That is a drop from 32 percent in 1992.\n  So the idea came from Sacramento, from the oncologist who treated \n1,000 women with breast cancer. What if we had a unique trial project, \nan optional stamp of 1 cent above whatever the first class rate was, \nwhere breast cancer groups and women all across this Nation who care \nhave the option to buy that stamp, and 1 cent would go for breast \ncancer research? The administration costs incurred by the post office \nwould be absorbed by that additional 1 cent.\n  I have had an occasion to discuss this with the Postmaster General. \nHe is not in favor of it. He is not in favor of it because it has not \nbeen done before. And it has not been done because there are those that \nsay, ``If we do it for this, why don't we do it for that? If we do it \nfor women, we should to it for men.''\n  Well, we are in an era of diminishing resources. We all know that. \nEverybody has looked at cuts. This is not a cut. This is a unique \nthing. It is a trial project. If it works, we learn something from it. \nIf it doesn't work, no money is lost from the Federal Treasury, or from \nthe post office.\n  One of the things I believe every Member of this body has seen, \nwhether it is in ``The Race for the Cure'' or the women that come into \nour offices, is a very unusual resilience in the breast cancer survivor \ncommunity. They are climbing mountains, they are showing they can \nsurvive. They have banded together in support groups. It is a \nwonderfully unusual thing. They would like this to be done. They are in \nthese Halls lobbying for it. They are in my office. I know they are in \nSenator Faircloth's office, and they have been in other offices saying, \n``Give us a chance. We will use this as fundraisers. We will go out and \nbuy first-class stamps for a cent above the rate. We will sell them to \nour members. We will get our members to do this.''\n  I think it is a worthy trial. It is a worthy project. Whether it \nworks, I don't know. They tell me that if 10 percent of the first-class \nstamps were bought through this option it would produce $60 million. I \ndon't know whether it will or not. I know that there is an enthused, \nenergized community out there. You may see them wearing one design for \na breast cancer stamp on their lapels, walking around the Capitol. I \nknow that they care and care very deeply.\n  When I first introduced the bill earlier this year, I had some \nsponsors on the bill. They came to me, and said, ``You know, you \nhaven't been working very hard. You only have 6 or 7 co-sponsors.'' So \nbecause we were on the floor for 3 hours before the Fourth of July \nbreak, I went around to each member, and 51 Senators said, ``Yes.'' \nThey would vote for it. ``Put my name down.'' And I did. They are on \nthis piece of paper in front of me.\n\n  This is an opportunity to cast that vote. This is an opportunity to \ntry something new.\n  People will come before us and say, ``Oh, my goodness. If we do this \nfor breast cancer, we should do it for prostate cancer.'' Well, maybe \nwe should. I don't know. But the proposal out there is this one, and it \nis all throughout the United States now.\n  People will say, ``Oh. Why don't we do it for AIDS?'' Well, the \nbreast cancer community has made this proposal. They are united about \nit. They want to try it.\n  I have agreed to sponsor it in the Senate. Senator Faircloth has \nagreed to be a cosponsor, along with Senator D'Amato, Senator Kent \nConrad, Senator Tom Harkin, Senator Feingold, Senator Johnson, Senator \nKerry, Senator Mack, Senator Reid, Senator Thurmond, and Senator \nTorricelli. I can't put all of the 51 names on this because I didn't \nspecifically say it would be an amendment. I said, a bill.\n  So I am told I should call everybody again. But I believe there is \nthe opportunity. I think the case has been made, if you see what \nhappens to women afflicted with breast cancer. And you see this amazing \nsurviver community and what they are willing to do. In a way, this \nstamp is a tribute to that kind of resolute spirit that can conquer \nwhat for many has been a mortal disease.\n  So I am hopeful, Mr. President, despite those who I know on the \nAppropriations Committee that do not want to see this happen. They \ndon't want to do it on this bill. But if it doesn't happen here, \nperhaps it won't, and we will send out a message to the breast cancer \nsurvival community that we will not try anything new.\n  If you have a disease, you will try anything to get rid of it. I \nthink this body should try one new thing, and let's see if it works, \nand let's see if we can produce 60, 70, 80, or 90 million new dollars \nfor breast cancer research.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves for her next \nappointment, I would like to make a couple of comments and ask her some \nquestions.\n  First of all, as I am sure she knows, I have always been a big \nsupporter of increased money going into breast cancer research, as she \nhas. And I commend her for the leadership she has taken on this issue. \nIn fact, many of our colleagues have not only supported additional \nresearch money but have participated on our own time on Saturdays and \nSundays in raising private funds for breast cancer research. The most \ncommon that we are aware of is the Susan Komen Foundation and The Run \nfor the Cure, which is done all over the United States.\n  Just a few weeks ago here in Washington, DC, we had something like \n45,000 or 50,000 people that contributed money to run through the \nstreets of Washington to help raise money for that very, very badly \nneeded program.\n  But I am a little concerned. She mentioned a few of the concerns \nalready. But I am told that the chairman of the authorizing \nsubcommittee, Senator Cochran, has some concerns about this proposal, \nas does Senator Stevens who will be here in about 25 minutes to make \nsome comments on it, too.\n  First, one of my concerns is certainly the administrative costs to \nthe Postal Service. I think they would be significant, as I understand \nit.\n  I would like to ask the Senator. Is there a provision that allows \nthem to recoup their costs? Or does the whole profit of this additional \ncost of stamps just go to the program, and do they have to absorb the \nadministrative costs for doing it?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes. The administrative costs are absorbed under the \none additional cent.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. A portion of 1 cent will go back to recover the cost.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The cost of collecting the money is absorbed in that \n1 cent. Yes.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I might also just comment that, as I \nunderstand it, if this 1-cent increase had been for the single best-\nselling stamp of all time--which was the Elvis Presley stamp that went \non sale a couple of years ago, that stamp sold $500 million individual \nstamps--but if this 1-cent additional had been on that stamp, it would \nhave raised only $5 million. Certainly that is an important amount but \nnot as much as we need. As I also understand, only about 1.6 million \nbreast cancer stamps have been sold so far.\n  So the amount, I would tell my friend from California, that she would \nhope to realize from what I have heard and seen is probably going to be \nquite a bit less than she would hope to get into this account.\n  The Senator already mentioned that there are some concerns by some of \nthe Members that there are many, many programs that are equally \nimportant--muscular dystrophy, prostate cancer is important, \nAlzheimer's disease, heart disease--many things that we need to address \nsome more. And I think, as some of my colleagues think, that we may be \nopening an avenue for all kinds of new groups to ask for the same kind \nof consideration.\n  If that happens, then I think, No. 1, we are going to confuse the \npublic and\n\n[[Page S7663]]\n\nwe will probably dilute the amount of money needed for any one of them.\n  But I am not opposed to this amendment. I just wanted to make sure \nthat my colleague understands that I am very supportive of her efforts. \nBut I do have these concerns.\n  I thank her, and I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, there is one Member seeking time. If the \nSenator from California is finished, I will suggest the absence of a \nquorum until Senator Stevens gets here.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator. Yes. At this time, if I may be \nafforded a reaction and comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  As we know, with anything done the first time you never really quite \nknow what it is going to do. I have had estimates. The group supporting \nthis has done some research. I know what they have told me. I cannot \nmake any guarantee to this body that it will produce a lot of money. I \ndo know that it is worth a try, in my opinion. It is important to \npeople. There is a movement behind it.\n  The breast cancer stamp now exists as of now and it has no \nfundraising connected to it. It is simply a first-class stamp. This has \nthe ability, for people that want to do so, to buy for the reason of \nraising an additional cent. I think every one of us know people \nimmediately close to us that are suffering from breast cancer. I happen \nto believe the women of America are going to respond to this. I think \nyoung women are going to respond to it. I think you are going to see \ninteresting ways that people are going to sell first-class stamps. I \nthink that is good for the post office. It is good for the mail, and \nhopefully it will be good for breast cancer.\n  I know I didn't buy an Elvis Presley stamp. What was the other stamp? \nI didn't buy the other breast cancer stamp. I will buy these. I think \nthere are many others like me. I don't know how many. But I think it is \nworth a try.\n  I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Governmental Affairs \nSubcommittee on International Security, Proliferation, and Federal \nServices, which has jurisdiction over postal matters, I must point out \nthat the Feinstein amendment would require the U.S. Postal Service to \nissue a special postage stamp.\n  Such a special stamp--generally referred to as a semipostal--would \nsell for 1 cent above the basic first-class letter rate, with most of \nthe differential going to fund breast cancer research. Though this is a \nwell-intentioned amendment, and breast cancer research is a highly \nworthwhile cause, the idea of using the Postal Service as a fund-\nraising tool is not a good one. The list of diseases that should be \ngiven added research funds is endless. Requiring the Postal Service to \nissue a semipostal stamp for breast cancer would place the Postal \nService and Congress in the very difficult position of determining \nwhich worthy organizations or research programs should receive \nfundraising assistance from the Postal authorities and which should \nnot.\n  The concept of semipostals has been around for years. Some nations \nissue them, but most do not. The European experience with this kind of \nstamp has shown that they are rarely as beneficial to the designated \norganization as expected. Consider the example of Canada. In 1975, the \nCanadian Postal Corporation issued a series of semipostal stamps to \nprovide supplementary revenue for the Canadian Olympic Committee. It \nwas reported that while the program received exceptionally good \npromotional and advertising support, it fell short of its intended \nrevenue objective. Demand for the semipostals throughout Canada was \nreportedly insubstantial. The program--viewed as a failure--concluded \nin 1976. More recently, the Canada Post issued a semipostal to support \nliteracy. With a surcharge of 5 cents per stamp, it raised only \n$252,000. After raising only a modest amount of money, combined with a \ntremendous administrative expense, Canada Post says they will not issue \nanother semipostal.\n  There is a strong U.S. tradition of private fund-raising for \ncharities. Such a stamp would effectively use the United States Postal \nService as a fundraiser, a role it never has had. The Postal Service's \njob--and expertise--is mail delivery. Congress should be mindful that \nthe postage stamp pays strictly for postal operations. It is not a fee \nfor anything but delivering the mail and paying the cost of running the \nservice. In fact, section 3622 of the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 \nprecludes charging rates in excess of those required to offset the \nPostal Service's costs of providing a particular service. In other \nwords, the Postal Service does not have the authority to put a \nsurcharge on a postage rate that is cost and overhead driven. There is \nsimply no legitimate connection between the desire to raise money for a \ncause, and maintenance of the postal service's mission of providing \nuniversal service at a universal rate.\n  This is an effort to bypass the legislative process with an amendment \non an appropriation bill and even though the Feinstein amendment's \ngoals are laudatory, it should be rejected.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I would also ask unanimous consent that the remaining \ntime be equally charged to both the proponents and the opponents of the \nFeinstein amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be \nallowed to speak as if in morning business for a period of 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/17/senate-section/article/S7659-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7663-S7664]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RACE RELATIONS IN AMERICA\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, on Monday, the President's Advisory \nCommission on Race met for the first time. Amid the wide-ranging \ndiscussion on a variety of issues relating specifically to race, \nChairman John Hope Franklin, the renowned doctor of history, discussed \nthe centrality of education and in particular the physical condition of \nour schools and the centrality of that issue to the future of race \nrelations in our country.\n  Dr. Franklin noted that in his home of North Carolina, there are \nschools that are closed part of the time because it is too hot, and \nthere are schools that are closed part of the time because it is too \ncold, and there are some that are closed part of the time because, when \nit rains, it rains inside the school as well as outside the school.\n  Dr. Franklin went on to note that the problem of crumbling schools is \nnot particular to race but rather it is a problem that transcends race. \nIt is a problem that is essential, however, to any discussion of race \nbecause it speaks to the character of our Nation as a whole. I want to \nquote him because I think it is important. ``It is a remarkable \ntestimony,'' Dr. Franklin noted, ``to the profligacy of this country, \nthat it will not provide decent educational facilities and \nopportunities for all of our children.''\n  I believe Dr. Franklin is absolutely correct. According to the U.S. \nGeneral Accounting Office, every day some 14 million children attend \nschools that are in such poor physical condition that they need major \nrepairs or should be replaced outright. Some 12 million children attend \nschools with leaky roofs; 42 percent of schools with more than 51 \npercent minority enrollment have at least one inadequate building, and \n29 percent of schools with less than 6 percent minority enrollment--\nless\n\n[[Page S7664]]\n\nthan 6 percent--have at least one inadequate building.\n  In urban, rural, and suburban areas alike, schools are crumbling down \naround our children. According to the U.S. General Accounting Office, \nit will cost at least $112 billion just to bring them up to code. That \nprice tag does not include the cost of upgrading schools so they can \nincorporate modern technologies in the classroom. The FCC, the Federal \nCommunications Commission, recently finalized an initiative that will \ngive the schools and libraries deep discounts on telecommunications \nservices, which should provide millions of children access to modern \ntechnology that they would not have otherwise enjoyed. Too many of our \nchildren, however, will be unable to take advantage of this opportunity \nbecause their schools lack even the basic infrastructure necessary to \nallow a teacher to plug a computer into the classroom wall. Nearly half \nof the schools lack the basic electrical wiring needed to fully \nintegrate computers in the classrooms.\n  So the crumbling schools problem has ramifications even beyond leaky \nroofs. It cuts off the ability of our youngsters to take advantage of \ntechnologies that will help them grapple with the educational \nchallenges that they face in their time.\n  Schools are overcrowded, also. I have seen schools where the study \nhalls are literally in the hallways, where computer labs are on the \nstairwell landings, and where they have erected cardboard partitions at \nthe end of corridors in order to create makeshift classrooms.\n  These dilapidated, overcrowded schools do not provide our children \nwith the kinds of opportunities they will need to compete in the 21st \ncentury global economy. Nor do these aging and crumbling schools \nprovide our children with the educational opportunities all of our \nchildren will need if we ever expect to move beyond the problems of \nrace relations which have existed, like a sore on our Nation, since its \nearliest days.\n  While Dr. Franklin was meeting with the President's Advisory Board on \nRace Relations, many of my colleagues over here were meeting to work \nout the final details of the tax bill. President Clinton's tax proposal \nincludes an innovative proposal to address the conditions of crumbling \nschools. I hope my colleagues on the conference committee will see fit \nto adopt his proposal.\n  The President has called for the distribution of allocable tax \ncredits to the States, which would then offer those tax credits to \ndevelopers and builders in exchange for their performing below-market-\nrate school construction or improvement projects. States and school \ndistricts need our help to address the problem of crumbling schools. We \nhave to rebuild these schools for the 21st century to give our young \npeople the educational opportunities that they need and they deserve. \nDoing so will help prepare our children for the 21st century economy \nand will help build a climate of tolerance among the people of our \ncountry.\n  I would like to take a moment to read a letter to my colleagues that \nI recently received from a superintendent of a rural school district in \nsouthern Illinois. I remind my colleagues, Illinois--we used to have an \nexpression, ``Just outside Chicago there is a place called Illinois.'' \nMy State is largely rural once you leave the region around Chicago. I \nwould like to read his letter, the whole letter, because I think it is \nimportant. Superintendent Lawrence Naeger wrote to me. He said:\n       I am the Superintendent of Century Community Unit Number \n     100 School District near Ullin, Illinois in the county of \n     Pulaski. I am writing to you in the name of the many citizens \n     of my school district that support your efforts to put \n     dollars back in the federal budget for school construction.\n       From the earliest days of our school district, the school \n     house has been a focal point of great community pride--a \n     brick and mortar representation of the commitment which \n     citizens of this school district have made to their \n     children's education. Sadly, economic changes over the years \n     have made our community's commitment more difficult. The \n     alarming number of construction concerns that now exist point \n     to a crisis waiting to happen.\n       As time goes by, it becomes evident that small repairs and \n     quality maintenance is not enough. Thankfully, there have \n     been no major health or safety disasters directly related to \n     the structures. However, it is apparent that the leaking \n     roofs, rusted plumbing, overworked heating systems, and \n     crumbling plaster are fast approaching a crisis point. Less \n     visible, but also of great concern, are infrastructure \n     problems related to overcrowding and/or the inadequacy of \n     school facilities for education as we move toward the 21st \n     Century. Classes held daily on a stage in a gymnasium in the \n     elementary school, and electrical systems which are \n     inadequate for today's learning technologies, stand in the \n     way of quality education for our children.\n       The Century Board of Education, trying to address these \n     concerns, have been caught between competing demands for \n     local dollars and increasingly restrictive laws regarding \n     access to revenue. As anti-tax sentiment has grown, so too \n     has the recognition that the state and federal governments \n     must become partners in resolving school infrastructure \n     concerns.\n       The Century School district is clearly at a critical \n     juncture with respect to the infrastructure of its schools. \n     Decisions are being made on how school infrastructure needs \n     can be adequately met, with a very limited budget. Money \n     spent on infrastructure generally comes from local taxes. \n     While the Century Board of Education is authorized to levy \n     taxes to support its building needs, there are restrictions \n     which severely limit the ability of the board to respond to \n     the emerging infrastructure problems.\n       It is important to note, in the not-too-distant future, \n     infrastructure problems which currently exist will likely be \n     compounded as our schools built in the 1950's and 1960's \n     begin to wear out. Though age does not necessarily make a \n     building dangerous or obsolete, construction at that time was \n     typically rapid and cheap . . .\n       Beyond the most urgent health and safety issues, there is \n     increasing concern about the need for . . . infrastructure \n     that can support educational reform and desired innovations, \n     infrastructure conditions that can accommodate the \n     integration of technology, infrastructure that can be \n     accessed by all students regardless of disability, schools \n     that can be used primarily for education but for other \n     community purposes as well, and schools that can serve as \n     safe havens protected from society's violence.\n       In summary, the Century Board of Education is standing \n     tall, providing the best opportunities for the children of \n     the district to attend school in an environment that is \n     physically safe and conducive to learning. We are being held \n     accountable and are willing to take responsibility to address \n     the deterioration of our school buildings. As well as the \n     growing need for new construction. However, we need your help \n     to fight on for federal dollars to continue the process.\n       Please fight for our district, our community, our children, \n     the hopes and dreams of all. Please continue to fight for all \n     the children who attend inequitable and inadequate \n     infrastructures, exacerbated by government red tape and \n     broken promises.\n            Sincerely,\n                                                  Lawrence Naeger,\n                                                   Superintendent.\n\n  Mr. President, I just want to point out as my time runs out here, the \ntime really has come for all of us in government at all levels, at the \nlocal, State, and the Federal Government, to cooperate, to stop \npointing fingers at each other, stop pointing fingers at the local \nschool officials or the State education officials or the township \nsupervisors and, instead, form a partnership among all levels of \ngovernment to address this critical problem.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a look at the conditions of schools in \ntheir own States and to consider the implications of crumbling schools \nfor our children, for our country, for our future, and for the \ncharacter of our Nation. That was the point that Dr. Franklin made on \nMonday. That is the point that I wanted to bring to the Senate's \nattention this afternoon.\n  I am hopeful that, as we go through the rest of this legislative \nsession, we can come up with innovative approaches to help States and \nlocal communities and local governments, such as represented by the \nletter I read, respond to their concern and need and interest in \nproviding quality educational opportunities for all of America's \nchildren.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/17/senate-section/article/S7663-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7664-S7669]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TREASURY AND GENERAL GOVERNMENT APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 927\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 5 minutes \nof time in favor of Mrs. Feinstein's amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator \nFeinstein's amendment. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this \namendment.\n\n[[Page S7665]]\n\n  In May of this year, Senator Feinstein introduced this bill, S. 726. \nThe bill creates a new stamp that costs 1 cent more than whatever the \nregular price stamp might be. The additional revenue is to be used to \ndirectly fund research efforts for breast cancer.\n  As I am sure we all know, breast cancer is the leading cause of death \nfor women between the ages of 15 and 54. There are 2.6 million women \ntoday in America with breast cancer and an estimated 1 million are yet \nto be diagnosed. If only 10 percent of the first-class stamps use the \noption for an additional penny--currently it would be a 33-cent stamp, \nbut that might change--but, if only 10 percent use the option of an \nadditional penny above, $60 million would be raised for breast cancer \nannually. This would represent a 10 percent increase in the research \nfunds available for this disease that is devastating so much of our \npopulation.\n  I frankly believe the idea will be popular and will generate even \ngreater funding than we anticipate. It is used pretty much around the \nworld, except in Britain and the United States, this method of raising \nmoney for worthwhile causes.\n  In my opinion, the new stamp provides a great opportunity to increase \nthe research, and the proceeds come directly from the American people \non a voluntary basis, not from tax money. Some have questioned what \nkind of precedent we are setting. I think the answer is that it is \nnone. It is going to require an act of Congress and the support of the \nAmerican people. If the program is successful, I suppose there will be \npeople attempting to emulate it, but that is a decision for Congress to \nmake at the time and on the issue involved. As I said, it is not a \nnovel approach; it has been used around the world before this.\n  Further, I think the people who do not think this will be popular are \nabsolutely wrong. This measure, I think, will be extremely popular. It \nwill raise a lot of money. I have discussed it with numerous people, \nand all have told me that they felt it was a worthwhile idea and would \nbe worthwhile. I thank Senator Feinstein for introducing the amendment.\n  I think the Senate needs to go on record in favor of this and let the \nAmerican people decide if it is going to succeed or not. If it does, we \nknow we will have been right. If it does not succeed, we will not have \nset a precedent for other stamps. But first and foremost, it is an idea \nwell worth trying, and I think we need to give it an opportunity.\n  I am aware that the post office has concerns. But every day I read \nthe post office wants to expand its line of business. Every day, they \nare going into new business, new things, and to these I do not object. \nBut I just noticed the other day they were selling neckties in the post \noffice. I don't see why, with the vast new interest and new things they \nare going into, they could possibly have a problem with printing this \nnew stamp. The cost of the stamp for distribution will be taken out \nbefore any money becomes available for research. This idea is merely a \nlogical extension of selling stamps. I strongly urge Members to support \nit and urge you to vote for the Feinstein amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask that I be yielded about 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this is not an easy task to appear in \nopposition to this amendment. It is not easy for me personally, because \nI am a survivor of prostate cancer. I come from a family where my \noldest brother, my father and my grandfather and my mother all died \nprematurely of cancer, and I thankfully just received word today that \nmy younger brother has now survived prostate cancer.\n  The question before the Senate is not cancer. The question before the \nSenate is how to raise money for cancer research. I have strongly urged \nthat this amendment not come before the Senate, because we reformed the \npostal system and made it an independent entity. It has evolved from \nthe old Post Office Department, where a member of the Postal Service, \nthe Postmaster General, was a member of the President's Cabinet, to one \nthat is run, basically, by a board of governors with a Postmaster \nGeneral that is appointed by that board of governors, and we have not \nissued a stamp in Congress since 1978.\n  There is no power in the Congress to do what this amendment asks. The \npower under existing law was given to the Board of Governors, the \nPostal Service, and the Postal Rate Commission. As a matter of fact, \nthe Postal Service does not have the authority to issue a stamp and \ncharge more than that established by law by the Postal Rate Commission.\n  I refer the Senate to section 3622 of title 39 which specifically \nsays that the cost for the stamps must be established through the \npostal rate procedure.\n  This comes at a time when all I can say is this is plainly wrong, and \nI have urged the sponsors to remember what they are doing. If we have \nthis stamp--and it looked nice. I saw it beside the Senator from \nCalifornia on C-SPAN. But we have AIDS problems, we have prostate \ncancer problems, we have problems raising money for the Boy Scouts and \nthe Girl Scouts and the community programs to raise money for all sorts \nof problems.\n  They have real trouble raising money, but, Mr. President, I started \nthe concept of putting up defense money for cancer research for breast \ncancer at $25 million from the defense funds, and I have just urged the \nSenate to pass a bill from the subcommittee I chair, Defense \nAppropriations. It has in it $175 million for breast cancer research, \nspecifically earmarked for breast cancer research.\n  This stamp, if it is issued, if it sold as many as the famous stamp--\nI think it was the Elvis stamp was the one that sold more than any \nstamp in history, a penny from each one of the Elvis stamps would bring \nin $1 million. So what we are seeing is a public relations campaign by \npeople who want credit for being for cancer research, but it is really \nnot an effective fundraising mechanism.\n  I urge them to use a process like we did for selling savings bonds, \nto have the Postal Service sell cancer stamps that would go into \nbooklets. You can have one for breast cancer, one for prostate cancer, \none for just the general National Institute of Cancer. But you buy the \nbook, put them in a booklet, and when you get $25 worth, you get a $25 \nbond. If you do that, you would make $1 out of every $20 that came in. \nIf this stamp becomes approved, they get 1 out of every 35 cents. In \nother words, $1 out of every $35, but the cost of raising this is \nhorrendous for the Postal Service. A person who wants to buy one of \nthese stamps will go to a window and say, ``We want 100 breast cancer \nstamps.''\n  ``We don't have that. We have one that shows Jimmy Doolittle or one \nthat shows World War II stamps, but we are out of those.'' This is not \nan effective way to sell stamps is what I am saying.\n  It is true that there are stamp collectors, and on a one-time basis, \nas the Elvis stamp showed, a lot of people buy them just for \ncollection, but I have to tell you, that is a one-time thing, but it is \nnot a one-time thing for the Postal Service. It is plainly wrong, \nbecause its job is to deliver the mail. It is paid for by the \nratepayers. The taxpayers do not support the Postal Service any longer.\n  The Board of Governors is on record against this. The Postal Service \nis against it. We have seen that this has been done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator has used 7 \nminutes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will take 2 more minutes, if I may, and then I will \nquiet down.\n  Canada issued a semipostal, that is what they call this, a semipostal \nstamp, to support literacy. It was a surcharge of 5 cent per stamp, and \nit raised $252,000 net. This is not an effective way to raise money for \nbreast cancer. We have shown these people how to raise more money for \nbreast cancer, how to improve breast cancer research. I want to work \nwith them, but I tell the Senate that this is not the way to do it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter that I \nreceived today from the Postal Service, from the Postmaster General, \nwhere he states that the Postal Service strongly\n\n[[Page S7666]]\n\nopposes this amendment and states that it would be inappropriate for \nthe Postal Service to raise revenue for purposes other than maintenance \nof the delivery system.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                          U.S. Postal Service,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 17, 1997.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Stevens: I am writing to express concern about \n     an amendment that was offered and then withdrawn at the full \n     Committee markup of the Treasury, Postal, and General \n     Government appropriations bill on July 15. The amendment \n     would require the Postal Service to issue a special postage \n     stamp to help fund breast cancer research. This hybrid stamp, \n     called a semipostal, would sell for one-cent above the Basic \n     First-Class letter rate, with most of the one-cent \n     differential going to breast cancer research.\n       The Postal Service strongly opposes this amendment. Our \n     basic function today remains the same as it has been for over \n     200 years--universal mail service throughout the nation. We \n     believe it would be inappropriate for the Postal Service to \n     raise revenue for purposes other than the maintenance of a \n     national mail delivery system.\n       This proposed amendment would set a precedent which would \n     open the floodgates for all worthy social causes. In very \n     short order, the Postal Service would find itself devoting \n     considerable time and expense as a fund raiser. That is not \n     our role, and we do not think it should be.\n       We understand this semipostal amendment will again be \n     offered on the Senate floor today, and would appreciate your \n     support in rejecting the idea.\n           Best regards,\n                                                    Marvin Runyon,\n                                          Postmaster General, CEO.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I say the same thing, you cannot limit \nthis process to one concept of a breast-cancer concept. It will lead to \nCongress getting back into the micromanagement of the Postal Service. \nIt is plainly wrong, and it should not become law. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. What happens to the time limits?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time will be suspended.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator may proceed.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 929\n\n(Purpose: To limit the use of funds to provide for Federal agencies to \n furnish commercially available property or services to other Federal \n                               agencies)\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 929 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Thomas], for himself, Mr. \n     Enzi and Mr. Brownback, proposes an amendment numbered 929.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section and renumber any following sections accordingly:\n\n     SEC.   . LIMITATION ON THE USE OF FUNDS TO PROVIDE FOR \n                   FEDERAL AGENCIES TO FURNISH COMMERCIALLY \n                   AVAILABLE PROPERTY OR SERVICES TO OTHER FEDERAL \n                   AGENCIES.\n\n       (a) Except as provided in subsection (b), none of the funds \n     appropriated by this or any other Act may be used by the \n     Office of Management and Budget, or any other agency, to \n     publish, promulgate, or enforce any policy, regulation, or \n     circular, or any rule or authority in any other form, that \n     would permit any Federal agency to provide a commercially \n     available property or service to any other department or \n     agency of government unless the policy, regulation, circular, \n     or other rule or authority meets the requirements prescribed \n     under subsection (b).\n       (b)(1) Not later than 120 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget shall prescribe regulations applicable \n     to any policy regulation, circular, or other rule or \n     authority referred to in subsection (a).\n       (2) The requirements prescribed under paragraph (1) shall \n     include the following:\n       (A) a requirement for a comparison between the cost of \n     providing the property or service concerned through the \n     agency concerned and the cost of providing such property or \n     service through the private sector;\n       (B) a requirement for cost and performance benchmarks \n     relating to the property or service provided relative to \n     comparable services provided by other government agencies and \n     contractors in order to permit effective oversight of the \n     cost and provision of such property or service by the agency \n     concerned or the Office of Management and Budget; and\n       (C) the regulation would not apply to contingency \n     operations associated with national security or a national \n     emergency.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that Senator \nEnzi and Senator Brownback be added as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I bring to the floor and to this bill an \namendment which was offered last year and adopted by a bipartisan vote \nof 59 to 39 but was trimmed out of the omnibus appropriations bill. It \nhas to do with the question of the Federal Government competing \nunfairly with private firms; agencies performing commercial, rather \nthan inherently governmental, activities for other agencies. My \namendment requires Federal agencies to demonstrate that they can \nperform more efficiently and effectively than the private sector before \nproviding commercially available goods and services to other agencies.\n  It has been the Federal Government's policy for over 40 years that it \nshould not compete with the private sector. In fact, the Government \nshould rely on the private sector to supply commercially available \ngoods and services. However, this policy is too often ignored.\n  For example, the Defense Science Board calculates that out of 850,000 \nfull-time positions needed to provide commercial services for the \nmilitary, 640,000 are held by Federal employees instead of private \nsector contractors.\n  The Clinton administration has taken this situation one step further. \nLast year, OMB came out with a policy that grandfathers existing \ninterservice support agreements from cost-comparison requirements. This \nchange permits one Federal agency to provide goods and services to \nanother agency regardless of cost or performance. This new policy gives \nFederal agencies until October 1997 to go out and recruit business from \nother agencies without performing a cost comparison and cost analysis. \nThe administration implicitly argues that this entrepreneurial approach \nto Government will save the taxpayers money.\n  However, if they don't do a cost comparison, how do they know it \nsaves money? Some examples of existing interservice support agreements \nare aerial photography, mapping services, laboratory services, printing \nservices, all of which are often provided more efficiently and more \ncost-effectively in the private sector.\n  For example, in Jacksonville, FL, the Navy Public Works Division \nrecently completed a state-of-the-art environmental lab to provide \nroutine hazardous waste characterizations. These services are already \navailable in the private sector, and the Navy intends to offer their \nservices to other agencies.\n  In Alaska last year, the State struggled to contain a large wildfire. \nThe CIA provided needed mapping and satellite imagery. A private \ncompany was available to do the work, but they were never asked.\n  These are just a few of the examples of direct Government competition \nwith the private sector without a cost comparison.\n  I want to emphasize that I am not insisting that the Federal \nGovernment use the private sector. It simply needs to compare public \nand private sector production to ensure the American taxpayer gets the \nbest value goods and services, the most bang for their buck.\n  Encouraging the Federal Government to compete with the private sector \nis philosophically wrong. Almost all of us stand up here day after day \nand talk about let's have less Government, reduce the size of \nGovernment, reduce the cost of Government, strengthen the private \nsector and, yet, continually allow this to go on. It is philosophically \nwrong. It hurts small business.\n  In fact, the three White House Conferences on Small Business rate \nthis as a top concern, the ability to compete for public contracts.\n  Unfair Government competition with the private sector costs the \ntaxpayers money. Numerous studies have shown that outsourcing can save \nthe Government up to $30 billion annually. It also\n\n[[Page S7667]]\n\ncircumvents the appropriations process. If an agency can do work for \nanother agency, it is likely that its resources and employees are \nlarger than it needs to be and needs to be cut back. On the other hand, \nif an agency's appropriation is cut, it recruits business. That also \ncircumvents the appropriations' process and the idea of focusing on \npriorities.\n\n  Most of all, the policy is contrary to current law. This policy is \nmerely a rule from the OMB supplemental handbook A-76. But it violates \nthe Economy Act, which specifically states that one agency can provide \ngoods and services to another agency only when a commercial enterprise \ncannot provide the goods and services as conveniently or as cheaply. In \nother words, you do have to do a cost comparison.\n  I think this is an unbelievable policy for a President that has said, \n``The era of big Government is over,'' and then to turn around and \nimplement a policy of this kind, which does not even provide for a cost \ncomparison. This policy is another example of the administration \nexpanding Government, not reinventing it.\n  I recently introduced a bill, S. 314, which is called the Freedom \nFrom Government Competition Act, which addresses Government competition \nwith the private sector. It encourages outsourcing and utilizing \nprivate sector capability. It provides exemptions for national \nsecurity, inherently governmental functions, situations where the \nGovernment can provide better value goods and services, and when \nprivate sector capability is inadequate. I want to stress that this \namendment addresses functions that are commercial activities within the \nGovernment. We need to take some action now to implement the rules and \nthe policy that has been in place for 40 years but have not been \nfollowed.\n  My amendment is exactly the same as that which the Senate passed last \nyear. It merely reaffirms existing law and prohibits one agency \nproviding commercial goods and services for another unless a comparison \nis done. More oversight of this problem is needed.\n  This amendment will create private sector jobs, help small business, \nsave taxpayer dollars, make the Government smaller and more efficient. \nThat is a great idea.\n  My bottom line is, I want the Government to cost less and be more \neffective. Most people here do. My amendment will ensure that. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting this commonsense, good-\nGovernment, protaxpayer reform.\n  Mr. President, I ask now for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is not a \nsufficient second.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I will come back later and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on amendment No. 929 \noffered by the Senator from Wyoming?\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. THOMAS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Vote on Amendment No. 927\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order concerning \nthe Feinstein amendment. We yield back all remaining time and ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  Mr. KOHL. On behalf of the minority and Senator Feinstein, we yield \nback our remaining time also.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, will the \ndistinguished Senator from Colorado be willing to add a Hatch amendment \non national media campaign?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. National media campaign?\n  Mr. HATCH. Yes, in addition to the judges' compensation.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. We will add that. But at the present time, the minority \nleader has informed me there are two or three others that are just \nright on the verge of offering their amendments. So I withhold my \nunanimous-consent request at the present time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment \nnumbered 929 will be set aside, and the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] for himself, Mr. Leahy, \n     Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Kohl, proposes an amendment numbered 930.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.    . JUDICIAL SALARIES.\n\n       (a) Judicial Cost-of-Living Adjustments.--Section 461(a) of \n     title 28, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(a) Effective on the same date that the rates of basic \n     pay under the General Schedule are adjusted pursuant to \n     section 5303 of title 5, each salary rate which is subject to \n     adjustment under this section shall be adjusted by the same \n     percentage amount as provided for under section 5303 of title \n     5, rounded to the nearest multiple of $100 (or if midway \n     between multiples of $100, to the next higher multiple of \n     $100).''.\n       (b) Automatic Adjustments Without Congressional Action.--\n     Section 140 of the resolution entitled ``A Joint Resolution \n     making further continuing appropriations for the fiscal year \n     1982, and for other purposes.'', approved December 15, 1981 \n     (Public Law 97-92; 95 Stat. 1200; 28 U.S.C. 461 note) is \n     repealed.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, my amendment delinks judges' salaries from \nour salary problem, because it is unbelievable how terrible it is in \nmany parts of this country that judges do not have an annual COLA. That \nis what this will grant them.\n  Mr. President, I am offering an amendment to establish a procedure \nfor future cost-of-living increases in judicial compensation. This \nlegislation is a portion of a legislative proposal prepared by the \nAdministrative Office of the U.S. Courts, and which I introduced by \nrequest as S. 394 earlier this Congress.\n  Under current law, salaries for Federal judges are currently linked \nto congressional and Executive Schedule salaries, so that Federal \njudges cannot receive cost-of-living adjustments [COLA's] unless \nMembers of Congress and employees on the Executive Schedule receive the \nsame COLA. As a consequence, Federal judges have not received a cost-\nof-living salary adjustment since January 1994. This amendment would \namend section 461 of title 28 to end the current linkage between the \njudicial, congressional and Executive Schedule compensation. Instead, \njudicial salaries would be adjusted automatically on an annual basis, \nin the same percentage amount as the rate of pay of Federal employees \nunder the General Schedule. In addition, the amendment would repeal \nsection 140 of Public Law No. 97-92, thereby removing the current \nrequirement that Congress affirmatively vote for cost-of-living \nincreases for Federal judges.\n  Not included in my amendment is language, originally proposed by the \nAdministrative Office and introduced as part of S. 394 earlier this \nCongress, which would give a one-time salary increase to Federal \njudges. I do believe this separate, one-time salary increase warrants \nserious consideration by this body, although not necessarily as part of \nthe second degree amendment I am presently offering.\n  If we are to attract and retain the most capable lawyers to serve as \nFederal judges, it is vitally important that we ensure that those \nresponsible for the effective functioning of the judicial branch \nreceive fair compensation, including reasonable adjustments which allow \njudicial salaries to keep pace with increases in the cost of living. As \nChief Justice Rehnquist stated in his ``1996 Year-End Report on the \nFederal Judiciary,'' ``We must insure that judges, who make a lifetime \ncommitment to public service are able to plan their financial futures \nbased on reasonable expectations.'' This amendment, which I am offering \nat the request of the Judicial Conference, proposes changes viewed by \nthe Judicial Conference as advancing this objective--an objective with \nwhich I believe most Senators would agree.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment of the Senator from \nUtah.\n  The amendment (No. 930) was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. KOHL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 929, As Modified\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I send to the desk a modification to \namendment 929.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 929), as modified, is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section and renumber any following sections accordingly:\n\n     SEC.  . LIMITATION ON THE USE OF FUNDS TO PROVIDE FOR FEDERAL \n                   AGENCIES TO FURNISH COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE \n                   PROPERTY OR SERVICES TO OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES.\n\n       (a) Except as provided in subsection (b), none of the funds \n     appropriated by this or any other Act may be used by the \n     Office of Management and Budget, or any other agency, to \n     publish, promulgate, or enforce any policy, regulation, or \n     circular, or any rule or authority in any other form, that \n     would permit any Federal agency to provide a commercially \n     available property or service to any other department or \n     agency of government unless the policy, regulation, circular, \n     or other rule or authority meets the requirements prescribed \n     under subsection (b).\n       (b)(1) Not later than 120 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Director of the Office of \n     Management and Budget shall prescribe regulations applicable \n     to any policy regulation, circular, or other rule or \n     authority referred to in subsection (a).\n       (2) The requirements prescribed under paragraph (1) shall \n     include the following:\n       (A) a requirement for a comparison between the cost of \n     providing the property or service concerned through the \n     agency concerned and the cost of providing such property or \n     service through the private sector;\n       (B) a requirement for cost and performance benchmarks \n     relating to the property or service provided relative to \n     comparable services provided by other government agencies and \n     contractors in order to permit effective oversight of the \n     cost and provision of such property or service by the agency \n     concerned or the Office of Management and Budget; and\n       (C) the regulation would not apply to contingency \n     operations associated with national security or a national \n     emergency.\n       (D) the regulation would not apply if the goods are to be \n     produced or services are to be performed by a private sector \n     source at a government owned facility that is operated by the \n     private sector source.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Hagel \nbe added as a sponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I would like to comment just briefly here \non the nomination of Mr. Joel Klein, who has been nominated for the \nposition of Assistant Attorney General of the Antitrust Division of the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  Last Friday, I spoke on this floor in support of Mr. Klein and urged \nmy colleagues to support his nomination. I certainly continue \nwholeheartedly to support Mr. Joel Klein. And I continue to urge my \ncolleagues to join me.\n  I will not repeat today all that I had to say last week on Mr. \nKlein's behalf, but I would like to reiterate that support and have my \nstatement from last Friday printed in the Record. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have that statement printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S7670]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nStatement of Senator Orrin Hatch on the Nomination of Joel I. Klein To \n    Be Assistant Attorney General of the Antitrust Division of the \n                  Department of Justice, July 11, 1997\n\n       Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of Mr. Joel Klein, \n     who has been nominated for the position of Assistant Attorney \n     General of the Antitrust Division of the Department of \n     Justice. Mr. Klein was reported out of the Judiciary \n     Committee unanimously on May 5. As his record and testimony \n     reflect, Mr. Klein is a fine nominee for this position, and I \n     am pleased that his nomination has finally been brought \n     before the full Senate today. He has my strong support.\n       I believe Mr. Klein is as fine a lawyer as any nominee who \n     has come before this committee. He graduated magna cum laude \n     from Harvard Law School before clerking for Chief Judge David \n     Brazelon of the D.C. Circuit and then Supreme Court Justice \n     Lewis Powell. Mr. Klein went on to practice public interest \n     law and later formed his own law firm, in which he developed \n     an outstanding reputation as an appellate lawyer arguing--and \n     winning--many important cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. \n     For the past two years, Mr. Klein has ably served as \n     Principal Deputy in the Justice Department's Antitrust \n     Division, and for the past several months he has been the \n     Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division.\n       It is clear, both from his speeches and his enforcement \n     decisions, that Mr. Klein is within the mainstream of \n     antitrust law and doctrine and will be a stabilizing \n     influence at the Antitrust Division. While no one doubts his \n     willingness to take vigorous enforcement actions when \n     appropriate, it is a credit to Mr. Klein that the U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of \n     Manufacturers and other business associations have written in \n     strong support of his nomination to lead the Antitrust \n     Division. They believe he will be good for American business. \n     And I think they are right.\n       At the same time, Mr. Klein has demonstrated a sense of \n     direction and a vision for the Antitrust Division, which is \n     important in a leader. He is committed to enforcing our \n     Nation's antitrust laws in order to uphold our cherished free \n     enterprise system and protect consumers from cartels and \n     other anticompetitive conduct. So, I am certain that Mr. \n     Klein will also be good for consumers.\n       Antitrust doctrine has had its ups and downs over the \n     years--although we may not all agree on which times were \n     which. At this point, however, I am hopeful that antitrust is \n     entering a more mature and more stable period. Although \n     antitrust analysis is fact-intensive and will always contain \n     gray areas, I hope Mr. Klein will work to help make antitrust \n     doctrine as clear and predictable as possible so that \n     companies know what is permitted and what the Antitrust \n     Division will challenge. This will help businesses compete \n     vigorously without the worry and chilling effects that result \n     from uncertainty. I would suggest that the Division's goal \n     should be to avoid burdens on lawful business activities \n     while appropriately enforcing the law against those who \n     clearly violate it.\n       Finally, I would like to add that I personally have been \n     very impressed with Mr. Klein. He strikes me as a person of \n     strong integrity, as a highly competent and talented lawyer \n     who is well-suited to lead the Antitrust Division. While I \n     expect we may not always agree on every issue, I believe that \n     Mr. Klein's skills and expertise will be a service to the \n     Department of Justice, to antitrust policymakers, and the \n     health of competition in our economy and I look forward to \n     working with him in the coming years.\n       In what appears to be a last-ditch effort to scuttle Mr. \n     Klein's nomination, there are some who have now floated an \n     allegation that the nominee's participation in a particular \n     merger decision was somehow improper. Upon examination, let \n     me say that it appears to me that these reports are wholly \n     unfounded and provide no basis whatsoever for questioning the \n     nominees conduct. I understand that, with respect to the \n     matter at issue, Mr. Klein consulted with the proper ethics \n     officials and was assured that his participation raised no \n     conflict of interest or even the appearance thereof. Based on \n     what we know, this judgment appears sound, and I am confident \n     that the nominee has conducted himself appropriately. I \n     should hope that nobody in this body will use this \n     extraneous, ill-founded notion as an eleventh hour basis for \n     opposing Mr. Klein's nomination. I am confident that Mr. \n     Klein is a man of integrity, and urge my colleagues to cast \n     their votes in his favor.\n       Some have suggested that Mr. Klein is misapplying the \n     Telecommunications Act and has taken questionable positions \n     on particular mergers. I will refrain here from passing \n     judgment on any particular decision and from engaging in a \n     detailed debate on Telecommunications antitrust policy. I \n     fully recognize that there are some very, very important \n     issues at stake here, especially in light of a number of \n     ambiguities left in the wake of the Telecommunications Act. I \n     also recognize that there have been some controversial \n     mergers in this area, and yet other potentially landmark \n     mergers which have not come to pass.\n       In short, telecommunications competition and antitrust \n     policy is one of the most important, yet somewhat unsettled, \n     policy areas affecting our emerging, transforming economy. \n     The looming policy decisions to be made in this area cannot \n     be ignored and indeed I plan to have the Judiciary Committee \n     and/or our Antitrust Subcommittee fully explore these issues.\n       But I believe it is neither fair nor wise to hold a nominee \n     hostage because of such concerns. In my view, sound public \n     policy is best served by bringing this nominee up for a vote, \n     permitting the Justice Department to proceed with a confirmed \n     Chief of the Antitrust Division, and for us in Congress to \n     move forward and work with the Department and other involved \n     agencies in the formulation and implementation of \n     telecommunications policies.\n       I hope that all Senators, and especially those of the \n     President's own party, would permit the administration's \n     nominee to be voted on.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I would also like to point out that numerous past and \npresent Government officials and attorneys have voiced strong support \nfor Mr. Klein, including James Rill and John Shenefield, who headed the \nAntitrust Division during the Bush and Carter administrations \nrespectively.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that a letter to the New York Times \neditor from Messrs. Rill and Shenefield be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                    July 11, 1997.\n     The New York Times,\n     New York, NY.\n       To the Editor: We write to state our disagreement with the \n     New York Times and with several Senators who have expressed \n     opposition to the nomination of Joel Klein to head the \n     Antitrust Division at the Justice Department. Mr. Klein \n     should be confirmed because he has all the qualities of \n     leadership and judgment to make an outstanding Assistant \n     Attorney General. In fact, the reasons why his detractors \n     have put his nomination on ``hold'' actually support the case \n     for his nomination. The objections to his nomination stem not \n     from concern about his qualifications, but from a difference \n     of opinion over the best way to ensure competitive markets in \n     telecommunications.\n       The Antitrust Division was created to function as a \n     specialist agency with the expertise and experience essential \n     to making sound antitrust enforcement decisions. Quick, \n     intuitive judgments based upon an incomplete understanding of \n     either the facts or the law can easily lead to incorrect \n     decisions. Critics of Mr. Klein's recent decisions are at a \n     disadvantage because they cannot possibly have his detailed \n     knowledge of the facts. That is why Congress wisely entrusted \n     such decisions to an expert agency. In the past that trust \n     has not been misplaced because the Division has been willing \n     to take an unpopular stand that it considered to be in the \n     public interest--as it did in settling the AT case.\n       Mr. Klein's willingness to reach a decision on the Bell \n     Atlantic merger indicates he has the courage to make a fine \n     Assistant Attorney General. He made a decision despite the \n     fact that whatever he decided to do was likely to offend \n     someone who was considering his nomination. No doubt Mr. \n     Klein could have found a way to delay a decision until after \n     he was confirmed. Instead, he made what he believed was the \n     correct decision from the perspective of the antitrust laws. \n     Mr. Klein is being criticized for doing his job. To \n     substitute the political process for the judgment of an \n     expert enforcement agency in an area where both the facts and \n     the law are remarkably complicated would be a dangerous \n     precedent that could only harm enforcement of the antitrust \n     laws in the future. We hope that those who have expressed \n     misgivings about Mr. Klein's nomination will soon allow it to \n     come to a vote, so that Mr. Klein can be confirmed--as he \n     should be.\n\n     James F. Rill.\n     John H. Shenefield.\n\n       Mr. Rill was Assistant Attorney General in charge of the \n     Antitrust Division during the Bush Administration; Mr. \n     Shenefield was Assistant Attorney General in charge of the \n     Antitrust Division during the Carter Administration.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I am very pleased that cloture was invoked last week with \nsuch overwhelming support. I must say, however, that I was quite \nsurprised, and disappointed even, to find us in the position of voting \non cloture for someone as good as Joel Klein. Even I, as chairman or \nranking member of the Judiciary Committee, have not filibustered a \nsingle Clinton administration nominee for the Justice Department or the \nFederal courts. I am not saying I will not in the future, but I will \nsay that I have not up until now.\n  Indeed, the last filibuster of a Justice Department nominee was over \nthe nomination of Walter Dellinger to head the Department's Office of \nLegal Counsel back in October of 1993. Of all the nominees I have seen \nin recent years, I must say that Joel Klein certainly ranks among the \nvery best of them.\n  Of course, I know my good colleague from South Carolina would not \ntake\n\n[[Page S7671]]\n\nthis step lightly and without what is, in his view, adequate \njustification, but in fairness I think we must now move quickly to \nconfirm this nominee who has been awaiting confirmation since May 5 of \nthis year.\n  As I explained last Friday, I believe it is critical for the \nDepartment of Justice, and the business community generally, to have a \npermanent, confirmed antitrust chief. Until we do, any antitrust matter \nbefore the Department of Justice will invite political maneuvering and \ngamesmanship by the affected parties, and any ultimate decision by the \nDepartment, no matter how justified on the merits, will unfairly be \nsubject to criticism.\n  Mr. Klein has, to his credit, not permitted the likelihood of such \ncriticism to deter him from leading the Department to bring closure on \ncritical matters pending before the Antitrust Division. I believe it is \nmost unfortunate that, because of this body's, the U.S. Senate's, \ndelay, Mr. Klein has been unfairly criticized for such decisions. This \ndoes a disservice to the Department as well as to those who come before \nit.\n  By urging that we move to confirm Mr. Klein, and in expressing my \nsupport for this fine nominee, I intend in no way to diminish the \nimportant issues raised by my colleague from South Carolina, and \nothers, regarding competition and antitrust policy in the \ntelecommunications field. Quite the contrary, it is my belief that \ntelecommunications competition and antitrust policy is one of the most \nimportant, yet somewhat unsettled, policy areas affecting our emerging \nand transforming economy.\n  In fact, I announce today that I plan to work in coordination with \nSenator DeWine, who chairs the Judiciary Committee's Antitrust \nSubcommittee, to explore the looming policy decisions in this area and \nthe role of the Department of Justice in the telecommunications arena. \nIn my view, there are few competitive issues which are more worthy of \nexamination than this one.\n  Notwithstanding the tremendous import of the issues raised by some of \nmy colleagues, I believe it is neither fair nor wise to hold this \nnominee and the Antitrust Division hostage because of concerns about \nhis potential positions in this very turbulent area of the law. In my \nview, sound public policy is best served by bringing this nominee up \nfor a vote, permitting the Justice Department to proceed with a \nconfirmed Chief of the Antitrust Division, and for us in Congress to \nmove forward and work with the Department and other involved agencies \nin the formulation and implementation of telecommunications policies.\n  So, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote to \nconfirm Joel Klein as Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust \nDivision.\n  I have known Mr. Klein for quite a while, and I have to say I know \nhim well. I also know his abilities well. I can also say, as someone \nwho has had a little experience in the law, that Mr. Klein will stack \nup with anybody. He is a fine nominee. I commend the President for \nhaving made this choice, for having had the foresight to put somebody \nlike this into the Justice Department.\n  I commend Mr. Klein for the work that he has done up to date, for his \nfearless work and not waiting until he is confirmed to act as the \nacting person in that Department and for the work he did prior to this \nnomination in that Department. I commend him for a lifetime of service \nto this country and to his family and to the law firms that he has \nworked with.\n  There is no question he has the academic and other credentials that \nfar exceed the academic and other credentials of many others who served \nwith distinction, who served in the Government of the United States, \nand particularly in the Justice Department.\n  So I am very happy to support his nomination. I hope that today \neverybody will support his nomination. I think it is the right thing to \ndo.\n  Again, I say, my colleague from South Carolina is sincere and \ndedicated in his effort, but I hope he will see fit to support this \nnomination as well, on the basis that he has made his case, he has made \nhis arguments, he has stood up for what he believes his principles are, \nand now it is time to support the President's nominee for this \nparticular, important position in the Antitrust Division.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, it is my hope that Joel Klein will be a \nstrong and effective advocate for competition and the interests of \nconsumers when he is confirmed as Assistant Attorney General for the \nAntitrust Division of the Department of Justice.\n  I had a close working relationship with his predecessor, Anne \nBingaman. I hope that we can develop that kind of relationship, as \nwell.\n  Mr. Klein has been buffeted a good bit since being nominated. He had \nto answer some tough questions during his nomination hearing about \napproving the Bell Atlantic-NYNEX merger without conditions. After the \nJudiciary Committee reported his nomination to the Senate on May 8, he \nresponded to a letter from Senator Burns and succeeded in convincing \nour colleague to remove his hold on this nomination. That letter and an \naddendum filed by Mr. Klein as Acting Assistant Attorney in connection \nwith the application of SBC Communications before the FCC raised \nserious concerns for a number of other Senators, however.\n  Last week the Senate proceeded by unanimous consent to consideration \nof this nomination. Until that moment, I understood there to have been \nRepublican holds against this nominee. Why the Republican leadership \nproceeded immediately upon calling up this nomination to file a cloture \npetition, they will have to explain. In fact, we had worked out a time \nagreement for the debate before the unnecessary cloture vote on Monday. \nThat agreement was confirmed by the majority and minority leaders and \npursuant thereto we are debating the nomination today.\n  In this regard, I note the consistent willingness of Senator Hollings \nto debate and vote on this nomination from the outset, and the sincere \nefforts of Senators Dorgan and Kerrey to obtain clarification of issues \nthat concern many of us.\n  I have given a good deal of thought to this nomination. I believe \nthat the Antitrust Division and the Assistant Attorney General who \nheads it are extremely important to effective enforcement of our laws \nand protection of American consumers. I have come to rely on them for \nadvice as we draft legislation and develop policies to foster \ncompetition.\n  I hope to continue to do so. I believe that the President is to be \ngiven significant deference on his selections for his Administration \nteam. The Attorney General has contacted us in support of Mr. Klein and \nhis interpretation of the law, and that means a good deal to me. As I \nconsider the legal interpretations and policies in question, I do not \nfind myself in total agreement with the Acting Assistant Attorney \nGeneral. Nonetheless, I will vote to confirm him.\n  Unlike some who have spoken in opposition to this nomination, I feel \nthat a good deal of the fault I find with Mr. Klein's positions stems \nfrom the Telecommunications Act of 1996. I worked hard to correct and \nimprove that act's weak and deferential standards for ensuring \ncompetition. In some measure we succeeded in strengthening the act, but \nother significant provisions that I supported to foster competition and \nprotect consumers were rejected. That was a principal factor in my \ndecision to vote against that act--the bill was not strong enough.\n  Others predicted that passage of the Telecommunications Act would \nlaunch an era of competition in which cable companies would compete \nwith the regional Bell operating companies for local phone service, \nlong distance companies would compete with the Bells in both local and \nlong distance services, and regional Bell operating companies would \ncompete against each other. The promise of competition was a sales \npitch but has not materialized to benefit American consumers. Instead \nof competition, we see entrenchment, mega-mergers, consolidation, and \nthe divvying up of markets.\n  I, too, hoped that the Justice Department Antitrust Division would \nact aggressively to protect consumers and foster competition. I have \nnoted my concerns during Mr. Klein's confirmation hearing in my \nquestioning of his unconditional approval of the Bell Atlantic-NYNEX \nmerger. If the current law only serves to protect against mergers that \ntend to diminish competition where it already exists, it may be\n\n[[Page S7672]]\n\ntime to amend the law to foster competition where none has existed. I \nhope that Joel Klein will help us do that.\n  I was taken aback by the language Mr. Klein used in his May 20 letter \nto Senator Burns by which he ``specifically rejected the suggestion in \nthe conference report'' on the Telecommunications Act that the 8(c) \ntest be employed. But the more that I reviewed the matter, the more I \nrealized that much of the fault lies with the conference report itself \nand the Telecommunications Act's failure to provide a definitive test.\n  I was not appointed to serve on that conference committee, although I \nwas serving as the ranking Democrat on the Antitrust Subcommittee on \nthe Judiciary Committee at the time. I would have wanted to help that \nconference incorporate a stronger test into the law. That did not \nhappen.\n  It is my hope that working with the Department of Justice we can now \nhelp ensure that the test the Attorney General has adopted--that the \nlocal market be fully and irreversibly open to competition--is a \nmeaningful standard and strong enforcement tool. If not, Congress \nshould revisit it and strengthen it.\n  I do think that Senator Hollings is correct when he criticizes the \naddendum to the Justice Department's submission in connection with the \nSBC Communications application. Both Senator Hollings and Congressman \nBliley concur as principal drafters of the law regarding their intent \nand its meaning. I trust that the Antitrust Division will review its \nposition on the proper meaning of section 271 of the Telecommunications \nAct and its requirement for competing service providers to offer \nfacilities-based services.\n  In opening the debate on this nomination, Senator Hatch cited \n``ambiguities left in the wake of the Telecommunications law'' and \n``unsettled policy areas'' and said:\n\n       But I believe it is neither fair nor wise to hold a nominee \n     hostage because of such concerns, especially one as competent \n     and decent as Joel Klein. In my view, sound public policy is \n     best served by bringing this nominee up for a vote permitting \n     the Justice Department to proceed with a confirmed chief of \n     the Antitrust Division, and for us in Congress to move \n     forward and work with the Department and other involved \n     agencies in the formulation and implementation of \n     telecommunications policies.\n\n  I agree. I look forward to the Judiciary Committee and our Antitrust \nSubcommittee exploring these important competition and antitrust policy \nmatters. I will likewise expect Senator Hatch to support other \nAdministration nominees for areas in which policies are in controversy.\n  Now that the majority leader has moved to implement his new hold \npolicy of proceeding on nominations, I trust he will not delay any \nfurther the nomination of Eric Holder to be Deputy Attorney General and \nthat he will promptly move to consideration of the judicial nominations \nreported by the Judiciary Committee over the last several weeks.\n  Some wrongly view confirmation as the end of the nominee's work with \nthe Senate. I hope that this is just the beginning of Assistant \nAttorney General Joel Klein's work with us to protect consumers and \nfoster competition. This is an awesome responsibility.\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the call of the quorum be \nrescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. KERREY. Madam President, I had a conversation with the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah who encouraged me to throw my entire \nprepared remarks away and take a gentlemanly course and support the \nnomination of Joel Klein. I have chosen not to do that. I have great \nrespect for the Senator from Utah, and I have chosen to continue to \noffer to my colleagues reasons why I have chosen to vote against Joel \nKlein, why I have chosen to oppose the nomination.\n  I like the man, I respect him, I believe he is a good individual, and \nI don't like coming here opposing a nominee that President Clinton sent \nto the Congress for confirmation. I would like very much to give him my \nunqualified support, but I simply, Madam President, cannot.\n  About a year and a half ago, many of us in this Chamber who \nparticipated in this debate over the Telecommunications Act--and I must \nsay, Madam President, one of the reasons I found myself in opposition \nto Mr. Klein is I led him to get the Department a role in the \nTelecommunications Act so that they would have some voice in \ndetermining whether or not there could be competition prior to \napproving the moving of entry from one sector to another. I fought for \nthat, and many opposed that. We ended the day and prevailed here on the \nfloor, prevailed in conference, and prevailed for final passage. It was \nsigned and made a part of the law.\n  Mr. Klein, in response to a question raised by a Member of this body \nwho actually opposed that, it seems to me in a letter gives away \nJustice's role. Now the Attorney General, Janet Reno, has written in \nresponse to our asking her if she thinks Justice has a role, has \nwritten a letter saying, indeed, she believes Justice does have a role, \nand she intends to exercise the authority the law gives her.\n  Indeed, Madam President, Mr. Klein, in meetings with me and with \nothers who were concerned about the remarks he made in this letter, has \ngiven me assurance and pointed to several cases where his actions seem \nto be very, very much procompetitor--my hope is that Mr. Klein is. As \nthe head of the Antitrust Division of Justice--I can read the tea \nleaves earlier on the cloture vote and would expect he will receive a \nfairly substantial vote, a resounding vote of support. My hope is I am \nwrong.\n  This morning in the Omaha World Herald this article appeared. The \nheadline says, ``So Far, Consumers the Losers in Battle for Dial-Tone \nDollars.''\n  Madam President, this is what Members should be concerned about, not \njust the Antitrust Division of Justice but they should also be \nconcerned about the nominees for the Federal Communications Commission \nand what they intend to do, how they intend to vote, how they intend to \nmake certain that we have competition, because unless we get \ncompetition at the local level, unless there is competition at that \nlocal level for that local dial tone, indeed for all information and \nservices at the local level, it is not likely the consumers will \nbenefit in the same ways that consumers benefited after divestiture in \n1982. Divestiture produced competition in long distance. That \ncompetition resulted in a reduction of price to the consumer and an \nimprovement of quality, as competition almost always does.\n  Without precedent, this legislation proposes to move us from a \nmonopoly at the local level--which we still have for most residential \ncustomers--from a monopoly to a competitive environment. We are not \nthere yet. We still have a monopoly. That monopoly can always, if there \nis only one choice that the consumer has, can always basically charge \nwhatever they want to charge.\n  This new legislation preempts States authorities from being able to \ndo many of the things they had done in the past. There are 358,000 \nresidential lines in the regional Bell company serving Omaha, NE. The \npresent rate for that local residential service is proposed to be \n$16.35, from a current rate of $14.90, a 9.7-percent increase, almost a \n10-percent increase from another local company that is also being \nproposed. They have that authority, now Madam President, to be able to \ncome and raise these residential rates.\n\n  It is going to be a problem for all of us if we do not get, in as \nexpeditious a way as possible, competition down to the local level. \nWhat will happen, all of us will have to be explaining why it was, in \n1996 when we debated this bill, why it was that we all promised this \nwould be great for the consumers--reduction in price, improvement in \nquality of service--why it is that they are not seeing this reduction \nin price, why it is they are seeing an increase in price instead of a \npromised reduction. The answer will be, we don't have competition yet.\n  My belief is that the Congress is going to have to think in a very \nhard and clear fashion what it is we have to do in order to make \ncertain that we\n\n[[Page S7673]]\n\nhave competition. I remember the distinguished Senator from Arizona, \nSenator McCain, as he debated this bill, and I believe he ended up \nvoting against it for precisely the same reasons I am talking about \nnow. He actually talked about lots of regulatory requirements that \ndidn't necessarily mean that we would get competition. He favored, as I \nheard him at the time, something that actually had great appeal to me, \nwhich is forget all the regulatory requirements, let's have almost a Le \nMans racing start. Set a time certain when everybody can compete, \nregardless of who they were, in everybody else's market--let's have \nthat.\n  As my colleagues will probably recall in 1996 when we were having our \ndebate, the prediction was that what we would have is the regional Bell \ncompanies competing against one another in individual markets, that we \nwould have the cable companies then competing. Since that time, what we \nhave seen is a significant amount of mergers, and I don't believe the \nkind of movement needed, with the single exception of a few companies. \nWe have seen Ameritech moving aggressively to open their market and try \nto get approval, as well to get into long distance. That is the \ntransaction that the law provides for--open up your local market and \nthen you can go into long distance service. That is the idea of the \nlaw. But it isn't happening very fast.\n  As a consequence, I don't think I will be the only Member who opens \nup their hometown newspaper and looks at the headline and sees, ``So \nfar consumers the losers in battle for dial-tone dollars.'' The reason \nthe consumers will be the losers is that the consumers in Omaha, NE, \nthe residential consumers, when it comes to dial tone, they have two \nchoices--take it or leave it. If you don't like the increase you can \nbuy your local service from nobody else. You really only have one \nchoice.\n  I say, Madam President, I will not be supporting the nomination of \nMr. Klein. I will be voting against Mr. Klein. I hope that other \nMembers who are wondering what this debate is about will give it some \nvery serious thought. They will, as well, be hearing from consumers in \nthe not-too-distant future, if they haven't already, ``I remember, \nSenator, when you were debating this. Didn't I recall you issued a \npress release saying that this legislation was going to produce lots of \nnew competition and reduction in price, and improvement and quality of \nservice? Where is the competition? I still don't see it. Where is the \npromised price reduction? Where is the promised benefits to the \nconsumers that were supposed to be coming our way at a theater near \nyou?'' Instead, what we have is price increases.\n  Mr. Klein, in his rather unfortunate, as he describes it, letter in \nresponse to a question by a Member who opposed giving the Justice \nDepartment authority over antitrust matters when it came to \ntelecommunications, Mr. Klein says today, ``Well, I didn't really mean \nall those things. I intend to be a very forceful advocate for \ncompetition.''\n  Madam President, I don't believe that is likely to happen. Mr. Klein \napproved the Bell Atlantic NYNEX merger. There were a lot of people, \nwhen this bill was being debated, that would not have stood up and \nsaid, ``The reason I am supporting this is because I hope what we get \nis the regional Bell operating companies merging with one another. I \nhope that happens. I hope we get mergers because that is exactly what \nwe need in order to get more choice.'' I don't know how that produces \nmore choice for the residential consumers in this new expanded area \nthat now a single company will have. I see decreased choice.\n  I heard a lot of people coming down and saying in fact what we are \nlikely to see is the large local monopolies competing with one another \nfor service. Though we are seeing some of it, I don't believe we are \nseeing anywhere near what we promised we were going to see, and unless \nwe get a vigorous advocate for competition in the Department of \nJustice, unless we get, as well, on the Federal Communications \nCommission, appointees who will do the same, as I said, Madam \nPresident, there will be a lot of people in this Senate as well as in \nthe House of Representatives having to explain to their consumers, to \ntheir residential consumers, just what exactly did you think was going \nto happen back in 1996?\n  So I hope that my colleagues, when they come down here to make a \ndecision about whether or not they will vote yes or no for the man who \nwill have a very significant role in determining whether or not we were \nright or wrong in 1996, I hope they give very serious consideration to \nwhether or not they believe that this individual is going to be able to \ndo what we all promised we were going to try to do when we voted for \nand took credit for this very significant piece of legislation in 1996.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, let me first thank my colleague, the \ndistinguished Senator from Nebraska. He has been very, very \nparticipatory over the years. It actually took us about 4 years to get \nthe Telecommunications Act of 1996 to a vote. On both sides of the \nCapitol and both sides of the aisle we had a very, very deliberate \ndiscussion and treatment of the particular issues involved. No one \nunderstood better the thrust of trying to deregulate and bring about \ncompetition than Senator Kerrey of Nebraska. I praise him publicly, \nonce again, for his leadership and the inclusions that he had contained \nin the final act itself.\n  Referring to that final act, Senator Kerrey tells exactly what is at \nstake here--this institution. The U.S. Senate seemingly has no \nhistorical memory. What we really had on course during the 1960's, \n1970's and early 1980's was a terrible monopolistic control of American \nTelephone & Telegraph. The fact of the matter was that they had some 12 \nparticular rulings by the Federal Communications Commission. But the \nsmart lawyers for the AT group would always put those on appeal, seek \nfurther delay, further consideration. While there were 12 orders on \ncourse at the Federal Communications Commission, mind you me, none of \nthem could get enforced. We were in an outrageous standoff in the \ncourts and at the Commission and, yes, an outrageous standoff in the \nCongress itself. We could not get a bill passed. They have that much \npolitical power. There isn't any question about it.\n  So, a very brilliant and dedicated jurist, Harold Greene of the \ncircuit court here in Washington, DC, took this matter over on a \npetition from the Justice Department for the AT breakup. In 1984, the \nmodified final judgment was handed down and the Bell companies were \nspun off on their own to begin competition, and AT itself was opened \nup for competition. That wasn't easy. I wish my friend, Bill McGowan of \nMCI was here because it was 30 years ago, practically, that he, with a \nlittle two-floor apartment down in Georgetown, with a little aerial on \ntop and three assistants, started to try to get into long distance. \nVery interestingly, the Farmer's Home finally gave him a loan. Can you \nimagine that? Competition started with a Farmer's Home loan. With that \nlittle bank, so to speak, he worked and brought some cases, he began \nnibbling away at the magnificent monopoly of AT in long distance.\n\n  Since that time, of course, the long distance market has opened up. \nYou've got MCI, Sprint, GTE, and the Brits are coming in, and the \nGermans, and all are participating--the Canadians, and otherwise. And \nso you have a very dynamic long distance market.\n  However, the monopolies at the local level persisted, and those \nmonopolies were intended for the ``public convenience and necessity''--\nthat is a phrase hardly heard in the halls of our National Government--\nin order for the advantages, the services, the opportunity, the \nadvancements to be brought onto the market and enjoyed by the public, \nwe instituted the Federal Communications Commission. We had the old \nrulings coming out with respect to getting licenses to carry, and \notherwise, at the State level, at ``public convenience and necessity.'' \nAnd we intentionally gave these seven Bell operating companies a \nmonopoly. We said: You provide the services and we will protect you so \nthat you are not bothered with the competition. On the contrary, if you \nget those services to the people, we will give you a profit that \naverages around 12 percent. Sometimes, in hearings, it went above that. \nYou find them now to have made one heck of a lot of money. But my crowd \nis down in Buenos Aires, and I just read\n\n[[Page S7674]]\n\nthis past week that Bell South is investing in Brazil, which has some \n20 million people. That is way more than the 3.6 million that we have \nin my little State of South Carolina. So more power to them. They have \nbeen well-operated. They have that monopoly. That was a big headache \nthat we had in trying to bring about deregulation, deregulation, \nderegulation.\n  This crowd up here in the House and Senate have no idea of the \nstruggle that we had and the expertise that went into the drafting of \nthis particular Telecommunications Act of 1996, to make sure that that \nmonopolistic control, that checkpoint, that bottleneck, that choke-\npoint was broken up, so that competition really could ensue. And we had \nwhat we call the ``checklist.'' And I can see that being worked on late \nnights around the clock, over Thanksgiving holidays, working, of \ncourse, with the Bell operating companies, we would meet--I forgot my \ndays now-- there was one on Friday and long distance on Monday. The \nlong distance may have been on Friday and the Bell operating companies \non Monday. But I set up a system, those years back, as the chairman of \nthe Committee of Commerce, Science, and Transportation, whereby \neverything would be operated on top of the table. We would bring all \nsides in. They would all be considered and they would be told where we \nwere and what we were negotiating and why.\n  I deemed that nothing was going to be done, because there were all \nkinds of attempts during the 1970's and 1980's--and I had learned from \nhard experience that you had to have a bipartisan bill and you had to \nhave all the parties in, and no last minute surprises, or anything of \nthat kind. So credit must be given to the various staffs on the \nRepublican and Democratic sides, working around the clock, to fathom \nthe particular provisions that are in issue in this particular \nappointment.\n  I know that some don't want to hear, and others don't care and they \ndon't listen to this particular background. But it is a very \ninteresting thing because it was worked out and finally voted upon by \n95 Republican and Democratic Senators when it passed. There was a \nstrong majority over on the House side.\n  It was a bill that, interestingly, when we finally agreed in December \nof 1995, our distinguished friend, the Vice President of the United \nStates, heard that we in conference had gotten an agreement, and he \ncame on the NBC Evening News program right in the middle of the news \nprogram. I happened to be listening when I had gotten back to the \noffice. What occurred was that Tom Brokaw said, ``Wait a minute, ladies \nand gentlemen, we have a newsbreak from the Vice President of the \nUnited States.'' I was worried that something may have occurred to the \nPresident, but it was not that at all. He came on and said, ``We \nfinally got my information superhighway agreed upon and I got \neverything I wanted. Well, this was December 1995, right after that \n1994 election. Speaker Gingrich on the House side said, ``If he got \neverything he wanted, that bill is deader than Elvis.'' The leader on \nthe Senate side, Senator Robert Dole, said, ``I am not going to call \nit.''\n\n  Of course, I had the duty, during the ensuing weeks through into \nChristmas and Christmas week, and all through the month of January, of \nholding the line.\n  I describe that to my colleagues because I want them to know that \nevery little thing in that bill was worked out with everyone and to \ntheir satisfaction and, finally, of course, to the Speaker and the \nMajority Leader Dole, because the bills were called in February of last \nyear and passed both Houses and were signed by the President.\n  Now, in coming about the breakup of the monopolies, to make sure--\nbecause you can't get competition going unless the Bell companies go \nalong. I can tell you here and now, if I ran a monopoly, I would \ncontinue investing in Buenos Aires and all like that for my \nstockholders, and what have you, and making money, and just hold on and \nappeal and drag feet and everything else.\n  Let me emphasize that is just exactly what has happened, why this \nparticular nomination ought to really be rejected. It is a sort of sad \nday when you work as hard as you do to get something done for the \nadministration, and the administration sends up an appointment of this \nkind that upsets the entire apple cart.\n  Let me tell you, Madam President, here it is, just last weekend, \n``MCI Widens Local Market; Loss Estimate,'' in the July 11 Wall Street \nJournal. Some $800 million--saying its losses from entering that \nbusiness could total $800 million this year, more than double its \noriginal estimate. Why? Because here is an analysis right here again in \nthe Wall Street Journal, over the weekend, when they announced that \ntheir shares dropped 17 percent. I only quote Chris Mines, senior \nanalyst of Forester Research, Inc., in Cambridge, MA, who said, ``MCI's \ncomplaints are totally justified. In general, I think local carriers \nare dragging their feet, using every means at their disposal to protect \ntheir monopolies.''\n  Now, Madam President, it is just not the news articles in the Wall \nStreet Journal. Take this week's Business Week magazine, on page 33, \n``Why SBC Shouldn't be the First Bell in Long Distance.'' Rather than \nreading the entire article, little squibs encapsulate those reasons. \n``How SBC keeps rivals away: one, excess charges. AT needed \ncustomized routing to provide directory assistance to its customers in \nSBC's territory. SBC's initial quote is $300 million. AT says other \nBells charge $1 million to $2 million.'' That is rather than the $300 \nmillion.\n  So it is perfectly obvious that they sit there and make this \noutrageous charge and that holds up everything. You get Senators \nrunning around, ``I don't know what is the matter with our bill. We \nwant to open up the market. Let market forces operate.'' You have \nmonopolies determined. Here is another reason here how SBC keeps rivals \naway. ``In Oklahoma, competitors must pay $19.13 per line for SBC's \nunbundled network, but SBC's retail rates are $14.34 a month.''\n  So, if they are going to charge 20 percent again more than anybody \ncoming in the market, anybody coming in the market is going broke, and \nthere is a loss by another long distance carrier. AT is trying to get \nin this market. MCI is trying to get in the other long distance market. \nThey are losing already $800 million trying to just break it.\n  Third, legal attacks. How SBC keeps rivals away. Legal attacks. SBC \nhas appealed even basic decisions by State regulators. For example, SBC \nappealed a Texas decision to let Teleport Communications Group provide \ncompeting local service. SBC contends Teleport had not met State \nstandards.\n  Madam President, I cite this from this particular article because \nit's momentary, it's timely. What really happens is not just MCI and \nAT, but others in these monopolies, with their lawyers, are bringing \ncases to test the constitutionality of the Telecommunications Act of \n1996. The one thing they said, ``Let's stop the bickering. Can't we \nwork in a bipartisan nature and get things done?'' The one thing done \nthis past Congress on a bipartisan basis was a 95 to 4 vote for the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996--totally bipartisan. I think those \nthings ought to be understood and how they came about, and how long and \nhard we worked over them.\n  Now, in getting about this particular task, I communicated with \nPresident Clinton and the White House and asked him if he could note in \na letter just exactly what his concerns were. I want to make sure staff \ngets copies of every one of these because they are not getting my file. \nAnd every time I get ready to talk, I just need a few notes. I can't \neven get a few notes. They are back there hidden away. So you get your \ncopies.\n  Remember this: I have a White House letter, Madam President, dated \nOctober 26, 1995, from President Clinton. I ask unanimous consent that \nthis letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 26, 1995.\n     Hon. Ernest F. Hollings,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n         Transportation, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Fritz: I enjoyed our telephone conversation today \n     regarding the upcoming conference on the telecommunications \n     reform bill and would like to follow-up on your request \n     regarding the specific issues of concern to me in the \n     proposed legislation.\n       As I said in our discussion, I am committed to promoting \n     competition in every aspect of\n\n[[Page S7675]]\n\n     the telecommunications and information industries. I believe \n     that the legislation should protect and promote diversity of \n     ownership and opinions in the mass media, should protect \n     consumers from unjustified rate increases for cable and \n     telephone services, and, in particular, should include a test \n     specifically designed to ensure that the Bell companies \n     entering into long distance markets will not impede \n     competition.\n       Earlier this year, my Administration provided comments on \n     S. 652 and H.R. 1555 as passed. I remain concerned that \n     neither bill provides a meaningful role for the Department of \n     Justice in safeguarding competition before local telephone \n     companies enter new markets. I continue to be concerned that \n     the bills allow too much concentration within the mass media \n     and in individual markets, which could reduce the diversity \n     of news and information available to the public. I also \n     believe that the provisions allowing mergers of cable and \n     telephone companies are overly broad. In addition, I oppose \n     deregulating cable programming services and equipment rates \n     before cable operators face real competition. I remain \n     committed, as well, to the other concerns contained in those \n     earlier statements on the two bills.\n       I applaud the Senate and the House for including provisions \n     requiring all new televisions to contain technology that will \n     allow parents to block out programs with violent or \n     objectionable content. I strongly support retention in the \n     final bill of the Snowe-Rockefeller provision that will \n     ensure that schools, libraries and hospitals have access to \n     advanced telecommunications services.\n       I look forward to working with you and your colleagues \n     during the conference to produce legislation that effectively \n     addresses these concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Clinton.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, I quote the second paragraph:\n\n       As I said in our discussion, I am committed to promoting \n     competition in every aspect of the telecommunications and \n     information industries. I believe that the legislation should \n     protect and promote diversity of ownership and opinions in \n     the mass media, should protect consumers from unjustified \n     rate increases for cable and telephone services and, in \n     particular, should include a test specifically designed to \n     ensure that the bell companies entering into long distance \n     markets will not impede competition.\n\n  I emphasize this because I had the charge from the President himself. \nNow you have the President's nominee coming and refuting all of that, \nbecause if you want to know where rates will increase, instead of \ncompetition, we are going to get consolidation, and instead of a \ncompetitive place in the market, you are going to get fixes all around. \nThis crowd has been operating monopolies for, lo, decades upon decades. \nThey know how to do it. They have a hard time learning.\n  AT in the 1980's pared down by a third the size of AT after the \nmodified final judgment in 1984. But they made twice the profit after \nthey finally learned how to compete. Our friends, the Bells, have yet \nto come and learn that. In fact, I strongly advised from these \nhappenings that they have no idea of competing; they have every idea of \nholding onto the monopoly as long as they can.\n  Madam President, ``If we can get an Assistant Attorney General or \nDeputy Attorney General''--whatever you want to call Mr. Joel Klein--\n``in our camp, rather we can hold on and continue making out like \ngangbusters for years to come.''\n  Now, as a result of the President's letter, we finally have section \n271(c)(1)(A) of the Telecommunications Act, and I ask that the \nstatement under ``presence of the facilities-based competitor, \nincluding both residential and business subscribers, having a \nfacilities-based competitor for both business and residential''--which \nwas proscribed in this law, and there are no ifs, ands and buts how it \nis written--I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record, \njust that section is necessary and not the entire act, of course.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       (A) Presence of a facilities-based competitor.--A Bell \n     operating company meets the requirements of this subparagraph \n     if it has entered into one or more binding agreements that \n     have been approved under section 252 specifying the terms and \n     conditions under which the Bell operating company is \n     providing access and interconnection to its network \n     facilities for the network facilities of one or more \n     unaffiliated competing providers of telephone exchange \n     service (as defined in section 3(47)(A), but excluding \n     exchange access) to residential and business subscribers. For \n     the purpose of this subparagraph, such telephone exchange \n     service may be offered by such competing providers either \n     exclusively over their own telephone exchange service \n     facilities or predominantly over their own telephone exchange \n     facilities in combination with the resale of the \n     telecommunications services of another carrier. For the \n     purpose of this subparagraph, services provided pursuant to \n     subpart K of part 22 of the Commission's regulations (47 \n     C.F.R. 22.901 et seq.) shall not be considered to be \n     telephone exchange services.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, we had a glowing candidate for the \nActing Assistant Attorney General in Joel Klein on March 11, 1997. He \nwent down to a class, a legal work seminar, on March 11, and the title \nof the seminar was ``Preparing for Competition in a Deregulated \nTelecommunications Market.''\n  Joel Klein, on page 9, I read here, and I quote: ``Now let me add a \nfew words about how we will apply this standard to our BOC applications \nunder section 271 of the act. Our preference, though we recognize that \nit may not always occur, is to see actual broad-based business and \nresidential entry into a local market.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that this particular speech be printed in the \nRecord in its entirety. So I am not quoting out of context.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Preparing for Competition in a Deregulated Telecommunications Market\n\n    (By Joel I. Klein, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Antitrust \n                 Division, U.S. Department of Justice)\n\n       First, I want to say that I'm delighted to be here today \n     and I'm grateful to Joe Sims and Phil Verveer for having \n     invited me. I can tell from reading the program and looking \n     at the impressive array of speakers that this has been a \n     comprehensive and informative conference on some cutting-edge \n     issues in the communications industry. In fact, when I \n     realized that I was going to be the last person to speak I \n     was reminded of Adlai Stevenson's quip in a similar situation \n     when he said, ``We're at the point in the program where \n     everything that could be said has been said but, \n     unfortunately, not everyone has had a chance to say it.'' So, \n     I'm especially appreciative that so many of you have stayed \n     around to hear my closing remarks and I hope that, despite \n     the odds, I may be able to add something to the overall \n     discussion.\n       Let me start by stating the obvious: what we're going \n     through right now in the communications field is truly \n     extraordinary. Technology, globalization, and last year's \n     legislative, executive, and administrative actions have come \n     together to create an environment of rapid change, great \n     opportunity, and considerable risk. We all know that ten \n     years from now things will be very different in the \n     communications industry; we just don't know how they'll \n     differ. From our perspective at the Antitrust Division, we \n     have one, overarching goal--to maximize competition. To be \n     more concrete about that, as I see it, the ideal result would \n     be a variety of different conduits--be it wire, wireless, \n     cable, or what have you--that link people with all kinds of \n     content--be it voice, video, audio, computer, and so on. But \n     envisioning an ultimately desirable competitive market \n     structure is not the difficult part here: what's really hard \n     is how we get there in a market that's transitioning from \n     regulation to competition. And that is the journey that we in \n     the Antitrust Division have embarked upon--at a somewhat \n     dizzying pace. I might add, since the passage of the 1996 \n     Telecom Act a little more than a year ago.\n       Before I focus in on some of the specifics, let me give you \n     a sense of the breadth of what we're dealing with. In the \n     first place, we've seen a flood of radio mergers now that the \n     1996 Act has authorized far more liberal ownership rules. I'm \n     advised that there have been over a thousand such mergers in \n     the past year and about 150 of them have been brought before \n     the Division, principally through the hart-Scott-Rodino \n     process, but also through independent inquiry in several non-\n     reportable transactions. We've conducted extensive \n     investigations in many of these cases and, to date, we've \n     sought divestitures in a handful of mergers. And while that's \n     important in terms of the economy the real story here is how \n     much concentration is occurring. In short, the concentration \n     envisioned by Congress is taking place, no doubt allowing the \n     industry to achieve some important efficiencies. And so long \n     as this consolidation doesn't erode competitive opportunities \n     in any market--and, with the application of sound antitrust \n     principles as a guide. I don't think it will--then these \n     mergers may ultimately strengthen the position of radio in \n     the overall communications industry. And, frankly, that's all \n     to the good.\n       Beyond radio, we're also experiencing consolidation in \n     other areas of the communications industry. The FCC is still \n     evaluating what limits to place on broadcast ownership but, \n     in other areas, we've already seen significant movement. \n     There's been a major Bell Company/cable merger--U.S. West/\n     Continental Cable--which the Division cleared with some \n     modification to the original deal. And we've also seen three \n     major telephone mergers--SBC/Pactel, which we cleared without \n     objection several months ago, and Bell Atlantic/NYNEX and \n     MCI/British Telecom,\n\n[[Page S7676]]\n\n     which are both still pending before us. These cases raise \n     important questions about potential competition, and also \n     about international interconnection where market conditions \n     may differ significantly in different countries and we have \n     expended, and will continue to expend, considerable time and \n     energy analyzing them and other such mergers that may come \n     before us in the future.\n       Now, in the time that remains, I'd like to focus in on one \n     particularly challenging aspect of this journey through the \n     communications industry and that is the deregulation of \n     telephone services in this country. This was probably the \n     most significant part of the 1996 Act and it raises \n     enormously difficult questions, questions that we at the \n     Division have, to some degree, been dealing with under the \n     Modified Final Judgment, or the ``MFJ,'' that resulted in the \n     break-up of AT and the creation of seven Regional Bell \n     Operating Companies, or ``RBOCs,'' as they are called, with \n     severe restrictions on what they could do beyond providing \n     local telephony within their own service areas. As a result \n     of that lawsuit, there can be little doubt that the Nation \n     has seen significantly improved long distance competition, \n     accompanied by the innovation and downward pressure on prices \n     that results from such competition. That is not to say that \n     everything's perfect in long distance--even more competition \n     would certainly be welcome--but it's important to recognize \n     how far we have come when we have three well-established \n     competitors, hundreds of other resellers, and four fiber-\n     optic systems wiring the country, with a fifth in progress. I \n     can tell you from my personal dealings with officials from \n     other countries that, as a result of the AT case, the U.S. \n     is positioned for global competition in a way that is the \n     envy of our current trading partners--whose telephone \n     companies will be our future competitors, I might add.\n       But now we are charged with taking the next steps--in \n     particular, the Congress, together with the leadership \n     provided by the Clinton Administration, established a \n     statutory framework that is designed to open up local \n     telephone markets to competition and that would allow the \n     local companies to move into in-region, long distance service \n     for the first time. The goal of this process is to have full-\n     scale competition in telephony throughout the nation. In a \n     nutshell, consumers should have as many as possible, but at \n     least several local options, long distance options, and, \n     ultimately, combined local and long distance options (one-\n     stop shopping, if you will). Once again, knowing where we \n     want to get is the easy part: it's getting there that's hard. \n     And to accomplish that goal, the statute puts in place a \n     variety of interrelated steps and assigns responsibility to \n     three separate agencies--the FCC, the various state \n     regulatory commissions, and the Department of Justice. This \n     mix of players, I would suggest, sensibly reflects the fact \n     that telephone regulation has historically been a shared \n     function of the FCC and the state agencies and, quite \n     naturally, both of them are necessary to the deregulatory \n     process as well. And we also belong there, essentially \n     because the goal of the process is competition and we have \n     expertise in that area generally and with respect to \n     telephony, in particular, because of our extensive \n     involvement in the AT case.\n       The vision of the 1996 Act was premised on a simple \n     formula: if the regulatory environment were different, the \n     market for local telephone service--previously thought to be \n     a ``natural monopoly''--would be subject to the discipline of \n     competition, bringing down prices and increasing quality and \n     choices for consumers. On this point, there was widespread \n     agreement, supported by the experience of several states in \n     paving the way for competition in the market for local \n     telephone service. Building on that experience in 1995, the \n     Antitrust Division, along with Ameritech, AT, and many \n     other parties proposed, on a trial basis, a waiver of the \n     MFJ, allowing Ameritech to offer in-region, long distance \n     service in return for compliance with some measures designed \n     to open its local market to competition and a demonstration \n     that actual competitive opportunities were expanding. This \n     proposed waiver, like the 1996 Act, contemplated the creation \n     of new, facilities-based, local service as a way to bring \n     real competition to the local telephone market. The Act seeks \n     to do this on a much broader scale, and in so doing, calls \n     for a series of transitional steps. Getting these steps right \n     is no easy task, and although they may not immediately lead \n     to the type of comprehensive facilities-based service that \n     we hope to see over time, we all realize that we should \n     not let the perfect be the enemy of the good here.\n       As I see it then, implementing the deregulatory vision set \n     out in the 1996 Act involves four basic things: (1) a set of \n     rules that will allow new entrants into local markets--the \n     so-called interconnection rules adopted by the FCC last \n     August and which have now been stayed in significant part by \n     the Eighth Circuit: (2) another set of provisions that \n     establish the criteria necessary to facilitate local \n     competition and with which the RBOCs must comply before they \n     are allowed to provide long distance and one-stop shopping \n     services: (3) access reform, designed to reduce the price \n     paid to local carriers for originating and terminating long \n     distance calls so that this price will reflect the actual \n     cost of providing the service: and (4) a universal service \n     plan that will eventually replace the implicit subsidies \n     contained within the current regulated telephone service \n     system with explicit and competitively neutral subsidies. As \n     to this last point, I should quickly explain that the current \n     system requires some users to pay above-cost rates to \n     subsidize other users who are served at rates below cost: the \n     1996 Act calls for these implicit subsidies to be made \n     explicit and to be paid for through a competitively neutral \n     universal service fund. Until we fully implement this \n     mandate, some local exchange carriers (or LECs, as they are \n     called) may be required to bear the costs of serving these \n     customers at uneconomic rates and/or we will continue to see \n     inefficient pricing and entry signals which will tend to \n     distort competitive opportunities and thereby hurt consumers.\n       Now, as I see it, the paradox of this kind of deregulatory \n     effort is that it depends upon a series of regulatory steps--\n     all taken, to be sure, in the name of deregulation--and those \n     regulatory steps, in turn, can significantly affect the long-\n     term prospects for full-scale competition in telephony. There \n     is no formula or equation that one can look to in order to \n     get these things right. They involve the exercise of \n     discretion by government agencies, which in turn requires \n     careful, sound judgments. And, given that these predictive \n     judgments are necessarily based on incomplete information, we \n     should all be somewhat humble in second-guessing those who \n     have to make the calls. Interestingly, the Fifth Circuit, \n     quoting Justice Cardozo, made just this point about a quarter \n     of a century ago in a case evaluating an FCC regulation \n     prohibiting telephone companies from offering cable service \n     in their regions, explaining that: ``[i]n a complex and \n     dynamic industry such as the communications field, it cannot \n     be expected that the agency charged with its regulation will \n     have perfect clairvoyance. Indeed, Justice Cardozo once said, \n     `Hardship must at times result from postponement of the rule \n     of action till a time when action is complete. It is one of \n     the consequences of the limitations of the human intellect \n     and of the denial to legislators and judges of infinite \n     prevision.' '' \\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ General Telephone Co. of Southwest v. United States, 449 \n     F.2d 846, 863 (5th Cir. 1971) (quoting Benjamin Cardozo. The \n     Nature of the Judicial Process 145 (1921)).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Against the backdrop of this call for humility, let me now \n     go on to highlight the problems in making the necessary \n     regulatory judgments by examining the four transitional steps \n     that I just mentioned. First, in order to get even some local \n     competition, at least for some period of time, competing \n     carriers will have to either purchase service from the LEC at \n     wholesale and attempt to compete with the same LEC by \n     reselling at retail or it will have to use the LEC's \n     facilities--switches, loops, and the like--in whole or in \n     part. In either case, someone has to set a price for the \n     product--be it wholesale service or the unbundled elements. \n     That price in turn can have important repercussions--set too \n     high, it can unfairly burden new entrants and make local \n     competition impossible; and set too low, it can give new \n     entrants a competitive advantage at the expense of the \n     incumbent LEC. What this all means is not just that one of \n     these companies may make a little (or even a lot) more than \n     the other but that long-term competitive conditions can be \n     seriously affected by these pricing decisions. This \n     particular concern has led to the Eighth Circuit litigation \n     in which the incumbent LECs are challenging the FCC's pricing \n     methodology (as well as the Commission's authority to impose \n     a certain pricing methodology to begin with). Fortunately, at \n     least from our point of view, most of the States have \n     followed the Commission's pricing methodology and so, while \n     the litigation goes forward, the actual prices for wholesale \n     and unbundled elements may not be materially different \n     regardless of who ultimately prevails in the Eighth Circuit. \n     I say that's fortunate from our point of view because we \n     supported the FCC's approach as a sound pricing methodology \n     for stimulating efficient local entry.\n       The second area where some difficult regulatory decisions \n     must be made in this deregulatory process has to do with the \n     issue of when a particular RBOC is permitted to enter the \n     long distance market. Under the statute, this is a state-by-\n     state determination, made by the FCC, with key inputs from \n     the state regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice. \n     Here, too, you can readily see the significance of the trade-\n     offs in the regulatory decision. If you let the RBOC into \n     long distance prematurely, two bad things can happen. First, \n     you may undermine the chance to ensure a competitive local \n     market since once in long distance, the RBOC's incentive to \n     cooperate with its competitors will diminish--if not \n     altogether, at least significantly. And second and \n     derivatively, a premature entry into in-region, long distance \n     service gives the RBOC an unfair advantage in the offering of \n     one-stop shopping since it can readily combine its local \n     service with one of several long distance services easily \n     available to it in the marketplace, while its potential \n     competitors may not have nearly so easy a time \n     combining their long distance service with local service \n     that has heretofore been unavailable to them. On the other \n     hand, if you keep the RBOC out of long distances for too \n     long a period, you risk giving the long distance carriers \n     an undue competitive benefit, since only they are able to \n     offer customers both local and long distance service for \n     the period of time that the RBOC is denied entry, thereby \n     giving them a first mover advantage. Not surprisingly in \n     this environment both kinds\n\n[[Page S7677]]\n\n     of carriers--local and long distance--feel very strongly \n     about the timing of RBOC entry into long distance, even to \n     the point of purchasing significant advertising to make \n     their respective cases.\n       For our part at the Antirust Division the issue of RBOC \n     entry into long distance has been a special focus. Under the \n     statute, we are expressly charged with evaluating each of the \n     fifty state applications and our competitive assessment must \n     be given ``substantial weight'' by the FCC. What is probably \n     most notable about the process is that we are authorized to \n     make our assessment ``using any standard the Attorney General \n     considers appropriate.'' Now, given that broad swath the \n     first thing we needed to do is to establish a concrete \n     standard so that applicants would know in advance how we'd be \n     evaluating them. We also needed to relate our standard to the \n     other, specific provisions of the statute--such as the 14-\n     point checklist the Section 272 separate-subsidiary \n     requirements, and the Track A and Track B entry provisions, \n     as well as the public interest test that the FCC is charged \n     with applying. In order to meet this challenge, we engaged in \n     an extensive inquiry, soliciting comments from all interested \n     parties and meeting with virtually all the affected players. \n     We received almost seventy-five comments and have met with \n     countless industry officials.\n       The upshot of this process has been to reach the following \n     conclusion: Our basic standard is that before an RBOC should \n     be allowed to enter long distance, it must be able to \n     demonstrate that its market is truly open (which, I should \n     make clear, is different from saying its market is fully \n     competitive). Before I put meat on the bones of that standard \n     let me first say how we think it integrates with the \n     remainder of Section 271. We believe that the other \n     provisions--the checklist the facilities-based requirement \n     the separate-subsidiary requirement and the option of Track \n     B--are all necessary, though not sufficient, to support \n     entry. These requirements, almost as their names imply, \n     involves fixed points but, by themselves are not sufficiently \n     dynamic to ensure that real competition can take place. \n     That's where we think our approach comes into play; we view \n     it as the dynamic part of the equation looking to ensure that \n     the wholesale support systems for opening up local markets \n     are not simply claimed to be in place, but that they will \n     actually work in fact are scalable, and have been \n     beachmarked, so that competition will be real and not marely \n     theortical. We think this approach is the best way to ensure \n     competitive effectiveness which we take to be our express \n     charge under the statute and we think it dovetails nicely \n     with the ``public interest'' standard that the FCC is charged \n     with applying in making the ultimate decision under 271 \n     whether to approve a particular application. More broadly, we \n     believe that our approach fits well within the overall \n     statutory scheme adopted by Congress, nicely blending the \n     fixed and dynamic requirements to reach an effective result.\n       Now, let me add a few words about how we will apply this \n     standard to RBOC applications under Section 271 of the Act \n     Our preference, though we recognize that it may not always \n     occur, is to see actual broad-based--ie, business and \n     residential--entry into a local market. This kind of entry \n     requires not only appropriate agreements between the RBOCs \n     and their potential competitors, but also the wholesale \n     support systems necessary to ensure that when a current \n     customer is switched from the RBOC to the new competitor, \n     the switching process occurs quickly and effectively, so \n     that the customer is satisfied and its new phone company \n     is not blamed for messing up the transfer--or that, after \n     a customer has been switched and she needs any services, \n     such as repair of her phone line, she gets it from the \n     RBOC in a timely and effective manner. The truth is that, \n     no matter how effectively systems are designed and even \n     assuming complete good faith on the part of the RBOC, this \n     kind of transition can have a lot of bugs in it. Once we \n     see successful full-scale entry, however, then we will \n     have reason to believe that the local market is open to \n     competition. This approach doesn't require the shift of \n     any particular amount of market share; nor should it take \n     very long once there is true broad-based entry into the \n     RBOC's market. Rather, using a metaphor that I've become \n     quite fond of, we just want to make sure that gas actually \n     can flow through the pipeline; and the best way to do that \n     is to see it happen.\n       This approach--i.e., looking for tangible entry--also has \n     two additional virtues: first, once there is such entry, the \n     new entrant certainly should have an incentive to make the \n     process work, since any new customers that are ill-served \n     will blame the new entrant. This will mean that the new \n     entrant is not likely to be gaming the system and, if there \n     are problems, the reason will be that the local market, for \n     some real-world reason--malign or benign--just isn't ready \n     for competition yet. And second, if broad-based competition \n     appears to be working smoothly, as we certainly hope it does, \n     it will establish a benchmark against which future, post-RBOC \n     entry into long distance, performance can be measured. In \n     other words, if competitors can obtain what they need, and \n     what they are legally entitled to get from the RBOC prior to \n     its entry into long distance, but not after it then we will \n     have reason to suspect that something is wrong and we will be \n     able to pursue appropriate remedial action.\n       Now, an even harder problem arises when the RBOC claims \n     that it's done everything it can to make entry opportunities \n     fully available but, for some reasons, no new entrant has \n     decided to go forward in a significant way. In these \n     circumstances, we will attempt to determine what the problem \n     is. And, purely at the level of speculation, one could \n     imagine a variety of explanations. For example, the prices \n     being charged by the RBOC could be too high to allow \n     effective competition any time soon or its systems may be too \n     uncertain for the new entrant to take the risk of large-scale \n     entry, or the RBOC may not be cooperating with its \n     competitors by providing the necessary wholesale support \n     systems. One the other hand, it may be that, despite \n     reasonable interconnection terms, fully available support \n     systems, and so on, it simply may not make economic sense for \n     a new entrant to come into any given market on a large-scale \n     basis. Or, a more elaborate version of this problem may be \n     that, if the long distance carriers think they are better off \n     preventing the new competition by the RBOC in their market \n     and also think that the best way to achieve this result is to \n     stay out of the local markets, they may simply choose not to \n     enter. On the third hand, if you will, it may be that some \n     other factor--such as a state statute or local regulation--is \n     making large-scale entry infeasible or, at least, very \n     unattractive. These are some possibilities, and I'm sure \n     there are others as well.\n       In any event, we will carefully examine the facts in any \n     case where there isn't full-scale entry to determine what's \n     actually going on. In such circumstances, of course, we will \n     ultimately have to make a fact-based determination on a case-\n     by-case basis. But I want to be very clear about one thing: \n     we will pay careful attention to see whether any party is \n     trying to game the system for its own parochial reasons. And, \n     if we think that's what's going on, be assured that we'll \n     take appropriate action. We don't have any dog in this \n     fight--just a desire to ensure full-scale competition in \n     telephony in an enduring fashion. Once that occurs, the \n     market can pick the winners and losers.\n       Let me now quickly turn to the last couple pieces of this \n     deregulatory puzzle--access reform and universal service. \n     These areas, which are related, also raise long-term \n     competitive concerns. Lowering access charges to cost is \n     desirable in a competitive market but, in the process, there \n     are at least a couple of things you need to be alert to--\n     first, you want to ensure that no one gets an undue \n     competitive advantage during the transition process: and \n     second, you need to make sure that the incumbent LEC is \n     fairly compensation for any implicit subsidies in the system \n     that it has to bear and which have previously been supported \n     by above-cost access charges. That is where the universal \n     service funding system kicks in. It is designed to pick up \n     these kinds of subsidies so that, as I said earlier, \n     competition can go forward without unfairly burdening those \n     players that have to bear the costs of such subsidies.\n       These kinds of issues can be enormously complex--first, how \n     do you sort out implicit subsidies as well as any historic \n     costs that a LEC is entitled to recover in a way that is fair \n     and, second, how do you then collect the money necessary to \n     pay these costs through a competitively neutral system. If \n     you've seen the FCC's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Access \n     Charges--a rulemaking that is ongoing as we speak--you \n     probably have some idea of how complicated this whole process \n     is. The Commission has raised important questions about rate \n     structure, about rate levels--including possible market-based \n     as well as prescriptive methods for dealing with these \n     levels--and about rate de-averaging, which means allowing \n     different access charges for different customers. Anyway, the \n     trick is to do this in a way that hastens competitive \n     opportunities but that is fair to all parties. I am confident \n     that the Commission will do just that.\n       One final point to remember as we move into a deregulated \n     environment is that the Telecom Act explicitly keeps the \n     antitrust laws in force. This serves not only to guard \n     against any anticompetitive consolidation, but also against \n     any other practices that violate the antitrust laws. Once \n     regulation begins moving off center stage, we are prepared \n     for the possibility that antitrust enforcement may be \n     necessary to ensure full and fair competition in these \n     markets. Especially in network industries, questions of \n     exclusive dealing, control over essential facilities and the \n     use of market power can raise significant antitrust concerns. \n     As a result I intend to make sure that the Division keeps \n     fully abreast of the developments in the marketplace and is \n     ready to take any action necessary to prevent abuses of \n     market power or other anticompetitive practices.\n       Let me close my emphasizing that while I've tried to \n     accurately portray at least some of the difficulties set in \n     motion by last year's Telcom Act I'm very optimistic about \n     the endeavor we have embarked upon. I've seen some recent \n     stories in the press complaining that consumers haven't yet \n     received the benefits of the 1996 Act but frankly, I think \n     such expectations are unrealistic. We've had a regulated \n     system of telephony in this country for over a century; it \n     won't be deregulated in a year and even after it is \n     deregulated, it'll take time for competition to wring all the \n     fat out of the system so that consumers truly get the best \n     service at the lowest prices. But, if we stay the course, I'm \n     confident that we will ultimately realize how wise this \n     legislation was and how much it will benefit our people. I \n     say that because\n\n[[Page S7678]]\n\n     history has taught us, time and time again, that deregulation \n     is difficult and transitions can be costly, but if our \n     Nation's economy is to be as strong as it can be--indeed, as \n     strong as it must be in an increasingly globalized market--\n     deregulation is not only desirable, it's essential. In short, \n     history is on our side. A little patience is all that's \n     needed.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished Chair.\n  Madam President, it is very interesting. I want to refer back to this \nbecause that is in regular type. ``Though we may recognize that it may \nnot always occur''--``though we recognize that it may not always \noccur.'' We are going to refer back to that in just a few minutes \nbecause our distinguished chairman of the Communications Subcommittee, \nSenator Conrad Burns, of Montana, wrote Mr. Joel Klein on May 15, 1997.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this letter be printed in the \nRecord in its entirety.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 15, 1997.\n     Mr. Joel I. Klein,\n     Acting Assistant Attorney General,\n     Antitrust Division,\n     Department of Justice,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Klein: I have written to the Senate Majority \n     Leader requesting that a hold be placed on your nomination to \n     be Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department's \n     Antitrust Division. I have concerns as to whether your views \n     of the implementation of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 \n     are in accordance with Congressional intent.\n       Section 271(d)(2)(A) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 \n     gives the Department of Justice a consultative role when the \n     Federal Communications Commission considers petitions filed \n     by the Bell Operating Companies (BOCs) for authorization to \n     provide in-region interLATA service. This summer the FCC will \n     begin ruling on these applications and I have several \n     concerns about how both the Department and the FCC will \n     implement Section 271 of the Act. As you know, both the House \n     and the Senate, in establishing a test for BOC entry into the \n     interLATA business, rejected the imposition of any \n     requirement that a BOC must face ``actual and demonstrable \n     competition'' in the local exchange market before obtaining \n     relief. While the statute allows the Department to apply \n     ``any standard the Attorney General considers appropriate'', \n     a speech you gave in March raises fears the Department and \n     the FCC may attempt to resurrect this test that was rejected \n     in Congress.\n       My concern arises particularly from your March 11 speech \n     announcing the Antitrust Division's position regarding \n     implementation of Section 271 of the Telecommunications Act \n     of 1996 (47 U.S.C. Section 271). You stated that the Division \n     would take the position that the BOCs should be forbidden to \n     enter long distance under Section 271 until there is \n     ``successful full-scale entry'' into the local market. As you \n     put it, the point of this requirement is to be sure that with \n     respect to local telephone services, ``gas naturally can flow \n     through the pipeline.'' I also read your speech as suggesting \n     that where there has not been full-scale entry, you would \n     oppose BOC entry unless the BOC could show that its \n     competitors are ``gaming the system.''\n       You have suggested that Section 271 gives you ``broad \n     swath'' to urge whatever position the Antitrust Division \n     likes. Congress, however, gave the Attorney General a role in \n     advising the FCC with respect to public interest issues \n     because of the Department's antitrust expertise. See, for \n     example, Sen. Conf. Rep. 104-230 for a list of some antitrust \n     standards that might be used. A ``gas in the pipeline'' \n     standard is plainly unrelated to the antitrust laws and, even \n     worse, violates congressional intent that the checklist \n     should be the only measure of when local markets are open. \n     Simply stated, the Attorney General's consultation on \n     antitrust issues must be framed by the specific statutory \n     standards for BOC entry, which preclude anything approaching \n     a ``metric test'' like the one Congress rejected.\n       More fundamentally, the basic point of the \n     Telecommunications Act is that regulators should stand aside \n     and let market forces work once fair competition is possible. \n     Holding up competition in one market because there is not \n     enough competition in another market makes no sense. It is \n     particularly harmful in this context, for local telephone \n     competition may be slow in coming to rural states for reasons \n     that have nothing to do with BOCs' steps to satisfy the \n     checklist. If so, your approach would prevent rural consumers \n     from realizing the benefits of long distance competition that \n     will be available to residents of urban states, just because \n     potential local competitors want to enter profitable urban \n     markets first.\n       As you prepare to discharge your responsibilities under the \n     Act, I would appreciate your answers to the following \n     questions. This will enable the Subcommittee on \n     Communications to carefully monitor implementation of this \n     portion of the Telecommunications Act.\n       1. In your speech you used the following terms--``real'' \n     and ``broad-based competitions'', ``actual, broad-based \n     entry'', ``true broad-based-entry'', ``tangible entry'', \n     ``large-scale entry'', and entry on a ``large-scale basis''. \n     What do these terms mean to the Department?\n       2. How many residential customers have to be served by a \n     competitor to meet the Department's entry test?\n       3. How many business customers have to be served by a \n     competitor to meet the Department's entry test?\n       4. Does there have to be more than one competitor in the \n     local exchange market to meet the Department's entry test?\n       5. Does a BOC have to face competition from AT, MCI or, \n     Sprint to meet the Department's entry test?\n       6. How do you reconcile Congress' rejection of a metric \n     test for BOC entry into the long distance market with our \n     statement that ``successful full-scale entry'' is necessary \n     in order for the Department to ``believe the local market is \n     open to competition?''\n       7. You have used the metaphor that the Department ``want(s) \n     to make sure that gas actually can flow through the \n     pipeline'' before allowing interLATA entry. How many orders \n     for resold services must be processed by a BOC in order to \n     satisfy this standard?\n       8. How many orders for unbundled network elements must be \n     processed by a BOC to satisfy this standard?\n       9. How much market share must a BOC lose to its competitors \n     to demonstrate that ``gas can flow through the pipeline?''\n       10. FCC Chairman Reed Hundt testified on March 12, 1997, \n     before the Senate Commerce Committee that a BOC that \n     satisfied the checklist but did not have an actual competitor \n     in its market would meet the entry standard. Do you agree \n     with Chairman Hundt?\n       11. If the Department opposes a BOC interLATA application, \n     do you believe the FCC should reject that application? If so, \n     wouldn't that give the Department's recommendation \n     ``preclusive effect,'' something that the Act specifically \n     prohibited?\n       12. You have also stated that the checklist, the \n     facilities-based requirement, the separate subsidiary \n     requirement and the option of ``Track B'' (the statement of \n     terms and conditions) are all ``necessary, though not \n     sufficient, to support entry. What more must a BOC \n     demonstrate to obtain the Department's support?\n       13. Do you believe that Track B can be used only if no one \n     has requested interconnection under Track A?\n       14. Can a BOC rely on Track B if it has received \n     interconnection requests from potential competitors but faces \n     no ``competing provider'' which is actually providing \n     telephone exchange service to residential and business \n     customers predominantly over its own facilities?\n       15. What if requesting interconnectors under Track A do not \n     ask for, or wish to pay for, all of the items in the \n     checklist? Can the BOC satisfy the entry test by \n     supplementing their interconnection agreements with a filing \n     under Track B to cover at least all remaining items in the \n     checklist?\n       Your prompt attention to these questions would be helpful \n     to the Subcommittee.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Conrad Burns,\n\n                                                         Chairman,\n                            Senate Subcommittee on Communications.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, you can read the entire letter. But I \ncan see the thrust of the letter by this language here, and I quote on \npage 2.\n\n       Congress, however, gave the Attorney General a role in \n     advising the FCC with respect to public interest issues \n     because of the Department's antitrust expertise. See, for \n     example, House conference report 104-458 for a list of some \n     antitrust standards that might be used. A gas-in-the-pipeline \n     standard is plainly unrelated to antitrust laws, and, even \n     worse, violates Congressional intent that the checklist \n     should be the only measure of when local markets are open.\n\n  We in the majority who wrote this particular bill would demur very, \nvery strongly from that wording by our distinguished friend, the \nSenator from Montana, in this particular letter.\n  What occurred is that the nominee, Joel Klein, in the talk, he talked \nabout you can see when competition is present, when you get to see the \ngas coming through the pipeline. He alludes to the anecdotal situation \nof gas pipeline cases.\n  But Senator Burns differs with that. He says you are supposed to \nhandle this antitrust, and don't give us anything about when \ncompetition starts. You can tell his displeasure because, along with \nthe letter, he put a hold on the Joel Klein nomination. You have a hold \non the nomination by the chairman of the Communications Subcommittee, \nand you got a strong letter with a questionnaire that is included, \nbecause I have included it in its entirety in the Record.\n  So 5 days later, on May 20, the Department of Justice, Acting \nAssistant Attorney General Joel Klein sends a letter to Senator Burns.\n  Madam President, I quote:\n\n       To begin with, I wholeheartedly agree with your statement \n     that the basic point of the\n\n[[Page S7679]]\n\n     Telecommunications Act is that regulators should stand aside \n     and let market forces work once fair competition is possible. \n     I want to assure you that the Department of Justice shares \n     that view.\n\n  Well, both distinguished gentlemen are writing and speaking \ncolloquially. One wants to tell you that competition is present when \nyou can see the gas coming through the pipeline, or smell the gas if \nyou can't see it. Otherwise, the Acting Assistant Attorney General \nsaid, ``Oh, yes, I want to let'' --in the Conrad letter, all these \nexpressions about ``let market forces.'' What we are trying to do is \n``let market forces.'' He said, ``I agree with you. We have to stand \naside and let market forces work.''\n  That, Madam President, is not the duty of the Acting Attorney General \nof the United States. He is supposed to stand there by that market and \nwatch it day in and day out. Because there is one thing that will occur \nif you let market forces work freely, and that is, monopolies will \ndevelop. Consolidations and mergers you see afoot right now are \noccurring every day, and money is talking. People are not suffering \nyet, but when they get into that monopolistic position, they will, \nbecause there won't be any of the rules and regulations, and they will \nbe in their own private businesses.\n  This group up here that continues to talk about ``let market forces'' \noperate, this tells me, one, I have a questionable candidate for the \nAntitrust Department of the Office of the Attorney General of the \nUnited States when he starts chanting about monopolies.\n  Reading on page 2, again, from the Joel Klein letter, I read on page \n2, one sentence:\n\n       In order to accomplish these goals, almost immediately \n     after I became Acting Assistant Attorney last October, I \n     asked all of the BOCs [the Bell Operating Companies] as well \n     as any other interested party, to give me their views of the \n     appropriate competition standards under section 271.\n\n  We set it out. We set out our report. We didn't need an Assistant \nAttorney General running around rewriting the law. He is talking about, \n``Oh, I got them all in. I am going to start developing policy.'' The \nCongress developed the policy. It took us 4 years to do it.\n  Here, he says gratuitously in the next sentence on the bottom of page \n2--this is Joel Klein, the nominee:\n\n       In formulating this standard, I specifically rejected using \n     the suggestion in the conference report that the Department \n     analyze Bell Operating Company applications employing the \n     standard used in the AT consent decree objecting to the \n     Bell Operating Company in regional long distance entry \n     ``unless there is no substantial possibility that the Bell \n     Operating Company or its affiliates could use its monopoly \n     power to impede competition in the market such company seeks \n     to enter.''\n\n  Bear with me a minute. I know this thing sounds complicated. And \nthose who want to watch a good, loud show they put on around the world, \nor whatever the dickens they put on in the afternoon, go ahead and turn \nto it. But this is very, very important.\n  Judge Greene had what we call in the trade ``the VIII(c) test''--that \nthey couldn't enter these markets until--this is the one rejected by \nJoel Klein--``there is no substantial possibility that the Bell \nOperating Company or its affiliates could use its monopoly power to \nimpede competition in the market such company seeks to do enter.''\n  Madam President, with that particular VIII(c) test, that is how \ncompetition starts in long distance that we have today. We don't have \nany in the local. Ninety-eight percent of the local calls are still \ncontrolled by the local Bell Operating Company. They have the monopoly. \nBut this really genius test, the VIII(c) test, became the standard of \nthe discipline, the standard of the industry.\n\n  In one hearing, as chairman of the Communications Subcommittee--the \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation hearing--I had the seven Bells \nattest. And we will put that in the Record, if necessary. They agreed \nwith this particular test. You have the Bell Operating Companies \nagreeing to that particular test, and that is why we kept it in there. \nWe didn't write it into the formal statute because one former colleague \non the House side had held up. He had tremendous influence, Jack Fields \nof Texas. So we put it in the language. But you follow the course or \ntalk to any of the conferees, you talk to any of the House and Senate \nMembers, they will tell you the VIII(c) test was the test, and we \ncouldn't think of a better one.\n  Here comes nominee Joel Klein, stating categorically here in May, \n``In formulating this standard, I specifically rejected using the \nsuggestion in the conference report that the Department analyze BOC \napplications employing the standard used''--the VIII(c) standard.\n  Madam President, when you work this long and you know the industry, \nyou know the monopolies, you know how Judge Greene held control and \noperated as well as he did, and communications prospered, expanded, and \ncompetition burst out all over in the long distance field with this \nparticular standard, and then have a gentleman come in totally green \nand just write back, just as he got a letter from the chairman who put \na hold on his nomination, and said ``I threw that out.'' The Bell \nOperating Companies tried to throw it out, and they couldn't. They know \nit because they had already testified in behalf of it.\n  He goes on to say that ``the VIII(c) standard which has barred Bell \nOperating Company entry into long distance since their divestiture from \nAT, struck me as insufficiently sensitive to the market conditions, \nand I was concerned that it would bar Bell Operating Company entry even \nwhere it would be competitively warranted.''\n  I want him to describe that. My understanding is that another \nSenator, my distinguished colleague from North Dakota--and also I was \ntalking to the Senator from Nebraska. And they have talked with the \ngentleman, Mr. Klein, and have asked him. And he has yet to come and \nelaborate about what is more ``sensitive.'' He says this is \n``insufficiently sensitive.'' We have yet to find another.\n  I have met twice with Joel Klein. And he said I was right. He was \nthere with the Attorney General. He understood, and he would get some \nensuing opinion, or letter, or some note that he understood, and he \ncould read the language, and it was going to be corrected.\n  Madam President, let's turn the page and go to Senator Conrad Burns' \nquestions and answers, and go to that question. Here is what Senator \nBurns questioned, and I quote.\n\n       In your speech, you use the following terms: ``Real and \n     broad-based competition,'' ``actual broad-based entry,'' \n     ``true broad-based entry,'' ``tangible entry,'' ``large-scale \n     entry,'' and ``entry on a large-scale basis.''\n       What do those terms mean to the department?\n\n  And I could read it all. The entire letter has been included. But let \nme read this last sentence.\n\n       Thus, in my March 11th speech--\n\n  The Acting Attorney General, he knows what we are talking about. He \nrefers to that speech.\n\n       In my March 11th speech to which you referred, I stated \n     that ``our preference, though we recognize that it may not \n     always occur, is to see actual broad based, that is, business \n     and residential, entry into a local market.''\n\n  Now, Madam President, for all of those unstudied in trying cases with \nlawyers, watch this particular language because it has the regular \nlanguage and regular print but he highlights with italic the phrase: \n``Our preference, though we recognize that it may not always occur.''\n  Now, that is in italic, not the rest of it. So the distinguished \nchairman of the communications subcommittee is given a signal. Watch \nthe play. And then comes the play.\n  Madam President, on May 21, the next day, he doesn't delay. Oh, that \nActing Attorney General for antitrust that held up for weeks the answer \nto the Dorgan letter and the Kerrey letter, he was prompt; he answered \nthat letter of Senator Burns in 5 days, gave the signal with the \nitalics.\n  (Mr. BENNETT assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this docket \nNo. 97-121, in the matter of the application of SBC Communications, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   [Before the Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC, CC \n                           Docket No. 97-121]\n\n       In the Matter of Application of SBC Communications Inc. et \n     al. Pursuant to Section 271 of the Telecommunications Act of \n     1996 to Provide In-Region, InterLATA Services in the State of \n     Oklahoma.\n\n\n addendum to the evaluation of the united states department of justice\n\n       Several parties have informally asked the Department to \n     clarify its views concerning\n\n[[Page S7680]]\n\n     two issues that have arisen in connection with this \n     proceeding: (1) whether we agree with the argument made by \n     some commentors that under Section 271(c)(1)(A) (``Track \n     A''), each separate class of subscribers that must be served \n     to satisfy that entry track, i.e., residential and business, \n     must be served ``exclusively . . . or predominantly'' over \n     the telephone exchange facilities of an unaffiliated \n     provider; \\1\\ and (2) the importance (and meaning) of \n     ``performance benchmarks'' in assessing whether BOC in-region \n     interLATA entry would be in the public interest. To address \n     any confusion on these points, the Department now files this \n     addendum.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Footnotes at end of article.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     I. Section 271(c)(1)(A) does not require that both \n         residential and business customers be served over the \n         facilities-based competitors' own facilities\n       Section 271(c)(1) requires that a BOC's application to \n     provide in-region interLATA services proceed under one of two \n     distinct tracks. As our evaluation explained, SBC's \n     application is governed by the standards of Track A. 47 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 271(c)(1)(A). See SBC Evaluation at 9-20. Under \n     Track A, a BOC must be providing ``access and interconnection \n     to its network facilities for the network facilities of one \n     or more unaffiliated competing providers of telephone \n     exchange service . . . to residential and business \n     subscribers.'' The statute further specifies that ``such \n     telephone exchange service may be offered by such competing \n     providers either exclusively over their own telephone \n     exchange service facilities or predominantly over their own \n     telephone exchange service facilities in combination with the \n     resale of the telecommunications services of another \n     carrier.'' 47 U.S.C. Sec. 271(c)(1)(A). As we explained in \n     our evaluation, SBC does not meet the standards of Track A \n     because there is no facilities-based competitor offering \n     service to residential subscribers. See SBC Evaluation at 20-\n     21. Brooks Fiber, to which SBC points as a residential \n     service provider, is merely testing its ability to offer \n     residential service by providing uncompensated service to \n     four employees; thus, it does not compete with SBC to serve \n     any residential ``subscribers.'' See id.\n       Some parties have pressed for rejection of SBC's \n     application on the additional ground that Brooks does not \n     provide residential service to anyone, including its four \n     employees, over its own facilities. In their view, Track A \n     requires, among other things, that residential service is \n     being provided completely or predominantly over a \n     competitor's own facilities. We disagree.\n       The statute requires that both business and residential \n     subscribers be served by a competing provider, and that such \n     provider must be exclusively or predominantly facilities-\n     based. It does not, however, require that each class of \n     customers (i.e., business and residential) must be served \n     over a facilities-based competitor's own facilities. To the \n     contrary, Congress expressly provided that the competitor may \n     be providing services ``predominantly'' over its own \n     facilities ``in combination with the resale of'' BOC \n     services. 47 U.S.C. Sec. 271(c)(1)(A). Thus, it does not \n     matter whether the competitor reaches one class of \n     customers--e.g., residential--only through resale, provided \n     that the competitor's local exchange services as a whole are \n     provided ``predominantly''over its own facilities.\n       This reading is not only consistent with the language of \n     the statute, but also serves Congress' twin purposes of \n     maximizing competition in local exchange and interexchange \n     telecommunications markets. To ensure that the BOCs truly \n     opened up their local networks to competitors, Congress \n     required that any BOC qualifying for Track A consideration \n     wait until a facilities-based competitor became operational--\n     provided that there is at least one potential competitor \n     proceeding toward that goal in a timely fashion--before that \n     BOC could satisfy the statute's in-region interLATA entry \n     requirements. In mandating that such a facilities-based \n     competitor offer both residential and business service, \n     Congress ensured both that (1) facilities-based entry path is \n     being used wherever requested; and (2) at least one \n     facilities-based competitor is offering service to \n     residential, as well as business, subscribers. See SBC \n     Evaluation at 14-17. Once those two basic conditions have \n     been satisfied, however, there is no reason to delay BOC \n     entry into interLATA markets simply because competitors that \n     have a demonstrated ability to operate as facilities-based \n     competitors, and that are in fact providing service \n     predominantly over their own facilities, find it most \n     advantageous to serve one class of customers on a resale \n     basis. Imposing this requirement would tip unnecessarily the \n     statute's balance between facilitating local entry and \n     providing for additional competition in interLATA services by \n     adding an unnecessary prerequisite to Track A that might \n     foreclose entry in certain cases for no beneficial \n     competitive purpose. Cf. id. at 22.\n     II. The Importance of performance benchmarks\n       In articulating the Department's approach to assessing BOC \n     applications for in-region, interLATA authority, we stated \n     that the existence of ``performance benchmarks'' serves an \n     important purpose in demonstrating that the market has been \n     ``irreversibly opened to competition.'' To better explain the \n     role of ``performance benchmarks,'' ``performance \n     standards,'' and ``performance measures'' in our analysis, we \n     have outlined further the definition and importance of these \n     concepts below.\\2\\\n       At bottom, a ``performance benchmark'' is a level of \n     performance to which regulators and competitors will be able \n     to hold a BOC after it receives in-region interLATA \n     authority. The most effective benchmarks are those based on a \n     ``track record'' of reliable service established by the BOC. \n     Such benchmarks may reflect either the BOC's performance of a \n     wholesale support function for a competitor, or, in areas \n     where the BOC performs the same function for its competitors \n     as it does for its own retail operations, a benchmark may \n     also be established by the BOC's service to its own retail \n     operations. In instances where neither type of benchmark is \n     available, the Department will consider other alternatives \n     that would ensure a consistent level of performance, such as, \n     for example, a commitment to adhere to certain industry \n     performance standards and/or an audit of the BOC's systems by \n     a neutral third party. Such benchmarks are significant \n     because they demonstrate the ability of the BOC to perform a \n     critical function--for example, the provisioning of an \n     unbundled loop within a measurable period of time. Thus, \n     benchmarks serve, as explained in our evaluation, the \n     important purpose of foreclosing post-entry BOC claims that \n     the delay or withholding of services needed by its \n     competitors should be excused on the ground that the services \n     or performance levels demanded by competitors are technically \n     infeasible. See SBC Evaluation at 45-48.\n       To make ``performance benchmarks'' a useful tool for post-\n     entry oversight, we also expect the BOC to adopt the specific \n     means and mechanisms necessary to measure its performance--\n     i.e., ``performance measures.'' That is, if there are no such \n     systems in place, it will be considerably more difficult to \n     ensure that the BOC continues to meet its established \n     performance benchmarks. Finally, we acknowledge that there \n     may be areas in which the present industry standards will be \n     updated, requiring new levels of performance. Accordingly, \n     the Department will also focus on the importance of \n     commitments by BOCs to adhere to ``performance \n     standards,'' even when they will be imposed upon it post-\n     entry.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     \\1\\ See, e.g., Opposition of Brooks Fiber Properties, Inc. to \n     Application of SBC Communications, Inc., CC Docket No. 97-\n     121, at 8-9 (May 1, 1997).\n     \\2\\ To reflect this typology, our evaluation should be \n     modified as follows:\n     Page 45 line 2 of heading ``b.''

I thank the distinguished Chair. And again now on page \n3 here the fellow has gotten the signal, and I read on page 3--the \nentire matter is in the Record.\n\n       It does not, however, require that each class of customers, \n     business and residential, must be served over a facilities \n     based competitor's own facilities. To the contrary, Congress \n     expressly provided that the competitor may be providing \n     services predominantly over its own facilities in combination \n     with the resale of Bell Operating Company services (47 USC \n     271 (c)(1)(A)). Thus, it does not matter whether the \n     competitor reaches one class of customers, namely \n     residential, only through resale provided that the \n     competitor's local exchange services as a whole are provided \n     predominantly over its own facilities.\n\n  Well, Mr. President, there it was. Bell Operating Companies through \nthe distinguished Senator from Montana got what they wanted in black \nand white. They just totally refuted 4 years of work, the most \nimportant part of the checklist, the most important part that provided \nfor competition in the long distance market, the most important part \nthat we included. We talked about it. We discussed it. We debated it. I \nwas in these conferences. They were in the conferences, like I tried to \nemphasize. The Bell Companies met all one day with our staffs on both \nsides and the long distance companies met all one day, and it was \nworked out. But do not take the word of the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter to the Honorable \nReed Hunt, Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, from \nChairman Tom Bliley, Congressman from Virginia, and chairman of the \nCommerce Committee over on the House side, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                    U.S. House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                        Committee on Commerce,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 20, 1997.\n     Hon. Reed Hundt,\n     Chairman, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hundt: I recently read with interest and \n     dismay the Department of Justice's additional comments \n     regarding SBC Communications Inc.'s (SBC's) application to \n     provide in-region, interLATA services in the State of \n     Oklahoma. The Department therein clarified its views on \n     section 271(c)(1)(A) of the Communications Act, as amended. \n     As the primary author of this provision. I feel compelled to \n     inform you that the Department misread the statute's plain \n     language. As you rule on SBC's application and future BOC \n     applications, you should not overlook the clear meaning of \n     section 271 or its legislative history.\n       The Department argued that a BOC should be allowed to enter \n     the in-region, interLATA market under ``Track A'' (i.e., \n     section 271(1)(A)) if a competing service provider offers \n     facilities-based services to business customers and resale \n     services to residential customers, so long as the combined \n     provision of both services is predominantly over the \n     competing service provider's facilities. In other words, the \n     Department wrongly takes the view that section 271(c)(1)(A) \n     is satisfied if a competitor is serving either residential or \n     business customers over its own facilities.\n       Section 271(c)(1)(A), however, clearly requires a different \n     interpretation. To quote the statute, a competing service \n     provider must offer telephone exchange service to \n     ``residential and business subscribers . . . either \n     exclusively over their own telephone exchange service \n     facilities or predominantly over their own telephone exchange \n     service facilities.'' Track A is thus satisfied if--and only \n     if--a BOC faces facilities-based competition in both \n     residential and business markets. Neither the statute nor its \n     legislative history permits any other interpretation; I know \n     this because I drafted both texts.\n       In the end, the Department's recent misinterpretation of \n     section 271 reinforces a point I frequently made during \n     Congressional debate over the Telecommunications Act of 1996: \n     the Department of Justice does not have the expertise to make \n     important telecommunications policy decisions. The FCC, by \n     contrast, does have the necessary expertise, which explains \n     why Congress gave you and your colleagues--and no one else--\n     the ultimate authority to make important decisions, such as \n     the decision to interpret section 271. I remind you that the \n     Department's role in this matter is a consultative one, and \n     should be treated as such.\n       Let me conclude by noting that, while this letter focuses \n     exclusively on Department's interpretation of section \n     271(c)(1)(A), it should not be construed to mean that the \n     balance of the Department's comments were either consistent \n     or inconsistent with Congressional intent.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Tom Bliley,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. This is dated June 20, 1997.\n\n       Dear Chairman Hunt:\n       I recently read with interest and dismay the Department of \n     Justice's additional comments regarding SBC Communications' \n     application to provide in-region interLATA services in the \n     State of Oklahoma. The department therein clarified its views \n     on section 271(c)(1)(A) of the Communications Act, as \n     amended. As a primary author--\n\n  Let me emphasize that. This is Chairman Bliley--\n\n       As a primary author of this provision, I feel compelled to \n     inform you that the department misread the statute's plain \n     language. As you rule on SBC's application and future Bell \n     Operating Company applications, you should not overlook the \n     clear meaning of section 271 or its legislative history. The \n     Department argued that a Bell Operating Company should be \n     allowed to enter the in-region interLATA market under track \n     A, that is, section 271(c)(1)(A) if a competing service \n     provides office facilities based services to business \n     customers and resale services to residential customers, so \n     long as the combined provision of both services is \n     predominantly over the competing service provider's \n     facilities.\n       In other words, the Department wrongly takes the view that \n     section 271(c)(1)(A) is satisfied if a competitor is serving \n     either residential or business customers over its own \n     facilities. Section 271(c)(1)(a), however, clearly requires a \n     different interpretation. To quote the statute, ``A competing \n     service provider must offer telephone exchange service to \n     residential and business subscribers either exclusively over \n     their own telephone exchange service facilities or \n     predominantly over their own telephone exchange service \n     facilities. Track A is thus satisfied if and only if a Bell \n     Operating Company faces facilities based competition in both \n     residential and business markets. Neither the statute nor its \n     legislative history permits any other interpretation. I know \n     this because I drafted both texts.\n\n  Mr. President, that is Chairman Bliley. I do not know how you can \nmake it more clear. He talks of the history. He talks of the conference \nreport. He talks of the actual language. And anybody reading it can see \nexactly that. In essence, Mr. Klein sort of quietly acknowledged it. I \nwas waiting because I met with him individually and then I met with him \nwith the Attorney General, I can tell you here and now for those who \nwatch this and follow it. And I ask unanimous consent the recent \neditorial in the New York Times entitled ``A Weak Antitrust Nominee'' \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7682]]\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 11, 1997]\n\n                        A Weak Antitrust Nominee\n\n       The next head of the Justice Department's antitrust \n     division will have a lot to say about whether the 1996 \n     Telecommunications Act breaks the monopoly chokehold that \n     Bell companies exert over local phone customers. He will rule \n     on mergers among telecommunications companies and advise the \n     Federal Communications Commission on applications by Bell \n     companies to enter long-distance markets. Thus it is \n     disheartening and disqualifying that President Clinton's \n     nominee, Joel Klein, is scheduled to come up for confirmation \n     today in the Senate with a record that suggests he might \n     knuckle under to the powerful Bell companies and the \n     politicians who do their bidding.\n       Senators Bob Kerrey, Ernest Hollings and Byron Dorgan have \n     threatened to block the vote today and put off until next \n     week a final determination of Mr. Klein's fate. But the \n     Administration would do its own telecommunications policy a \n     favor by withdrawing the nomination and finding a stronger, \n     more aggressive successor.\n       Mr. Klein, who has been serving as the Government's acting \n     Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust, demonstrated his \n     inclinations when he overrode objections of some of his staff \n     and approved unconditionally the merger of Bell Atlantic and \n     Nynex. That merger will remove Bell Atlantic as a potential \n     competitor for Nynex's many dissatisfied customers. Mr. Klein \n     refused even to impose conditions that would have made it \n     easier for state and Federal regulators to pry open Nynex's \n     markets to rivals such as AT\n       Worse, Mr. Klein sent a letter to Chairman Conrad Burns of \n     the Senate communications subcommittee, who runs political \n     interference for the Bell companies, that committed the \n     antitrust division to pro-Bell positions in defiance of the \n     1996 act.\n       That act invites the Bell companies to provide long-\n     distance service, but only if the Bells first open their \n     systems to rivals that want to compete for local customers. \n     Yet in the letter to Mr. Burns, Mr. Klein explicitly rejected \n     Congress's interpretation of requirements to be imposed on \n     the Bells in favor of his own, weaker standard.\n       In a subsequent submission to the Federal Communications \n     Commission, Mr. Klein further weakened a requirement that \n     before the Bells enter long-distance service they face a \n     competitor that is serious enough to build its own switches \n     and wires. Mr. Klein has also upset some senators by seeming \n     to minimize the importance, provided in the 1996 \n     Telecommunications Act, of Justice's advice to the F.C.C. on \n     applications by Bell companies to enter long-distance.\n       True, Mr. Klein has blocked applications by two Bell \n     companies, SBC and Ameritech, to offer long-distance service \n     before they had opened their local markets to competition. \n     But by pandering to Mr. Burns, he has created strong doubts \n     that he can provide aggressive antitrust leadership.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I ask unanimous consent that the Consumer Federation of \nAmerica letter of July 14, 1997, on this score be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                               Consumer Federation of America,\n\n                                                    July 14, 1997.\n       Dear Senator: With cable rates rising almost three times \n     faster than inflation and massive consolidation in cable, \n     radio and telecommunications markets, your efforts to promote \n     competition through the 1996 Telecommunications Act are \n     backfiring.\n       Acting Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust Joel Klein \n     bears significant responsibility for these unintended, \n     monopolistic results. Unless you demand that the Justice \n     Department's Antitrust Division reverse course and engage in \n     strict antitrust enforcement (see attached New York Times \n     editorial: ``A Weak Antitrust Nominee''), consumers will face \n     vastly inflated telephone and cable rates from increasingly \n     entrenched monopolies.\n       After antitrust officials allowed the seven local Bell \n     telephone monopolies to consolidate into four bigger \n     monopolies; permitted Time Warner and TeleCommunications Inc. \n     (TCI) to unite companies service almost one-half of all cable \n     customers through a combination with Turner Broadcasting; and \n     approved hundreds of radio mergers, consumers are seeing no \n     appreciable increase in either competition or pocketbook \n     savings from the Telecommunications Act.\n       While Acting Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein \n     described some of this activity as ``the concentration \n     envisioned by Congress'' (remarks to Glasser Legalworks \n     Seminar, March 11, 1997), we believe you were hoping \n     antitrust enforcement would foster increased competition \n     rather than concentration.\n       Contrary to promises they made to Congress in return for \n     more market freedom, large cable, telephone and other \n     telecommunications companies are not vigorously entering each \n     other's markets:\n       AT appears to be throwing in the towel on the notion of \n     competing with the local Bell monopolies, as it pursues \n     mergers with the Bell companies.\n       MCI is losing money hand-over-fist in its failed efforts to \n     jump-start local phone competition.\n       After failing to start a competitive satellite alternative \n     to cable monopolies, Rupert Murdoch decided to join forces \n     with the cable giants through deals with TCI's John Malone, \n     Primestar and Cablevision.\n       Finally, local phone companies have pulled the plug on most \n     of their grandiose efforts to enter the cable business, and \n     cable companies have retreated just as quickly from entering \n     the phone business.\n       And while all this market entrenchment goes on, cable rates \n     are skyrocketing and many local phone companies seek a \n     doubling of local phone rates in anticipation of \n     ``competition.''\n       It is more obvious than ever before that the \n     Telecommunications Act will be an abject failure unless \n     Congress makes sure that the Antitrust Division reverses \n     course and reinvigorates its enforcement practices.\n           Sincerely,\n     Howard M. Metzenbaum, Chairman, Consumer Federation of \n     America, former chairman, Senate Subcommittee on Antitrust, \n     Business Rights and Competition.\n     Gene Kimmelman,\n       Co-Director, Consumers Union.\n     Dr. Mark Cooper,\n       Research Director, Consumer Federation of America.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Consumer Federation and others who have followed this \nthing have been on the phone and otherwise just fighting to make sure \nthat this was really held up and defeated. And in all fairness, I am \nsorry, after we see the exchange of letters here recently, that I did \nnot fight this nomination. I put a hold on it. I thought that Members \nwould listen, that they would want to learn and they would want to \nunderstand. But evidently the jury has been fixed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that two letters, one by \nSenator Kerrey to the Attorney General dated June 23, and the letter \nback from the Office of the Attorney General dated July 14 to Senator \nDorgan be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 23, 1997.\n     Hon. Janet Reno,\n     U.S. Department of Justice,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Attorney General: Not too long ago, I met Joel \n     Klein and found him to be an intelligent, talented attorney \n     and a dedicated public servant. I would like very much to \n     support his nomination for Assistant Attorney General for \n     Antitrust but have some very serious concerns about the \n     Administration's telecommunications policies and Mr. Klein's \n     interpretation of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. I am \n     hopeful you can clarify the Department's official views for \n     me.\n       I am particularly concerned about recent comments made by \n     Acting Assistant Attorney General Klein regarding the \n     Department of Justice's (DOJ) role in facilitating \n     competition in the wake of the Telecommunications Act of \n     1996. As you know, my support of the Telecommunications Act \n     was contingent upon a strong role for DOJ in shaping a \n     competitive telecommunications market. I did not stop the \n     work of the United States Senate with a filibuster in order \n     for the Department of Justice to take its responsibilities \n     lightly. In the contrary, I expected DOJ to use every ounce \n     of its authority, including those powers granted outside of \n     the Telecommunications Act, to ensure the competitive \n     integrity of the new telecommunications market.\n       In response to questions by the Chairman of the Senate \n     Communications Subcommittee, Mr. Klein said that he \n     ``specifically rejected using the suggestion in the \n     Conference Report that the Department analyze Bell Operating \n     Company (BOC) applications employing the standard used in the \n     AT consent decree''. This standard would reject BOC entry \n     into in-region long distance unless ``there is a substantial \n     possibility that the BOC or its affiliates could use its \n     monopoly power to impede competition in the market such \n     company seeks to enter.'' The Telecommunications Act gave you \n     the authority to choose any standard you see fit to evaluate \n     BOC entry into in-region service. Winning that discretion was \n     a hard fought battle. Is the Department using its discretion \n     to chose a weak standard? Does Mr. Klein's statement mean \n     that a Bell Operating Company should be allowed to enter the \n     in-region long distance market even if there is a \n     ``substantial possibility that he BOC or its affiliates could \n     use monopoly power to impede competition?''\n       Mr. Klein's comment to the Chairman that ``we think that \n     the openness of a local market can be best assessed by the \n     discretionary authority of the FCC, relying in part on the \n     Department of Justice's competitive assessment, and based on \n     the evaluation of the particular circumstances in an \n     individual state.'' I fought hard to include DOJ in this \n     process because of the legal and economic expertise of the \n     Antitrust Division. Is the Department abdicating its role in \n     this area? The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is not \n     the only agency equipped to\n\n[[Page S7683]]\n\n     make decisions about the openness of markets. Can a market be \n     competitive if it is not open? The Department's \n     responsibility under the act and the nation's antitrust laws \n     is most serious and should be aggressively pursued by the \n     Antitrust Division. Although the ultimate decision lies with \n     the FCC, the Department should accept its important role as \n     the expert in competition and market power and adopt a \n     meaningful entry standard based on pro-competitive \n     principles. I am not convinced that the Department has done \n     that.\n       On a separate but equally important competition issue, I \n     remain very concerned about recent mergers between large \n     telecommunications providers. The decision by Justice to \n     approve the Bell Atlantic/NYNEX merger without any conditions \n     is troubling. I am also concerned about rumors circulating \n     about a possible reconstruction of the old Bell system. \n     Reports of AT efforts to bring two BOC's back into its fold \n     should give everyone pause. Such a merger will likely lead to \n     a new round of large telecommunications mergers which could \n     greatly reduce any chance for the swift adoption of a \n     vibrant, competitive telecommunications market. Competitive \n     entry could be frozen while real and potential competitors \n     court, woo and marry each other.\n       Finally, I am pleased with Mr. Klein's emphasis on ensuring \n     that the BOC's take the necessary steps to allow competition \n     in their markets. The Department of Justice should use its \n     authority to ensure that no one creates or uses artificial \n     impediments to block competitive entry. Interconnection \n     agreements are pending in all fifty states, but at this time \n     no significant competition has developed. The era of \n     telecommunications monopolies should be over, not recreated. \n     Market forces, not market power should motivate all \n     telecommunications carriers to work night and day to win and \n     keep customers. Interconnection should be made as simple and \n     efficient as possible. It should be very easy for a \n     telecommunications entrepreneur to gather a group of \n     customers and easily, efficiently and expeditiously begin \n     providing them service through interconnection or resale.\n       The telecommunications industry is at a critical point in \n     its history. The Department's commitment to using its full \n     authority to promote competition is important to achieving an \n     environment where consumers come first and entrepreneurs are \n     encouraged to challenge the status quo. Thank you for your \n     careful consideration of my concerns and would appreciate \n     your views on these matters. I look forward to your response.\n           Sincerely,\n     J. Robert Kerrey.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                               Office of the Attorney General,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 1997.\n     Hon. Byron L. Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dorgan: The President has requested that I \n     respond to your recent letter to him regarding the nomination \n     of Joel Klein to be Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust \n     and the Administration's telecommunications policies.\n       At the outset, I want to emphasize my appreciation and that \n     of the Department as a whole for your strong and unwavering \n     support for the important role provided for the Department in \n     the implementation of the Telecommunications Act of 1996. I \n     remember how hard we fought together to secure the DOJ role. \n     As a consequence, I share with you a keen interest in \n     ensuring that the Department carries out its role under the \n     Telecommunications Act effectively.\n       Let me begin by assuring you that the Department of Justice \n     takes its role under the Telecommunications Act of 1996 \n     extremely seriously. We have devoted substantial resources to \n     preliminary investigations all across the nation on a state-\n     by-state basis to understand the competitive conditions in \n     each state. We have devoted even more resources to our review \n     and evaluation of specific Section 271 applications. We \n     prepared extensive, even exhaustive, analyses of SBC's \n     Section 271 application for in-region long distance authority \n     in Oklahoma and Ameritech's Section 271 application for in-\n     region long distance authority in Michigan.\n       Our actions in these matters make absolutely clear that the \n     Department is firmly committed to ensuring that local markets \n     are fully and irreversibly open, so that competition can take \n     hold there and flourish, and that long distance markets are \n     as competitive as possible. We share your view that this is \n     crucial for consumers in this country. To this end, we have \n     adopted a procompetitive standard for evaluating Section 271 \n     applications, and we are providing the FCC with meaningful \n     guidance on competition policy in specific cases. The FCC \n     relied heavily on our analysis in its only decision to date, \n     its recent decision denying SBC's application.\n       You have specific questions regarding the standard used by \n     the Department in evaluating Bell Operating Company (BOC) FCC \n     applications to provide in-region long distance service.\n       After a careful evaluation of public input, the Department \n     adopted a standard that the local market had to be ``fully \n     and irreversibly open to competition.'' I assure you that \n     this is not a weak standard. It is a meaningful standard \n     based on strong procompetitive principles and is designed to \n     ensure and protect competition in both local and long-\n     distance markets. It ensures that no one can create \n     artificial impediments to entry, and it ensures that BOCs are \n     not able to provide in-region long distance service \n     prematurely, when they might have unfair competitive \n     advantages over competitors. Otherwise, the promise of fully \n     competitive local and long distance markets would be delayed.\n       As demonstrated by our evaluations of SBC's Section 271 \n     Oklahoma application in May, and of Ameritech's Section 271 \n     Michigan application in late June, we will not support long \n     distance entry until local markets are fully and irreversibly \n     open to competition. Our position (and our standard) is one \n     that is tough but fair and designed to promote the maximum \n     amount of competition in all markets. The Department is fully \n     committed to ensuring that all telecommunications markets \n     become as competitive as possible.\n       In closing, let me say Joel Klein is an extremely \n     intelligent and talented attorney and a dedicated public \n     servant. The President and I hope he is rapidly confirmed by \n     the United States Senate to be the Assistant Attorney General \n     for Antitrust.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Janet Reno.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Now, you see every effort has been made to try to clear \nthat record, and you can read the Attorney General's letter, and for \nthe purposes at hand it is not worth the paper it is written on. You \ncan throw it away. It says nothing--that she believes in competition. \nNow, she is a lawyer. She knows how to read emphasized italics \nlanguage. She saw the pitch. I told her about the pitch and how it \noccurred. I showed her the talk that Klein made. We went down the whole \nthing. So Senator Kerrey, and I understand, of course, Senator Dorgan \nwrote a letter, and we were waiting for a letter back and we had to \nwait several weeks. Not the Senator from Montana. His letter and \naddendum and opinion were all put out immediately. But when Senators \nwho worked on the bill as diligently as we did tried to meet with him \nand then put down in black and white our misgivings, write the Attorney \nGeneral's department and ask, please, now, let's see your position here \non the plain, clear language, they write back--``I believe in \ncompetition.'' Just two pages of nothing. I have that in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I should have, like I say, politicked this nomination \nfor its defeat.\n  Let me ask unanimous consent that the ``Dear Colleague'' letter of \nJuly 10 by Senator Dorgan of North Dakota and myself be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n           Transportation,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 10, 1997.\n       Dear Colleague: The Senate may soon move to consider the \n     nomination of Joel Klein to be the Assistant Attorney General \n     in charge of the Antitrust Division. Because of statements \n     and actions by Mr. Klein in his acting capacity at the \n     Department of Justice we are very concerned with the \n     direction of the Administration's policies with respect to \n     its interpretation of certain provisions of the \n     Telecommunications Act of 1996. We believe that these issues \n     need clarification before Mr. Klein's nomination should be \n     brought to a vote in the Senate. We urge you to support us in \n     our desire to resolve the issues surrounding Mr. Klein's \n     actions before his nomination is brought to the Senate floor \n     for debate.\n       Whether or not robust competition develops in the local \n     telephone service market depends upon the Administration's \n     commitment to vigorously enforce these critical provisions of \n     the Telecommunications Act. Unfortunately, while serving as \n     acting chief of the Antitrust Division, Mr. Klein has \n     explicitly contradicted specific statutory mandates and \n     conference report directions that we, working with the White \n     House, fought again all odds to have added to the \n     Telecommunications Act of 1996. We have asked Mr. Klein, \n     Attorney General Reno, and the White House to review our \n     concerns and demonstrate that the Antitrust Division will \n     follow the explicit meaning of the Telecommunications Act. So \n     far, we have not received a satisfactory response to our \n     concerns.\n       Our misgivings about Mr. Klein go to the very heart of \n     whether the Telecommunications Act achieves its goal of \n     promoting more competition and lower prices for consumers. In \n     response to White House requests (and a very specific veto \n     threat) we made sure that nothing in the Telecommunications \n     act in any way undermined the antitrust laws. In fact, to \n     address these concerns, we gave the Justice Department new \n     authority to rule on mergers of telecommunications common \n     carriers (power previously reserved for the Federal \n     Communications Commission), and we gave the Justice \n     Department a substantial role in determining when a local \n     Bell telephone monopoly could enter the long distance market \n     because it had sufficiently opened its market to competition. \n     However, under the leadership of Mr. Klein, the Justice \n     Department has abdicated its responsibility and failed to use\n\n[[Page S7684]]\n\n     these tools to promote the level of competition that we and \n     the Clinton Administration believed should be developing in \n     telecommunications markets.\n       By interpreting the Telecommunications Act in a manner that \n     fails to ensure that both consumers and businesses receive \n     competitive choices from separate local phone companies; by \n     abandoning the Department of Justice's traditional standard \n     for measuring competition to make it easier for the Bell \n     companies to enter long distance; and by approving the \n     largest merger in telecommunications history without even a \n     policing mechanism to ensure that competition would be \n     enhanced, Mr. Klein has sent the wrong signal to the \n     marketplace and undermined the core principles that are the \n     foundation upon which the Telecommunications Act was \n     constructed.\n       In a letter describing his final concerns about our bill \n     and the bill passed by our colleagues in the House, President \n     Clinton wrote that the final bill ``should include a test \n     specifically designed to ensure that the Bell companies \n     entering into long distance markets will not impede \n     competition.'' This test described by President Clinton is \n     actually a stronger test than the VIII(c) test contained \n     within the Modified Final Judgment. Yet, Mr. Klein rejected \n     both these tests recently and decided to develop his own \n     lesser standard of ``irreversibly open to competition.''\n       In another more compelling matter, Mr. Klein has turned the \n     statute on its head in his interpretation of the facilities-\n     based entry test for long distance. The statute requires that \n     a facilities-based provider serve both business and \n     residential customers before the Bell company can enter long \n     distance. Mr. Klein, however, believes the statute can be \n     interpreted to mean that a facilities-based carrier need only \n     provide service to business or residential customers. Yet \n     again, another instance where Mr. Klein has weakened the \n     protections that the Congress fought hard to enact into law \n     to protect consumers from premature entry into long distance.\n       We will insist that any Administration nominee support the \n     consumer protection we fought hard to put into place. Mr. \n     Klein's interpretation of the law will result in more \n     consolidation, less choice and higher costs to consumers. We \n     therefore want to ensure that this or any Administration \n     nominee implement the letter of the law and follow the steps \n     that we and the Administration outlined in achieving a \n     consensus during deliberations on the Telecommunications \n     Act's conference report.\n           Sincerely,\n     Byron L. Dorgan.\n     Ernest F. Hollings.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It is not my intent to take further time. I can tell \nthat this was called. I had checked after the last rollcall. They said \nit wasn't going to be called until after 6 o'clock. When they filed it, \nthey filed cloture immediately before there was any kind of debate \nwhatever. They have not only lost their senses with respect to reality, \ncalling deficits listed in the document as $179.3 billion as balanced, \nbut they have lost their manners and their courtesy. Usually you have \nthe Senator who had the hold and caused the particular confusion put on \nnotice, but I had a staffer watching the TV and saw our friend from \nUtah, Senator Hatch, was talking. So there we are, just right in the \nmiddle.\n  You did not need cloture. At the time we put on a hold and were \nasked: Do you want to be identified as the one having the hold, I said \nabsolutely. I am not playing games, tricks or anything of that kind. I \nwould be glad if you called it this afternoon. That was weeks ago where \nI would have a chance to explain exactly what occurred. But, of course, \nyou can see what has occurred. They have politically worked it, got the \nvotes, got cloture. Don't waste time. Let us get on with this.\n  And then when the rates go up, when you get consolidation instead of \ncompetition and those rates go up, and you don't get competition in the \nlocal market and you don't get what we intended in the \nTelecommunications Act, don't come around like in Gramm-Rudman-Hollings \nand say it didn't work. Gramm-Rudman-Hollings worked up until 1990 when \nthey went out to Andrews Air Base and they put in the categories and \nso-called ceilings--we haven't reached those ceilings yet--and repealed \nthe across-the-board cuts, the sequester language. On October 21 at \n1:40 a.m. I made the point of order that you are now repealing the \nthrust of Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. Today, this afternoon, I am making the \nsame point. You are repealing the competitive feature of the \nTelecommuncations Act of 1996.\n  I hope the nomination is defeated and we get somebody here who can \nread.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nnomination of Joel I. Klein to serve as Assistant Attorney General for \nthe Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice. Mr. Klein is a \nfine man and is an outstanding nominee for this important position. I \nam pleased to support him.\n  Mr. Klein achieved an excellent academic record at both Columbia \nCollege in New York and Harvard Law School. He then served as a law \nclerk for the Chief Judge of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals and \nlater for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell. Afterward, he \ndeveloped a distinguished reputation in private practice, where he \nargued important cases before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  For the past several months, he has served as the Acting Assistant \nAttorney General for the Antitrust Division. During that time, he has \nshown that he is firmly committed to enforcing our nation's antitrust \nlaws. For example, under his leadership, the Antitrust Division has \ngreatly increased its collection of criminal fines. Thus far this \nfiscal year, which almost coincides with Joel Klein's tenure, the \nAntitrust Division has collected over $192 million dollars in criminal \nfines, compared to only about $27 million for all of fiscal year 1996.\n  Mr. President, I am confident that Mr. Klein is within the mainstream \nof antitrust law and doctrine, and will exercise his responsibilities \nfairly and within the dictates of the law. He is committed to upholding \nour free enterprise system and to protecting consumers from anti-\ncompetitive conduct.\n  Under Chairman Hatch's distinguished leadership, the Judiciary \nCommittee held a hearing on Mr. Klein's nomination in April, and his \nnomination was reported out of the Committee unanimously in May.\n  In short, I strongly believe that Mr. Klein is a man of unquestioned \nintegrity and great ability. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of \nthis nomination.\n  Mr. President, in closing I want to commend Senator Hatch, the able \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee for the position he has taken on \nthis particular nomination.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, let me make a few brief points. First, it is \nkind of ironic that Joel Klein's nomination has nearly universal \nRepublican support, but has divided many Democrats. After all, he is \nthe President's choice for the job and any Presidential nominee for an \nexecutive branch appointment--Democrat or Republican--deserves the \nbenefit of the doubt. More than that, Mr. Klein has the support of many \nprominent Democrats, among them Judge Abner Mikva, Former Deputy \nAttorney General Jamie Gorelick, Lloyd Cutler, and others. I ask \nunanimous consent that a letter from them--and from prominent \nRepublicans--in support of Joel Klein be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 14, 1997.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Senate Majority Leader, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Tom Daschle,\n     Senate Minority Leader, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott and Senator Daschle: We are lawyers, \n     academics, and former government officials with differing \n     views on various legal and public policy issues. We are \n     united, however, in our belief that Joel I. Klein is a \n     superbly and uniquely qualified nominee to be the Assistant \n     Attorney General for Antitrust at the Department of Justice. \n     We are confident that as Assistant Attorney General Joel \n     Klein would vigorously enforce the nation's antitrust laws \n     and effectively serve the public interest. We urge the Senate \n     to act upon this nomination promptly and confirm Mr. Klein to \n     this important post.\n           Sincerely,\n         Donald B. Ayer, Former Deputy Attorney General, Former \n           Deputy Solicitor General; Warren Christopher, Former \n           Secretary of State, Former Deputy Attorney General; \n           Lloyd N.

Collectively, we have \n     served as economic experts for interexchange carriers, \n     wireless companies, and Bell operating companies. The \n     signatories below include four recent Economics Deputies from \n     the Antitrust Division and the two most recent Chief \n     Economists at the Federal Communications Commission.\n       Although we have our differences in the interpretation of \n     various economic evidence, and in our recommendations for \n     telecommunications policies, we all believe that Joel Klein \n     will make an excellent Assistant Attorney General. He is fair \n     and thoughtful, he understands and uses economic arguments \n     and analysis effectively, and he is dedicated to enforcing \n     our antitrust laws and promoting competition in our economy.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Joseph Farrell,\n       Prof. of Economics, U. of California at Berkeley.\n     Michael Katz,\n       Prof. of Business Administration, U. of California at \n     Berkeley.\n     Carl Shapiro,\n       Prof. of Business Strategy, U. of California at Berkeley.\n     Richard Gilbert,\n       Prof. of Economics, U. of California at Berkeley.\n     Janusz Ordover,\n       Prof. of Economics, New York U.\n     Robert Willig,\n       Prof. of Economics and Public Affairs, Princeton U.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Second, while it is unfortunate that Eric Holder is being \nheld ``hostage'' to Joel Klein's nomination, the truth is that the \nsooner we confirm Mr. Klein, the sooner we can move forward and confirm \nEric Holder. The Department of Justice, and the American people, will \nbe better off with a confirmed Deputy Attorney General.\n  Third, I respect the efforts of my colleagues, Senator Hollings, \nSenator Dorgan and Senator Kerrey, who have fought long and hard for \nconsumers on telecommunications matters. Like me, they clearly want \nsomeone in charge of the Antitrust Division who will bring about the \nkind of competition promised in--but not yet delivered by--the \nTelecommunications Act. They have sent a strong message to Joel Klein \non how to interpret Section 271 of the Act, and I believe he \nunderstands that message and will work hard to promote vigorous \ncompetition in the telephone industry--and all other industries.\n  My hope is that Joel Klein, as a confirmed appointee, will surprise \nhis critics and please his supporters in his enforcement of the \nantitrust laws. I urge my colleagues to support him.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I give my strong support to Joel Klein's \nnomination to serve as Assistant Attorney General of the Antitrust \nDivision at the Department of Justice. Mr. Klein's background and \nexperience have prepared him well to serve the country in this \ncapacity.\n  After graduating magna cum laude from Columbia University and Harvard \nLaw School, Mr. Klein served as a law clerk for both D.C. Circuit Judge \nDavid Bazelon and Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell. He later served \nwith great distinction as a public interest lawyer, Deputy White House \nCounsel, and Principal Deputy of the Antitrust Division where he is now \nthe Acting Assistant Attorney General.\n  Mr. Klein's work in the Antitrust Division has earned wide praise. \nLeading economists, including two former Chief Economists of the \nFederal Communications Commission, believe that he will be an excellent \nAssistant Attorney General who is ``dedicated to enforcing our \nantitrust laws and promoting competition in our economy.'' Mr. Klein \nwins similar high praise from State and Federal officials and many \nmembers of the American Bar Association active in the Section of \nAntitrust Law.\n  This praise is well deserved. Mr. Klein has won substantial criminal \nfines against large companies guilty of price-fixing. He has challenged \nanticompetitive practices and anticompetitive mergers that harm \nconsumers. He has given new emphasis to antitrust enforcement overseas \nto help open more markets for U.S. businesses.\n  I have had the opportunity to work closely with Mr. Klein on several \nissues, including a recent ``East-West Initiative,'' which brought \ntogether business leaders, government officials, and Republican and \nDemocratic Senators from Massachusetts, North Carolina, Washington, \nUtah, and California to discuss cooperative efforts by government and \nbusiness to help consumers. Mr. Klein's participation in this effort \nwas key to its success, and I have the greatest respect for his ability \nand his commitment to public service.\n  I urge the Senate to approve his nomination. His outstanding record \nmakes him an excellent nominee for this position. I hope that the \nstrong bipartisan support already expressed by many Senators on both \nsides of the aisle will lead to further cooperation in expediting \naction on other nominees for the Department of Justice, and for long \noverdue bipartisan action on judicial nominations as well.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the position of Assistant Attorney General \nfor Anti-Trust is one of the most critical to assuring American \nconsumers enjoy the benefits of competition. The decisions made by the \nindividual who holds this title affect billions of dollars and the \nability of our companies to compete in the global economy. They affect \ncorporate profit and loss sheets and the course of the stock market. \nBut most importantly, they affect the prices consumers pay for basic \nservices, from telephone calls to transportation and television.\n  No area holds more promise for competition than communications, and \nthat was the major impetus for the 1996 Telecommunications Act. The Act \nwas intended to eliminate monopolies, spur new entrants and bring down \nprices. Eighteen months later, we have seen pitifully little progress. \nThe Administration has not moved aggressively to promote competition. \nThe vote I will cast today is meant to send a signal to the \nAdministration that those of us in Congress who supported the 1996 \nTelecommunications Act want to see competition rather than \nconcentration.\n  As a member of the Commerce Communications Subcommittee, I had hoped \nthe 1996 Telecommunications Act would unleash a torrent of competition. \nInstead, we have seen prices outpace inflation in many areas. Each day \nthe paper seems to carry yet another announcement of one giant \ncompany's plans to merge with another. Companies are spending millions \nof dollars on litigation and negative advertising. The situation \nreminds me of the African proverb: when elephants fight, the grass gets \ntrampled. The grass here is the American consumer.\n  Perhaps the overwhelming array of choices has lulled the consumer \ninto a sense of complacency. We hear about 500 channel broadcast \nsatellite and video-on-demand. We see pages and pages of advertisements \nfor cellular phones and CD ROM's, interactive computers and digital \ncameras. The pace of progress is incredible.\n  But if one peeks behind the smorgasboard, there is a very disturbing \ntrend. The trend is toward concentration and media mega-mergers. \nToday's competitors are becoming tomorrow's partners.\n  Mr. President, this is why the position of Assistant Attorney General \nfor Anti-Trust is so crucial. The individual who sits in that office \nplays a pivotal role in assuring our anti-trust laws produce robust \ncompetition rather than rogue concentration. Consumers need a champion \nfor choice in communications.\n  I like Mr. Klein personally and believe him to be a skilled lawyer. \nIt is the Administration's failure to move aggressively to promote \ncompetition that disturbs me. I hope my vote today\n\n[[Page S7686]]\n\nsends a clear message to the Administration that the trend toward \nincreased communications concentration needs to be thorougly examined \nand challenged. For this reason, Mr. President, I will not be able to \nsupport the Administration on this vote.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nJoel Klein because of my confidence in his ability to be the kind of \nantitrust law enforcer the Justice Department and the country need to \nprotect consumers and ensure vigorous competition.\n  My confidence comes from Mr. Klein's record of great success during \nthe past nine months during which he has headed the Antitrust Division. \nHe has proven to be a strong advocate in promotion of competition. His \naccomplishments include suing Rochster Gas and Electric for impeding \ncompetition for electric power, suing to block a hospital merger that \nwould have raised prices for patients on Long Island, NY, obtaining \nindictments of an insulation company executive for price fixing, \nblocking an acquisition that would have created a dominant provider of \nasphalt concrete in New Hampshire and Vermont, and blocking an \nacquisition by Gulfstar Communications that would have created \nunacceptable media concentration.\n  His record also includes numerous guilty pleas and fines and \nsettlements from antitrust violators, including a record $5.6 million \npenalty from German and Brazilian companies for violating pre-merger \nnotification rules.\n  With an already strong record in an acting capacity, we can look \nforward to great things from Mr. Klein should he be confirmed by the \nSenate.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I must say I find some irony in the \ncriticisms I am hearing today regarding Mr. Klein's efforts to \nimplement the Telecommunications Act. In essence, it is being suggested \nthat Mr. Klein's interpretation of the Act would permit local Bell \ncompanies to enter the long distance market prematurely, or too easily.\n  In fact, however, Mr. Klein has weighed in against Bell entry into \nlong distance in the 2 applications that have, to date, come before \nhim--that is, the SBC and Ameritech applications. So it is curious to \nme that, while Mr. Klein's only actions in this regard have been \ncontrary to the Bells, his confirmation is being opposed on the ground \nthat he is being too lax on the Bells. This puzzles me.\n  But the broader point here is that Mr. Klein has demonstrated a \nstudied, fair approach to interpreting the law, as a general matter.\n  I may well disagree with particular decisions Mr. Klein makes, but I \nam persuaded he will make a top-flight antitrust chief. So I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this nomination.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise this evening to offer may support \nfor nomination of Joel Klein to assume the position of Assistant \nAttorney General of the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of \nJustice.\n  There has been much debate here this evening over my letter to Mr. \nKlein dated May 15, 1997, and his subsequent letter in response dated \nMay 20, 1997. I'd like to take this opportunity to offer my two cents.\n  When Mr. Klein's nomination was first reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee, I was concerned for three primary reasons. First, I had \nrecently read Mr. Klein's paper entitled ``Preparing for Competition in \na Deregulated Telecommunications Market,'' which he presented at the \nWillard Inter-Continental Hotel in Washington, DC, on March 11, 1997, \nand his interpretation in that paper of Section 271 of the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996 troubled me. Because I chair the \nSubcommittee on Communications, I felt that I could not, in good \nconscience, allow his nomination to move forward; consequently, I \nplaced a hold upon his nomination and sent a letter to him asking him \nto explain his statements concerning 271 applications. He promptly \nresponded with a comprehensive explanation of his statements, and, \nwhile I did not at that time nor do I now, necessarily agree with his \nassessment of the DoJ's role in the 271 application process, I \nunderstood the basis of his convictions.\n  Second, in addition to the questions raised in my letter, I also \ntelephoned him and expressed concern over what had been reported to \nme--both by press accounts and by a wide range of industry \nrepresentatives--as a total failure on the part of the Antitrust \nDivision to investigate allegations that Microsoft Corporation was in \nviolation of the Consent Decree entered into with the Department of \nJustice on August 21, 1995. I have here one of several newspaper \narticles detailing these allegations and seek unanimous consent for its \nintroduction into the Record. Subsequently, I met with Mr. Klein and he \nassured me that he would investigate these allegations.\n  Finally, I had been contacted by a number of radio broadcasters who \nhad complained that the Antitrust Division was misinterpreting the \nradio ownership provisions of the Telecommunications Act, but, after \nmeeting with Mr. Klein, and discussing the issue at length, I was \nsatisfied with his approach in this matter.\n  Consequently, based upon both his written and verbal responses to my \nconcerns. I am satisfied that he will be a fine Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for the Antitrust Division, and I support his nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if there is a cure for insomnia, as I said \nthe other day, this kind of debate surely must be it. This is so arcane \nand technical, to be talking about antitrust issues and VIII(C) and \nsection 271, and all of these issues that almost no one understands. \nThey seem not very important to many, I am sure. I suppose most who \nwould listen to this would think it incredibly boring. But, in fact, it \nis very, very important. We have a market system in this country that \nworks only when there is competition. When you don't have competition, \nthe market system doesn't work.\n  We have something called a referee several places in this Government: \nOne at Justice, in the Antitrust Division; we have a referee function \nin the Federal Trade Commission. In fact, we have 1,000 attorneys, \nroughly, I understand, whose job it is to deal with antitrust issues \nand the issues of monopoly and so on. The purpose is to make sure that \nwe don't have enterprises, where people come in and grab markets and \ndevelop trusts or monopolies and extract from the consumers a price \nthat is unfair, a price that is not set in an open market or an open \ncompetition. That is what this antitrust enforcement is about.\n  Mr. Joel Klein is, by all accounts, capable, smart, and a fellow with \na distinguished career. I have met him. I think he is a nice fellow. We \nshould not be voting on this nomination at this point. We should not \nhave been voting on a cloture motion on this nomination either, as we \ndid a week ago. Why? Because there are substantial questions that a \nnumber of us have raised about the nomination of Mr. Klein that have \nnot been answered. I feel I must vote against this nomination. I don't \nlike that position, but I don't intend to vote for a nomination with \nthe kind of questions that remain about a number of positions that have \nbeen taken, a number of things that have been written and said by this \npotential nominee on antitrust issues, that give me great concern.\n  I intend to speak only briefly because I think my colleagues have \ncovered this subject. After I complete my presentation I will yield \nback the remainder of our time. But I want to make a couple of \nimportant points.\n  The fight on the Telecommunications Act, which was the first major \nreform of the telecommunications laws in this country in five or six \ndecades, was a substantial battle between behemoths in our country--\norganizations that provided local service that are collecting tens and \ntens of billions of dollars of revenue, and organizations that are \ninvolved in long distance telephone service that are just as big. These \ntitans then clashed as we wrote a Telecommunications Act. One of my \nconcerns as we wrote this act was that we would end up, not with more \ncompetition, but, instead, with more concentration. If you have less \ncompetition and more concentration you will have higher prices.\n  My colleague from Nebraska held up something that was in the paper \nthis morning in Nebraska, ``So Far, Consumers Losers in Battle for \nDial-Tone Dollars; basic rates for telephone service are up for 93 \npercent of Nebraska\n\n[[Page S7687]]\n\nresidential customers the past year.'' I don't know much about \nNebraska, but I fear what will happen if we don't have aggressive \nantitrust enforcement at the Justice Department, something I fought \nvery hard for, as did the Senator from South Carolina, as did the \nSenator from Nebraska, when we passed the Telecommunications Act. We \nwere the ones standing out here on the floor talking about the VIII(C) \ntest. We are the ones who fought for a role for the Justice Department \nin all of these issues. Were it not for us, it would not have been \nthere.\n  Now, the Justice Department role is critical, as is the role of the \nFederal Communications Commission. If we have a Federal Communications \nCommission that does the wrong thing, or we have a Justice Department \nthat doesn't do the right thing in antitrust enforcement, I guarantee \nthe result of the Telecommunications Act last year will not be more \ncompetition and lower prices, it will be more concentration, fewer \ncompanies, and higher prices. I guarantee it.\n  This is important. This is about billions and billions and billions \nof dollars of additional charges that consumers may or may not have to \npay in the future, depending on antitrust enforcement in the Justice \nDepartment and on thoughtful, responsible decisions in the Federal \nCommunications Commission that properly implement the \nTelecommunications Act. There will be more discussion about that \nbecause we also have some disagreements about nominations to the \nFederal Communications Commission.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nat this point a letter that I have written to Mr. Joel Klein dated July \n15, asking some questions about the interpretations that have been made \non the VIII(C) test--the VIII(C) standards, rather, relative to the new \nstandard called ``irreversibly open to competition.''\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 15, 1997.\n     Mr. Joel Klein,\n     Acting Assistant Attorney General, U.S. Department of \n         Justice, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Klein: Last night, I received a letter from \n     Attorney General Janet Reno responding to a letter I sent to \n     President Clinton relating to issues that I have with respect \n     to your nomination. While I appreciate the fact that the \n     Administration has acted to respond to my inquiry, the \n     response was very general and lacks sufficient specificity to \n     alleviate my concerns.\n       I expect that you will be confirmed by the Senate on \n     Thursday. However, before I can vote in your favor, I still \n     need to resolve some concerns with respect to the role of the \n     Justice Department in the antitrust aspects of \n     telecommunications policy. In particular, your assurance to \n     other Senators that you reject the VIII(C) standard with \n     respect to the Justice Department's evaluation of a Section \n     271 application by a Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC) \n     needs further explanation. I would like a more detailed and \n     specific analysis from you on how the ``irreversibly open to \n     competition'' standard relates to the VIII(C) standard, which \n     was recommended in the Conference Report on the \n     Telecommunications Act of 1996. How does the ``irreversibly \n     open to competition'' standard differ from the VIII(C) \n     standard with respect to assessing adequate local competition \n     and the impact of RBOC entry into long distance services on \n     long distance competition.\n       In our meeting last week, you said that the standard that \n     you and the Antitrust Division have developed is stronger \n     than the VIII(C) standard, and more appropriate in your \n     judgement. I would like your analysis why this is the case. I \n     want to assure you that I have an open mind on this subject. \n     My position is not absolutely wedded to the VIII(C) standard \n     as the only test for evaluation of a Section 271 application \n     by an RBOC. Rather, I become concerned when an Administration \n     official adopts a position that differs from previous \n     Administration policy--which I fought for in the debate over \n     the Telecommunications Act--and I would like to better \n     understand the new position.\n       As I said on the Senate floor last Friday, I do not doubt \n     your abilities nor your integrity. I simply would like some \n     clarification on some issues that I fought hard to secure in \n     the Telecommunications Act at the request of the \n     Administration before the Senate votes on your nomination to \n     be Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division.\n       Thank you for your assistance and cooperation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Byron L. Dorgan,\n                                                      U.S. Senate.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I have sent Mr. Klein this letter.\n  Let me say this. It may well be that the irreversibly open to \ncompetition standard is a tougher standard, as they allege. I don't \nhave the foggiest idea. I don't know. Nobody knows. And I am not \nprepared to have someone say, ``I reject the standard that Congress \ndetermined to be the standard when it passed the Telecommunications \nAct, and I create my own standard,'' and none of us know what that \nmeans here--I am not prepared to say, ``Yes, let me sign up for that. \nLet me be a partner in that process.'' I am not willing to do it.\n  It may be, at the end stage of this process, maybe it is proven to us \nthat Mr. Klein was right. I hope so. I hope that is the case. But if he \nis not right, if we are right, what is going to happen is everybody in \nthis country who uses a telephone, everybody in this country who is a \nconsumer of telecommunications services, is going to end up paying \nhigher prices. That's the test.\n  Mr. President, one final point and then I will conclude. During the \ndebate on the Telecommunications Act, something happened to me that was \na real learning experience. All of us in the Senate have learning \nexperiences, despite the fact that some say we never seem to be able to \nlearn.\n  I offered an amendment on the floor of this Senate on the issue of \nconcentration, because the bill that came to the Senate said, ``Let's \ntake the limits off. Let's let these companies marry up. The more \nweddings the better. Let three companies become one. Let two companies \nbecome--let's have mergers, let them go off and get married--it is just \nterrific.'' That is what the bill was. So I offered an amendment on the \nfloor of the Senate and said, ``Let's put these limits back on at this \npoint.'' I don't support taking the limits off how many television \nstations you can own, how many radio stations you can own.\n  We had a vote and guess what? Guess who won? I won. My amendment \nprevailed. I was so surprised I could hardly stand, and it was about 4 \no'clock in the afternoon. The then-majority leader did not support my \nposition. He was on the opposite side. He changed his vote--had another \nMember change his vote, and asked for reconsideration after dinner, 3 \nhours later. And do you know what happened? There were four, five, or \nsix Members of the Senate that went out to have dinner--Lord only knows \nwhat they ate--they came back and 3 hours later they had some sort of \nepiphany that allowed them to vote against my amendment, so I lost.\n  I learned that winning around here sometimes means you only win for 3 \nhours. It felt good from 4 to 7, but the fact is I lost. Then the bill \nwent to conference and the bill had enough in it to make me feel that \nmaybe we will move in the right direction. But I would rue the day of \nsupporting any portion of this telecommunications act if we don't have \nthe most aggressive antitrust enforcement and the best decisions, the \nmost thoughtful decisions comporting with what we decide is in this act \nfrom the Federal Communications Commission.\n  I have a lot more to say but I know there are other times when \nMembers will be anxious to hear it, and I will save it for those times.\n  Let me compliment the Senator from South Carolina and the Senator \nfrom Nebraska.\n  Let me say a word, finally to the nominee. I expect the Senate will \ncast a favorable vote for this nominee. I hope this nominee succeeds. I \nhope this nominee proves that the standard that he has developed is a \ntough, no-nonsense standard. If he does, I will come to the floor at \nsome point in the future and say, ``Hurrah for you. I support what you \nhave done.'' I think we should not be voting on this nominee today. I \nwish we had more time. If we had more time, maybe some of these votes \nwould have been different.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and yield the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, do I understand the other side is willing \nto yield back the remainder of their time and we are prepared to yield \nback the remainder of our time?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we yield the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time.

HOLDER, JR., TO BE DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased today that we are finally \nvoting on the nomination of Mr. Eric Holder, nominated to serve as \nDeputy Attorney General. Mr. Holder was reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee unanimously on June 24. I support Mr. Holder for this \nposition, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of his \nconfirmation.\n  This is a position which is vitally important to the efficient and \neffective management of the Justice Department, as well as to this \ncommittee and its many dealings with the Department. The Deputy \nAttorney General plays a critical role in the day-to-day oversight, \nmanagement, and administration of the Justice Department, typically \nhandling the Department's most important and sensitive matters. The \ndeputy has ultimate responsibility for the office of the Solicitor \nGeneral, who represents the United States before the Supreme Court, as \nwell as all of the Department's civil and criminal divisions, \nincluding, for example, the civil rights, tax and antitrust divisions, \nthe criminal division, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and all \nU.S. attorneys. In short, a broad array of policy and law-enforcement \ndecisions that are critical not just to our legal system but to the \nNation as a whole, ultimately pass through the Deputy Attorney General.\n  Mr. Holder comes to us with a distinguished record in the law and in \nthe administration of justice. After graduating from Columbia Law \nSchool in 1976, he served for 12 years as a prosecutor in the public \nintegrity section of Justice Department's Criminal Division, after \nwhich he served for 5 years as a associate judge for the District of \nColumbia Superior Court. Since 1993, Mr. Holder has served as U.S. \nattorney for the District of Columbia, our Nation's largest U.S. \nAttorney's Office, which employs over 300 attorneys and prosecutes over \n10,000 cases each year. I believe these positions provide especially \nuseful experience for a person who would serve as Deputy Attorney \nGeneral.\n  I would like to emphasize how important it is to the Senate and the \nJudiciary Committee in particular, on both sides of the aisle, to have \na close and cooperative working relationship with the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral. I believe that one of the Department's greatest assets over \nthe past several years has been its former deputy, Jamie Gorelick, who \nsuccessfully fostered and maintained a cooperative, honest, and \nresponsive relationship with this committee. I cannot overestimate how \nvaluable this relationship has been in the virtually daily interactions \nbetween the committee and the Department, and I am hopeful, and \nconfident, that Eric Holder will, like his predecessor, work closely \nwith the committee to ensure that the Department maintains the highest \nlevel of professionalism and independence in its commitment to \nenforcing our Nation's laws. I have spoken with Mr. Holder on numerous \noccasions since his nomination, and am struck that, in addition to \nbeing eminently qualified for this position, he is a candid, forthright \nindividual of character and integrity who will be a positive force in \nsteering the Justice Department and in seeing to it that our laws our \nfaithfully and impartially enforced. The Nation expects and deserves \nnothing less, and I believe they will get as much from Mr. Holder.\n  While I have often given Attorney General Reno due credit for the \nfine work and accomplishments of the Justice Department, not the least \nof which is the recent trial and conviction of Timothy McVeigh, the \nDepartment, like any large agency, also has its share of problems, many \nof which fall on the Deputy Attorney General's desk.\n  Moreover, the Department has been, and inevitably will be, the \nsubject of some rather intense political pressure, and, quite frankly, \nI am somewhat disturbed by a growing sense that, in a number of \ninstances, there is at least the appearance that political pressures \nmay have won out over the fair and impartial enforcement of the law. \nAfter a rather public display by the White House of its displeasure \nthat the Attorney General had previously sought the appointment of four \nindependent counsels, we now see the Attorney General steadfastly \nrefusing to appoint an independent counsel to conduct the campaign \nfinance investigation--the one case where an independent counsel is \nmost called for to ensure public confidence in the investigation and \nthe Department itself. And, after the Attorney General expressly \nadopted one interpretation of the independent counsel statute, and I \nchallenged that interpretation, we now receive a letter explaining that \nshe has, notwithstanding statements to the contrary, been applying the \nsame standard I articulated. The Justice Department issues bizarre \nstatements seeking to put particular spins on information disclosed by \nChairman Thompson in connection with the campaign fundraising hearings. \nThe Justice Department has filed briefs taking rather dubious positions \nin politically sensitive cases, including its appeal brief in the \nlitigation over California's proposition 209, and its very recent brief \ndefending Mrs. Clinton's invocation of a governmental attorney client \nprivilege in response to independent counsel Starr's request for \ncertain documents. And the FBI Director is in the position of refusing \nto brief the White House on national security matters because of its \npending investigation. While each of these instances, standing alone, \nmight have a legitimate explanation, taken together they create an \nappearance that politics is influencing what should be a neutral, \nindependent enforcement of our Nation's laws.\n\n[[Page S7689]]\n\n  Public confidence in our legal system, and in our Government itself, \ndemands nothing short of this.\n  Mr. Holder has given me his commitment to maintaining his own \nindependent judgment, and to seeing to it that the law is fairly and \nimpartially interpreted and enforced as it should be, even when doing \nso may lead to results that are not politically expedient. That \ncommitment will be as important as ever for the Department as it faces \nnumerous challenges in the coming years. I believe Mr. Holder will \nremain true to his word, and urge my colleagues to support him.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the President on his nomination \nof Eric H. Holder, Jr., and am delighted that the Senate is acting to \nconfirm this nominee to be Deputy Attorney General of the United \nStates.\n  It was with concerted effort that Senator Hatch and I worked to \nensure that Eric Holder was reported by the Judiciary Committee and \nready for Senate confirmation to the important position of Deputy \nAttorney General of the United States before the Senate adjourned 3 \nweeks ago.\n  The President's nomination of Mr. Holder to the second highest \nposition at the Department of Justice was reported to the Senate \nwithout a single dissent on June 24. This nomination could and should \nhave been approved by the Senate before it adjourned for the last \nextended recess for the Fourth of July. This nomination is strongly \nsupported by Senator Hatch, chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n  There was and is no Democratic hold on this nomination. The delay on \nthe Republican side in considering this nomination remains unexplained. \nI urged on July 10 and July 11 that he not be held hostage to other \nnominations. I am glad we have finally--finally after 3 weeks--freed \nthis nomination.\n  Eric Holder has proven his dedication to effective law enforcement. \nAs a former prosecutor myself, I appreciate Mr. Holder's distinguished \ncareer in law enforcement.\n  Shortly after his graduation from Columbia Law School, Mr. Holder \njoined the Department of Justice as part of the Attorney General's \nHonors Program. He was assigned to the newly formed public integrity \nsection in 1976, where he worked for 12 years investigating and \nprosecuting corruption. While at the public integrity section, Mr. \nHolder participated in a number of prosecutions and appeals involving \nsuch defendants as the State Treasurer of Florida, a former Ambassador \nto the Dominican Republic, a local judge in Philadelphia, an assistant \nU.S. attorney in New York City, an FBI agent, and a ``capo'' in an \norganized crime family. He received a number of awards for outstanding \nperformance and special achievement from the Department of Justice.\n  In 1988, President Reagan nominated and the Senate confirmed Mr. \nHolder to be an associate judge of the Superior Court of the District \nof Columbia, where he served for the next 5 years. In his 5 years on \nthe bench, Judge Holder presided over hundreds of criminal trials. In \n1993, President Clinton nominated and the Senate confirmed Eric Holder \nto the important post of U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia. As \nUnited States Attorney for one of the largest U.S. Attorney's offices \nin the Nation, Mr. Holder has supervised 300 lawyers involved in \ncriminal, civil, and appellate cases. He has functioned as both the \nlocal district attorney and the Federal prosecutor. He has been active \nin community affairs. For more than a decade, he has been a member of \nConcerned Black Men, an organization seeking to help young people in \nthe District of Columbia. He is involved in a number of the group's \nactivities, including the efficacy program and the pregnancy prevention \neffort. He has participated in the D.C. Street Law program and is \nactive in the See Forever Foundation and the National Foundation for \nTeaching Entrepreneurship. He is cochair of Project PACT to reduce \nyouth violence and has been instrumental in the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice's outreach efforts to the D.C. community.\n  In 1994 he received the Pioneer Award from the National Black \nProsecutors Association. In 1995 his contributions were recognized when \nhe received awards from the District of Columbia Bar Association, the \nGreater Washington Urban League, the American Jewish Congress, and Phi \nBeta Sigma fraternity. Last year he received awards from the D.C. \nChapter of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement \nExecutives, George Washington University, Columbia College, the \nFederation of Citizens Associations of D.C., Omega Psi Phi fraternity, \nthe Brotherhood of Shiloh Men, McDonalds and the Asian Pacific Bar \nAssociation.\n  I look forward to working with him in his new position as Deputy \nAttorney General. I regret the unnecessary delays that have stalled \nthis important nomination for the last 3 weeks on the Senate Executive \nCalendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Eric H. Holder, Jr., of the District of \nColumbia, to be Deputy Attorney General?

Mr. President, I want to commend the chairman of the \nTreasury, Postal Service Subcommittee, the distinguished Senator from \nColorado, for the good work he has done today on this legislation and \nthe cooperation he has received from the ranking member, Senator Kohl. \nI want to thank the Senate for the work that has been done this week.\n  We have completed four appropriations bills and we are down to an \nidentifiable, finite list of amendments on the Treasury, Postal Service \nbill. It has taken cooperation from all the Senators and a lot of \nsupport from the leader on the Democratic side of the aisle. I think we \nshould commend each other when we do good work like this. I appreciate \nthe support we have had.\n  In recognition of that, I think rather than trying to drive on to \nconclusion tonight and perhaps having votes later on tonight, we will \ngo forward tonight with debate on all remaining amendments, and then we \nwill ask unanimous consent to stack the votes beginning at 5:15 on \nMonday.\n  Also, on Monday, we will begin the HUD-VA appropriations bill. For \nthose that are interested, on two other subjects, at the request of a \nnumber of Senators on both sides, so that we can try to continue to see \nif we can work out an agreement, we have moved the tuna-dolphin issue \noff until next week. We hope an agreement can be worked out, or a \ncompromise. If it cannot be, we will probably have a cloture vote on \nthat on Friday of next week.\n  With regard to FDA reform, we have a very good bill that was reported \nfrom the education-labor committee. Senator Jeffords has been working \nwith\n\n[[Page S7690]]\n\nother interested Senators on both sides of the aisle and on both sides \nof the issue. We are hoping that a time agreement can be worked out on \nthat. If we get a time agreement, we will try to take that bill up, \nperhaps, Tuesday or Wednesday.\n  If we get the unanimous-consent request, there would be no further \nvotes tonight or Friday. The next recorded votes would be at 5:15 on \nMonday. We will resume consideration of the treasury, postal \nappropriations bill. Earlier today, the managers were able to reach an \nagreement to limit amendments to that bill--first-degree amendments, I \nbelieve. Therefore, the Senate will remain in session this evening \nuntil the amendments have been debated. The votes, then, will be \npostponed to occur until 5:15 on Monday.\n  Mr. President, I believe that is all we need to announce at this \npoint, Mr. President. So we can go back to the Treasury, Postal Service \nbill.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield for one comment?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Although we will not be in session tomorrow, we will \nhave a markup of a series of bills for the Appropriations Committee \nstarting at 9:45.\n  Mr. LOTT. And there will also be considerable work done tomorrow in \nthe two conferences that are pending, as we communicate between the \nCongress and administration on that. I don't believe a unanimous-\nconsent request is required on this issue, announcing when the next \nvotes would occur.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is it the majority leader's intention to get the tuna-\ndolphin bill resolved in one fashion or another?\n  Mr. LOTT. The Senator may not have heard. I announced that in \ndeference to the request of a number of Senators who are trying to work \nout a reasonable compromise, we have pushed that issue off. But it is \nour intent that if we don't get a compromise worked out, we would have \na cloture vote on that on Friday of next week. I want it understood by \nSenators that we should expect to be in session next Friday. So please \ndon't be planning on leaving Thursday night.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If the majority leader will yield, I have one further \nquestion. If that cloture vote does not succeed, do we intend to \ncontinue to debate the tuna-dolphin issue until its conclusion?\n  Mr. LOTT. That would be my preference.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator very much for yielding to me.\n  I would like to inform the leader that I think there is a real great \nopportunity to resolve this problem. Senator John Kerry has great \ninterest in it. I have been working with Senator Smith and Senator \nBiden, and many other Senators. We have some really good support for \nreal compromise. We feel that it can be compromised. I am very hopeful \nwe can work together to resolve this. But, if not, we are prepared to \nhave a showdown on the matter, if we have to.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could just say, Mr. President, that I appreciate the \nsuggestion that a good compromise could be worked out. And that is why \nI have not forced the issue this week. I originally planned to have a \ncloture vote on Friday, probably. But there were requests that we not \ndo that both from the Senator from California and others.\n  I am not interested in trying to make an issue here. This is not an \nissue I am directly involved in, although it came out of the Commerce \nCommittee, which I serve on. I think it is an important issue, an \nimportant conservation issue. It is an issue that affects jobs and \nfishing areas. Senator Daschle and I both have been receiving calls \nfrom the President of the United States saying, please get this \nlegislation up and get it to a conclusion.\n  So my desire is to try to be helpful on this one. At the request of \nthe administration, I am looking for a compromise that will allow us to \nget it completed in a reasonable period of time. But, if we can't do \nthat, then we will just go with the alternative.\n  I yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If I could just add to that, I say to the majority \nleader, the fact is that the administration wants this bill. The fact \nis, this is an 11-nation agreement. The fact is, the majority of the \nenvironmental community in the United States of America and throughout \nthe world, including Green Peace, want this bill. That is why I asked \nthe majority leader, and, because of its importance, we were willing to \ndebate this issue through until it is done.\n  I believe that it is also important to point out that the majority \nleader had planned on having a cloture vote and debate today. It was at \nthe request of the ranking Democrat on the Commerce Committee, Senator \nHollings, that he delay this for an another entire week after many \nweeks of negotiations--fruitless, I might add. And if the Senator from \nCalifornia feels that the way to pursue any issue is through filibuster \nand debate rather than bringing up her amendments and having them voted \non and the issue disposed of, that is fine with me. But I strongly \nsupport the majority leader in saying that we will debate this issue \nuntil it is resolved. It is too important, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I think probably at this point I would be \nwell-advised to yield the floor and let the Senators talk directly to \neach other.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator very much.\n  Mr. President, I just didn't want the Record to go by without stating \nmy disagreement with my friend from Arizona. We have 85 environmental \ngroups, including the Sierra Club and the Humane Society, on the side \nof reasonable compromise. This is an area where I don't have to agree \nwith the administration. Sometimes those occasions do occur.\n  Senator Biden and I teamed up in 1990. We passed the Dolphin \nProtection Act. This bill overturns it. Frankly, it was done in a way \nthat should have brought the parties together in the first place. So I \nthink we are doing this a little bit backwards in the sense that the \ncompromise, I think, is going to come.\n  By the way, I have no problem with bringing up the bill at any point. \nWe are prepared to do that. So, if you want to bring up the cloture \nvote on the motion to proceed to the bill, we are prepared to do that. \nBut we think we can compromise this. We see Senator John Kerry now \nplaying a lead role--Senator Biden, I, Senator Smith, and others on \nboth sides of the aisle, in a bipartisan way, are ready to put forward \nan excellent compromise. If we get that, this bill can go through in \nmoments.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes. I yield to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the leader.\n  I would like to comment on this issue because I think it is \ncritically important, as chair of the Ocean and Fisheries Subcommittee. \nThe fact is, the administration has requested that this issue be \naddressed expeditiously because of the agreement that we have entered \ninto with 11 other countries.\n  Second, we attempted to work with Senator Kerry and others on the \ncommittee for a compromise on this issue. To no avail, I might add. But \nirrespective of that, we incorporated a number of changes in the \nlegislation that were recommended by Senator Kerry and others that I \nthink makes substantial progress on the issues that have been raised by \nthe Senator from California and others. But there is a point at which \nit contravenes the agreement that had been reached between the United \nStates and these other countries.\n\n  I hope we will have a chance to resolve these issues and to work on \nit, but we have to have good-faith efforts on the other side in order \nto resolve these issues without compromising the agreement.\n  I should also mention there are a number of environmental \nconservation groups that are endorsing this agreement because they \nthink this is the best way to protect not only dolphin and tuna but \nother species that have been affected because of the status quo and \nbecause of the current law.\n\n[[Page S7691]]\n\n  I should add other methods have affected the byproduct of other \nspecies to the detriment of a significant number of different fish that \notherwise will continue to go on in this effort if we do not change it \nwith this agreement.\n  So I hope that the Senator from California will work in a good-faith \neffort to reach an agreement on this issue. Otherwise, it will be lost.\n  I would also ask the President to work very vigorously. If he wants \nthis legislation to come through, I think he certainly has to work to \nmake sure that it does.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we are going to have this debate next week, \nI presume.\n  I thank everyone for all of their good efforts.\n  Please allow me to complete my unanimous-consent request, and then we \nwill complete the debate on the Treasury, Postal Service appropriations \nbill.\n  I want to emphasize this again. The Senate will next consider after \nthis bill the VA-HUD appropriations bill on Monday, and votes will \noccur on amendments and passage of the treasury, postal bill at 5:15.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all amendments must be offered and \ndebated with respect to the Treasury, Postal Service tonight, and those \nvotes then would occur on a case-by-case basis at 5:15 on Monday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object.\n  Mr. LOTT. Good.\n  Mr. COATS. I do not want to be oversolicitous here, but I think \nanybody watching understands the difficulty of the majority leader in \ntrying to schedule issues for the Senate to debate. But I just want to \nsay that the majority leader has gone out of his way to give us a \nfamily-friendly schedule and some certainty in our schedule by the way \nhe has scheduled issues, by the way he has scheduled votes with a \ncertainty of votes and provided Members an opportunity to go home and \nhave dinner with their families, albeit a somewhat late dinner, but we \nare used to late dinners.\n  I just think this is an example of the difficulty of doing what he is \ndoing. But he is doing a terrific job of it. I appreciate that. I might \nhave considered staying in the Senate if I had known it was going to be \nthis family-friendly.\n  Mr. LOTT. I tried to tell you.\n  I would be glad to yield to the Senator from Indiana any time. I \nappreciate his comments.\n  Mr. President, I have a unanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank Senator Coats very much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, before he leaves, I do want to thank the \nmajority leader and the minority leader for their cooperation with our \ncommittee.\n  This has been a historic week for the Appropriations Committee. With \nthe cooperation of my good friend from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, and \nthe chairman of the subcommittees and the ranking members, we will now \ncomplete debate on five separate bills in 4 days. They have all passed \nby sheer weight of bipartisanship and cooperation and willingness to \nwork together to work out problems.\n  I am hopeful that we will see the same thing next week when we again \nwant to bring before the Senate at least five bills. We will have them \nready to go before the Senate next week, and we will try to work them \nin according with the schedule.\n  But it is imperative, if we are going to avoid the problem of an \nenormous continuing resolution that we passed in the last Congress, \nthat we get these bills to conference before we go off on the August \nrecess so that the work can be done. Not all of the staff will have to \nstay here for the whole month. But we will have them at least ready to \ngo to conference when we come back. They will be preconferenced during \nthe period of August, and I think we will avoid any continuing \nresolution.\n  So I am, again, grateful to everyone here. But I hope the Senate \nitself is making history, and it is doing so in really the best spirit \nI have seen in the Senate for many years.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

That amendment is pending.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, the underlying first-degree amendment to \nNo. 921 has been cleared on both sides, and I urge its immediate \nadoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, it has been cleared on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 921) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. KOHL.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 22, lines 15 and 16, strike ``Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law,'' and insert ``Hereafter,''.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to thank the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Treasury, General Government, and Civil Service, Mr. \nCampbell, and the ranking member, Mr. Kohl, for their assistance with \nthis important clarifying amendment to the fiscal year 1998 Treasury \nand general government appropriations bill. They and their staffs have \ndone excellent work in putting this bill together, and they are to be \ncommended for their leadership.\n  The purpose of this amendment should be clarified for the Record. \nSection 107 of the bill, as approved by the Committee on \nAppropriations, states, ``Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \nno field support reorganization of the Internal Revenue Service shall \nbe undertaken in Aberdeen, South Dakota, until the Internal Revenue \nService toll-free help phone line assistance program reaches at least \nan 80 percent service level. The Commissioner shall submit to Congress \na report and the GAO shall certify to Congress that the 80 percent \nservice level has been met.'' Identical language was included in \nappropriations legislation approved last year for fiscal year 1997.\n  It has always been my intention that this language be considered \npermanent unless specifically changed by an act of Congress. The \nobvious intention of Congress in approving this provision is that \nreductions in force should not take place in Aberdeen until South \nDakotans can be assured of being able to access assistance from IRS \nthrough the national telephone lines. It has not been the intention of \nCongress that this provision should expire at the end of the fiscal \nyear for which the funds of this act are being appropriated. To make \nthis crystal clear and explicit in the statute itself, my amendment \nreplaces the phrase ``notwithstanding any other provision of law'' with \nthe word ``hereafter.'' As the General Accounting Office states in its \npublication, Principles of Federal Appropriations Law, Second Edition, \nVolume I, ``A provision contained in an annual appropriation act is not \nto be construed to be permanent legislation unless the language used \ntherein or the nature of the provision makes it clear that Congress \nintended it to be permanent. The presumption can be overcome if the \nprovision uses language indicating futurity, such as `hereafter.' ''\n\n[[Page S7692]]\n\n  Mr. President, this legislation ensures that no reorganization of the \nAberdeen, South Dakota, IRS office shall take place until the IRS is \ncapable of providing service on a national level that equates to the \nhigh quality service currently provided in Aberdeen.\n  Again, I wish to thank my colleagues for their help and consideration \non this issue.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared on both \nsides. I ask for its immediate adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. The amendment has been cleared by the majority side, \nMr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. KOHL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, at this time I would like to yield some \ntime to Senator Collins, who would like to speak on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, first I express my appreciation to the \nvery able managers of this legislation, Senator Campbell and Senator \nKohl, for their willingness to accept the amendment which has been \nproposed by myself, Senator Shelby and Senator Grassley.\n  Let me just briefly explain the amendment and its purpose.\n  This amendment would prohibit the inspector general of the Department \nof Treasury from spending any money on consulting contracts, and it \nwould make a corresponding reduction in the inspector general's budget \nby cutting it by $1 million.\n  Let me first make clear that this amendment is not intended to affect \nin any way any audit, inspection, investigation or law enforcement \nfunction of the Inspector General's Office. The reduction proposed in \nmy amendment is intended to be taken from administrative expenses, \nspecifically the budget classification called ``Other services,'' which \nis funded in the President's budget at $2.4 million. My amendment would \nleave $1.4 million available for that classification.\n  I am offering this amendment today because there is clear, disturbing \nand credible evidence that the incumbent inspector general has abused \nher contracting authority by spending taxpayer dollars on management \nstudies of questionable value and of excessive cost.\n  For example, in April of this year, press accounts revealed that the \ninspector general had let a soul-source contract for a management study \nof her office. This $90,000 contract was awarded without the benefit of \nfair and open competition, and it was awarded to a friend of hers, \nsomeone who had in fact recommended her for the position of inspector \ngeneral.\n  Mr. President, I have personally reviewed the final product of this \ncontract. It is a 20-page report costing taxpayers $4,500 per page.\n  Another example of questionable activity occurred in September of \n1995 when the inspector general awarded another contract, again without \nfull and open competition, for $85,000 that subsequently ballooned to \ncost more than $300,000. My amendment would curtail these kinds of \nabuses in contracting by limiting the amount of funds available for \nthis purpose and by prohibiting the inspector general from spending \nmoney on consulting services. In the meantime, without prejudging the \nultimate outcome, the permanent subcommittee on investigations, of \nwhich I am the Chair, will continue its in-depth investigation into the \ncontracting practices of this office.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record several \nnewspaper reports documenting these contracting abuses.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Treasury Ethics Watchdog Gave No-Bid Contract to Associate\n\n                           (By John Solomon)\n\n       Washington.--Shortly after becoming the Treasury \n     Department's ethics watchdog, Valerie Lau arranged a no-bid \n     contract for a longtime acquaintance who had written the \n     White House recommending her for her job.\n       Lau's involvement has prompted a rare congressional inquiry \n     into a department's inspector general, an official whose \n     normal duties are policing the conduct of others and guarding \n     against waste, fraud and abuse.\n       Documents obtained by The Associated Press show that Lau \n     wrote a Treasury contracting office on Dec. 11, 1994, to \n     select auditor Frank Sato to conduct a management review \n     study of her office. Sato had proposed the study only the day \n     before.\n       Lau asked that the contract be a ``sole source \n     procurement,'' not to be competitively bid because of an \n     ``unusual and compelling urgency'' for the review, the \n     documents state.\n       Treasury quickly approved a $113,000 contract for Sato & \n     Associates. The firm ultimately was paid $90,776, the \n     documents show.\n       A year earlier, Sato had written the White House personnel \n     office to recommend Lau ``very highly'' for an inspector \n     general's job, saying he had known her since 1980 and found \n     her to be ``a uniquely qualified person with high integrity \n     and character.''\n       Treasury officials say Sato was chosen for the contract \n     because he was a former federal inspector general ``uniquely \n     qualified'' to review Lau's office and make recommendations \n     to make it more efficient.\n       The disclosure marks the second time in a week that Lau's \n     conduct has come under scrutiny. Last Thursday, she admitted \n     she gave inaccurate testimony to Congress but blamed the \n     error on bad information from her staff.\n       Congressional investigators are reviewing the Sato \n     contract.\n       ``At best, in this case, there is an appearance of \n     impropriety that undermines the public confidence in this IG. \n     This watchdog needs to be watched,'' said Sen. Charles \n     Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of one the Senate's investigative \n     subcommittees.\n       Lau refused to be interviewed. But in written answers to \n     Congress, she acknowledged she developed ``professional \n     acquaintances'' with Sato and another partner in his firm \n     over the years as they served as government auditors.\n       She did not mention Sato's letter of recommendation to the \n     White House. Treasury spokesman Howard Schloss said Lau was \n     aware of the letter but had not solicited it.\n       Federal ethics regulations advise employees to avoid \n     actions that ``give rise to an appearance of * * * giving \n     preferential treatment'' to someone with whom they have an \n     outside relationship.\n       The regulations advise that ``an employee whose duties \n     would affect the financial interests of a friend, relative or \n     person with whom he is affiliated with in a nongovernmental \n     capacity'' should consult with a third party to avoid the \n     appearance of a conflict that would make a ``reasonable \n     person'' question their impartiality.\n       Lau told Congress she chose Sato's firm because she knew he \n     and his associated had ``unique qualifications'' as former \n     inspectors general to provide ``expertise in the area of \n     audit, investigations and managing'' her office.\n       Treasury officials could not immediately answer whether Lau \n     consulted a third party, disclosed her outside relationship \n     with Sato or reviewed the ethics rules before proceeding with \n     the contract.\n       Sato worked for almost a decade as an inspector general at \n     two different federal departments, then as an auditor at the\n\n[[Page S7693]]\n\n     Deloitte & Touche accounting firm before starting his own \n     business. He did not return a message left at his home \n     Friday.\n       In his May 1993 letter recommending Lau, he told the White \n     House he had known Lau since 1980 and worked with her ``on \n     both professional accounting/financial management and Asian \n     American issues.''\n       ``I have found her to not only be a top professional, but a \n     kind of person you enjoy working with,'' he wrote.\n       Lau, a former congressional auditor, was appointed the \n     following year to Treasury inspector general, among positions \n     Sato recommended to presidential personnel.\n       She began the job in late 1994. Documents show she began \n     inquiring in early December about the possibility of a \n     management review study, and on Dec. 10 received a formal \n     proposal from Sato.\n       The next day she wrote the contracting office recommending \n     Sato for the contract. ``Please let me know what I need to \n     provide next,'' Lau scribbled in the handwritten note.\n       On Dec. 12, Lau submitted a formal contract proposal. \n     Documents show it borrowed much of the language from the plan \n     Sato had sent her just two days earlier.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Apr. 24, 1997]\n\n Senator Seeks Probe of Treasury Official--At Issue Is No-Bid Contract \n                    Awarded to Longtime Acquaintance\n\n                  (By Stephen Barr and Clay Chandler)\n\n       The chairman of a Senate panel on government oversight \n     yesterday requested an inquiry into allegations that Treasury \n     Department Inspector General Valerie Lau arranged to award a \n     no-bid contract to a longtime acquaintance who had \n     recommended that she be hired for her job.\n       Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), Chairman of the \n     Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on administrative \n     oversight and the courts, made the request, saying that if \n     the allegations were true, ``the IG's action raises \n     appearance questions of preferential treatment and a quid pro \n     quo.''\n       A Treasury official, who asked not to be identified said \n     the contract was awarded on merit, Lau was seeking a speedy \n     review of her office to improve its ability to conduct a \n     department-wide audit, a crucial part of a government-wide \n     financial audit mandated by Congress, the official said.\n       Within weeks after her 1994 Senate confirmation, Lau \n     selected Frank S. Sato, an auditor and former inspector \n     general, to conduct a management study of her office and its \n     operations, Treasury Department documents released by \n     Grassley's office show, Lau's office is responsible for \n     preventing waste, fraud and abuse in the department.\n       Lau told Treasury procurement officials on Dec. 7, 1994, \n     that she had ``identified an immediate need'' for a \n     management study. Three days later, in a letter to Lau, Sato \n     outlined his proposal for the study.\n       The next day, Dec. 11, Lau recommended Sato for the job in \n     a handwritten note. In documents attached to the note and in \n     a subsequent memo to procurement officials, Lau indicated \n     that the contract would be awarded without competitive bids \n     and for a fixed price.\n       Treasury officials approved $113,000 for the contract and \n     eventually paid $90,776 to Sato & Associates, a Treasury \n     spokesman said.\n       In his contract proposal, Sato listed his qualifications, \n     including experience as inspector general at the Veterans \n     Administration (now the Department of Veterans Affairs) and \n     Transportation Department during the 1980s. Sato said his \n     ``project team'' would include at least one other former \n     inspector general, Charles L. Dempsey, who investigated the \n     Reagan-era scandals at the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development.\n       The year before Sato received the contract, he wrote a \n     letter to a White House personnel official urging that Lau be \n     considered for inspector general jobs at Treasury, the \n     Transportation Department or the Office of Personnel \n     Management.\n       Sato said he had known Lau since 1980, when she worked for \n     the General Accounting Office, the congressional watchdog \n     agency, in San Francisco, Sato described Lau as a ``top \n     professional'' with ``high integrity and character.''\n       In Lau's prepared testimony submitted for her Senate \n     confirmation hearing, she praised Sato as one of the \n     government's first inspector generals who set high standards \n     for the watch-dog positions created Congress in 1978.\n       Grassley made his request for a review of the Sato contract \n     in a letter to Robert M. Bryant, who heads the FBI's Criminal \n     Investigative Division.\n       The letter was addressed to Bryant in his role as chairman \n     of the Integrity Committee, the arm of the President's \n     Council on Integrity and Efficiency that handles allegations \n     of misconduct against inspector generals. If the Integrity \n     Committee decides an allegation warrants investigation, it \n     turns the probe over to the Justice Department.\n       Grassely said no-bid contracts ``are usually reserved for \n     matters of `unusual and compelling urgency.' This contract \n     clearly was neither unusual nor urgent.'' He asked Bryant to \n     determine whether the awarding of the contract violated any \n     laws regulations or ethics codes.\n       Sato did not return telephone calls seeking comment. The \n     Treasury official said Lau had already referred the contract \n     issue to the Integrity Committee for review.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Apr. 28, 1997]\n\n            Treasury Memo Cautioned Rubin on Lau's Problems\n\n                            (By Ruth Larson)\n\n       Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and the FBI were \n     notified more than three months ago about serious ethics \n     problems involving Treasury Department Inspector General \n     Valerie Lau, Treasury sources say.\n       Treasury Department spokesman Howard Schloss said he \n     believed the Jan. 15 internal memo, a copy of which was \n     obtained last week by The Washington Times, was referred to \n     the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency, which \n     oversees performance of inspectors general from various \n     Cabinet departments.\n       ``It's my understanding that nothing's been done on this \n     matter,'' said Mr. Schloss, who declined further comment on \n     the pace of the inquiry or the allegations against Miss Lau. \n     Questions for Miss Lau were directed to Mr. Schloss.\n       Titled ``Mismanagement and Abuse of Power,'' the four-page \n     memorandum delivered to Mr. Rubin's office detailed \n     questionable travel, contracting and administrative expenses \n     in the inspector general's office under Miss Lau's \n     management.\n       ``We are supposed to be independent and detect waste, fraud \n     and abuse,'' the memo reads. ``We are not supposed to be \n     practicing waste, fraud, and abuse.''\n       The memo also questioned the inspector general's \n     willingness to tackle difficult or sensitive audits and \n     investigations of some of the government's most critical \n     agencies. Miss Lau's jurisdiction includes the Internal \n     Revenue Service, the U.S. Secret Service, and the Bureau of \n     Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.\n       The inspector general's office ``avoids at all costs \n     conducting hard-hitting, meaningful audits and \n     investigations,'' according to the memo. ``It is widely \n     perceived that we avoid controversial areas and political \n     issues that would require the IG to take a strong stand on \n     certain issues.''\n       The document was also given to an FBI investigator \n     associated with the Council on Integrity and Efficiency. That \n     agent declined to comment on the memo or disclose whether an \n     inquiry is under way.\n       The apparent lack of action at the agency in the wake of \n     the memo has caught the attention of Sen. Charles E. \n     Grassley, Iowa Republican and a member of the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee.\n       Mr. Grassley plans to prod the FBI for an update on the Lau \n     memo, his office said on Friday.\n       The Jan. 15 memo said Miss Lau:\n       Used more than $200,000 worth of employee time and travel \n     resources to develop a ``mission vision, value statement'' \n     for her office.\n       The value statement ultimately said the mission of the \n     inspector general's office is to ``conduct independent \n     audits, investigations and reviews'' that help ``promote \n     economy, efficiency and effectiveness, and prevent and detect \n     fraud and abuse.''\n       Hired an outside consulting firm called KLS to address \n     problems with diversity and employee morale.\n       A Treasury official said Friday that $292,076 had been \n     spent to date on the two-year contract, out of a possible \n     $343,650. The contract runs through September.\n       Steered a sole-source management contract worth $90,776 to \n     a firm owned by Frank Sato, a former inspector general and \n     long-time acquaintance of Miss Lau's who wrote the White \n     House to recommend her for her current post.\n       Made frequent trips to the West Coast, purportedly for \n     business, but widely perceived by employees as chances to \n     visit her family in the San Francisco area, ``at a time when \n     the agency was strapped for travel funds.''\n       Since the Jan. 15 memo, subsequent memos provided to the \n     FBI reported that * * * questionable behavior.\n       At a February 1996 meeting, for example, an employee \n     complained that morale was suffering and there was ``not \n     enough warmth'' in the agency.\n       ``Ms. Lau then responded by saying she would show him some \n     `warmth,' and she proceeded to physically sit in [the \n     employee's] lap, placed her arms round him, and gave him a \n     big hug,'' one memo said.\n       Employees said one incident where Miss Lau failed to \n     investigate forcefully came when she refused to allow her IRS \n     Oversight Audit staff to investigate problems with the IRS' \n     computer upgrade and reports of widespread employee browsing \n     through celebrity tax returns.\n       In fact, since Miss Lau took over the office in October \n     1994, funds recovered have dropped from $201 million in \n     fiscal 1994 to $25.9 million in fiscal 1996.\n       The number of audit reports issued has dropped as well, \n     from 158 reports in 1994 to 106 in 1996.\n       Miss Lau has told Congress that the lower numbers are due \n     to auditors' efforts to comply with new federal guidelines.\n       Meanwhile, in an effort to boost employee morale, Miss Lau \n     hired the consulting firm KLS in September 1995.\n       In a written response to a House panel's questions, Miss \n     Lau said: ``The sensitivity of identified diversity issues \n     and perceived internal problems was such that an objective, \n     outside source was desirable.''\n       The KLS contract was awarded using ``other than full and \n     open competition'' because ``the agency's need is of such \n     unusual and compelling urgency that it precludes \n     competition,'' she wrote.\n\n[[Page S7694]]\n\n       Employees say the scope of $344,000 contract has been \n     amended since the original award and now includes revamping \n     the office's employee performance.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                     [From U.S. News, July 2, 1997]\n\n                    Treasury IG Worked for Democrats\n\n                           (By John Solomon)\n\n       Washington.--The Treasury Department's ethics watchdog, \n     already under scrutiny for a no-bid contract to an associate, \n     authorized skipping normal competitive bidding procedures for \n     a second consulting contract, official say.\n       With Congress beginning to investigate contracting by the \n     office of Treasury Inspector General Valerie Lau, documents \n     and interviews also shed new light on Lau's background and \n     her office's work. For instance, Lau:\n       Was given an opportunity to apply for a Clinton \n     administration job in 1993 while working as a consultant for \n     the Democratic Party. Inspectors general, though appointed by \n     the president, by law are designed to be politically \n     independent.\n       Was instructed by the No. 2 Treasury Department official to \n     rewrite one of the most high-profile reports of her tenure--\n     the investigation into law enforcement's attendance at \n     racist, drunken Good Ol' Boys Roundups--because it lacked \n     basic investigatory information.\n       The scrutiny of Lau's office is an unusual twist for a \n     watchdog normally charged with policing against waste, fraud \n     and abuse throughout the Treasury Department.\n       Lau declined to be interviewed, but her office provided \n     written answers to questions posed by The Associated Press.\n       The AP reported last month that shortly after taking over \n     as IG in late 1994, Lau approved a $90,000 no-bid, sole-\n     source management review contract to an associate who has \n     written the White House recommending her for the job.\n       Documents show Lau approved the sole-source contract to \n     Sato & Associates on the grounds that the government would be \n     ``seriously injured'' if the contract was put up for bidding.\n       Officials say that in 1995, Lau's office again approved \n     skipping competitive bidding procedures to hire a consultant \n     to boost morale among workers.\n       Lau's office says it approved the $271,000 contract to the \n     consulting firm KLS under a legal provision that permits \n     ``other than full and open competition when the agency's need \n     is such unusual and compelling urgency.''\n       The IG office said it skipped the bidding ``to prevent \n     deterioration in workforce effectiveness' and because a \n     survey it conducted ``suggested a prompt response was \n     necessary'' to low worker morale.\n       The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations is \n     investigating a variety of issues surrounding Lau's office, \n     including the noncompetitive contracts and the performance of \n     her office.\n       ``I consider the allegations surrounding the Treasury \n     Department's inspector general to be very troubling,'' Sen. \n     Susan M. Collins, R-Maine, said.\n       In a January 1996 memo, Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence \n     Summers wrote Lau that her original report into Treasury \n     agents' participation in the controversial Good Ol'Boys \n     Roundups was lacking key information.\n       ``I am very concerned that the report be maximally credible \n     in all respects,'' Summers wrote.\n       ``Specifically it should be evident on the face of the \n     report that your investigation was thorough and \n     uncompromising.\n       ``While those of us who know you well have no question \n     concerning your effort and intentions, it would be helpful \n     for your report to lay out exactly how your investigation was \n     conducted,'' Summers wrote.\n       Among the basic information he cited as missing: \n     identifying which witnesses were interviewed describing \n     efforts made to collect documents, photographs and other \n     evidence.\n       ``In sum, it would seem advisable to describe all of the \n     investigative techniques your office used or elected not to \n     use in conducting this information,'' Summers wrote.\n       Assistant Treasury Secretary Howard Schloss said Summers' \n     letter was simply designed to reinforce that ``the report be \n     as clear as possible.''\n       Schloss also confirmed that just before she was hired by \n     the Clinton administration, Lau volunteered in 1993 to work \n     as a ``career consultant'' at the Democratic National \n     Committee in Washington.\n       Schloss said Lau a professional auditor who also has a \n     master's degree in career development, produced a series of \n     jobs search strategy workshops for the DNC.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment that \nrequires all Federal agencies to remove computer games from Government \ncomputers.\n  On June 9 of this year, I introduced S. 885, the Responsive \nGovernment Act, together with Senators Hagel, Shelby, Stevens, and \nHutchinson of Arkansas. The Responsive Government Act includes several \nprovisions to help restore the confidence of the American people in the \nFederal Government. One of its provisions concerns the use of computer \ngames on Government computers. I am again offering it today.\n  It is absolutely ludicrous that the taxpayers are paying people to \nplay computer games. The computers are bought and paid for by the \nAmerican taxpayers for work and not for fun, and they are footing the \nbill for the job, the office and everything. To be using it for \npleasure is simply not in keeping with the way we should be running the \nGovernment.\n  The Federal Government did spend close to $20 billion last year on \ncomputers, equipment and support services. These systems are designed \nand purchased to increase productivity, not to provide games and \nability to pass time while Federal employees are drawing wages. \nHowever, many of these computers are delivered already equipped with \nso-called games which reduce workers' efficiency and productivity. This \nlegislation would prohibit the Federal Government from purchasing \ncomputers with preloaded game programs. These games, of course, do \nnothing but decrease productivity.\n  In fact, a private sector survey found that workers spent an average \nof 5\\1/2\\ hours per week playing computer games and other nonrelated \ntasks related to computer games. This translates into an annual loss of \n$10 billion in productivity.\n  Clearly, these games do not stay on the computers and go unused. In \nfact, many of the games now come equipped with a ``boss key'' which is \na device that lets a worker strike a single key and transform the \ncomputer scene from a game to a spread sheet, a false spread sheet but \na spread sheet. The soul purpose of the device is to hide unproductive \nbehavior from supervisors. If you are playing the game and you suspect \nthat anybody is coming, you just hit a key and it looks like you are \nworking.\n  There is no reason for the Federal Government to buy computers with \nprograms designed to divert employees' attention from their jobs. This \nis just simply common sense.\n  My amendment does provide a waiver in cases where a cost-benefit \nanalysis finds it is more costly to purchase new computer equipment \nwithout games than with them. But these cost-benefit reports must be \ntransmitted to the Congress. I think it is a reasonable safeguard for \nthe unusual cases that cannot be anticipated by the Congress.\n  This is something that has already been done in selected Government \nagencies. Governor George Allen of Virginia and former Labor Secretary \nRobert Reich ordered workers to delete these game programs from their \ncomputers. I commend them for the action. It is time to implement such \na policy throughout the Federal Government.\n  I thank the chairman for accepting this amendment. I understand it \nhas been accepted by the managers of the bill on both sides, and I very \nmuch appreciate the support and help of Senator Campbell and Senator \nKohl.\n  Mr. President, I yield any remaining time.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, the majority has no objection to this \namendment.\n  Mr. KOHL. The minority accepts it also.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment. \nWithout objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 932) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KOHL. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 937\n\n   (Purpose: To strike restrictions on current authorities under the \n                National Energy Conservation Policy Act)\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Bingaman, I send an \namendment to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wisconsin [Mr. Kohl], for Mr. Bingaman, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 937.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 92, strike lines 6 through 16.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of amendment from the \nSenator from New Mexico to strike section 630 of this legislation. The \nprovision that would be stricken by the amendment addresses substantive \nissues regarding the energy efficiency requirements that apply to \nFederal agencies under the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The requirements \naddressed by this provision are complex and, along with many, if not \nall, of the energy efficiency provisions of EPAct, have resulted in \nquite a bit of controversy during their implementation. As chairman of \nthe Energy Committee, I intend to investigate these issues thoroughly \nand address them legislatively, as appropriate.\n  I believe that the supporters of section 630 have raised a legitimate \nconcern that will probably require a legislative resolution. However, \nas I noted, these issues are very complex, and within the jurisdiction \nof the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. The scope of this \nsection is very broad and its full impact is unknown at this time. Its \nimpact on existing contracts is unclear, and it may, in fact, prohibit \nsome activities that are appropriate and beneficial to the American \ntaxpayer. We simply have not had the opportunity for the Energy \nCommittee to evaluate this language and assess all of its implications, \nas it should. As such, I must object to their resolution in this piece \nof legislation on procedural grounds and would ask that my name be \nadded as co-sponsor of the Bingaman amendment.\n  Mr. KOHL. I ask to have the amendment laid aside until Monday.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I object. I wish to discuss the amendment tonight.\n\n[[Page S7696]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The amendment of the Senator from New Mexico would \neliminate from the bill a provision that I requested be inserted \nbecause of a conference I had with a former staff member of the \nCommerce Committee, as a matter of fact. He pointed out to me that the \nbasic law, the National Energy Conservation Policy Act, requires the \ncompetitive process.\n  According to the Office of Technology Assessment, Federal agencies \nspent about $4 billion annually on power, light, water and other \nutility bills, and that that could be cut by 25 percent, about $1 \nbillion a year, if we required agencies to improve energy efficiency. \nThat led to this new law.\n  Our provision does not call for new funding. It does not change \nexisting law. It restricts the use of appropriated funds unless \nprocurements are made through the competitive process. The language in \nthe bill that I requested effects no change in that law, the existing \nlaw. The existing law does require a full competitive procurement to be \nused by Federal agencies to obtain energy-efficient goods and services. \nIt is within the jurisdiction of our Appropriations Committee. It is \nprimarily because it limits the expenditure of funds. Our language \nreally does no more than direct Federal agencies to abide by the law, \nto follow the law which requires specific procurement procedures. It \nwill not disrupt any existing contracts. It will not prohibit any \nutility or nonutility provider of energy-efficient services from \ncompeting for Federal contracts. It simply directs the Federal agencies \nto use the competitive process for procuring services for all energy \nefficiency providers as current law directs.\n  Mr. President, my problem with striking it is it will mean that we \nwill continue to not receive the savings that we are supposed to \nreceive as a result of the basic law of the land which is the Energy \nConservation Policy Act. I do believe that this is a law which ought to \nbe pursued. I call the Senate's attention to that act, which is \nbasically the 1978 act. It has been improved on several times since \nthat time.\n  I might say, the person who talked to me was part of the staff at the \ntime that basic law was devised, and pointed out to me how it has not \nbeen enforced. What we are talking about is basically the provision \nthat is required under Section 551(4) of Title I of the National Energy \nConservation Policy Act which basically says this:\n\n       The term ``energy conservation measures'' means measures \n     that are applied to a Federal building that improve energy \n     efficiency or are life cycle cost effective and that involve \n     energy conservation, cogeneration facilities, renewable \n     energy sources, improvements in operation and maintenance \n     efficiencies, or retrofit activities.\n\n  That is the law, Mr. President. Senator Bingaman's amendment would \nstrike from this bill my amendment which requires and--prevents the use \nof funds under this bill for those activities unless they follow the \nlaw regarding competitive procurement practices. I know Senator \nBingaman will have a minute when he comes on Monday. I wanted to take \nthis time now to explain it.\n  I ask unanimous consent we have printed in the Record at this point \nthe relevant provisions of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act, \nSection 201 of the Federal Property Administrative Services Act, which \nis what we require.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Excerpts From the National Energy Conservation Policy Act\n\n       Sec. 8259. Definitions.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       (4) the term ``energy conservation measures'' means \n     measures that are applied to a Federal building that improve \n     energy efficiency and are life cycle cost effective and that \n     involve energy conservation, cogeneration facilities, \n     renewable energy sources, improvements in operations and \n     maintenance efficiencies, or retrofit activities;\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Sec. 8251. Findings.\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Federal Government is the largest single energy \n     consumer in the Nation;\n       (2) the cost of meeting the Federal Government's energy \n     requirement is substantial;\n       (3) there are significant opportunities in the Federal \n     Government to conserve and make more efficient use of energy \n     through improved operations and maintenance, the use of new \n     energy efficient technologies, and the application and \n     achievement of energy efficient design and construction;\n       (4) Federal energy conservation measures can be financed at \n     little or no cost to the Federal Government by using private \n     investment capital made available through contracts \n     authorized by subchapter VII of this chapter; and\n       (5) an increase in energy efficiency by the Federal \n     Government would benefit the Nation by reducing the cost of \n     government, reducing national dependence on foreign energy \n     resources, and demonstrating the benefits of greater energy \n     efficiency to the Nation.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Sec. 8287. Authority to enter into contracts.\n       (a) In general.\n       (1) The head of a Federal agency may enter into contracts \n     under this subchapter solely for the purpose of achieving \n     energy savings and benefits ancillary to that purpose. Each \n     such contract may, notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, be for a period not to exceed 25 years. Such contract \n     shall provide that the contractor shall incur costs of \n     implementing energy savings measures, including at least the \n     costs (if any) incurred in making energy audits, acquiring \n     and installing equipment, and training personnel, in exchange \n     for a share of any energy savings directly resulting from \n     implementation of such measures during the term of the \n     contract.\n       (2)(A) Contracts under this subchapter shall be energy \n     savings performance contracts and shall require an annual \n     energy audit and specify the terms and conditions of any \n     Government payments and performance guarantees. Any such \n     performance guarantee shall provide that the contractor is \n     responsible for maintenance and repair services for any \n     energy related equipment, including computer software \n     systems.\n       (B) Aggregate annual payments by an agency to both \n     utilities and energy savings performance contractors, under \n     an energy savings performance contract, may not exceed the \n     amount that the agency would have paid for utilities without \n     an energy savings performance contract (as estimated through \n     the procedures developed pursuant to this section) during \n     contract years. The contract shall provide for a guarantee of \n     savings to the agency, and shall establish payment schedules \n     reflecting such guarantee, taking into account any capital \n     costs under the contract.\n       (C) Federal agencies may incur obligations pursuant to such \n     contracts to finance energy conservation measures provided \n     guaranteed savings exceed the debt service requirements.\n       (D) A Federal agency may enter into a multiyear contract \n     under this subchapter for a period not to exceed 25 years, \n     without funding of cancellation charges before cancellation, \n     if--\n       (i) such contract was awarded in a competitive manner \n     pursuant to subsection (b(2) of this section, using \n     procedures and methods established under this subchapter;\n       (ii) funds are available and adequate for payment of the \n     costs of such contract for the first fiscal year;\n       (iii) 30 days before the award of any such contract that \n     contains a clause setting forth a cancellation ceiling in \n     excess of $750,000, the head of such agency gives written \n     notification of such proposed contract and of the proposed \n     cancellation ceiling for such contract to the appropriate \n     authorizing and appropriating committees of the Congress; and\n       (iv) such contract is governed by part 17.1 of the Federal \n     Acquisition Regulation promulgated under section 421 of Title \n     41 or the applicable rules promulgated under this subchapter.\n       (b) Implementation.\n       (1)(A) The Secretary, with the concurrence of the Federal \n     Acquisition Regulatory Council established under section \n     421(a) of Title 41, not later than 180 days after October 24, \n     1992, shall, by rule, establish appropriate procedures and \n     methods for use by Federal agencies to select, monitor, and \n     terminate contracts with energy service contractors in \n     accordance with laws governing Federal procurement that will \n     achieve the intent of this section in a cost-effective \n     manner. In developing such procedures and methods, the \n     Secretary, with the concurrence of the Federal Acquisition \n     Regulatory Council, shall determine which existing \n     regulations are inconsistent with the intent of this section \n     and shall formulate substitute regulations consistent with \n     laws governing Federal procurement.\n       (B) The procedures and methods established pursuant to \n     subparagraph (A) shall be the procedures and contracting \n     methods for selection, by an agency, of a contractor to \n     provide energy savings performance services. Such procedures \n     and methods shall provide for the calculation of energy \n     savings based on sound engineering and financial practices.\n       (2) The procedures and methods established pursuant to \n     paragraph (1)(A) shall--\n       (A) allow the Secretary to--\n       (i) request statements of qualifications, which shall, at a \n     minimum, include prior experience and capabilities of \n     contractors to perform the proposed types of energy savings \n     services and financial and performance information, from \n     firms engaged in providing energy savings services; and\n       (ii) from the statements received, designate and prepare a \n     list, with an update at\n\n[[Page S7697]]\n\n     least annually, of those firms that are qualified to provide \n     energy savings services;\n       (B) require each agency to use the list prepared by the \n     Secretary pursuant to subparagraph (A)(ii) unless the agency \n     elects to develop an agency list of firms qualified to \n     provide energy savings performance services using the same \n     selection procedures and methods as are required of the \n     Secretary in preparing such lists; and\n       (C) allow the head of each agency to--\n       (i) select firms from the list prepared pursuant to \n     subparagraph (A)(ii) or the list prepared by the agency \n     pursuant to subparagraph (B) to conduct discussions \n     concerning a particular proposed energy savings project, \n     including requesting a technical and price proposal from such \n     selected firms for such project;\n       (ii) select from such firms the most qualified firm to \n     provide energy savings services based on technical and price \n     proposals and any other relevant information;\n       (iii) permit receipt of unsolicited proposals for energy \n     savings performance contracting services from a firm that \n     such agency has determined is qualified to provide such \n     services under the procedures established pursuant \n     to paragraph (1)(A), and require agency facility managers \n     to place a notice in the Commerce Business Daily \n     announcing they have received such a proposal and invite \n     other similarly qualified firms to submit competing \n     proposals; and\n       (iv) enter into an energy savings performance contract with \n     a firm qualified under clause (iii), consistent with the \n     procedures and methods established pursuant to paragraph \n     (1)(A).\n       (3) A firm not designated as qualified to provide energy \n     savings services under paragraph (2)(A)(i) or paragraph \n     (2)(B) may request a review of such decision to be conducted \n     in accordance with procedures to be developed by the board of \n     contract appeals of the General Services Administration. \n     Procedures developed by the board of contract appeals under \n     this paragraph shall be substantially equivalent to \n     procedures established under section 759(f) of Title 40.\n       (c) Sunset and reporting requirements\n       (1) The authority to enter into new contracts under this \n     section shall cease to be effective five years after the date \n     procedures and methods are established under subsection (b) \n     of this section.\n       (2) Beginning one year after the date procedures and \n     methods are established under subsection (b) of this section, \n     and annually thereafter, for a period of five years after \n     such date, the Comptroller General of the United States shall \n     report on the implementation of this section. Such reports \n     shall include, but not be limited to, an assessment of the \n     following issues:\n       (A) The quality of the energy audits conducted for the \n     agencies.\n       (B) The Government's ability to maximize energy savings.\n       (C) The total energy cost savings accrued by the agencies \n     that have entered into such contracts.\n       (D) The total costs associated with entering into and \n     performing such contracts.\n       (E) A comparison of the total costs incurred by agencies \n     under such contracts and the total costs incurred under \n     similar contracts performed in the private sector.\n       (F) The number of firms selected as qualified firms under \n     this section and their respective shares of awarded \n     contracts.\n       (G) The number of firms engaged in similar activity in the \n     private sector and their respective market shares.\n       (H) The number of applicant firms not selected as qualified \n     firms under this section and the reason for their \n     nonselection.\n       (I) The frequency with which agencies have utilized the \n     services of Government labs to perform any of the functions \n     specified in this section.\n       (J) With the respect to the final report submitted pursuant \n     to this paragraph, an assessment of whether the contracting \n     procedures developed pursuant to this section and utilized by \n     agencies have been effective and whether continued use of \n     such procedures, as opposed to the procedures provided by \n     existing public contract law, is necessary for implementation \n     of successful energy savings performance contracts.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Sec. 8287a.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the amendments \nbe set aside.\n  Mr. KOHL. We have no objection to their being set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     PRESIDENT'S ANTI-DRUG CAMPAIGN\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I had planned to offer an amendment which \naddresses a matter that is critical to the future of America. Drug use \nby the nation's youth is rising at alarming levels. The Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy's budget request included $175 million for \na youth oriented media anti-drug campaign aimed at reducing drug use by \nour nation's children. I strongly support this campaign.\n  Drug use among America's youth has doubled over the past five years, \ntripling among eighth graders. These trends are devastating and \nthreaten to destroy the fabric of American society. We have an \nobligation to reverse these trends by motivating America's youth to \nreject drugs. As you know, the media exerts tremendous influence on \nchildren. Through the power of the media we are equipped to influence \nchildren via outlets that include television, radio, computer software, \nand the Internet.\n  While drug use has been glamorized, normalized and linked with \npopularity, this media campaign will employ a strategy to change youth \nattitudes about the perceived risk of drug use and to encourage parents \nto talk to their children about drugs. Coupled with support from the \nprivate sector, the program would finance anti-drug messages to reach \n90 percent of all children ages 9 through 17 at least four times per \nweek. The media campaign will supplement existing public service \ncampaigns carried out by groups such as the Partnership for a Drug Free \nAmerica and the Ad Council, both of whom will participate in the Office \nof National Drug Policy campaign.\n  Unfortunately, this program was not fully funded by the \nAppropriations Committee. I share its view that the funds used for this \nprogram must be carefully monitored to assure its effectiveness and \nnon-partisan status, and I support the requirements the Committee has \nincluded that address these matters.\n  However, I believe that denial of full funding sends the wrong \nmessage here. The Appropriations Committee questioned whether full \nfunding for this new program at this time was premature. I fail to see \nthe rationale. The numbers of children using drugs are going up. If \nanything, I would say that funding for such a campaign is too late, not \npremature.\n  Let's put this funding in the context of the media. We all know that \nHollywood is a multibillion dollar industry. Each year, billions of \ndollars are put into producing movies that glamorize drugs and alcohol. \nThen there is the advertising industry. I am told that the amount \nrequested for this program is of the same magnitude of what is \ntypically spent on one line of commercials for a fast food restaurant. \nAnd how much money every year is spent on beer commercials? If you \nimagine what our children are inundated with on a daily basis, and then \nif you think about how limited this campaign actually is, I believe one \nwould begin to understand how much more we should be doing to prevent \nour children from being influenced to view drugs and alcohol in a \npositive light.\n  My amendment would have added $65 million to help counter the \nmessages our children receive each day. Given the expressions of \nopposition I have received from the Committee on this amendment, I will \nnot offer it. Nonetheless I cannot think of a sound reason to oppose \nthis critically important campaign. We must invest in the future of \nAmerica's 68 million children. We cannot allow another generation \nchildren to be lost to the culture of drug use.\n  I hope that in the future the Senate will have the opportunity to \nrevisit this matter and increase funding for this most important anti-\ndrug campaign.\n\n[[Page S7700]]\n\n              FUNDING FOR THE FEDERAL ELECTION COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the funding for \nthe Federal Election Commission (FEC), as allocated in the Treasury, \nGeneral Government, Civil Service Appropriations Bill.\n  All of us know that Congress' appropriators are tasked with guiding \none of the most difficult of our duties--deciding how to spend the \ntaxpayers' money. While I appreciate the magnitude and difficulty of \nthis task as approached by the Subcommittee on Treasury, General \nGovernment, and Civil Service Appropriations, I am disappointed that \nthe committee did not provide the FEC with full funding at its request \nof $34.2 million, as supported by the President.\n  Mr. President, the citizens' cries for campaign finance reform are \ngrowing louder and louder. Why? Because campaign spending is out of \ncontrol. As money floods endlessly into our electoral system, however, \nI fear the voice of the average American will be drowned out and \ndemocracy will be the victim.\n  Much must be done to truly and effectively clean up our political \ncampaigns. But one thing we can do to start right now is provide the \nFEC--the agency charged by Congress with overseeing our campaign \nfinance system--with the finances it needs to promptly and effectively \nenforce the laws that govern our campaigns.\n  Consider that, in just eight years, we have seen a fourfold increase \nin the amount of money raised and spent by both parties, from $220 \nmillion raised by both parties in 1988 to $881 million raised in 1996.\n  In just four years, we have seen a 73 percent increase in political \ncosts. A 73 percent increase in political costs since 1992--while wages \nrose 13 percent and education costs rose 17 percent during that same \nperiod.\n  Congressional spending in 1996 general elections was $626.4 million, \n6.3 percent higher than the record 1994 levels.\n  And an unprecedented $2.5 billion in financial activity was reported \nto the commission in 1996.\n  And it was the FEC that had to oversee all this spending, to be sure \nit complied with the law.\n  This increase in campaign spending has therefore generated a sharp \nincrease FEC's workload. Between 1994 and November of 1996, the FEC's \ncaseload rose 36 percent, and because complaints related to the 1996 \nelection are still being filed, the FEC expects the caseload to \nultimately rise by 52 percent. Yet, providing adequate funding for the \nFEC has been a constant battle. Recent rescissions and funding \nrollbacks have prevented the FEC from keeping up with its ever-\nincreasing workload and meeting inflation in rent and salary costs.\n  This combination of a decreasing budget and an increasing workload \nhave hamstrung the FEC's ability to fulfill its watchdog role in a \ntimely and effective manner. At the same time the FEC's caseload has \nrisen, staff cuts required by the post-FY '95 budget reductions have \nled to a 25 percent drop in the FEC's ability to handle those cases.\n  Perhaps that is one reason why the FEC has become known as a \ntoothless tiger. I believe it is time to give this tiger the teeth it \nneeds to carry out its duties.\n  Mr. President, we are in the midst of multiple government \ninvestigations into campaign financing--investigations I wholeheartedly \nsupport. But as Congress has allocated millions of dollars for \nburgeoning Congressional campaign finance investigations, the least we \ncan do is provide adequate funding for the independent and bipartisan \nFEC to do its job.\n  Many of my colleagues have said that campaign finance reform is not \nthe issue for 1997. The illegalities of 1996, they say, is the issue. \nYet, at the same time, they refuse to fund the very agency that should \nbe first to uncover and punish any illegalities.\n  In October 1996, following news reports of alleged irregularities in \nfundraising by both political parties, I initiated a request that the \nFEC conduct an investigation of the Democratic National Committee, and \npledged to make available all relevant records and personnel. At a \nRules Committee hearing earlier this year, I was shocked to learn that \nas of February 1997, due to the tremendous backlog of cases and funding \nshortfalls at the FEC, that investigation had not even begun. While I \nam informed today that the investigation has now begun, I believe the \ndelay in commencing the audit is illustrative of the magnitude of the \nFEC's budget problems.\n  Earlier this year, after learning of the FEC's long delay in \nbeginning to address the cases generated by the 1996 election, I \nintroduced a bill to strengthen the FEC and authorize full funding for \nthe agency. I was also recently joined by my colleagues Senators \nKerrey, Reed, and Dorgan in writing to Senate appropriators to request \nthat they provide the FEC with full funding. I ask unanimous consent \nthat those letters be printed in the Record.\n  I am disappointed that we have not fully funded the FEC at this time, \nbut I remain hopeful that we will provide full funding--and enact other \nmuch needed FEC reforms--when we debate comprehensive campaign finance \nreform in what I hope will be the near future.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 7, 1997.\n     Hon. Ben Nighthorse Campbell,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service, and \n         General Government Appropriations, Committee on \n         Appropriations, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Campbell: As your subcommittee prepares to \n     consider the Treasury-Postal Appropriations bill, we write to \n     urge you to appropriate full funding for the Federal Election \n     Commission at their request of $34.2 million.\n       Established by Congress as one of the post-Watergate \n     reforms, the FEC was charged with overseeing and monitoring \n     federal election campaigns' compliance with the law. As we \n     mark the 25th anniversary of Watergate this year, it is time \n     that we enable the FEC to live up to its mandate by providing \n     it with the necessary funding.\n       In recent elections, as the cost of campaigns has spiraled \n     out of control and current campaign laws have proven porous \n     and ineffective in discouraging this trend, the FEC's \n     caseload has risen, making its job more and more difficult. \n     The cost of campaigns rose 73% between the 1992 and 1996, and \n     parties raised four times the amount of money in 1996 that \n     they raised just eight years before in 1988. Between 1994 and \n     November of 1996, the FEC's caseload rose 36% and because \n     complaints related to the 1996 election are still being \n     filed, the FEC expects the caseload to ultimately rise by \n     52%. Yet, even as the FEC's workload has surged and Congress \n     has allocated millions of dollars for burgeoning \n     Congressional campaign finance investigations, providing \n     adequate funding for the independent and bipartisan FEC has \n     been a constant battle. Rescissions and funding rollbacks \n     over the last few years have not permitted the FEC to keep \n     pace with its increasing workload, or even to meet inflation \n     in rent and salary costs.\n       This combination of a decreasing budget and an increasing \n     workload have hamstrung the FEC's ability to fulfill its \n     duties. At the same time the FEC's caseload has risen, staff \n     cuts required by the post-FY '95 budget reductions have led \n     to a 25% drop in the FEC's ability to handle those cases.\n       The $34.2 million requested by the FEC encompasses $29.3 \n     million included in the President's budget, which the FEC \n     requires to continue responsible operation and which would \n     restore the FEC's funding to its pre-1995 recision level. The \n     $34.2 million figure also encompasses an additional $4.9 \n     million the FEC now needs to handle the increased volume of \n     work resulting from the 1996 elections.\n       For too long, the FEC has been known as a toothless tiger, \n     an agency rendered powerless by both structural and financial \n     inadequacies. While we in Congress must explore many ways of \n     strengthening the FEC, one way we can help restore its \n     authority is to allocate the money it needs. We urge you and \n     your committee to make the requested FEC funding a top \n     priority.\n     Robert J. Kerrey.\n     Jack Reed.\n     Christopher J. Dodd.\n     Byron L.

Mr. President, I would like to commend Senator Campbell \nfor his work on this appropriations bill. I was particularly pleased \nwith the funding level for the National Historical Publications and \nRecords Commission, which was increased by $1 million over the budget \nrequest. It is my hope that, although not specifically earmarked, a \nportion of these funds will go toward completing the Rhode Island \nHistorical Society's ongoing project ``The Papers of General Nathaniel \nGreene.''\n  As I am sure my colleagues are aware, Nathaniel Greene, in addition \nto being a famous Rhode Islander, was second in command to General \nGeorge Washington during the American Revolutionary War. Nathaniel \nGreene's papers, which are extensive, provide a complete, first-person \naccount of the Revolution. The Greene papers include numerous \ncorrespondence with George Washington, as well as letters from all of \nthe members of the Continental Congress, the Board of War, many of the \nstate governors, a number of Generals in the Continental Army, and \nother troops and their loved ones.\n  When the war was over, General Greene, clearly recognizing the \nhistorical significance of his correspondence, gathered as many as \n6,000 letters and documents in trunks and made his way home to Rhode \nIsland. Later, he stopped in Princeton, New Jersey, the site of the \nContinental Congress, and expressed his desire to have his papers \ncopied, assembled, and bound in books. That very day, Congress agreed \nto General Greene's request and voted to provide him with a clerk to \nundertake this task. Regrettably, General Greene died two years later, \nand, over the years, his papers have been scattered between more than \n100 repositories in a number of states.\n  Since 1971, the Rhode Island Historical Society has worked to \nassemble and publish the extraordinary papers of this remarkable \npatriot. At the onset of this project, which was cosponsored by The \nWilliam L. Clement Library at the University of Michigan, funds were \nprovided by the National Historical Publications Commission (now the \nNHPRC). Additional funds were received through the National Endowment \nfor the Humanities, which contributed to the completion of the first \nnine volumes of ``The Papers of General Nathaniel Greene.''\n  The remaining volumes of the Greene Papers will focus on the \nRevolutionary War in the South. Details about the Southern Campaign are \nfar less well known than those about the War in the North.\n  At the age of thirty-two, Nathaniel Greene became the youngest \nGeneral in the Continental Army and later became commander of the \nSouthern Army. In 1781 and 1782, he and his troops defeated the British \nin the Carolinas and in Georgia. The several volumes that remain to be \ncompleted focus on this aspect of our nation's early history. It is a \nperiod that, in some important aspects, is not well chronicled, and I \nbelieve that completion of the Greene Papers will add significantly to \nour knowledge of an entire region--the South.\n  Once again, I applaud Senators Campbell and Kohl for their work on \nthis bill and hope that funds from the National Historical Publications \nand Records Commission will be available for completion of the Greene \nPapers.\n\n\n                   REGULATORY ACCOUNTING, SECTION 625\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \nexpress my support for the regulatory accounting provision in Section \n625 of the Treasury-Postal Appropriations bill, S. 1023. This continues \nlast year's effort by Senator Stevens, and as the new Chairman of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, I strongly support it. I believe the \npublic has the right to know the benefits and burdens of Federal \nregulatory programs. And Congress needs this information to better \nmanage the regulatory process. Currently, Federal regulatory programs \ncost hundreds of billions of dollars per year--$700 billion by some \nestimates. That comes to several thousand dollars for the average \nAmerican household--perhaps $7,000 per year. Our regulatory goals are \ntoo important, and our resources are too precious, to spend this money \nunwisely.\n  This provision is identical to last year's Stevens Amendment. It \nrequires the Office of Management and Budget to provide Congress with a \nreport on: (1) the total annual costs and benefits of Federal \nregulatory programs; (2) the costs and benefits of rules costing $100 \nmillion or more; (3) the direct and indirect impacts of Federal rules \non the private sector, State and local government, and the Federal \ngovernment; and (4) recommendations to streamline and improve \nregulatory programs. Before issuing the report in final form, OMB must \nprovide the public with notice and an opportunity to comment on the \ndraft report--its substance, methodologies, and recommendations. In the \nfinal report, OMB must summarize the public comments.\n  Now we know that regulatory accounting is doable, and it does not \nimpose an unjustifiable burden on the agencies. First, OMB has done its \nfirst draft report under last year's regulatory accounting provision, \nand we expect the draft to be published in the Federal Register early \nnext week. While this report is not perfect, it shows that regulatory \naccounting can be done and can help us better understand the benefits \nand burdens of regulation. In the past week, the American Enterprise \nInstitute and the Brookings Institution released a primer on how to do \nregulatory accounting, entitled ``Improving Regulatory \nAccountability.'' This should be helpful to all of us as OMB revises \nits draft report.\n  Estimating the total annual costs and benefits of Federal regulatory \nprograms is like assembling a jigsaw puzzle, and some of the major \nsections have been assembled. OMB's first draft report will provide a \nfoundation for further improvements that can be proposed during the \npublic comment period. Private studies have estimated the annual costs \nof regulation, and many of its benefits. These include Bob Hahn's \n``Regulatory Reform: What Do the Numbers Tell Us?,'' Tom Hopkins' \n``Cost of Regulation,'' and Hahn and Hird's ``The Costs and Benefits of \nRegulation.'' Moreover, Executive Order 12866, like the preceding \nOrders for the last 15 years, requires a cost-benefit assessment for \nsignificant regulations, which constitute most of the puzzle. The \nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act also requires detailed cost-benefit \nanalyses of $100 million rules. In addition, the paperwork burden--and \nI do think it should be addressed--constitutes about 1/3 of the cost \npuzzle, and paperwork burden hours already are estimated under the \nPaperwork Reduction Act. Those burdens can easily be monetized by \nestimating the value of the\n\n[[Page S7702]]\n\ntime needed to comply with paperwork requirements. In addition, the \ncost of environmental regulation--about \\1/4\\ of the cost puzzle--is \nestimated in EPA's study, The Cost of a Clean Environment (1990), in \nannual estimates by the Department of Commerce, and by other sources. \nFinally, regulatory accounting should not create a resource drain for \nOMB. OMB should issue guidelines requiring the agencies to compile \nneeded information, just as OMB does in the fiscal budget process.\n\n  This regulatory accounting provision requires OMB to do a credible \nand reliable report on the costs and benefits of Federal regulation. \nFirst, subsection 625(a)(1) requires OMB to provide estimates of the \n``total annual'' costs and benefits of Federal regulatory programs. \nThis includes those regulatory costs and benefits that will impact the \nnation during the upcoming fiscal year. These costs and benefits would \ninclude impacts from rules issued before this upcoming fiscal year, not \njust new rules. OMB should do its best to estimate and quantify that \nfigure on the cost side, and to explain what benefits we are getting \nfor the costs of these programs.\n  When estimating the costs and benefits of ``Federal regulatory \nprograms,'' OMB should use the valuable information already available, \nand supplement it where needed. Where agencies have or can produce \ndetailed information on the costs and benefits of individual programs, \nthey should make full use of this information. For example, EPA \nproduces reports on the costs of their major environmental programs. \nSince EPA has program-by-program information, EPA should include such \ndetail in its estimates. Other agencies may not have program-by-program \nestimates of costs and benefits, nor be capable of producing it, so \nthey may need to rely on less detailed information. I expect a rule of \nreason will prevail: Where the agencies can produce detail that will be \ninformative for the Congress and the public, they should do so. Where \nit is extremely burdensome to provide such detail, broader estimates \nshould suffice. Information generated during the public comment period \nshould assist OMB.\n  Subsection 625(a)(3) requires OMB to assess the direct and indirect \nimpacts of Federal rules on the private sector, State and local \ngovernment, and the Federal Government. As many studies show, \nregulatory impacts go beyond compliance costs. Regulation also creates \na drag on real wages, economic growth, and productivity. Complex \neconomic models can quantify these adverse impacts. However, OMB is not \nmandated to devote vast resources to create such models. Instead, OMB \nmay use available reports, studies, and other relevant information to \nassess the direct and indirect impacts of Federal rules. In addition, \nOMB should discuss the serious problems posed by unfunded federal \nmandates for State, local and tribal governments. OMB should inform \nCongress of its efforts to address these problems. Ultimately, OMB must \nprovide Congress with a credible accounting statement on the regulatory \nprocess. This report should show clearly the benefits and burdens of \nthe regulatory process, and it should help Congress to see which \nprograms are cost-effective and which are wasteful.\n  We have received a copy of OMB's first draft report prepared under \nlast year's Stevens Amendment. The draft is an important first step, \nand I agree with many recommendations it provides. For example, I \nstrongly agree that OIRA should lead an effort to raise the use and \nquality of agency analyses for developing regulations. I also agree \nthat OIRA should develop a database on the costs and benefits of major \nrules and a system to track the net benefits of all new federal \nregulations and reforms of existing regulations. This information could \nbe used to determine what improvements to recommend. However, I also \nthink that there are several more areas that would be fruitful for OMB \nto consider. First, OMB should estimate the total costs of all federal \nmandates, not just environmental, health, safety and economic \nregulation. In particular, OMB should estimate the entire costs of \npaperwork, including from tax collection. Second, OMB should estimate, \nwhere feasible, the quantifiable indirect costs and the indirect \nbenefits of regulation. This includes, for example, the costs \nassociated with product bans and marketing limitations, as well as the \nindirect benefits associated with the preservation of endangered \nspecies. Third, OMB should examine the impact of regulation on wages, \ninnovation, employment, and income distribution, including employment \nimpacts on particular sectors of the economy. OMB should leverage the \nexpertise and resources of other agencies, especially the President's \nCouncil of Economic Advisors, to do these analyses. Finally, OMB should \ndo more to recommend improvements to the regulatory process, as well as \nparticular programs and regulations. OMB does not have to be omniscient \nto propose such improvements, and its recommendations do not have to be \nbased on perfect empirical data. Let's also use common sense and work \ntogether for the public good.\n  In closing, I should note that this regulatory accounting provision \nis founded on broad support. Last year's Stevens amendment was adopted \nby voice vote. It was modeled on more detailed provisions strongly \nsupported in the 104th Congress--in the Roth bill, S. 291, the Dole-\nJohnston bill, S. 343, and the Glenn-Chafee bill. Regulatory accounting \nis widely endorsed--by those who labor under the growing regulatory \nburden, as well as by those who want to assure the benefits of \nregulation and to enhance the public's right to know about important \ngovernmental decisions.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, under a prior unanimous consent, all \nMembers were advised that there would be debates tonight on the \namendments that many of them had said they wanted to pursue. Several \nSenators have said they were going to be here this evening to do that. \nUnfortunately, we cannot find them. We don't know where they are. We \ncalled their offices. They are not down here to debate their \namendments. So, with consultation with Senator Kohl, we are prepared to \njust close us down tonight.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for 5 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/17/senate-section/article/S7689-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7702-S7703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATION OF EXPLORERS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the men and women \nwhose work contributes to our nation's great space program. Their \ncontributions have made the first seventeen days of the month of July a \nhigh point of public interest and enthusiasm. I would like to share \nwith my colleagues some observations of these contributions.\n  Earlier this week, I visited NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center in \nHuntsville, AL, and spent a few minutes talking with three of the \nastronauts on board of the Space Shuttle Columbia. Members of my staff \nviewed their launch on July 1 from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. \nIt was another great launch and another great milestone for Columbia \nand our shuttle program. In case you missed the landing on CNN, \nColumbia returned safely to Earth at approximately 7:15 a.m. this \nmorning. While in orbit, the crew conducted world class research in \nareas which are so critical to our future success in the global \neconomy--biotechnology, materials science, and combustion research. \nThis research is vitally important, and here is why:\n  It is hard to understate the importance of the biotechnology research \nwhen you consider the hundreds of proteins in the human body. We \ncurrently understand the structure of about 1 percent of these \nproteins. If scientists can decipher the exact structure of a protein, \nthey can determine how it works with other proteins to perform a \nspecific function. For example, by studying a protein that is part of a \nvirus, they can learn how that virus attacks plants or animals. To do \nthis, however, scientists must grow near-perfect crystals of that \nprotein. While some can be done quite easily on\n\n[[Page S7703]]\n\nEarth, some are distorted by gravity. During Columbia's mission, \nprotein growth experiments grew large quantities of various proteins. \nThese experiments are designed to improve our knowledge and lead to \nbreakthroughs in diabetes, bronchial asthma, AIDS, various kinds of \ninflammation, and Chagas disease, a disease affecting 20 million people \nworldwide but most prevalent in Latin America and making its way into \nthe United States.\n  Materials science has unlimited potential. Historically, mankind's \ndevelopment has been tied to the development of new materials since the \ndawn of time--the ``Stone Age'', the ``Iron Age'', the ``Bronze Age.'' \nAs humanity matures into the ``space age,'' the need for new materials \nis as important and evolutionary as ever. The key to materials science \nresearch is understanding how the structure of a material forms and how \nthis structure affects the properties of the material. On Earth, \nsedimentation and buoyancy cause uneven mixing of the ingredients of \nthe material and can deform the structure as it solidifies. \nImperfections in the structures of metals and alloys can affect \nmechanical strength or resistance to corrosion, while similar flaws in \nglasses and alloys can make them easier to crack or break. In \nmicrogravity, sedimentation and buoyancy are reduced or eliminated, \nenabling investigators to learn how these factors affect the final \nstructure of the material. The knowledge gained from the studies on \nboard Columbia will be used to improve materials processing on earth. \nThese are the materials which will allow us to chart the great unknowns \nof space in the decades ahead.\n  The third area of world-class research was conducted in combustion, \nwhich accounts for approximately 85 percent of the world's energy \nproduction and a significant percentage of the world's atmospheric \npollution. Combustion plays a key role in processes involved in ground \ntransportation, spacecraft propulsion, aircraft propulsion, and \nhazardous waste disposal. However, despite many years of study, we have \nonly a limited understanding of many fundamental combustion processes. \nThe results from experiments in these areas will help NASA design \nengines for cleaner air and more fuel efficiency. Just a tenth of 1 \npercent increase in the ability to burn fuel more efficiently can more \nthan pay the cost of a shuttle mission and help keep the environment \ncleaner as well. We spend hundreds of billions of dollars each year on \noil and every penny saved is a penny that stays right here in America.\n\n  All of these experiments I just mentioned, Mr. President, were \nperformed inside Spacelab, a joint venture of NASA and the European \nSpace Agency. Investigators representing 32 universities, 12 commercial \nindustries and five government agencies participated in the 33 \nmicrogravity experiments in Spacelab. This mission was a bridge between \nthe activities currently possible on Spacelab and those of a much \nlonger duration but with similar international cooperation that will \ntake place on International Space Station.\n  This mission caused no great fanfare like the Mars mission is \ncontinuing to cause. Like many of you, I greatly enjoyed watching the \ncoverage of the landing of the Pathfinder with my family over the \nFourth of July weekend. I felt a special pride at this event. The Mars \nmission is a uniquely American accomplishment and has captured the \nimagination and attention of the world. I look forward to the day when \nthe United States sends a manned mission to Mars. America must continue \nto be a nation of explorers, carrying out the traditions of discovery \nembodied by Lewis and Clark, and the other great explorers. So much \ndepends on our leadership and the dedication of thousands of men and \nwomen working on projects large and small that will lead us to new \nfrontiers in space.\n  This morning, NASA Administrator Dan Goldin addressed the Republican \nFreshman Caucus. We discussed with him many of NASA's visionary \nprojects and the future need for the International Space Station as a \nbridge to future exploration. On the Space Station, NASA will learn how \nto keep astronauts safe and healthy for long periods of time. They will \nlearn how to shield astronauts from radiation. They will learn more \nabout how to combat the bone loss astronauts experience after they have \nbeen in orbit for just a short period of time. And they will learn how \nto deal with medical problems, such as blood loss, a virus or bacterial \ninfection, and surgical procedure. These are all things that we must be \nprepared for if we are to send men and women in space for long periods \nof time. Mr. Goldin praised astronaut Michael Foale, our astronaut \nabroad the Mir space station, as a true American hero. Foale is \ndemonstrating to the world that U.S. astronauts are prepared to deal \nwith adversity and hardship. He stressed that our children are seeing a \ndrama in real time that is as fascinating to them as the drama we \nfollowed aboard Apollo 13 many years ago. Mr. Goldin assured us, \nhowever, that he has three teams examining the safety factors of the \nMir and that all must sign off before any more U.S. astronauts are \nplaced on board. He has confidence in the crew and confidence in the \nMir, he strongly believes we must stay the course.\n  Each Senator in attendance received a copy of the first photograph to \nbe returned from Mars. I understand Mr. Goldin will be sending one to \neach Member of this body. He also proudly stated that NASA's Internet \nsite on this mission has received over 300 million hits during its \nfirst five days, breaking all records for an Internet site. This \nmission has united the world in its interest. It has sparked the \nimagination of a new generation of space adventurers, and only time \nwill tell how far they will go.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I believe the Mars mission symbolizes \nthe very best of America. It transcends politics and demonstrates the \ncutting edge technology that has made our Nation the forerunner in \nspace exploration. This is truly the way we want the world to see us, \nisn't it? Space is the key to the image and the future of this nation \nin the 21st century and beyond. We must have national leadership, a \nkeen vision, clear-cut goals, and a strong commitment from this and the \nCongresses to follow. We must be willing to pay the price necessary to \nrealize our dreams and the dreams and goals of our children. Where will \nwe be in just 20 years from now? Mr. Goldin and his employees at NASA \nhave the vision that will take us beyond the fringe of the universe \nand, along the way, will provide untold benefits for mankind.\n  We are indeed a nation of adventurers and the crew of Columbia, the \nscientists at JPL and U.S. astronaut Michael Foale are setting the \nazimuth and cutting the trail for us to follow. The question is ``Will \nwe heed the signs and run the risks to get to the other side?'' I \nbelieve our nation is ready for that challenge and will meet it in \nevery way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PERSONAL ALLOWANCE PARITY AMONG NAFTA PARTIES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The United States Trade Representative and \n     the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of Commerce, shall initiate discussions with \n     officials of the Governments of Mexico and Canada to achieve \n     parity in the duty-free personal allowance structure of the \n     United States, Mexico, and Canada.\n       (b) Report.--The United States Trade Representative and the \n     Secretary of the Treasury shall report to Congress within 90 \n     days after the date of enactment of this Act on the progress \n     that is being made to correct any disparity between the \n     United States, Mexico, and Canada with respect to duty-free \n     personal allowances.\n       (c) Recommendations.--If parity with respect to duty-free \n     personal allowances between the United States, Mexico, and \n     Canada is not achieved within 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the United States Trade Representative \n     and the Secretary of the Treasury shall submit \n     recommendations to Congress for appropriate legislation.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we have probably the best relations \nwith Mexico than we have had in this country in a long, long time. I \nthink NAFTA has added to the good will and the trade between our \nnations. But there is one part of our trade relationship that is not at \nparity and is not in the spirit of NAFTA, and that is the exemptions \nfor personal goods or for buying when you are on the border between \nMexico and the United States.\n  As a matter of fact, there is not parity in the exemption, and I \nthink that is against the spirit of NAFTA. I am hoping that we will be \nable to change that, and that is what my amendment will attempt to do.\n  The amendment is very simple. It directs the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative and the Secretary of the Treasury to begin discussions \nwith their counterparts in Mexico to achieve parity in the duty-free \nallowance structure of all of our NAFTA countries, and the concern is \nbetween Mexico and the United States.\n  These officials will report to Congress within 90 days on the changes \nthey are making to correct these disparities. If the situation remains \nunchanged, in 6 months these officials will propose appropriate \nlegislation to bring the United States' duty-free allowance to conform \nto the allowance levels established by Mexico and Canada.\n  Let me give an example of what is wrong and why this disparity \nexists. The United States provides that each U.S. resident returning \nfrom Mexico has a personal exemption from duty on merchandise valued at \nup to $400 once every 30 days. Mexico, however, has a two-tier duty-\nfree allowance. If you are a resident in a 25-kilometer strip along \nMexico's northern border, and you return from the United States at a \nland border crossing, you may only return with $50 in duty-free \nmerchandise.\n  This has become known as the $50 rule. It is crippling business in \nour border retailers on the U.S. side of the border in Texas, \nCalifornia, New Mexico and Arizona, because if you are a Mexican \nresident bringing in more than $50, you must pay a 22.8 percent duty \nrate. Now, this makes it prohibitively expensive for a Mexican resident \nto purchase a washing machine, a refrigerator, any kind of electronics \nor any item costing more than $50, so it is inequitable.\n  We believe in the spirit of NAFTA, in parity, in equity, any rule you \nwant to apply, that it should just be the same. We have been talking \nabout this for 3\\1/2\\ years, since I came to the Senate. The border \nretailers in Texas told me that the $50 rule was being enforced by the \nMexican Government. I have talked to the officials of the Mexican \nGovernment about this. I truly believe that President Zedillo intended \nto do something about it. He said he was going to right after he was \nelected. But we all know that the peso crisis occurred, and surely he \nhad so many things on his plate that this was not on the front burner. \nI understood that.\n  Now the Mexican economic situation is stabilized, and certainly, I \nthink, it is on its way to full recovery, and I think this matter of \nequity and parity must be addressed. That is why my amendment would \njust ask the U.S. Trade Representative and the Secretary of the \nTreasury to begin these discussions, to report back, and if they are \nnot able to make progress, then tell us what legislation should be \npassed to make this happen.\n  That is the amendment. I hope both sides will agree this is in \neveryone's best interests, and I hope we will be able to vote on this \nor have it accepted early next week and that we can begin the process \nof making sure that the spirit, as well as the letter, of NAFTA is \napplied to both sides of our relationship with the country of Mexico.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay the amendment aside, \nand we will take it up at the appropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, there are several amendments now pending \nat the desk that will be subject to a vote on Monday. I ask unanimous \nconsent that no second-degree amendments be in order. I understand this \nhas been cleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/17/senate-section/article/S7703-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  (During today's session of the Senate, the following morning business \nwas transacted.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/17/senate-section/article/S7704-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7704-S7705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO COL. THOMAS L. OWENS, U.S. ARMY CHIEF OF PERSONNEL, U.S. \n                       SPECIAL OPERATIONS COMMAND\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to recognize and say \nfarewell to an outstanding Army officer who has served our Nation with \ndistinction for the past 27 years. It is a privilege for me to \nrecognize his many outstanding achievements and commend him for his \nservice.\n  A native of Brandon, MS, Colonel Owens attended High School in Byram, \nMS. He graduated from the University of Southern Mississippi, where he \nwas commissioned as a regular Army second lieutenant in June 1970. This \nfoundation, provided by his education and training in Mississippi, \nbegan his distinguished national career.\n\n[[Page S7705]]\n\n  Colonel Owens has served throughout the world in defense of our \nNation's freedom. He served three tours in Europe during the Cold War \nagainst the Communist block countries. These tours were served with \nrenowned units including, VII U.S. Corps, 2d Armored Division and 8th \nInfantry Division (Mechanized). While stationed in the United States, \nColonel Owens served with the elite XVIII Airborne Corps, Fort Bragg, \nNorth Carolina. He served in Desert Storm with XVIII Airborne Corps, \nreceiving a Bronze Star for his dedicated service.\n  Colonel Owens' current and final assignment has been with the U.S. \nSpecial Operations Command, MacDill Air Force Base, Florida as Chief of \nPersonnel. Colonel Owens' magnificent work has ensured our Special \nOperations Forces personnel who are deployed throughout the world in \nmore than 50 countries are always taken care of and put in the right \nplace at the right time.\n  The common thread throughout his 27 years of service has been Colonel \nOwnes' selfless sacrifice in doing everything he could to take care of \nthe young men and women who served under him as a platoon leader all \nthe way through Brigade Commander. Mr. President, we owe a debt of \ngratitude to Col. Tom Owens, his wife, Ulrike, son, Steve, and \ndaughter, Audrey, for their many sacrifices during his 27-year Army \ncareer. He is a great credit to both the Army and the country he has so \nproudly served.\n  On behalf of the great State of Mississippi and our Nation, I wish \nhim, as a paratrooper and distinguished soldier, ``calm winds and soft \nlandings, while keeping his feet and knees into the breeze'' as he \ntransitions into life as a civilian. He is a soldier's soldier.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/17/senate-section/article/S7704-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PIERRE AREA SENIOR CITIZENS 20TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to \nlegislation that I believe could have a substantial positive impact on \nUnited States commerce. For several months now, my colleagues on the \nCommerce Committee have been working to forge an agreement that will \nderegulate ocean shipping and allow our exporters to compete on a more \nlevel playing field with our foreign competitors. S. 414, The Ocean \nShipping Reform Act of 1997, would bring much-needed reform to the \nshipping industry by injecting a higher degree of competition into the \ncurrent conference-dominated system of ocean shipping. It would also \nend federal government tariff filing with the Federal Maritime \nCommission and I believe that this is a significant step toward \nreducing red tape in this industry.\n  First of all, I want to commend those Senators who have played an \nactive role in writing and furthering this important legislation. \nSenators Hutchison, Gorton, Lott, and Breaux have worked diligently to \nachieve a consensus among the diverse interests in the shipping \nindustry, and I know that is no small task. I also want to commend \nSenator McCain and his staff, who have endeavored to find common ground \nwith all affected parties by working openly and holding numerous \nmeetings. The result of this work is an important piece of legislation \non which I hope the Senate will be able to focus its attention in the \nnear future.\n  I care about this legislation because it could have a tremendous \nimpact on the agriculture industry which is, of course, vitally \nimportant to Kansas. Exporting is critical to the agriculture \nindustry--overall, forty percent of what we grow in the U.S. is \nconsumed overseas. Moreover, exports will play an increasingly \nimportant role in agriculture because any growth in the industry will \nprimarily come from exports. As the incomes of people in many \ndeveloping countries increase, they are able to afford a higher \nquality, more diversified diet--and the U.S. stands ready to provide \nit. And, the fastest growing category of agricultural commodities for \nexport are high-value products, such as meat and vegetables, which are \ntransported in ocean containers--the type of ocean transportation that \nis affected by this legislation.\n  Transportation costs are a particularly important factor in achieving \nagricultural exports because transportation typically comprises a \nlarger proportion of the final cost of the good than for other \nindustries. In fact, transportation is often the single largest \ncomponent of the delivered cost of the good, accounting for as much as \n50 percent of total landed cost. The U.S. Department of Agriculture \nestimates that the agriculture industry alone spends more than four \nbillion dollars each year in containerized shipping, and that this \nprice includes a premium attributable to conference market power which \nis 18 percent of the cost of transportation. In a business where sales \nare made or lost based on pennies per pound, this is the difference \nbetween the U.S. or our competitors making the sale. And, given that \nevery $1 in agricultural exports generates an additional $1.50 in \neconomic activity, the importance of S. 414 for not only the \nagriculture industry, but the U.S. economy as a whole, is clear.\n  This bill has the support of many farm organizations; in fact, I have \nletters that I would like to submit for the record from the American \nFarm Bureau Federation, the National Pork Producers Council, the \nNational Cattlemen's Beef Association, the National Grain and \nFeed Association, Farmland Industries, ConAgra, the National Broiler \nCouncil, and the American Frozen Food Institute. Additionally, many \nagricultural chemicals are exported via containerized ocean vessels \nwould benefit from reduced regulatory restraints.\n\n  However, while these organizations are united in their support for \nlegislation to reform ocean shipping, they also share the concern I \nhave regarding certain provisions of the bill in its current form. In \nits current form, this bill requires the reporting of essential \ncontract terms with the Intermodel Transportation Board. I must \nregister my belief that without contract confidentiality the basic \npremise of this legislation, to allow greater competition in the \nshipping industry, is severely undermined. What is gained by the \nability to negotiate individual contracts if one's competitors have \naccess to the essential terms of the contract?\n  When I voted for this bill as it was passed out of the Commerce \nCommittee on May 1 it was clear that outstanding concerns regarding \nconfidential contracting would be addressed before the bill was to be \nconsidered on the Senate floor. It was with that understanding that I \nsupported the bill. While I appreciate the sincere efforts that have \nbeen made to accommodate the interests of exporters since that time, my \nreservations remain because no agreement has been reached. I understand \nthat the distinguished majority leader has promised to bring this bill \nto the floor in its current form during this Congress and that Senator \nGorton has expressed his intention to address the contract reporting \nprovisions through amendment. While I am disappointed that more reform \nwill not be embraced in the bill that is brought to the floor, I \nrespect our leader's view and look forward to the debate that will \nensue.\n  I want to support this legislation. I support its underlying goal to \nreduce burdensome regulation. I believe that reducing regulatory \nhurdles that hinder the efficiency of U.S. businesses is the right \nthing to do, and it is one of the primary reasons that I came to \nWashington. However, to the extent that the reforms in this bill are \ndiminished, my support is eroded.\n  Nevertheless, I continue to believe in the importance of this \nlegislation. I hope that the Senate will take action soon so that the \nagriculture industry,\n\n[[Page S7706]]\n\nas well as all other industries which utilize containerized ocean \nshipping, will be able to increase their competitive advantage in the \nglobal marketplace.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                     June 4, 1997.\n     Hon. Sam Brownback,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Brownback: We are asking your assistance in \n     assuring that S. 414 is enacted in a form that will enable \n     shippers to contract with ocean carriers in the same manner \n     that they now contract with motor carriers and railroads.\n       Although we support the objective of S. 414, we are quite \n     concerned about some of the modifications that have been made \n     to the bill subsequent to introduction. We urge the \n     objectionable provisions be removed before the bill is sent \n     to the Senate floor.\n       (1) We are concerned with the language added that would \n     require filing of service contracts with the Intermodal \n     Transportation Board and the publications of the essential \n     terms of those contracts. We believe that the disclosure \n     requirements that have recently been incorporated into the \n     bill would serve only to inhibit the ability of ocean \n     carriers and shippers to negotiate contracts that best serve \n     their mutual interests. This is because disclosure will \n     enable ratemaking conferences to continue to pressure \n     individual carriers to maintain parallel pricing of ocean \n     transportation services. Disclosure is not required to \n     protect any shipper interest. Our members have contracted for \n     transportation services with railroads and motor carriers for \n     many years and have found that confidentiality has encouraged \n     carriers to agree to creative and responsive terms designed \n     to meet each customer's distinct transportation needs.\n       (2) We also believe that contracts should be excluded from \n     Section 10 which deals with discrimination and other \n     prohibited acts. Contracts of motor carriers and railroads \n     are not subject to such antidiscrimination provisions and \n     this has never presented any problems for shippers. Even the \n     present statute applicable to ocean carriers, which was \n     enacted in 1984, does not subject contracts to the prohibited \n     acts section of the statute. Therefore, including them would \n     represent a significant step backwards from where we are at \n     present. If there are concerns about potential abuses by \n     carrier conferences operating under antitrust immunity, we \n     would have no objection to making only those contracts to \n     which a conference itself is actually a party subject to such \n     provisions. An alternative would be to simply prohibit \n     conferences from entering into service contracts.\n       It is our understanding that certain port and maritime \n     labor interests have expressed a need to have access to terms \n     of transportation contracts for planning purposes. Whatever \n     information may be useful for those purposes is readily \n     available from the individual carriers that serve a \n     particular port or that employ members of maritime unions. It \n     is neither necessary nor appropriate to subject carriers and \n     shippers to burdensome regulatory requirements in order to \n     provide an alternative source for that type of information.\n       Again, we urge that the changes addressing our concerns be \n     made to S. 414 before it is sent to the Senate floor. If we \n     can provide you further information or otherwise be of \n     assistance to you with regard to this matter, please let us \n     know.\n           Sincerely,\n     American Farm Bureau Federation,\n     National Cattlemen's Beef Association,\n     National Pork Producers Council.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                National Grain and\n\n\n                                             Feed Association,\n\n                                                   April 29, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Re: S. 414, The Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1997.\n       Dear Chairman McCain: We are writing in response to last \n     week's staff draft of S. 414, which is scheduled for mark-up \n     by the Committee on May 1. We are extremely concerned about \n     several provisions of last week's draft, and urge the \n     Committee to reject S. 414 in its present form.\n       Further, the NGFA offers the following comments as the \n     Committee prepares to address the bill and any amendments:\n       1. The Federal Maritime Commission should not be merged \n     with the Surface Transportation Board. The NGFA has long \n     advocated the elimination of the Federal Maritime Commission \n     as an unnecessary entity. Additionally, the STB is already in \n     danger of becoming an ineffective agency because of \n     inadequate funding. Indeed, the Clinton Administration's \n     fiscal 1998 budget proposal would fund the agency entirely \n     from user fees. The Administration's proposal would ensure \n     that filling fees charged to rail users and others would rise \n     so high as to, as a practical matter, preclude recourse \n     before the agency. The NGFA has recommended that the STB be \n     eliminated and the Interstate Commerce Act repealed should \n     Congress choose not to adequately fund the agency. Combining \n     the FMC and the STB would simply compound the STB's existing \n     problems.\n       2. Users of ocean vessels and consumers would be better \n     served by eliminating the special antitrust protection \n     granted to liner vessel operators. Enforcement of U.S. \n     antitrust laws would be a more effective deterrent to \n     discriminatory treatment than the existing or proposed \n     regulatory scheme. Economic regulation of transportation \n     carriers can too easily be turned into a carrier shield to \n     block marketplace competition and enforcement of laws, such \n     as U.S. antitrust laws, that apply to shippers and other \n     businesses.\n       3. The bill fails to make needed changes to the Jones Act \n     and other cabotage laws. The Jones Act, in particular, \n     creates significant barriers and added costs for those \n     wishing to use self-propelled bulk vessels for shipments \n     between domestic deepwater ports. An ``ocean shipping reform \n     bill'' which fails to achieve reforms in our nation's \n     antiquated and market-distorting cabotage laws should not \n     move forward.\n       The NGFA is the national nonprofit trade association of \n     about 1,000 grain, feed and processing firms comprising 5,000 \n     facilities that store, handle, merchandise, mill, process and \n     export more than two-thirds of all U.S. grains and oilseeds \n     utilized in domestic and export markets. Founded in 1896, the \n     NGFA's members include country, terminal, and export \n     elevators; feed mills; cash grain and feed merchandisers; \n     commodity futures brokers and commission merchants; \n     processors; millers; and allied industries. The NGFA also \n     consists of 37 affiliated state and regional grain and feed \n     associations whose members include more than 10,000 grain and \n     feed companies nationwide.\n       As always, please contact me or David Barrett at the NGFA \n     if you have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Kendell W. Keith,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                        Farmland Industries, Inc.,\n\n\n                                              Kansas City, MO,\n\n                                                     June 4, 1997.\n     Hon. Sam Brownback,\n     U.S. Senate, Washngton, DC.\n       Dear Senator Brownback: I would first like to thank you for \n     your support of S. 414, The Ocean Shipping Reform Act of \n     1997. In my responsibilities with Farmland Industries, Inc., \n     I know first hand the need for changes in the archaic ocean \n     shipping laws which prevent U.S. companies from being \n     competitive in the world marketplace. S. 414, as approved by \n     the Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, went a \n     long way toward improving this inequity. However, there are \n     two areas which must be addressed if we are to have \n     legislation which truly meets this nation's future \n     international trade needs.\n       Confidential Contracts.--The amendment offered by Senator \n     Slade Gorton would aggregate contract information rather than \n     publicly disclosing data in contracts between ocean carriers \n     and their customers. We believe this excellent compromise \n     deserves your support since it would eliminate the current \n     bill's economic disadvantage of disclosing individual \n     contract information to our overseas competitors. This \n     approach, supported by Chairman John McCain in a Journal of \n     Commerce interview, provides the U.S. ports and labor the \n     information they say they need in determining cargo flows and \n     long term strategic planning and at the same time shields the \n     specific terms of ocean transportation contracts.\n       Eliminate Restrictions on Contracting.--S. 414, as \n     currently drafted, would apply broad antidiscrimination \n     provisions to all types of service contracts. If these were \n     to be put into effect, it would be extremely difficult for \n     carriers to know which contract terms and prices would be \n     discriminatory. We believe an easy solution to this problem \n     would be to apply these provisions only to contracts that \n     maintain antitrust immunity and by limiting the parties who \n     may bring an action under the provisions to ports and ocean \n     transportation intermediaries. These changes would ensure \n     that individual contracts may be entered into in a normal \n     business fashion and that adequate oversight is provided to \n     agreement contracts.\n       We ask your support for these changes to S. 414 and \n     ultimately for passage of legislation which would encourage \n     U.S. exports and greater international trade. Thank you for \n     your serious consideration of our position and proposals.\n           Yours very truly,\n                                                  Fred E. Schrodt,\n                                                   Vice President.\n                                                    ConAgra, Inc.,\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                   April 29, 1997.\n     Hon. Sam Brownback,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Attention: Tim McGivern\n     Subject: S. 414, The Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1997\n       Dear Senator: We have previously written to you to express \n     our strong support for S. 414. Because we spend more than \n     $200,000,000,00 each year on maritime transportation we are \n     vitally interested in elimination of artificial, outdated \n     regulatory constraints that handicap our ability to compete \n     in the global marketplace.\n       S. 414 is now scheduled for mark-up by the Committee on \n     Commerce, Science and\n\n[[Page S7707]]\n\n     Transportation on May 1, 1997. We are extremely concerned \n     about proposed amendments which surfaced over the weekend and \n     would, if incorporated into the bill, represent a giant step \n     backwards.\n       The key feature of S. 414 is the language that authorizes \n     individual ocean carriers to enter into confidential \n     transportation contracts. Similar provisions have been in \n     effect for years for virtually all other forms of \n     transportation including truckers, railroads, barge lines and \n     air carriers. They have proven to be tremendously effective \n     in promoting efficiency and thereby lowering transportation \n     costs to the benefit of both carriers and shippers. There is \n     nothing unique about maritime transportation that would cause \n     confidential contracts to be any less beneficial.\n       Amendments that are being promoted by foreign flag carriers \n     and their ratemaking cartels would eviscerate the \n     transportation contract provisions of the bill. Under the \n     misleading banner of antidiscrimination, the proposed \n     amendments would:\n       (1) require the filing of individual carrier contracts with \n     the Intermodal Transportation Board;\n       (2) require disclosure of the essential terms of each \n     contract;\n       (3) establish substantive standards of ``prejudice and \n     disadvantage'' that would effectively preclude carriers from \n     entering into service contracts that are tailored to meet the \n     distinct needs of shippers and to allow them to maximize the \n     efficiency of their operations; and\n       (4) create a regulatory scheme that would allow specious \n     challenges to service contracts as a pretext for obtaining \n     access to their terms.\n       Although such provisions are supposedly designed to benefit \n     shippers, the shipper community overwhelmingly opposes them. \n     Instead of removing unnecessary regulatory burdens, these \n     provisions would add new ones.\n       We urge you to oppose these amendments and allow S. 414 to \n     go forward in a form that would allow shippers to enter into \n     transportation contracts with individual ocean carriers in \n     the same manner as they have done with all other modes for \n     many years, with great economic benefit to both carriers and \n     shippers.\n       If you would like further detail about our concerns, we \n     will be happy to provide it.\n           Best wishes,\n                                                   Paul A. Korody,\n     Vice President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                     National Broiler Council,\n\n                                                     June 3, 1997.\n     Re S. 414 Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1997.\n     Hon. Sam Brownback,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Brownback: The National Broiler Council \n     strongly supports the objective of S. 414 to allow ocean \n     transportation to be more competitive by eliminating \n     unnecessary regulatory burdens. Because members of the \n     Broiler Council produce poultry that is sold for export, we \n     have a keen interest in enactment of S. 414.\n       Although we support the objective of S. 414, we are quite \n     concerned about some of the modifications that have been made \n     to the bill since it was originally introduced. We would urge \n     that two amendments be made before the bill is sent to the \n     Senate floor in order to enable the shipping public to \n     realize the full benefits in the original bill.\n       We are concerned with language that has been inserted in \n     the bill that would require filing of service contracts with \n     the Intermodal Transportation Board and the publication of \n     essential terms of those contracts. Our members have \n     contracted for transportation services with railroads and \n     motor carriers for many years and have found that filing of \n     contracts with a regulatory agency is unnecessary and \n     needlessly burdensome. We believe that the disclosure \n     requirements that have crept into the bill would serve only \n     to inhibit the ability of individual ocean carriers and \n     shippers to negotiate contracts that best serve their mutual \n     interests. The filing and processing of those contracts would \n     also require perpetuation of an unnecessary bureaucracy, \n     since virtually no other transportation mode is required to \n     file its contracts with any regulatory agency. If there are \n     concerns about potential abuses by carrier conferences \n     operating under antitrust immunity, we would have no \n     objection to contracts to which a conference itself is \n     actually a party being subject to such provisions. An \n     alternative would be to simply prohibit conferences from \n     entering into contracts. However, individual ocean carriers \n     should be able to negotiate and enter into contracts in the \n     same manner that has worked so well for motor carriers and \n     railroads.\n       As a related matter, we believe that contracts should be \n     excluded from Section 10 of S. 414 which deals with \n     discrimination and other prohibited acts. Contracts of motor \n     carriers and railroads are not subject to such \n     antidiscrimination provisions and this has never presented \n     any problem to shippers. In fact, under the terms of the \n     present statute, which was enacted in 1984, service contracts \n     of ocean carriers are not subject to the prohibited acts \n     section of the statute.\n       Therefore, including them would represent a significant \n     step backwards from where we are at present.\n       We understand that certain port and maritime labor \n     interests have expressed a need to have access to terms of \n     transportation contracts for planning purposes. Whatever \n     information may be needed for those purposes is readily \n     available from the individual carriers that serve a \n     particular port or that employ members of maritime unions.

John McCain,\n     Chairman, Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the members of the \n     American Frozen Institute (AFFI), this letter is to urge your \n     continued support for expedient final passage of S. 414, The \n     Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1977.\n       As S. 414 advances for consideration by the full Senate, \n     AFFI urges you and your colleagues on the Commerce, Science \n     and Transportation Committee to support efforts to modify the \n     bill as reported by the Committee to maximize confidentiality \n     in ocean shipping contracting. The Institute also urges your \n     support for efforts to ensure that the broad \n     antidiscrimination provisions included in the reported bill \n     will not create a disincentive for firms to enter into \n     individual contract negotiations.\n       The American Frozen Food Institute is the national trade \n     association that has represented the interests of frozen food \n     manufacturers, processors, marketers and suppliers for more \n     than 50 years. The Institute's 550 member companies account \n     for over 90 percent of the total annual production of frozen \n     food in the United States, valued at approximately $60 \n     billion.\n       Meaningful reform of U.S. ocean shipping laws is critical \n     to foster international trade in an increasingly global \n     marketplace. The refinements to S. 414 recommended above \n     would further this goal by promoting more competitive pricing \n     and contracting for products which are imported from and \n     exported to overseas markets by frozen food processors and \n     other U.S. shippers.\n       Thank you again for the leadership you and your Committee \n     have demonstrated on maritime reform. If AFFI may be of \n     assistance to you or your staff in accomplishing this shared \n     objective, please feel free to give me a call.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Steven C. Anderson,\n     President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/17/senate-section/article/S7705-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7707]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports \nthat for the week ending July 11, the U.S. imported 7,678,000 barrels \nof oil each day, 409,000 barrels more than the 7,269,000 imported each \nday during the same week a year ago.\n  Americans relied on foreign oil for 54.9 percent of their needs last \nweek, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before \nthe Persian gulf war, the United States obtained approximately 45 \npercent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil \nembargo in the 1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of \nAmerica's oil supply.\n\n[[Page S7708]]\n\n  Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil?

A bill to extend the native American veteran direct housing \nloan pilot program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n\n\n     NATIVE AMERICAN VETERANS HOUSING LOAN IMPROVEMENTS LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce \nlegislation to extend and improve the native American veteran direct \nloan pilot program. I am pleased to add Senators Johnson, Domenici, and \nHatch as cosponsors of this legislation.\n  America's most important resource has always been the individuals \nwilling to lay down their lives for their country. Throughout our \nhistory we have been blessed with men and women willing to put \nthemselves at risk for the greater good.\n  Native Americans have been proud to be a part of this Nation's \ndefense. From the revolutionary era to our ongoing peacekeeping \nmissions around the globe, native Americans have served and continue to \nserve the United States honorably. It may surprise some members to know \nthat native Americans served, suffered, and died in service to this \nNation even though they were not allowed to be citizens until 1924.\n  As a veteran I feel a special kinship with all those men and women \nwho served this Nation in peacetime and in war. As an Indian veteran I \nam keenly aware of the dedicated service Indians, Alaskans, and \nHawaiians have given--often without recognition of their sacrifice.\n  How can we compensate these men and women for making the greatest \nsacrifice they could? There is no dollar value we can place on a life. \nAt the very least, we must provide the basic benefits of health care, \nhousing, and education to those that laid down their lives for America.\n  Since 1992, the Department of Veterans Affairs has operated a direct \nhousing loan program to help native America veterans build decent \nhomes. I was amazed to find out that in the last 5 years, that program \nhad provided eight Indian veterans with loans.\n  That is not an indication that all Indian veterans have no housing \nneeds. During a hearing on veterans issues, members of the Indian \nAffairs Committee saw videotape of the houses used by Navajo veterans. \nThey looked like something you would see in a Third World nation, not \nAmerica. Houses had holes in their roofs and walls and plastic sheets \nfor windows. Many houses do not have working plumbing and water has to \nbe carried from miles away. This is certainly not the appreciation and \nrespect war veterans deserve.\n  Native Americans seeking home loans face many obstacles unique to \nIndian country, including poor economic conditions and the fact that \nthe land cannot be used as collateral. But the most surprising \nrevelation at the committee's hearing was that the majority of Indian \nveterans seem to have little or no knowledge that the VA's direct loan \nprogram exists. If they do, many do not know how or where to apply. The \nGovernment has no problem finding these men and women when it is time \nto draft them to fight in a war. But when it is time to pay them back \nfor their sacrifice, the effort just is not there.\n  That is why the bill I introduce today does more than extend the \ndirect loan program for 3 years. It includes measures to boost the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs' efforts to implement the direct loan \nprogram for native American veterans. The bill places new requirements \non the Department to consult with tribal organizations, native veterans \norganizations, and other groups prior to making decisions under the \nact. It also expresses Congress's desire that the Department carry out \nvigorous outreach and education efforts to inform potential \nbeneficiaries of the housing assistance benefits under the\n\n[[Page S7711]]\n\nact. The bill requires the Department to submit annual reports to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs, the House Resources Committee, and the \nVeterans' Committees of both Chambers containing a description of the \noutreach activities undertaken by the VA on a regional basis, with a \nsecond mandate that the VA conduct an assessment of how effective these \nefforts have been in encouraging greater use of the loan program.\n  We must honor the service and sacrifice of our warriors. We must \nrecognize the sacrifice they have made for all of us. The direct loan \nprogram is an ambitious idea designed to help our veterans with the \nmost basic human need: a roof over their heads. It should not sit \nunused because of bureaucratic complacency. It is my hope that this \nreauthorization, with the appropriate changes, will jumpstart the \nDepartment's efforts to make the program available to native veterans \nand help them use it. I believe it is the least we can do. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this critical legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na section-by-section analysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1027\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Native Americans across the United States have a long, \n     proud, and distinguished tradition of service in the Armed \n     Forces of the United States.\n       (2) Native Americans have historically served in the Armed \n     Forces in numbers which far exceed their representation in \n     the population of the United States.\n       (3) Native Americans have lost their lives in the service \n     of the United States and in the cause of peace.\n       (4) The demand for safe, decent, and affordable housing \n     among the 210,000 Native American veterans in the United \n     States is acute.\n       (5) Native American veterans face unique impediments to the \n     use of traditional housing programs to benefit veterans such \n     as poor economic conditions, the legal status of Indian trust \n     lands, and the lack of incentives for lenders to make loans \n     on trust lands.\n\n     SEC. 2. EXTENSION OF DIRECT HOUSING LOAN PILOT PROGRAM.\n\n       Section 3761(c) of title 38, United States Code, is amended \n     by striking out ``September 30, 1997'' and inserting in lieu \n     thereof ``September 30, 2000''.\n\n     SEC. 3. OUTREACH.\n\n       Section 3762(i) of title 38, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``, in consultation with tribal \n     organizations and Native American veterans organizations,'' \n     after ``The Secretary shall''; and\n       (2) by striking out ``tribal organizations and''.\n\n     SEC. 4. CONSULTATION WITH NATIVE AMERICAN VETERANS \n                   ORGANIZATIONS.\n\n       The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall consult with Native \n     American veterans organizations in carrying out the Native \n     American veterans direct housing loan program under \n     subchapter V of chapter 37 of title 38, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 5. ANNUAL REPORTS.\n\n       Section 8(d) of the Veterans Home Loan Program Amendments \n     of 1992 (Public Law 102-547; 106 Stat. 3640; 38 U.S.C. 3761 \n     note) is amended--\n       (1) in the matter preceding paragraph (1)--\n       (A) by striking out ``1998,'' and inserting in lieu thereof \n     ``2001,''; and\n       (B) by inserting ``, the Committee on Indian Affairs of the \n     Senate, and the Committee on Resources of the House of \n     Representatives'' after ``the House of Representatives'';\n       (2) by striking out ``and'' at the end of paragraph (3);\n       (3) by redesignating paragraph (4) as paragraph (5); and\n       (4) by inserting after paragraph (3) the following new \n     paragraph (4):\n       ``(4) a description of the outreach activities undertaken \n     by the Secretary under section 3762(i) of such title (as so \n     added) which--\n       ``(A) specifies such activities on a region-by-region \n     basis; and\n       ``(B) assesses the effectiveness of such activities in \n     encouraging the participation of Native American veterans in \n     the pilot program; and''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\nVeterans Direct Housing Loan Pilot Program--Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Background. Begun in 1992, the Native American Veterans \n     Housing Program is due to be reauthorized. The account \n     retains some $3.5 million of an original $5 million \n     appropriation. Since 1992, the performance of the Veterans \n     Administration in distributing this money to Indians is poor, \n     especially compared with the experience of the Native \n     Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders. The goal of the amendments \n     is to get the VA to do its job better in Indian country. The \n     reasons adduced by the VA for the poor performance are not \n     convincing.\n       Section 1. New Findings Section. This section recognizes \n     Indians' long and historic contributions made to the Armed \n     Forces and defense of the United States. This section also \n     recognizes the acute need for housing among the more than \n     200,000 native veterans, and the unique impediments native \n     veterans face due to poor economic conditions on the \n     reservation, and the inability to securitize Indian trust \n     lands.\n       Section 2. Extension of Program. The bill would extend the \n     authority for the program for 3 years, to September 30, 2000.\n       Section 3. Outreach. Most of the discernible problems in \n     the implementation of this program involve a lack of \n     knowledge about the program by Indians and lack of proactive \n     endeavors by the VA to disseminate information about the \n     program through Indian country. The bill would place new \n     requirements on the VA to consult with tribal organizations, \n     native veterans organizations, and other groups prior to \n     making decisions under the act.\n       Section 4. Consultation with Native American Veterans \n     Organizations. This new section requires the VA to consult \n     with native veterans organizations in implementing the act.\n       Section 5. Annual Reports. The VA is required to submit \n     annual reports to the Committee on Indian Affairs, the House \n     Resources Committee, and the veterans committees of both \n     Chambers containing a description of the outreach activities \n     undertaken by the VA on a regional basis, with a second \n     mandate that the VA conduct an assessment of the efficacy of \n     such activities in encouraging greater use of the program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 1028. A bill to direct the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct a \npilot project on designated lands within Plumas, Lassen, and Tahoe \nNational Forests in the State of California to demonstrate the \neffectiveness of the resource management activities proposed by the \nQuincy Library Group and to amend current land and resource management; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\nThe Quincy Library Group Forest Recovery and Economic Stability Act of \n                                  1997\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today Senator Barbara Boxer and I are \nintroducing the Quincy Library Group Forest Recovery and Economic \nStability Act of 1997. This legislation is nearly identical to H.R. 858 \nsponsored in the House of Representatives by Congressman Wally Herger \nand passed by the House last week on a vote of 429 to 1.\n  The House vote is remarkable for two reasons:\n  First, any legislation involving a controversial issue--particularly \non one as contentious as forest management --that receives 429 votes is \nremarkable in and of itself.\n  Second, the process by which this legislation evolved is really, I \nthink, groundbreaking, and it deserves to be recognized.\n  I first met the Quincy Library Group back in 1992 when I was running \nfor the Senate, and was then very impressed with what they were trying \nto do.\n  The overwhelming House vote is a real victory for local communities \nlike Quincy which seek to avoid the polarizing--and often paralyzing--\nbattles that have characterized forest management issues for the last \ndecade.\n  The Quincy Library Group is a local coalition of timber industry \nrepresentatives, environmentalists, citizens, and elected officials in \nPlumas, Lassen, and Sierra Counties, CA, who came together to resolve \ntheir long-standing conflicts over timber management on the national \nforest lands in their area.\n  They had seen first hand the seemingly ever present conflict between \ntimber harvesting and jobs, environmental laws and protection of their \ncommunities and forests, and the devastation of massive forest fires. \nThey also saw that a practical solution to the conflict between timber \ninterests and environmental interests were both going to be wiped out \none day by uncontrollable wildfires. And so they tried to get together \nand talk things out.\n  They decided to meet in a quiet, non-confrontational environment--the \nmain room of the Quincy Public Library. Hence, they became known as the \nQuincy Library Group.\n\n  They began their dialog in the recognition that they shared the \ncommon goal of fostering forest health, ecological integrity, an \nadequate timber supply for area mills, and economic stability for their \ncommunity.\n  So, after a year-and-a-half of negotiation, the Quincy Library Group \ndeveloped an alternative management\n\n[[Page S7712]]\n\nplan for the Lassen National Forest, Plumas National Forest, and \nSierraville Ranger District of the Tahoe National Forest.\n  This legislation is the result. The bill we introduce today \nimplements the Quincy Library Group's plan.\n  I know that some environmental organizations had concerns about \naspects of this legislation, and some may still oppose it.\n  But let me make something very clear: As I stated when I met with the \nQuincy Library Group, in order to have my support, the legislation had \nto explicitly state that all activities would be carried out consistent \nwith all applicable Federal environmental laws, both substantive and \nprocedural. The administration made this requirement clear as well.\n  The House bill and this legislation do so.\n  Another condition for my support, and that of the administration, was \nthat the legislation must authorize sufficient funds to carry out the \nplan, so that funds will not be diverted from other important programs \nlike wildlife protection, grazing and recreation.\n  The House bill and this legislation authorize appropriations to do \nso.\n  With these key provisions in place, I believe this legislation \ndeserves strong support and swift passage.\n  Specifically, this legislation:\n  Directs the Secretary of Agriculture to implement the Quincy Library \nGroup's forest management proposal on designated lands in the Plumas, \nLassen, and Tahoe National Forests for 5 years as a demonstration \nof community-based consensus forest management;\n\n  Protects the California spotted owl and riparian areas by excluding \nall spotted owl habitat in the pilot project area from logging and \nother resource management activities during the 5-year pilot project, \nand requiring the Forest Service to follow the scientific analysis team \nguidelines for riparian system protection;\n  Calls for the construction of fuel breaks on 40,000 to 60,000 acres a \nyear;\n  Provides for group selection on 0.57 percent of the project area \nannually as well as individual tree selection uneven-aged forest \nmanagement;\n  Limits the total acreage subject to forest management activities to \n70,000 acres annually;\n  Requires a program of riparian management, including wide protection \nzones and riparian restoration projects;\n  Requires the preparation of an environmental impact statement prior \nto the commencement of the pilot project;\n  Authorizes the appropriation of funds to carry out the Quincy Library \nGroup pilot project;\n  Directs the Forest Service to amend the land and resource management \nplans for the Plumas, Lassen, and Tahoe National Forests to consider \nadoption of the Quincy Library Group plan in the forest management \nplans;\n  Requires an annual report to Congress on the status of the pilot \nproject, including the source and use of funds, the acres treated and \ndescription of the results, economic benefits to the local communities, \nand activities planned for the following year; and finally,\n  Requires a scientific assessment of the Quincy Library Group project \nto be commenced at the midpoint of the project and submitted to \nCongress by July 1, 2002.\n  At the suggestion of the environmental community, and with the \nconcurrence of the Quincy Library Group, I have added language to the \nHouse version of the bill to provide additional environmental \nsafeguards. These additions will ensure that there will be no road \nbuilding or timber harvesting on the lands the Quincy Library Group \nplan designated as off base, plan designates certain lands as deferred, \nand require the annual reports and the final report on the Quincy \nLibrary Group project to include a report on any adverse environmental \nimpacts of the pilot project. Finally, it is our intention that areas \nof late successional emphasis identified in the Sierra Nevada ecosystem \nproject report also be protected from resource management activities \nduring the pilot project, and I will seek committee report language on \nthis issue.\n\n  What all this means is that as a result of the Quincy Library Group \npilot project:\n  The threat of catastrophic forest fires will be reduced, through the \nclearing of underbrush and thinning of the smaller trees;\n  Enough jobs in the forests will be provided to keep the local mills \nin operation and the communities in existence; and\n  Forest health will be improved, riparian areas will be restored, and \nbiological diversity maintained.\n  Mr. President, I believe the Quincy Library Group deserves a great \ndeal of credit and respect for approaching a tough issue with the goal \nof finding common ground.\n  There is a lot of common ground. They all live in the area. They all \nwork there. They raise their children there. They all care about both \nthe environment and the industry that provides jobs to the region. They \nwanted to work out a solution instead of continuing the take-no-\nprisoners-approach of endless litigation and standoff.\n  I believe the solution-based approach demonstrated by the Quincy \nLibrary Group should be supported by the Congress, and that is why I \ncommitted months ago to introduce legislation based on this group's \nefforts.\n  On an issue like forest management and timber harvesting, many local \nvariables are involved and must be considered to find workable \nsolutions:\n  For example, the wildfire threat in Tennessee is not the same as it \nis in California.\n  And the economic impact of the timber industry may be different in \nHayfork, CA than it is in Juneau, AK.\n  The bottom line is that, as long as certain basic standards of \nenvironmental law are met, this pilot project will demonstrate whether \na local initiative can be successful in developing a forest management \nplan that works to protect the old growth trees, endangered species, \nand jobs for the community.\n  And based on that belief I am pleased to support their efforts by \nsponsoring this legislation in the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1028\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The Quincy Library Group Forest Recovery and Economic \nStability Act is the result of many years of consensus building in an \neffort to unite unlikely partners in a mutually beneficial project.\n  President Clinton spurred this consensus approach in April 1993, at \nthe Northwest Forest Summit, when he challenged Americans to stay in \nthe conference room and out of the courtroom. One local group put this \ndifficult challenge into action and began a series of meetings in the \nonly place they knew they could ensure civility, and some degree of \nquiet--their local library. With that, the Quincy Library Group was \ncreated.\n  This group of local citizens surrounding Quincy, CA, including timber \nindustry representatives, local environmental activists, and public \nofficials, have been meeting periodically since 1992 to develop a \ntimber management plan for the areas' surrounding national forests. \nThey did not have an easy task before them--promoting the local \neconomy, preserving jobs, and protecting the environment.\n  Several years ago I visited Quincy, CA, and had an opportunity to see \nfirst hand the problems in the forests and the community at work. Since \nthat time, I have worked with the Quincy Library Group, U.S. Forest \nService, Senator Feinstein, Members of Congress, and the national \nenvironmental community in an effort to reach a consensus.\n  I believe that is what we have before us today. This legislation will \nimplement the Quincy Library Group proposal for managing the Tahoe, \nLassen, and Sierraville Range of the Tahoe National Forests through \nbiological reserves, fire suppression, riparian restoration, watershed \nprotection, and monitoring.\n  The House passed a companion bill earlier this week by a near \nunanimous vote. I believe the overwhelming success in the House was \nlargely due to the inclusion of provisions which ensure compliance with \nall environmental laws, as well as interim and final California spotted \nowl guidelines.\n  This proposal has gone through years of collaboration from many \ndedicated people with many different interests. We now have legislation \nto implement this consensus--legislation which can be fined tuned as it \nmoves through the legislative process.\n  The President's statement of administration policy on the House \ncompanion bill suggests further refining the bill so that the pilot \nproject will end once the Forest Service completes the appropriate \nforest plan amendments. I would be supportive of such a change to the \nbill.\n  Some have suggested that the legislation increase the protection of \nall old growth forests in the area and ensure that logging and road \nbuilding be prohibited in all roadless and sensitive areas. We should \nconsider that change.\n  I hope that these concerns can be addressed as this bill moves \nthrough the legislative process. Nonetheless, many positive changes \nhave been made to the legislation over the last few months, and \nalthough some outstanding concerns still remain, the legislation now \nprovides many of the safeguards necessary to protect the natural \nenvironment while promoting the local economy.\n  I want to thank Senator Feinstein, Congressmen Fazio, Miller, Herger, \nYoung, and the Forest Service for their efforts on this legislation. It \nhas truly been a cooperative effort and I hope we are able to pass this \nlegislation quickly so that we will soon be able to see the proposal \nimplemented on the ground.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 1029. A bill to provide loan forgiveness for individuals who earn \na degree in early childhood education, and enter and remain employed in \nthe early child care profession, to provide loan cancellation for \ncertain child care providers, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n              The Quality Child Care Loan Forgiveness Act\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I send a bill to the desk now, a bill on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Wellstone.\n  Mr. President, this bill is the Quality Child Care Loan Forgiveness \nAct and it is intended to, at least in part, deal with a very serious \nproblem in this country. That problem simply is that more and more \nchildren, more and more of our children, are every day in child care. \nThere is a real concern about the quality of child care. This bill does \nnot solve every problem in regard to child care, but I think it is a \nstart and I think it would make a significant impact.\n  Today, more than 70 percent of mothers are in the labor force. Almost \n75 percent of married couples with children have both spouses working. \nAll of these working parents, plus parents moving from welfare to work, \nhave to find someone to care for their children if they are going to go \nout and support their families. Yet today, child care is often very \nhard to find and quality child care is even harder to find. In just 20 \nyears, the last 20 years, the percentage of children enrolled in some \nform, in some manner, of child care has gone from 30 percent to 70 \npercent.\n  Quality child care is a concern to virtually every family in this \ncountry. More and more parents are working. More and more children are \nin child care. I think the very least we can do is to try to assure \nthose families that, while they are at work, their children will be \ntaken care of by qualified and by competent individuals. This, \nunfortunately, is not always taking place today. There are many \nqualified people in child care. There are very many dedicated people in \nchild care. But I think we can do better. This is what this bill \nintends to address.\n  Scientists tell us that the largest indicator of a child's \nintelligence is the mother's education level. While a mother is at \nwork, then it becomes the education level of the child care provider \nthat the child deals with for, sometimes, an extended period of time \nduring the day. With all the new research that we see on the brain and \nearly childhood development, I think we have to reemphasize this \nparticular aspect of child care. We need well-educated, well-trained \nchild care providers. One of the ways we can achieve this, one of the \nthings that we can do to raise the quality of child care, is to say to \nindividuals who are inclined to go into the child care profession that \nwe will in fact help them if they want to make this a profession.\n  We have to let people know, if they are going to earn a degree to \ntake care of our children, we will help them. Our bill, the bill \nintroduced today by Senator Wellstone and myself, will do this. Our \nbill would help repay the student loans of an individual who earns an \nearly childhood degree and would help repay the loan of that person who \ngoes to work in a licensed child care facility. The Quality Child Care \nLoan Forgiveness Act would pay off a student loan at the rate of 15 \npercent a year for people who earn an early childhood degree and who \nwork in a licensed child care facility.\n  This bill will help bring more qualified individuals to the child \ncare profession. It would also help to decrease the high turnover \nlevels caused, many times, by very low wages.\n  Let me conclude. The Quality Child Care Loan Forgiveness Act is an \nimportant way to improve the quality of child care. American parents \nneed it for their peace of mind, and American children need it for \ntheir mind development.\n  I thank the Chair and ask unanimous consent at this time that the \nfull text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1029\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Quality Child Care Loan \n     Forgiveness Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) New scientific research shows that the electrical \n     activity of brain cells actually changes the physical \n     structure of the brain, and that without a stimulating \n     environment, a baby's brain suffers.\n       (2) 12,000,000 children under age 6, and 17,000,000 school-\n     aged children of working parents, need child care. Demand for \n     child care is growing as more mothers enter the workforce.\n       (3) Good quality child care, in a safe environment, with \n     trained, caring providers who offer stimulating activities \n     appropriate to the child's age, help children grow and \n     thrive. Recent research shows that most child care needs \n     significant improvement.\n       (4) Good quality child care depends largely on the \n     provider. Yet providers of child care earn on average only \n     $6.70 per hour or $11,725\n\n[[Page S7715]]\n\n     per year. Such earnings cause high turnover, which affects \n     the overall quality of a child care program and causes \n     anxiety for children.\n       (5) Children attending lower-quality child care facilities \n     and child care facilities with high staff turnover are less \n     competent in language and social development.\n       (6) Low-income and high-income children are more likely \n     than middle-income children to attend child care facilities \n     providing high quality child care.\n       (7) The quality of child care is primarily related to high \n     staff-to-child ratios, staff education, and administrators' \n     prior experience. In addition, certain characteristics \n     distinguish poor, mediocre, and good-quality child care \n     facilities, the most important of which are teacher wages, \n     education, and specialized training.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to bring more highly trained individuals into the early \n     child care profession; and\n       (2) to keep more highly trained child care providers in the \n     early child care field for longer periods of time.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nOhio to introduce a bill that is an important step toward protecting \nthe lives and the future of this Nation's children. Today in the Labor \nCommittee, we will hear from the parents of a 3-month-old baby who lost \nhis life after only 2 hours in daycare. We as a society must share some \nof the responsibility for this tragedy with the daycare center that \nneglected Jeremy Fiedelholtz. We as a society have allowed daycares to \nbe under funded and understaffed, because we have not valued the \nposition of daycare provider. We have not treated that job as a \nprofession, we have not respected their responsibilities and considered \nsuch individuals to have a career worthy of compensation, attention, \nand respect.\n  The bill that my colleague and I introduce today would provide loan \nforgiveness for individuals who earn a degree in early childhood \neducation, and enter and remain employed in the early child care \nprofession. It would also provide forgiveness for some existing child \ncare providers who remain in the profession.\n  The bill seeks to make child care more affordable and to increase the \nquality of child care by making a career in child care more profitable. \nIt would help make the career of caregiver more affordable and more \nfeasible for those interested in helping children grow. Nationally, \nchild care workers have the following statistics:\n\n[[Page S7716]]\n\n97 percent are female; 33 percent are women of color; 41 percent have \nchildren; 10 percent are single parents; only 18 percent of child care \ncenters offer their workers health coverage.\n  In Minnesota child care centers, the average hourly wage for a child \ncare provider is $8.72; for an assistant teacher is $6.66; and for an \naide is $5.69. Minnesota family child care providers, who are never \ncovered by the Fair Labor Standards Act, have an average hourly wage of \n$2.79, and make $7,800 a year for a 60-hour work week. With changes \ncreated by the welfare bill in the Federal child care food program, \nmany family child care providers will become ineligible for this \nprogram; those who don't pass the costs of care on to the parents will \nhave negative earnings--they will actually lose $71 a week.\n  Nationally, child care teaching staff earn $6.89 an hour and $12,000 \na year. Family child care providers earn $9,500, and unregulated \nproviders, $5,100. Although they are better educated than the average \nworker, child care workers earn one-third of the average male salary \nand one-half of the average female salary. It is no surprise that one-\nthird of them leave their centers every year.\n  In the meantime, in Minnesota, there are 8,960 children on the \nwaiting list for child care. There are probably another 13,440 children \nwho would apply if the waiting list wasn't so long. Mr. President, add \nall this up and you have a recipe for disaster. Child care is without \nquestion among the most important issues facing the workforce today. \nParents who can't care for their children, can't work. Child care is \nwithout question among the most important issues facing the field of \neducation today. Children who are not stimulated and cared for during \nthe earliest years will never be able to reach his or her full \npotential when they grow up.\n  If we don't take the profession seriously and encourage people of \ncaliber to enter the profession of caregiving, and reward those who \nremain in the profession, then we are risking our economic future and \nputting at risk millions of children like Jeremy Fiedelholtz. I urge my \ncolleagues to join us in this bipartisan effort to invest money where \nit is most needed.\n  Let me just say I am very honored to introduce this legislation with \nSenator DeWine. I thoroughly enjoy working with him, and I think we are \nboth very committed to this piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, in the Labor Committee today, we are going to hear \nfrom the parents of a 3-month-old baby who lost his life after only 2 \nhours in child care. If you look at the reports, the conditions around \nour country are not what they should be for children, and if you just \nthink about the pay scale of women and men--they are mainly women--who \nare child care providers, we have devalued the work of adults who work \nwith children. What this piece of legislation does is it provides loan \nforgiveness for individuals who earn a degree in early childhood \ndevelopment and then remain employed in this early childhood \nprofession. It also would have some forgiveness for existing child care \nproviders who remain in the profession.\n  What we are simply trying to say here, I say to my colleagues, is \nthat the neuroscience evidence is compelling, these early years are \ncritical years, we have to get it right, there has to be a nurturing \ncare and the intellectual stimulation and, yet, if you look around the \ncountry, nationally child care teaching staff earn an average of $6.89 \nan hour, or about $12,000 a year.\n  Actually, in many of our States, people who work in zoos, and by the \nway I love visiting zoos--it is not my point to put down that work--\nearn twice as much as women and men who work in child care centers. If \nwe really value children and we really understand that pre-K is so \nimportant, and if we really understand--and we should and we must--that \nwe have to make sure that by age 3, children have gotten the nurturing \ncare in order for them to be able to go on and do well in school and do \nwell in life, then it is terribly important that we attach more value \nto the work that is being done.\n  That is what this piece of legislation does, which provides the loan \nforgiveness for women and men I hope will go into this profession. It \nis a small step forward, but it is an extremely important step.\n  I am very pleased to introduce this legislation today with my \ncolleague, Senator DeWine.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 1030. A bill to amend title IV of the Public Health Service Act to \nestablish a National Center for Bioengineering Research; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n      The National Center for Bioengineering Research Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National \nCenter for Bioengineering Research Act of 1997. Bioengineering is where \nmedical need and technical capability meet to increase our capacity to \ndiagnose and treat disease; to enhance the quality of life of millions \nof people with chronic conditions; to save millions of dollars in \nhealth care costs; and to generate billions of dollars for our economy. \nMedical devices alone is a $40 billion-a-year industry.\n  Bioengineering is an interdisciplinary field that applies physical, \nchemical, and mathematical sciences and engineering principles to the \nstudy of biology, medicine, behavior, and health. It advances knowledge \nfrom the molecular to the organ systems level, and develops new and \nnovel biologics, materials, processes, implant, devices, and \ninformatics approaches for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of \ndisease, for patient rehabilitation, and for improving health.\n  Although the term ``bioengineering'' may not be commonplace, many of \nthe major medical advances from bioengineering are very familiar, \nincluding the heart-lung machine, kidney dialysis, total hip joint \nreplacements, heart pacemakers, artificial hearts, prosthetics, and \ndiagnostic medical imaging. Other advances are right around the corner, \nincluding implantable insulin pumps with biosensors that detect exactly \nwhen and how much insulin is needed; and regeneration of tissue, \ncartilage, and even organs, instead of transplantation--which brings \nwith it the risk of rejection, major trauma to the patient, and one of \nthe highest costs in our entire health care system. As a heart-lung \ntransplant surgeon, I know first hand about the life-saving \ncontributions made by all of these bioengineering developments. We need \nas many new achievements like this as we can produce.\n  In spite of such spectacular achievements, however, the field of \nbioengineering suffers from fragmentation and a lack of coordination \nthat could impede and delay future advances in the field. This \nfragmentation was recognized as early as 1967, when an international \nconference called for better coordination in bioengineering research.\n  In 1995, at the request of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human \nResources, the NIH submitted a report, ``Support for Bioengineering \nResearch.'' This report was remarkably consistent with a number of \nprevious studies over the last 30 years that stressed the need for: a \ncentralized focus for extramural bioengineering research at NIH; a \nstrong intramural bioengineering program at NIH; and increased \ncoordination of bioengineering activities within NIH and among other \nFederal agencies.\n  This legislation seeks to implement those recommendations and is \ndesigned to enhance the state of and improve the coordination of \nbioengineering research conducted within NIH and throughout the Federal \nGovernment. This bill calls for the establishment of a National Center \nfor Bioengineering Research within the National Heart, Lung and Blood \nInstitute at NIH. The mission of the Center is to:\n       First, enhance the state of bioengineering research within \n     NIH;\n       Second, promote collaborative research projects among NIH \n     institutes and across Federal agencies;\n       Third, enhance communication among bioengineering \n     investigators within Federal agencies and with private sector \n     entities; and\n       Fourth, educate the Congress and the public on the critical \n     importance of bioengineering to both the health and the \n     economy of the Nation.\n  This legislation does not create a new institute within NIH. The \nCenter would have no grantmaking authority. New funding would be \nallocated to institutes to support basic research projects in \nbioengineering through the standard peer review process.\n  This legislation is introduced today as a stand-alone bill. But I \nexpect it to\n\n[[Page S7717]]\n\nbe included in the reauthorization bill for the National Institutes of \nHealth which, as Chair of the Public Health and Safety Subcommittee of \nthe Committee on Labor and Human Resources, I intend to move forward \nduring the first session of the 105th Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill and summary be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1030\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Center for \n     Bioengineering Research Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Bioengineering is an interdisciplinary field that \n     applies physical, chemical, and mathematical sciences and \n     engineering principles to the study of biology, medicine, \n     behavior, and health. It advances knowledge from the \n     molecular to the organ systems level, and develops new and \n     novel biologics, materials, processes, implants, devices, and \n     informatics approaches for the prevention, diagnosis, and \n     treatment of disease, for patient rehabilitation, and for \n     improving health.\n       (2) Efforts to reduce Federal budget deficits require that \n     resources be managed in ways to maximize productivity.\n       (3) As part of the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993, Congress \n     asked for a report on the state of bioengineering research at \n     the National Institutes of Health.\n       (4) In 1994, as requested by the Congress, an External \n     Consultants Committee submitted a report to the Director of \n     the National Institutes of Health on support for \n     bioengineering research.\n       (5) In 1995, the Director of the National Institutes of \n     Health submitted a report to Congress on Support for \n     Bioengineering Research, that included recommendations for \n     greater coordination of bioengineering research.\n       (6) In 1996, an amendment to the National Institutes of \n     Health Revitalization Act of 1996 directed the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services, acting through the Director of the \n     National Institutes of Health, to ``prepare and submit to the \n     Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate and the \n     Committee on Commerce of the House of Representatives, a \n     report containing specific plans and timeframes on how the \n     Director will implement the findings and recommendations of \n     the Report to Congress entitled Support for Bioengineering \n     Research submitted to Congress in August 1995 in compliance \n     with Public Law 103-43, the National Institutes of Health \n     (NIH) Revitalization Act of 1993, Section 1912''. This \n     legislation passed the Senate but was not acted upon by the \n     House.\n       (7) In the spring of 1997, the National Institutes of \n     Health established the Bioengineering Consortium, with \n     representation from each of the institutes, to advance \n     bioengineering and its mission within the National Institutes \n     of Health.\n       (8) Legislation is needed to support and further the \n     efforts already begun by the National Institutes of Health in \n     order to maximize the health benefits for the American \n     people.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF NATIONAL CENTER FOR BIOENGINEERING \n                   RESEARCH.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subpart 2 of part C of title IV of the \n     Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 285 et seq.) is amended \n     by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 425A.

In spring 1997 NIH established a Bioengineering \n     Consortium, with representation from each of the institutes, \n     to advance bioengineering and its mission within NIH. This \n     legislation seeks to support and further the efforts already \n     begun by NIH in order to maximize the health benefits for the \n     American people.\n\n\n                             Impact of Bill\n\n       Bill would create National Center for Bioengineering \n     Research, located within the National Heart, Lung and Blood \n     Institute. Mission of the Center is to enhance bioengineering \n     research within NIH; improve coordination and communication \n     across all Federal agencies; educate members of Congress and \n     the public on importance of bioengineering in enhancing \n     diagnosis and treatment of disease and strengthening the \n     economy; annually convene bioengineering experts to advise \n     Director of the Center; and submit an annual report to \n     Congress.\n       Center would have no grant-making authority. New funding \n     would be allocated to institutes to support basic research in \n     bioengineering.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. D'Amato):\n  S. 1031. A bill to protect Federal law enforcement officers who \nintervene in certain situations to protect life or prevent bodily \ninjury; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n    the federal law enforcement officers' good samaritan act of 1997\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Federal Law \nEnforcement Officers' Good Samaritan Act of 1997. This bill will help \nFederal officers do what they do best: protect lives. Under this bill, \nany Federal law enforcement officer who, while off duty, should \nunexpectedly arrive at or is present at a crime will be able to take \nappropriate action.\n  Mr. President, perhaps a hypothetical example would best explain the \nintent of this legislation. Lets say a law enforcement officer stops at \na convenience store on his way home from work one evening. While \npicking up a gallon of milk and a loaf of bread, a criminal attempts to \nrob this particular store. Now most law enforcement folks will tell you \nthat, in this situation, they would feel compelled to take some kind of \nappropriate action. But in many jurisdictions, if they do\n\n[[Page S7718]]\n\ntake action and are hurt, or are forced to hurt the criminal, they may \nnot be eligible for their health benefits, and may be open to be sued \nby the criminal for their actions. The law enforcement officer, acting \non his training, and intervening in a situation that he had the \ntraining and ability to deal with, would have to cover these expenses \nfrom his own pocket. Mr. President, this does not sound fair to me. It \ncan create a situation where the officer may feel unable to act in \nresponse to his sense of duty because of concerns that he will be \npenalized for acting. This legislation would eliminate these legitimate \nworries.\n  Let me make it clear that this bill does not expand Federal law \nenforcement authority. A Federal officer could only make a citizen's \narrest, if necessary, and local law enforcement officials would still \nhave jurisdiction in the case. My office has spoken with the National \nAssociation of Attorneys General, and they are supportive of this \nlegislation.\n  I hope that my colleagues will take the time to look at this \nlegislation, and join Senator Alfonse D'Amato and me in sponsoring this \nbill. Our Government has invested a lot of time, energy, and trust in \nthe training and support of our Federal law enforcement officers. We \nneed to be sure that they are able to perform their duties--and to act \nas we would hope and expect them to act.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to join with Senator \nGrassley in the introduction of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers' \nGood Samaritan Act. This bill is essential to protect trained federal \nlaw enforcement officers who want to offer assistance when they witness \na crime but are afraid of the repercussions afterwards if it is not a \ncrime defined under their agency's authorizing statute.\n  Agents in the federal law enforcement community are charged with the \ninvestigation of criminal activities defined in their authorizing \nstatute. For example, DEA agents investigate drug crimes and a Secret \nService agent's role is limited to financial crimes. If acting ``within \nthe scope of their employment'', meaning they deal with only those \ncrimes listed in their agency's authorizing statute, the actions of the \nSpecial Agent will not result in personal liability. In addition, the \nemploying agency may assign counsel or provide worker's compensation if \nthe Special Agent was injured in the line of duty.\n  However, when an off-duty Federal Agent witnesses the commission of a \nviolent crime, such as a DEA agent witnessing a robbery, the \nintervention is deemed to be outside the scope of his or her \nemployment. Unfortunately, that special agent's intervention may \nsubject the off-duty Federal Law Enforcement Agent to personal \nliability--without the protections afforded them if they were on duty.\n  There are few cases nation-wide but it has affected the intervention \nof our Federal Law Enforcement Officers. In one instance, two DEA \nagents on a surveillance saw a parked car occupied by a man and a young \nwoman. The car was not part of the surveillance. This did not stop the \nagents from intervening when they saw the young woman struggling with \nthe man and screaming for help. Their assistance was not ``within the \nscope of their employment'' but these trained agents wanted to help, \nusing their expertise in crisis situations. The DEA agents certainly \nwere not thinking a lawsuit when they intervened but because their \nactions were outside the scope, they were acting as private citizens--\nsubjecting their personal assets to a lawsuit.\n  Federal agents who unexpectedly encounter violence in our communities \nface an unconscionable choice: 1.) stand by and allow the violence to \noccur; 2.) refuse help to the victim and allow the perpetrator to \nescape; or 3.) intervene as a private citizen and risk bankruptcy by a \npotential lawsuit.\n  Currently, there exists no federal statute authorizing Federal \nSpecial Agents to intervene during the commission of certain violent \ncrimes outside the scope of their statutory authority, and protecting \ntheir personal assets when they assist someone in need. I urge my \ncolleagues to review the merits of this bill and join in this effort to \nrelieve the fear of our specially trained law enforcement agent and \npossibly encouraging their intervention when citizens need it the most.\n  This bill explicitly defines when a specially trained agent may be \nprotected if he or she offers assistance ``outside the scope of their \nemployment''. These instances are limited to:\n  (A) the protection of any person in his presence from the imminent \ninfliction of bodily harm;\n  (B) offering immediate help to any victim who suffers bodily harm in \nhis presence; and\n  (C) preventing the escape of any person he reasonably believes to be \nresponsible for inflicting, attempting or threatening to inflict, \nbodily harm to another in his presence.\n  It will provide the Agent with the same qualified immunity that he \nhas if the act was within the ``scope of his employment'': counsel will \nbe provided to the agent, the Federal Government will indemnify for the \ndamages caused, worker's compensation will be available.\n  This bill will not curtail the rights of an injured party. It does \nnot prevent an injured party from suing for damages incurred during the \nintervention by the Agent nor will it restrict the amount of damages \nthat an injured party may receive if the court finds that the Agent \nacted unreasonably.\n  This bill will not expand the powers or authorities of Federal law \nenforcement agencies or give Federal law enforcement agents authority \nto investigate or to direct any state or local law enforcement body, \nusurping the powers of the state or local law enforcement agencies, \noutside of their jurisdiction. Finally, this bill will not restrict the \nfiling of criminal charges if the action of the Agent fits the current \nstatutory definition.\n  Federal law enforcement agents need this protection and I urge its \npassage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself and Mr. Campbell):\n  S. 1036. A bill to amend section 435(d)(1)(A)(ii) of the Higher \nEducation Act of 1965 with respect to the definition of an eligible \nlender; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                             kid's bank act\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation \namending the Higher Education Act to revise the proportion of student \nloans that a bank can maintain in relation to their total consumer \nportfolio. This bill will allow the Young Americans Bank to continue \nproviding a unique opportunity for young people to learn to control a \nchecking account, save for the future, and manage credit obligations. \nThe bank has had resounding success in teaching young clients how to \nresponsibly handle their finances.\n  The Young Americans Bank has been operating for ten years as the only \nbank in the nation that exclusively serves young people under the age \nof 22. It is a full service, State chartered, federally insured bank \nwith almost 17,000 customers from all 50 States and 11 foreign \ncountries. Another exceptional element of the bank is that its holding \ncompany, the Young American Education Foundation, is the only nonprofit \nholding company in the country.\n  While educating our youth on how to make responsible financial \ndecisions, the Young Americans Bank also has a natural demand for \nstudent loans. Section 435 of the Higher Education Act prohibits banks \nfrom having student loans comprise more than 50 percent of total loans. \nClearly this prohibits the Young Americans Bank from accommodating the \nlarge percentage of student loans that they would like to provide for \ntheir young clients. It is also important to note that allowing the \nbank to carry a larger student loan portfolio would improve the bank's \nfinancial performance, which in turn would provide more funds for \neducational programming.\n  My legislation would allow very small, nonprofit banks to exceed the \n50-percent student loan ratio. The exception would apply only to \ninstitutions with a total outstanding student loan volume of $10 \nmillion or less, and all loans would have to be made to those age 22 \nand under.\n  The Young Americans Bank enjoys broad support, and I have received \nletters endorsing this legislation from Denver's Mayor Wellington Webb, \nthe Colorado Bankers Association, the Colorado Governor's office and \nnumerous financial institutions and universities.\n  The operation and objectives of the Young Americans Bank should not \nbe limited. This bank does an outstanding\n\n[[Page S7719]]\n\njob of providing financial and educational opportunities to young \npeople, and I encourage my colleagues to support their mission and \nencourage the expansion of such a successful institution.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n       By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 1037. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nestablish incentives to increase the demand for and supply of quality \nchild care, to provide incentives to States that improve the quality of \nchild care, to expand clearing-house and electronic networks for the \ndistribution of child care information, to improve the quality of child \ncare provided through Federal facilities and programs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\nThe Creating Improved Delivery of Child Care: Affordable, Reliable, and \n                        Educational Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today, there are more than 12 million \nchildren under the age of five--including half of all infants under one \nyear of age--who spend at least part of their day being cared for by \nsomeone other than their parents. There are millions more school-aged \nchildren under the age of twelve who are in some form of child care at \nthe beginning and end of the school day as well as during school \nholidays and vacations. And more six to twelve year olds who are \nlatchkey kids--returning home from school to no supervision because \nparents are working and there are few, if any, alternatives.\n  The past two decades have seen a dramatic rise in the number of women \nin the paid labor force. Women now constitute 46% of our nation's labor \nforce. Most women are working to meet their family's basic needs. More \nthan 60% of women with pre-school aged children are employed full- or \npart-time. Their employment is not a choice, but an essential part of \ntheir family's economic survival. And for most of these families, child \ncare is not an option, but a requirement.\n  Many of the traditional sources of child care are no longer \navailable--as many of the friends, neighbors, grandparents, and other \nrelatives who used to be available to provide child care are also \nworking. Research has repeatedly demonstrated that for parents who must \nwork, child care services that are dependable and of high quality make \nit easier to find and keep a job. Good child care helps parents reach \nand maintain economic self-sufficiency. Congress acknowledged this when \nit passed welfare reform last year, which dramatically increased the \namount of entitlement money available for child care.\n  Steady increases in the number of employed women with young children, \ncombined with last year's welfare reforms, have placed tremendous \npressures on communities to dramatically expand the amount of available \nchild care. While the supply of child care has increased over the past \n10 years, there are still significant shortages for parents in rural \nareas, those with school-aged children or infants, and for lower-income \nfamilies.\n  I think that few of us know how much child care costs. The Senate \nEmployee's Child Care Center costs between $150 and $175 a week--$7,800 \nto $9,100 a year. That places it in the high-middle range in terms of \ncosts for the Washington, D.C. area. The younger the child, the higher \nthe costs--and Senate Employee's Child Care Center does not accept \nchildren under 18 months old, the most expensive type of child care.\n  The costs of child care are almost wholly dependent upon the \ngeographic area, the type of child care, and the age of the child. For \nexample, a family purchasing full-time child care services for a four-\nyear-old in rural New York using a family child care home may pay as \nlittle as $60 a week. In contrast, a family with an infant using a \nchild care center in New York City may pay more than $250 a week.\n  For a 3- to 4-year-old child, the least expensive age group, the \nnational average for center-based child care is $4,600 a year. The \naverage cost for high quality care, such as that provided by the Senate \nEmployee's Child Care Center, is between $8,500 and $9,100 a year. The \ncost of family-based child care is generally less expensive, while in-\nhome care with a nanny or au pair is generally more expensive.\n  A family normally spends about twenty-percent of its income on \nhousing and ten-percent on food. The costs of child care for a low-or \nmiddle-income family can rival the cost of housing and be double the \ncost of food. Even though most of us recognize the critical part that \nchild care plays in the economic survival of families, we often fail to \nrecognize it as a basic cost which consumes a significant portion of a \nfamily's income.\n  Parents can only purchase child care they can afford. Those who do \nfind care that is affordable and convenient are often unsatisfied with \nthe quality of the care their child receives. In fact, one quarter of \nall parents would change their child care arrangement if they could \nfind and afford something better.\n  Since 1990, the costs of child care have risen about six-percent \nannually. This is almost triple the annual increase in the cost of \nliving. At the same time, there are strong indicators that the quality \nof child care has significantly decreased during that same period of \ntime. Parents are paying more but getting less.\n  The quality of child care in America is very troubling. A recent \nnationwide study found that forty-percent of the child care provided to \ninfants in child care centers was potentially injurious. Fifteen-\npercent of center-based child care providers for all pre-schoolers are \nso bad that a child's health and safety are threatened; seventy-percent \nare mediocre--not hurting or helping children; and fifteen-percent \nactively promote a child's development. Center-based child care, the \nobject of this study, is the most heavily regulated and frequently \nmonitored type of child care. There are strong indications that care \nfor children in less regulated settings, such as family-based child \ncare and in-home care, is far worse.\n  Combining the research on the quality of child care with the \nbreakthroughs on the development of the human brain produces a very \ndisturbing situation. Many children enter child care by eleven weeks of \nage, are in care for close to 30 hours a week, and often stay in some \nform of child care until they enter school. During that same period of \nlife, a child's brain is undergoing a series of extraordinary changes.\n  In the first three years of life, the brain either makes the \nconnections it needs for learning or it atrophies, making later efforts \nat remediation in learning, behavior, and thinking difficult, at best. \nThe experiences and stimulation that a caretaker provide to a child are \nthe foundations upon which all future learning is built. The brain's \ngreatest and most critical growth spurt is between birth and ten years \nof age--precisely the time when non-parental child care is most \nfrequently utilized. A Time magazine special report on ``How a Child's \nBrain Develops'' (February 3, 1997) said it best, ``. . . Good, \naffordable day care is not a luxury or a fringe benefit for welfare \nmothers and working parents but essential brain food for the next \ngeneration.'' While bad child care can seriously impair a child's \ndevelopment, high-quality child care significantly increases the \nchances of good developmental outcomes for children.\n  Think about it. At the most important time in the development of a \nchild's brain, more than twelve million children are being cared for by \npeople who are paid less than the person who picks up your garbage each \nweek, and are required to have less training than the person who cuts \nyour hair, and less skill-based testing than the person delivering \npackages to your house. Child care providers play an important role in \na child's development, for they help fine-tune the child's capacity to \nthink and process information, social skills, emotional health, and \nacquisition of language.\n  Last year, our goal in child care was to streamline federal \nassistance by creating a cohesive structure for federal assistance and \nto provide sufficient government funds to subsidize child care for \nwelfare recipients who were transitioning into work. This year our goal \nmust be to promote the healthy development of children in child care. I \nam worried that the pressure of the need to accommodate the increasing \ndemand for child care will force many into forgoing quality just to \nincrease the number of child care slots available.\n\n[[Page S7720]]\n\n  I rise today to introduce legislation entitled ``Creating Improved \nDelivery of Child Care: Affordable, Reliable, and Educational Act of \n1997,'' the CIDCARE Act. It incorporates modifications to the tax code, \nan incentive grant program for states (including wage subsidies for \nchild care providers who get additional training and education and a \ngrant program to encourage small business partnerships to provide child \ncare for employees), a technology-based infrastructure for the \nprofessional development of child care providers, educational loan \nforgiveness for child care providers, requirements that states include \nthe cost of child care in the calculation of child support orders, \nexpansion of the federal government's technical assistance and \ninformation dissemination role, and requirements that child care \ncenters located in federal facilities to meet high quality standards of \ncare.\n  There is no one thing--no magic bullet--that will ensure higher \nquality child care. Each of these provisions has been included to solve \na specific problem or break through a barrier that has hampered efforts \nto improve the quality of child care. Taken as a whole, these \nprovisions represent a comprehensive effort to increase the \nsupply while simultaneously creating a demand for high-quality child \ncare, and make it affordable for low- and middle-income families.\n\n  To offset the cost of these changes, the bill reduces, but does not \neliminate, the dependent care tax credit for upper income taxpayers. \nOver a 5-year period, it gradually decreases the amount that an \nemployee can place in a dependent care assistance plan used to \nreimburse nonaccredited or non-credential child care. In addition, the \nlegislation expands the coordinated enforcement efforts of the Internal \nRevenue Service and the HHS Office of Child Support Enforcement, which \nwill significantly reduce the amount of fraud related to illegal tax \ndeduction and credit claims by noncustodial, noncontributing parents.\n  The first provision in CIDCARE makes several changes in the Child and \nDependent Care Tax Credit [CDCTC]. This tax credit is the largest tax-\nbased subsidy for child care. The bill raises the income level for the \nreceipt of the highest percentage of employment-related child care \ncosts from $10,000 to $20,000. The percentage is decreased at a rate of \n1 percent for each additional $2,500 in adjusted gross income and sets \na minimum percentage of 10 percent for incomes of $70,000 and above.\n  This change represents a more equitable distribution of limited \nresources based on the percentage of income a family must use to meet \nchild care expenses. For families qualifying for the EITC, the \nlegislation makes the child care tax credit refundable, on a quarterly \nbasis. This will enable many low-income working families to move from \npart-time to full-time employment, by easing the burden of child care \ncosts and having the money available at regular intervals throughout \nthe year.\n  Another revision to the Child Care Tax Credit establishes, over a 5-\nyear period, different rates for the tax credit, dependent on whether \nthe child care is provided in an accredited child care facility or by a \ncredentialed professional. This will reward parents who choose high-\nquality child care and help defray the additional costs of that care.\n  I am sensitive to the concerns of colleagues who object to reducing \nthe child care tax credit. But before you judge this reduction too \nharshly, let's put it into perspective. The tax credit remains at or \nabove the current rate of 20 percent for parents with adjusted gross \nincomes of $45,000 or less, regardless of the type of child care. The \nmedian income of families with children nationally is $37,000. While \nthere are wide differences in between States, there are only four \nStates where the median exceeds $45,000 AGI, triggering a reduction in \nthe current rate of 20 percent. The median income in most States is \nsignificantly below this trigger.\n  At the end of the 5-year phase in period, the tax credit remains at \nor above the current 20 percent rate for families with an AGI of \n$55,000--if they choose high-quality child care. No States have median \nincomes of families with children which exceed this which triggers a \nreduction below current child care tax rate. Families with incomes at \nor above $70,000 will still receive a tax credit of ten percent, \nincreased to 12.5% if high quality care is used.\n\n  In terms of money, a one percent decrease in the child care tax \ncredit equals $24 when care for one child is claimed, and $48 for two \nor more children. Families making $70,000 or more are the hardest hit \nby my legislation. Yet their maximum financial cost is $240 a year for \none child,or $480 a year for two or more children--about half of one \npercent of their adjusted gross income.\n  The second area of changes occurs in the Dependent Care Assistance \nPlan (DCAP). The CIDCARE Act increases the amount that an employee can \ncontribute to a DCAP account, if the funds are used to pay for the care \nof two or more eligible persons. In addition, the amount of DCAP \ncontributions is increased for high-quality care and decreased for care \nthat is provided by an unaccredited child care facility or a person who \nhas not received a professional credential. At the end of the five year \nphase in, the maximum decrease in the DCAP amount for unaccredited care \nis 20% lower than the current ceiling on contributions. These \ndifferential rates are phased in over a five year period in order for \nchild care providers to achieve accreditation or become credentialed in \nchild care.\n  Current law prohibits DCAP from being used to pay relatives for care. \nWhile I support needed controls on the use of DCAP accounts in most \ncases, my legislation would make a very limited exception to this \nprohibition. DCAP payments could be made to pay a parent or grandparent \nto care for a newborn child. The DCAP account could be joined at \nanytime during a pregnancy. The funds would be available for up to 12 \nmonths from the date of deposit into the employee's DCAP account--\nbecause babies have a timetable all their own when it comes to being \nborn.\n  The last change CIDCARE makes in the Dependent Care Assistance Plan \nis a requirement that federal employees have the opportunity to \ncontribute to DCAP. Private employees, as well as many state and local \ngovernments, have had DCAP available for their employees since 1981. \nConsistent with the intent of the Congressional Accountability Act, I \nwant to make this child care subsidy available to federal workers, \nincluding legislative branch employees.\n  Child care is a growing concern to businesses, big and small. \nEmployers are coming to the realization that affordable, convenient \nhigh-quality child care is a critical element in hiring and retaining \nskilled employees. Many companies, such as Johnson & Johnson, IBM, and \nothers have been very innovative in providing child care assistance for \ntheir employees. Small businesses in particular are finding it \ndifficult to meet the child care needs of their employees, but \nrecognize the importance of that help.\n  The CIDCARE Act creates a tax credit for employers providing or \notherwise supporting high-quality child care arrangements for their \nemployees. On the Budget Reconciliation bill passed by the Senate, \nSenator Kohl introduced an amendment to provide a time-limited tax \ncredit for employers who provide child care for their employees. To \nreinforce the importance of the Kohl amendment, I have included it in \nCIDCARE. Fifty percent of the expenses incurred by a business to meet \nthe child care needs of employees will be credited toward the business' \nFederal tax liability. Eligible expenses are capped at $150,000 per \nyear, and the tax credit sunsets after three years.\n\n  Costs allowed to businesses under this provision include startup \ncosts, renovations to meet accreditation standards, professional \ndevelopment for child care providers, general operating expenses, \nsubsidized child care for lower paid employees, support for child care \nresource and referral services and other child care activities. These \nprovisions encourage business involvement and innovation in meeting the \nchild care needs of employees and increasing the demand for higher \nquality child care.\n  Current law prohibits businesses from receiving a charitable \ndeduction for donations made to public entities, such as schools and \nchild care services. CIDCARE will extend eligibility for a business \ncharitable deduction to the donation of educational equipment and\n\n[[Page S7721]]\n\nsupplies donated to public schools, public child care providers, and \npublic child care support entities, such as resource and referral \nservices. If child care is to improve and meet the developmental needs \nof our Nation's children, every available resource must be made \navailable. Computers which are discarded because they are too slow or \nhave insufficient hard drive capacity, can be the first step into the \ncomputer-age for a small child or the link to professional training for \na child care provider.\n  A critical part of improving the quality of child care is \nprofessional development for child care providers. Since the 1970's \nthere has been a decline in child care teacher salaries. In 1990, \nteachers in child care centers earned an average of $11,500 a year. \nAssistant teachers, the largest growing segment of child care \nprofessionals, were paid 10- to 20-percent less than child care \nteachers. The 1990 annual income of regulated family child care \nproviders was $10,944 which translates to about $4 an hour. \nNonregulated family child care, generally comprised of providers taking \ncare of a smaller number of children, earned an average of $4,275 a \nyear--substantially less than minimum wage.\n  With these wages, it is easy to understand why more child care \nproviders do not participate in professional training or attend college \nclasses to improve their skills. The costs of applying for and \nreceiving certification as a qualified child care professional are \nminimal, but understandably out of reach for many child care providers.\n  This legislation will exempt expenses directly related to child care \naccreditation or becoming credentialed from the 2 percent floor that is \napplied to miscellaneous itemized deductions. This will at least permit \nchild care providers to receive a full deduction for the expenses \nassociated with improving the child care services which they provide. \nThis incentive for professional growth and the development of new \nskills is a small but critical part of my overall effort to support \nhigh-quality child care.\n\n  The last tax modification in CIDCARE creates a very limited exception \nto the executive use rule governing the tax deduction for home office \nexpenses. The legislation will permit the mixed use of home office \nspace for business and personal purposes to allow a person to care for \nhis or her child. In some ways, the need for this exception comes down \nto fundamental fairness. How many school holidays, snow days and other \ntimes do children accompany their parents into work?\n  I can always tell when the schools are unexpectedly closed, by the \nincreased number of little people I see in Senate offices and eateries. \nI have been in Senate offices and other workplaces where a crib or \nplaypen is clearly in evidence. Yet, none of us question whether our \noffices are exclusively for business use. One of the big incentives for \ntelecommuting and home-based business is to allow parents to have more \ntime with their families, yet existing law would keep a new mother from \nlegitimately claiming a home office deduction if she has her child \nsleeping in a crib in a corner of the room where she is working.\n  The non-tax related provisions of the legislation are designed to \ncomplement and work with the tax provisions. In order for families to \nbe able to take advantage of the increased tax credits for child care \nin an accredited center or with a provider who has received a child \ncare credential, there need to be more of these high quality centers \nand better trained providers. Child care providers must have easy, \naffordable access to training and other activities which will lead to \naccreditation and credentialing. This effort will require that the \nfederal government join forces with states and the business community. \nParents must be made aware of how to identify quality child care and \nits importance in their children's lives. And the federal government \nshould set an example by requiring that child care centers located in \nfederal facilities meet higher standards of care. It will take all of \nthese provisions, working together, to improve the quality of child \ncare for our children.\n  The CIDCARE Act will require that states include the cost of child \ncare in the calculation of child support obligations. When a custodial \nparent is employed or actively seeking employment, the state procedures \nfor the determination of the amount of child support need to include an \namount equal to or more than the child care rates used by the state to \nadminister the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act. When child \ncare is being provided in an accredited child care center or by a \ncredentialed child care that rate will be increased by fifty-percent.\n  Since the passage of the Child Care and Development Act in 1990, \nstates have been setting ``market'' or ``comparable'' rates for child \ncare. CIDCARE uses those rates as a baseline for adding the cost of \nchild care to the amount of child support which a non-custodial parent \nwill be required to pay. Current child support calculations \ninclude estimates of the other basic expenses necessary to provide \nfinancially for a child. In many instances, the expense of child care \nis the direct result of the divorce or lack of financial support from \nthe non-custodial parent. It is only fair that child care expenses be \nincluded in those calculations. If the custodial parent secures higher \nquality child care, the non-custodial parent will share in the \nadditional costs of that care. Children should not be forced into poor \nquality child care because a non-custodial parent refused to share in \nthe additional expense of higher quality care.\n\n  The CIDCARE bill establishes a $260 million competitive grant program \nto assist states in improving the quality of child care. To be \neligible, a state must not have reduced the scope or otherwise \ndecreased the state's licensing requirements since 1995, must be in \ncompliance with the requirements of the Child Care and Development \nBlock Grant, must have drawn down at least 80% of the amount awarded to \nthe state in federal entitlement child care funds requiring a state \nmatch, and must conduct annual on-site monitoring of state licensed or \notherwise regulated child care facilities, with at least one \nunannounced visit every 3 years. The legislation requires that a \nPriority be given to states that raise at least a 10% match for the \nfederal funds from business or other private sources.\n  States must use at least 20% of the grant funds awarded to establish \na subsidy program to provide salary increases to child care providers \nwho are credentialed in the state. The low level of child care wages is \nthe most often cited reason for the tremendous staff turnover in the \nchild care profession. In areas where child care subsidies as low as \nfifty cents an hour are put in place, the staff turnover rate drops \ndramatically. The wage subsidy also will encourage more child care \nproviders to get additional training or advance their education.\n  In addition, states will need to use at least twenty-percent of the \nfunds awarded for a grant program to provide start-up funds for \npartnerships of small businesses to develop and operate child care \ncooperative services for their employees. While large employers have \nboth the number of employees to justify an on- or near-site child care \ncenter and the additional financial resources for start-up costs, small \nbusinesses have been struggling with ways to help their employees meet \ntheir child care needs. This grant program will provide time-limited \nhelp for partnerships of small businesses who work together to develop \nchild care resources for their employees.\n  States can use the remainder of grant funds awarded for any of the \nfollowing activities: developing standards for of entities applying for \nstate recognition for the accreditation and credentialing of child care \nproviders; establishing a scholarship program to help child care \nproviders meet the costs of education and training; expanding state-\nbased child care training and technical assistance activities; improve \nconsumer education efforts including the expansion of resource and \nreferral services and child care complaint systems; providing increased \nrates of reimbursement provided under federal or state child care \nassistance for children with special needs; purchasing \nspecial supplies, equipment, or meeting other extraordinary expenses \nnecessary for the care of special needs children for distribution to \nchild care providers serving special needs children, or providing \nincreased rates of reimbursement provided under federal or state child \ncare assistance for accredited and credentialed care. Each of these \nactivities has been demonstrated\n\n[[Page S7722]]\n\nto be a contributing factor in improving the quality of child care.\n\n  Parents, child care providers, employers, and others need a \nconstantly updated source of information about improving the quality of \nchild care. States need a central depository where they can learn what \nother states are doing as well as a place where they can contribute \ntheir own ideas and activities from which others can learn. The \ncollection and dissemination of information, demonstrations, and \ntechnology is one of the most important roles of the federal \ngovernment.\n  Under provisions in the CIDCARE Act, the Department of Health and \nHuman Services (HHS) will collect information about the importance of \nhigh quality child care (including what it is, how to identify it, why \nit is important for children), and in partnership with the ADCouncil or \nsimilar professional advertising entity, distribute that information \nthrough a national public awareness campaign and other mechanisms. To \nincrease the capacity of child care credentialing and accreditation \nentities, HHS will award competitive grants to child care credentialing \nand accreditation entities that have not been in existence more than 10 \nyears for the purpose of refining and evaluating their procedures for \nand methods of granting child care accreditation and/or credentialing. \nThe legislation authorizes $10 million annually, to conduct these \ninformation and technology transfer activities.\n  The CIDCARE Act authorizes $50 million a year to create and operate a \ntechnology-based training infrastructure to enable child care providers \nnationwide to receive the training, education, and support they need to \nimprove the quality of child care. The bill builds upon existing \ndistance learning, Internet, and satellite resources, with sufficient \nfunding to expand access to affordable child care training and \ninformation. The primary focus of the infrastructure will be to \ndisseminate the training necessary to become an accredited child care \ncenter or a credentialed child care professional. Training and \neducation, delivered at a minimal cost and accessible to individuals \nwithin 25 miles of their homes, will remove one of the most substantial \nbarriers to child care credentialing and accreditation.\n  Essentially, the legislation establishes a child care training and \neducation interactive ``network'', which will be used by child care \ncredentialing and accreditation entities for training, skills testing, \nand other activities needed to achieve and maintain child care \ncredentialing and accreditation. Entities recognized by 2 or more \nstates as providing accepted child care credentialing or accreditation \nservices will be active participants in decisions governing the use of \nthe child care ``training network.'' Time lines for the creation and \nimplementation of the infrastructure and caps on administrative costs \nare included in the bill provide both financial and programmatic \naccountability.\n\n  Through the child care training infrastructure, a no interest \nrevolving loan fund is established to enable child care providers and \nchild care support entities to purchase computers, satellite dishes, \nand other technological equipment which enable them to participate in \nthe child care training provided on the national infrastructure. For \nthe first five years of the legislation, at least ten-percent of the \nfunds appropriated for the child care training infrastructure will be \nplaced into the revolving loan fund. This part of CIDCARE, like similar \nfederal loan programs, establishes that the funds be kept in a separate \ninterest bearing account, establishes application procedures, terms and \nconditions for the approval of such loans, and procedures for handling \nloan defaults.\n  At the current time, child care centers located in federal facilities \nare not required to meet even basic safety and health requirements. \nThey are not subject to state or local laws or regulations governing \nthe operation of a child care center. The CIDCARE Act will require \nfederal child care centers (those in buildings leased or owned by the \nfederal government--legislative, executive, judicial branches) to meet \nall state and local licensing and other regulatory requirements related \nto the provision of child care, within six months of the passage of \nthis legislation--or make substantial progress towards meeting those \nrequirements. The appropriate Administrator of each branch of \ngovernment shall issue regulations specifying center-based child care \naccreditation standards and require all child care facilities in \nfederal buildings under their control achieve accreditation within 3 \nyears of the passage of this legislation.\n  If the child care program located in a federal facility fails to be \nin compliance, or show substantial compliance with state and local \nlicensing requirements within six months or with the identified \naccreditation standards within three years, the agency must cease \nproviding child care in that child care center. On-site monitoring to \nensure compliance with these regulations and standards must be \nperformed by an outside entity. The legislation authorizes $900 \nthousand to the General Services Administration (GSA) to implement this \nprovision.\n  CIDCARE will require that federal child care programs provided by the \nCorporation for National and Community Service, the Departments of \nDefense, Education, Housing and Urban Affairs, Justice, and Labor, will \nensure, to the maximum extent possible, that by October 1, 2001, any \nchild care made available through programs funded or operated by those \nDepartments and the Corporation, be provided by an accredited child \ncare facility or a credentialed child care professional. The federal \ngovernment needs to demonstrate a commitment to quality child care, by \nraising the standards it applies to its own programs.\n  The CIDCARE Act will expand the Community Development Block Grant to \ninclude the renovation or upgrading of child care facilities to meet \naccreditation standards as an allowable use of the grant funds. It also \nwill extend existing Perkins and Stafford Loan forgiveness programs to \ninclude persons who work as credentialed professionals in a child care \nsetting. Just as these loan forgiveness programs helped encourage more \npeople to become teachers, I hope that this extension of these two \neducational loan programs to child care providers will result in more \nand better qualified child care providers. To be eligible for loan \nforgiveness, the person must be employed full time providing child care \nservices and have a degree in early childhood education or development \nor receive professional child care credentials.\n\n  The need for high-quality child care is compelling. Having \naffordable, convenient child care is tied directly to a family's \nability to produce income. Good child care can be an effective way to \nsupport the healthy development of children, particularly in the \nacquisition of social and language skills. For the millions of children \nwho spend much of their preschool lives and many of their nonschool \nhours being cared for by someone other than their parents, child care \nprovides the foundation upon which all future education will be built--\nand determines to a large extent whether that foundation will be strong \nor weak.\n  As we all know, quality child care costs money. It costs money to \nparents who bear the biggest burden for the cost of child care. It \ncosts businesses both through the direct assistance that they provide \nto employees to help with the costs of child care, and through their \nability to hire and retain a skilled work force. It costs Government \nthrough existing tax provisions, direct spending, and discretionary \nspending targeted at child care. But the costs of not making this \ninvestment are even higher. Those costs can be measured in the expense \nof remedial education, the expansion of an unskilled labor force, the \nincrease in prison populations, and most importantly, the blunted \npotential of millions of children.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Dodd, Senator Roberts and me in \nsupport of the CIDCARE bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1037\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to join my colleague \nfrom Vermont, Senator Jeffords, as we introduce the Creating Improved \nDelivery of Child Care: Affordable, Reliable, and Educational (CIDCARE) \nAct of 1997.\n  This legislation will go a long way toward giving parents peace of \nmind. Child care shouldn't be like going to Las Vegas--where you roll \nthe dice and hope for the best. Parents should be confident that when \nthey are not able to be with their children, their children will still \nbe well cared for. We shouldn't be gambling with our children's health \nand safety.\n  Up to this point Mr. President, we in the federal government have \nlargely deferred the issue of quality of child care to the states. The \nsole significant contribution of the federal government to improving \nthe quality of this nation's child care is the modest 4% setaside for \nquality improvement that we struggled to create within the child care \ndevelopment block grant. This lack of federal support for quality has \nnot served children well.\n  A few years ago my good friend, Professor Ed Zigler of Yale \nUniversity, did a survey of state child care regulations. He found, in \nshort, that states are failing the ``quality test''--no state had child \ncare regulations in place that could be characterized as good quality \nstandards. Only a third of states had minimally acceptable regulations. \nTwo-thirds of states had regulations that didn't even address the \nbasics--caregiver training, safe environments, appropriate provider-\nchild ratios.\n  Keep in mind, we're not even talking about how well or whether states \nactually enforced those standards. This study was simply asking a \nquestion about the first step in quality--whether states had basic \nchild care quality standards on the books that providers could be held \nto. This legislation addresses, for the first time on a federal level, \nthe issues of quality child care. We have safety standards for the food \nwe eat and the cars we drive. Is it too much to have some basic \nstandards for child care providers--individuals who literally hold a \nchild's life in their hands? I think not, Mr. President. And even \nbeyond basic health and safety standards, we must consider how we can \nassist caregivers in supporting children's growth and development.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will help working families afford \nchild care. Specifically, this bill more equitably distributes the \nchild care tax credit by making the credit refundable for lower income \nfamilies, increasing the credit for families under $55,000, and phasing \ndown the credit to a minimum of 10% for higher income taxpayers. \nFurther, it increases the amount that employees can contribute to \nDependent Care Assistance Plans (DCAP).\n\n[[Page S7732]]\n\n  The CIDCARE bill further provides incentives for parents to choose \nhigh quality child care by providing a higher tax credit and larger \nDCAP allowances for families that use accredited or credentialed \nservices, reflecting the higher expenses associated with higher quality \ncare.\n  Additionally, this legislation encourages child care centers and \nproviders to offer high quality child care. It gives child care \nproviders a higher deduction for the educational expenses related to \nachieving or maintaining accreditation. It further provides $50 million \nto create and operate a technology-based training infrastructure, that \nbuilds upon existing distance learning, Internet, and satellite \nresources, to enable child care providers nationwide to receive \ntraining, education, and support. It also provides loan forgiveness for \nPerkins and Stafford educational loans for child care workers who \nobtain a degree in early childhood education or receive professional \nchild care credentials. This bill would also require federal child care \ncenters to meet all state and local licensing and other regulatory \nrequirements related to the provision of child care.\n  This legislation will also give businesses incentives to support \nquality child care for their employees and the community at large. It \nwill allow businesses a charitable deduction for donating educational \nequipment to non-profit child care providers, support entities, and \npublic schools and provides a tax credit for employers who develop \nchild care centers for their employees.\n  Finally, Mr. President, the CIDCARE bill will provide grants to \nstates to support quality child care. It establishes a $260 million \ncompetitive grant program to assist states in improving the quality of \nchild care through mechanisms such as: salary increases for \ncredentialed child care providers: developing standards for the \naccreditation and credentialing of child care providers; scholarship \nprograms to help child care providers meet the costs of education and \ntraining; expanding training and technical assistance activities; \nconsumer education efforts, and increased rates of reimbursement for \nthe care of children with special needs.\n  Mr. President, quality child care can no longer be considered a \nluxury reserved for the very few. This should not be a partisan issue. \nAll of us want the best for our children. And when they can't be with \ntheir parents, we want them to be in high quality care. This \nlegislation will move us in that direction.

Con. Res. 41.\n\n       Whereas the Republic of Cyprus has been divided and \n     occupied by foreign forces since 1974 in violation of United \n     Nations resolutions;\n       Whereas the international community, Congress, and \n     successive United States administrations have called for an \n     end to the status quo on Cyprus, considering that it \n     perpetuates an unacceptable violation of international law \n     and fundamental human rights affecting all the people of \n     Cyprus, and undermines significant United States interests in \n     the Eastern Mediterranean region;\n       Whereas the international community and the United States \n     Government have repeatedly called for the speedy withdrawal \n     of all foreign forces from the territory of Cyprus;\n       Whereas there are internationally acceptable means to \n     resolve the situation in Cyprus, including the \n     demilitarization of Cyprus and the establishment of a \n     multinational force to ensure the security of both \n     communities in Cyprus;\n       Whereas during the past year tensions in Cyprus have \n     dramatically increased, with violent incidents occurring \n     along cease-fire lines at a level not reached since 1974;\n       Whereas recent events in Cyprus have heightened the \n     potential for armed conflict in the region involving two \n     North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies, Greece and \n     Turkey, which would threaten vital United States interests in \n     the already volatile Eastern Mediterranean area and beyond;\n       Whereas a peaceful, just, and lasting solution to the \n     Cyprus problem would greatly benefit the security, and the \n     political, economic, and social well-being of all Cypriots, \n     as well as contribute to improved relations between Greece \n     and Turkey;\n       Whereas a lasting solution to the Cyprus problem would also \n     strengthen peace and stability in the Eastern Mediterranean \n     and serve important interests of the United States;\n       Whereas the United Nations has repeatedly stated the \n     parameters for such a solution, most recently in United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 1092, adopted on December \n     23, 1996, with United States support;\n       Whereas the prospect of the accession by Cyprus to the \n     European Union, which the United States has \n     actively supported, could serve as a catalyst for a \n     solution to the Cyprus problem;\n       Whereas President Bill Clinton has pledged that in 1997 the \n     United States will ``play a heightened role in promoting a \n     resolution in Cyprus''; and\n       Whereas United States leadership will be a crucial factor \n     in achieving a solution to the Cyprus problem, and increased \n     United States involvement in the search for this solution \n     will contribute to a reduction of tension on Cyprus: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) reaffirms its view that the status quo on Cyprus is \n     unacceptable and detrimental to the interests of the United \n     States in the Eastern Mediterranean and beyond;\n       (2) considers that lasting peace and stability on Cyprus \n     could be best secured by--\n       (A) a process of complete demilitarization leading to the \n     withdrawal of all foreign occupation forces;\n       (B) the cessation of foreign arms transfers to Cyprus; and\n       (C) the provision of alternative internationally acceptable \n     and effective security arrangements with guaranteed rights \n     for both communities as negotiated by the parties;\n       (3) welcomes and supports the commitment by President \n     Clinton to give increased attention to Cyprus and to make the \n     search for a solution a priority of United States foreign \n     policy, as witnessed by the appointment of Ambassador Richard \n     Holbrooke as Special Presidential Emissary for Cyprus; and\n       (4) calls upon the parties to lend their full support and \n     cooperation to United States, United Nations, and other \n     international efforts to promote an equitable and speedy \n     resolution of the Cyprus problem--\n       (A) on the basis of international law, the provisions of \n     relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, and \n     democratic principles, including respect for human rights;

Mr. President, overall, this is a good bill. It \nshows that the Congress is concerned about finding savings in its own \noperations to contribute to deficit reduction.\n  The bill does reduce slightly the total number of employees in the \nSenate offices from last year's levels. It contains numerous reductions \nin unnecessary spending requested by various offices and affiliated \norganizations. Some of the more interesting examples of items requested \nby offices but which were very wisely not included in this bill are:\n  A seismic study of the Capitol Building for $75,000; $30,000 for \nmaintenance of outdoor sculpture in the Peace and Garfield parks; and a \nstudy of electromagnetic fields in the Russell Building which would \nhave cost $50,000.\n  The report also directs the General Accounting Office to place higher \npriority on Members' requests for audits. This has been a particular \nmatter of concern to me, since the time the GAO sent auditors to middle \nof the gulf war to inspect Apache helicopters. I appreciate the \ncommittee's understanding and assistance in refocusing the efforts of \nthe GAO on the work required by Congress, rather than self-initiated \nagendas.\n  Unfortunately, though, the bill increases funding for the Senate and \njoint Congressional operations by $51.6 million over last year's \nlevels, for a total of $1.538 billion. For the Congress to approve an \nincrease in spending for its own operations seems to me ill-advised, \nparticularly as we continue to struggle to reach agreement on \nlegislation to provide tax relief and reduce Federal spending.\n  In addition, there are several provisions in the bill language that I \nwould ask the managers to clarify further.\n  For example, $100,000 is earmarked from the Library of Congress \nbudget for an International Copyright Institute. Another $2,250 from \nthe Library of Congress budget is set aside for official \nrepresentational and reception expenses of the International Copyright \nInstitute. My question is, what is this International Copyright \nInstitute, and why is it singled out for an earmark of this sort?\n  The bill also provides $354.2 million for the General Accounting \nOffice--an increase of $15.7 million over last year's level. This 4.6 \npercent increase is an unfortunate reversal of the trend to reduce the \nsize and cost of the GAO.\n  The report states that this $345 million will pay for 3,500 full-time \nequivalent personnel. It is curious to me that the GAO can, in effect, \nhire 3,500 staffers, while all 100 Senators make do with just slightly \nmore than 3,900 staffers, including our State offices.\n  The bill also earmarks an unlimited amount of GAO's funds to finance \n``an appropriate share'' of the expenses of several different programs:\n  The Joint Financial Management Improvement Program, including the \nsalary of the Executive Director and secretarial support; the National \nIntergovernmental Audit Forum or a Regional Intergovernmental Audit \nForum, as determined by the respective forum, including necessary \ntravel expenses of non-Federal participants; and the American \nConsortium on International Public Administration, including any \nexpenses attributable to its membership in the International Institute \nof Administrative Sciences.\n  Again, I wonder why these particular institutions are deserving of an \nearmark for unlimited amounts of the GAO's budget.\n  In addition, the report language contains several funding and \nlanguage provisions that cause me some concern. For example:\n  A provision for $118,000 increase in travel, consultant, and \nrepresentational funding for the Secretary of the Senate.\n  A provision for $25,000 for training and travel expenses related to \ntraining for employees of the Senate Child Care Center. Shouldn't these \nemployees already be well-trained in child care when they are hired?\n  A provision for $500,000 for improved lighting in the Senate Chamber. \nI hadn't noticed a particular problem with lighting in the Chamber.\n  A provision for $100,000 to design a new subway from the Russell \nBuilding to the Capitol Building. Mr. President, we have already spent \nhuge amounts of money to install a new subway from the Dirksen and Hart \nbuildings. Why do we need to spend more money on subways, and why does \nit cost a half-million dollars to design a subway when I assume it will \nbe very similar to the one already built from Dirksen and Hart?\n  A provision for $550,000 to modernize elevators in the Hart Building. \nThis building is relatively new and I wonder why a half-million dollars \nis needed at this time to upgrade the elevators.\n  Again, I congratulate the managers of the bill for their hard work \nand scrupulous attention to detail. This is, overall, a very good bill, \nbut I hope that, in conference with the House, unnecessary spending can \nbe dropped to bring the total back in line with current levels of \nspending.\n  I ask that list of objectionable items be printed in the Record.\n  The list follows:\n\n[[Page S7738]]\n\n                             Bill Language\n\n       $100,000 from the Library of Congress budget for an \n     International Copyright Institute.\n       $2,250 from the Library of Congress budget for official \n     representational and reception expenses for activities of the \n     International Copyright Institute.\n       $354.2 million for the General Accounting Office--an \n     increase of $15.7 million over last year's level.\n       This 4.6 percent increase is an unfortunate reversal of the \n     trend to reduce the size and cost of the GAO.\n       The report states that this will pay for 3,500 full-time \n     equivalent personnel.

Mr. President, I would like to ask the ranking \nmember on the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee, Senator Reid \nof Nevada, a question regarding the funding for hydrogen research in \nthe appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998.\n  Mr. REID. I would be pleased to answer a question from my colleague.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you. As you well know, funding for the Department \nof Energy's Hydrogen Research Program is critical to the advancement of \nhydrogen technologies. The President's budget for fiscal year 1998 \nrequested $15 million. The committee, through the efforts of the \nranking member, increased the budget request by $4 million to $19 \nmillion. As we know, the Hydrogen Future Act that passed by the \nCongress last year authorized $25 million for fiscal year 1998.\n  As the ranking member of this appropriations subcommittee I sincerely \nappreciate his efforts to increase funding for hydrogen research in the \nenergy and water development bill. As we know, the Department needs the \nfunding that they have requested to pursue the furthering of hydrogen \nby working with the private-sector and our national laboratories to \ndemonstrate the effectiveness as well as the safety of hydrogen. I know \nthat my ranking member is as interested as I am in the demonstration \nand validation of hydrogen power technology. I support his request for \na demonstration and evaluation at the Nevada test site as part of the \nDepartment of Energy's Hydrogen Research Program budget.\n  I would like to ask the distinguished ranking member if he would \nelaborate on the intentions of the committee report language as it \nrelates to the Department allocating funds for a comprehensive \nvalidation program at the Nevada test site. If I understand this \ncorrectly, the distinguished Senator from Nevada is suggesting that the \nDepartment should begin phase 1 of a program in fiscal year 1998 that \nwill establish at the Nevada test site a single location to administer \ntesting and evaluation of industry-led hydrogen energy systems.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, that is correct. First, I am deeply \nconcerned that increased consumption of refined petroleum products for \ntransportation will continue to climb and the quality of the air we \nbreath will continue to deteriorate. Additionally, our reliance on \nforeign oil can only aggravate our trade imbalance as well as \njeopardize our national security.\n  Therefore, I felt it to be vitally important that we begin to move \nforward and establish, at least, one location to allow the Department \nof Energy the ability to begin the precommercialization of hydrogen \ntechnologies. And the Department should provide to the committee a plan \nfor the furthering of this center at the Nevada test site in future \nyears. Hopefully, their fiscal year 1999 request will mirror the \nauthorization of $30 million contained in the Hydrogen Future Act in \norder to fully implement the center. Full funding at the authorized \nlevels are the only way that we can begin to bring this technology to \nthe marketplace. Furthermore, it is my hope that the administration \nwill view our increased funding of the hydrogen research program as a \nclear indication that there is support for this technology in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank you for clarifying this most important issue and \nwill continue to look to your leadership in this area.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/17/senate-section/article/S7738-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7738-S7739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   EXPLANATION OF SELECTED VOTES ON SPENDING PORTION OF THE BALANCED \n                               BUDGET ACT\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, recently, the Senate considered \nhistoric changes to preserve Medicare for future generations. I think \nit is important to outline my views in detail on a few of the key votes \ncast regarding these issues.\n  I voted to table an amendment by Senator Mikulski to reinstate the \nBoren amendment. In negotiating with the White House on this balanced \nbudget agreement, we all agreed that the best way to reform Medicaid is \nto allow Governors the maximum flexibility to design programs that meet \nthe unique needs of their States. The biggest barrier to this \nflexibility, according to the bipartisan National Governors \nAssociation, is the Boren amendment. The Boren amendment has allowed \nthe court system to set reimbursement rates, and these rates have been \ninflated much higher than what the market would determine. These higher \nrates have cost the States millions of dollars a year and have \ninhibited the ability of States to implement real program reforms. For \nthis reason, I supported the bipartisan budget agreement and the \ndecision to revoke the Boren amendment.\n  I voted to table an amendment by Senator Kennedy which would require \nspecific health benefits for children with special needs. I believe \nthat our package went a long way in meeting the important goal of \nproviding health benefits to children in need. Mr. Kennedy's amendment, \nhowever, would take away the flexibility that Governors need to develop \nthe best possible plan for their States. Instead, Mr. Kennedy's \namendment would allow the Federal Government to mandate both what the \nbenefits should look like and who should receive them. I believe this \namendment represents movement in the wrong direction.\n  I voted against an amendment offered by Senator Durbin and Senator \nWellstone which would reinstate food stamp benefits to the children of \nlegal immigrants. We have already negotiated certain changes in regard \nto services for legal immigrants in the bipartisan budget agreement. I \nam committed to upholding that agreement and believe that this \namendment went outside the scope of the agreed to changes.\n  Senator D'Amato offered an amendment to take the money saved by \nchanging the Medicare and Medicaid Program and direct it to National \nInstitutes of Health to provide medical research. While I \nwholeheartedly support increased funding for NIH, I do not believe this \nis an appropriate funding avenue and therefore opposed it. In fact, I \nbelieve that money saved through changes to Medicare should go toward \nmaintaining the long-term solvency of the Medicare Program.\n  I voted against an amendment offered by Senator Dodd which would add \n$100 million to provide health care to children who are severely \ndisabled. While I believe this is an important goal, I maintain, and \nreceived assurances to that end, that the health needs of severely \ndisabled children would be met through the additional $24 billion we \nwill be spending on our children's health package already incorporated \nin this bill.\n\n[[Page S7739]]\n\n  I supported Senator Levin's amendment which would allow vocational \neducation training to count toward meeting the work requirement under \nthe welfare reform law. The current welfare law limits the amount of \ntime an individual can be on vocational education to 12 months. This \namendment will increase that limit to 24 months. I believe this change \nwill allow individuals the time necessary to engage in training \nprograms to provide real work opportunities once they leave the welfare \nsystem.\n  I opposed an amendment offered by Senator Specter which would have \nprovided $1.5 billion over 5 years to pay the Medicare premium for low-\nincome seniors. I voted against this amendment because the budget \nreconciliation package provides $1.5 billion in new funds to assist \nMedicare beneficiaries between 120 and 150 percent of the poverty line \nwith their Medicare premium. I believe the legislation already \naddresses this important need.\n  Finally, I voted in favor of waiving the Budget Act to include the \nMedicare Choice program as part of the budget reconciliation bill. I \nbelieve that this is one of the most important provisions of the \nMedicare bill. Our legislation will allow seniors a wide array of \nchoices in care. Seniors will be able to choose from a variety of \ninsurance plans including medical savings accounts [MSA] and private \nfee-for-service plans. It is critical to keep these provisions in the \nlegislation to allow seniors a real choice in care and to protect \nseniors from rationing services in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/17/senate-section/article/S7738-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7739]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REAUTHORIZING AMTRAK APPROPRIATIONS\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I support S. 961, the \nadministration's bill to reauthorize appropriations for the National \nRail Passenger Corporation, better known as Amtrak. Amtrak is a \nnecessary part of a national transportation system. It has demonstrated \nits popularity with the traveling public and, more importantly, its \nability to provide safe, efficient transportation at reasonable prices.\n  My South Carolina constituents have made it quite clear that they \nwant Amtrak to prosper, and wish it expanded, not terminated or forced \nto operate under unreasonable restrictions or reduced to the status of \na regional railroad. The citizens of South Carolina and the Nation \ndemand a first class rail passenger transportation service. This is \nAmtrak's mission, and its promise.\n  S. 961 puts Amtrak on the path to fulfilling that promise. The bill \nconcentrates on what is important, the operational and financial \nviability of Amtrak, and is not diverted from its goal by including \nprovisions that are divisive and will not save Amtrak significant money \nor allow it to maximize its revenues.\n  Specifically, S. 961 does not include a provision which would impose \nso-called caps on the punitive damages available to passengers involved \nin accidents while aboard Amtrak trains. Other bills which purport to \naid Amtrak would cap punitive damages to twice compensatory damages or \n$250,000, whichever is greater. While I understand the necessity of any \nbusiness to reduce costs, placing liability caps against passengers \nwill not significantly improve Amtrak's bottom line. The General \nAccounting Office's (GAO) highest estimate of savings from such caps is \nless than one percent of Amtrak's capital funding needs.\n  Moreover, the provision ignores the value of punitive damages to the \npublic. With punitive damages a possibility, Amtrak has the incentive \nto properly train its personnel, invest in safe equipment, and reward \nsafe operations. Finally, such a provision is unnecessary. Punitive \ndamages have never been awarded against Amtrak.\n  S. 961 puts the emphasis where it should be, on authorizing \nappropriations of $5 billion for Amtrak over the next six years. It is \nthis money that is needed to fund Amtrak operations, equipment \npurchases, much needed capital improvements, and expanded services, not \nthe small amount any liability cap will provide the rail carrier. We \nwould all like to avoid paying Government subsidies for this service, \nbut we cannot ignore that the provision of transportation \ninfrastructure is a necessary function of Government, whether involving \nhighways, bridges, airports, mass transit, or rail. It should be noted \nthat a 1994 study of central government subsidies of rail \ntransportation showed that U.S. subsidy levels are 35th in the world, \nwell below those of Europe.\n  S. 961 also avoids the unnecessary controversy brought about by an \neffort to provide indemnification for freight railroads over whose \ntracks Amtrak largely operates. Some argue that freight railroads need \nprotection from accidents between their trains and Amtrak trains. \nWhatever the merits of indemnifying particular freight railroads in \nparticular cases, what has been proposed in several bills is the \ncomplete indemnification of any freight railroad for any accident, \nregardless of cause or fault. In other words, if a freight railroad \nemployee acts intentionally or with gross negligence and causes an \naccident, Amtrak would pay for that accident, most likely with tax \ndollars paid by the American people. The American people would be \nforced to pay for the mistakes of a multi-million dollar private \ncorporation. This is indefensible.\n  In 1987, a Conrail engineer, after smoking marijuana, drinking beer, \nand disabling safety equipment, ran his Conrail locomotives into the \nrear of an Amtrak train near Chase, MD. The disaster cost 16 lives and \n175 injuries. In the resulting litigation, a court found the conduct of \nthe engineer to involve gross negligence. The accident cost $130 \nmillion. If the full indemnification provision had been in effect at \nthat time, Amtrak, which was completely blameless, would have been \nrequired to pay all of the damages associated with that accident. \nAmtrak would have had to pay the cost of an accident beyond its control \nand that it was powerless to prevent. There is no more potent example \nof the unfairness of such a provision.\n  One other unacceptable provision that was wisely omitted from S. 961 \nis a so-called sunset trigger provision. Unfortunately, such a \nprovision is contained in S. 738, the Amtrak bill recently ordered \nreported by the Commerce Committee. The provision establishes a new \nAmtrak Reform Council [ARC] to investigate Amtrak's financial \ncondition, make a determination of Amtrak's ability to meet its \nfinancial goals, and present a report on Amtrak's condition to the \nCongress. If the ARC determination is negative, Amtrak is required to \nprepare a liquidation plan and the ARC is required to prepare a plan \nfor restructuring Amtrak. Both plans are sent to Congress and if, \nwithin 90 days, the Congress does not enact the restructuring plan, the \nliquidation plan must be implemented. Thus, to kill Amtrak, any action \nto save it need only be delayed by its congressional opponents for 3 \nmonths.\n  Under this provision, Amtrak could be liquidated without either House \nof Congress taking any responsibility by voting for or against the \nliquidation plan. There would not have to be any debate in Congress on \nAmtrak or the liquidation plan. No questions of Amtrak's worth or \nimportance and no indication of the consequences of eliminating Amtrak \nwould have to be addressed. A transportation program of vital \nimportance to millions of Americans would be eliminated without another \nword. This is nothing more than Congress evading its responsibilities \nand should not be allowed.\n  S. 961 is the right approach. We should insist that Amtrak run its \noperations in a business-like, efficient manner. And we should conduct \nvigorous oversight. However, we should not complicate its authorization \nlegislation with extraneous provisions, and any decision to discontinue \npassenger rail service in this country must be made in full view and \nwith complete information on the economic and social costs of doing \nso.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/17/senate-section/article/S7739-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7739-S7740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL DEFENSE RESEARCH\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, on Monday, July 14, 1997, I offered \nan amendment to the fiscal year 1998 Department of Defense \nappropriations bill which specifically appropriated funds for a program \nof basic research in the area of chemical and biological defenses. I \nwant to thank the distinguished chairman of the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee, Senator Stevens, and the ranking minority\n\n[[Page S7740]]\n\nmember, Senator Inouye, for accepting this very important amendment.\n  This chemical and biological sensor research program was specifically \nauthorized in the Defense authorization bill which was overwhelmingly \npassed by the Senate last week. The Senate Armed Services Committee \nrecommended, and the Senate approved, an increase of $2 million in \nresearch and development funding for a joint service program to develop \na prototype hybrid integrated sensor array for chemical and biological \npoint detection.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee's intent was to accelerate the \ndevelopment of small sensors which would detect, in real time, the \npresence of chemical or biological agents. These sensors would be based \non metal oxide and biochemical film technologies. In its report, the \nSenate Armed Services Committee emphasized its support for this program \nand for expanding the knowledge in military relevant fields of chemical \nand biological research. Our soldiers in the field need this technology \nto protect them from the possible threat presented by chemical and \nbiological agents.\n  Mr. President, I have reviewed the fiscal year 1998 Department of \nDefense appropriations bill which we are considering here in the \nSenate, and it is unclear as to whether the funding for this program, \nwhich was included in the Defense authorization bill, has sufficient \nappropriations. My intent, with this amendment, is to make clear that \nthis bill appropriates funds for this very important program.\n  Mr. President, the threat from chemical and biological weapons that \nfaces our Nation's troops is very real and very dangerous. During the \nPersian Gulf war, we witnessed just how dangerous the threat of \nchemical and biological weapons was during that crisis and how this \nthreat continues today.\n  We must also consider the fact that chemical and biological weapons \nmay also be a potential weapon of choice for use by terrorists. \nContinued research and development in the area of sensor development \nmust continue in this field to counter these very real threats.\n  There is an urgent need to have effective chemical and biological \nweapon sensors that can detect the presence of these weapons in real-\ntime or near-real-time. The Department of Defense needs to rapidly \ndevelop these kinds of sensors, and that is the intent of this \namendment.\n  This amendment does not seek to go beyond the authorized funding \namount. It seeks merely to insure that the program which the Senate has \nvoted to authorize is fully funded in this bill. I thank my colleagues \nfor their support of this amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/17/senate-section/article/S7739-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 EXECUTIVE BRANCH POLITICAL APPOINTEES\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as many in this body know, I have \nbeen concerned that while the total number of Federal employees has \nbeen reduced in recent years, the same cannot be said of executive \nbranch political appointees.\n  Indeed, between 1980 and 1992 the number of political appointees grew \n17 percent, three times as fast as the total number of executive branch \nemployees.\n  Mr. President, let me emphasize that political appointees play a \nvital role in implementing those very policies for which an \nadministration is elected in the first place. Political appointees \noften also bring backgrounds rich in experience as well as a fresh \nperspective that can strengthen our Government.\n  But as many distinguished observers have noted, too many political \nappointees may actually interfere with the efficient and effective \nimplementation of administration policies. Author Paul Light has \ndocumented this problem in his book ``Thickening Government: Federal \nGovernment and the Diffusion of Accountability.''\n  Various public commissions and Government watchdog groups have also \nvoiced concerns from the 1989 National Commission on Public Service, \nchaired by Paul Volcker, to the Congressional Budget Office, and most \nrecently the Twentieth Century Fund Task Force on the Presidential \nAppointment Process, chaired by two former Members of this body, former \nSenators John Culver and Charles Mathias.\n  Mr. President, I have introduced legislation to cap the number of \npolitical appointees at 2,000, a level which represents a reduction of \nabout 30 percent from current levels. That proposal is identical to the \nrecommendation of both the Volcker Commission and the Twentieth Century \nFund Task Force, and also mirrors a proposal by the Congressional \nBudget Office which is included in their publication of spending and \nrevenue options to reduce the deficit. My bill would save taxpayers \nover $330 million during the next 5 years. Just as important, bringing \nthe number of political appointees to a more manageable level will \nenhance flexibility and increase the ability of the President to \nimplement administration policies.\n  Mr. President, this administration has a commendable record in \nbringing the overall growth of the Federal employees under control, \nand, in fact, beginning to reduce the number by several hundred \nthousand.\n  And recently, I was encouraged to see that work also began with \nrespect to political appointees in the Commerce Department, an agency \nwhere the growing number of appointees has been a particular concern.\n  Mr. President, while I believe we have a long way to go in this area, \nthere has been some progress made by the administration and I will not \noffer my legislation as an amendment to this particular bill as I have \nin the past.\n  I firmly believe further work is needed in this area, however, and I \nwill be following the progress made by the administration in reducing \nthe number of political appointees with great interest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/17/senate-section/article/S7740-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              IN REMEMBRANCE OF THE VICTIMS OF FLIGHT 800\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise in remembrance of the 228 \nvictims of the TWA airline crash off the Long Island coast which \noccurred just 1 year ago today. In that accident, the community of \nMontoursville, PA, lost 16 of its young citizens--students from the \nlocal high school who were traveling abroad as members of the school's \nfrench club--and 5 adult chaperones.\n  While its cause remains unknown, I believe it is critical that our \nremembrance of the accident not be defined by this uncertainty, \ndifficult as it is for those who mourn the death of family and friends. \nBecause we do know, with certainty, what we lost: sons, daughters, \nclassmates, as well as mothers, fathers, and neighbors. We know of \ntheir contributions to their communities, schools, and professions. We \nknow, especially in the cases of the youngest victims, of their promise \nand of their vitality. We know of their importance in the lives of \ntheir families. It is with this sure knowledge of who the victims were \nand of what they did in their lives that we should remember them.\n  The loss of the young Pennsylvania students--and all the members of \nthat flight--to unexplained tragedy is terrible to bear. I know that \nthe Montoursville students were the pride of their community. \nResponsible and accomplished students, cherished sons and daughters, \nthey undertook the much-anticipated trip to France with gratitude, \nexcitement and hope. By remembering them in this way perhaps we will \nalways somehow know their presence in our lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/17/senate-section/article/S7740-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7740-S7741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ONE YEAR AGO TODAY--TWA FLIGHT 800\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, one year ago today, I spent the \nmorning in a hearing on aviation safety arguing with the head of the \nFederal Aviation Administration that we needed higher safety standards \nand better safety inspections. We finished with the hearing at about \nthe same time 230 people began to prepare for a flight to Paris.\n  As with most flights, I am sure that some people were a little \nnervous, while others were delighted to be on board and away from the \nheat and congestion in New York. Shortly after 8:30 p.m., the lives of \nthe 230 people and their families changed forever.\n  Terrorism was the first focus of the National Transportation Safety \nBoard, FBI, and others. It was, and remains, incredible that a \nperfectly able aircraft, with an experienced crew, would just explode. \nYet it happened.\n  To the family of Matt Alexander, July 17 will always remain a tragic\n\n[[Page S7741]]\n\nmemory. Matt was from Florence, South Carolina. He was a student at \nWake Forest, going to spend a semester in France.\n  I want to make sure that the families of the victims realize that \ntheir losses have not been, and will not be, forgotten. Aviation safety \nchanges will occur that are the direct result of the crash. While new \nsafety measures cannot bring back loved ones, they can help prevent \nfuture losses.\n  We already have put in place new procedures to assist the families \nfollowing aviation disasters. A Federal task force created as part of \nthe Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996 continues to examine \nways to make sure that families get needed information, assistance, and \nprivacy following a disaster. None of this will bring back people like \nMatt, but we can make the process a more humane one.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/17/senate-section/article/S7740-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          1997 MID YEAR REPORT\n\n  The mailing and filing date of the 1997 Mid Year Report required by \nthe Federal Election Campaign Act, as amended, is Thursday, July 31, \n1997.
