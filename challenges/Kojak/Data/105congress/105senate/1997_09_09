Mr. President, in the absence of any Senators in the \nChamber to proceed with the legislation pending, I will take this \noccasion for a few moments to discuss U.S. foreign policy in the \nMideast. This is especially appropriate since today the Secretary of \nState, Madeleine Albright, is traveling to the Mideast in an effort to \npromote the so-called peace process. My very strong view is that the \ntime has come for a fundamental reassessment of U.S. policy for the \nMideast. The brutal fact of life is that there is no peace process. We \ntalk of the peace process, but there is a one-sided war being waged \ntoday by the Palestinians, a war against Israel.\n  Regrettably, terrorism has replaced warfare as a way of obtaining or \nseeking to obtain political objectives. After the Israelis were \nsuccessful in the wars of 1948, 1956, 1967, and 1973, there has no \nlonger been an effort to confront Israel militarily, but the insidious \nterrorist war continues. President Reagan said that the Soviets liked \nthe arms race as long as they were the only ones in it, and then with \nthe change of United States policy in the 1980's we brought the Soviet \nUnion to bankruptcy and ended that matter. And now I submit it is time \nfor a change in U.S. foreign policy in the Mideast because, simply \nstated, the emperor is wearing no clothes. There is no peace process. \nWe have had continuing terrorist attacks for years, but in the last 6 \nmonths the situation has escalated.\n  On March 21 of this year, on July 30 of this year, and on September 4 \nof this year, there have been bombings, murdering 21 Israelis and \nwounding over 330 other Israelis. On August 27, Chairman Yasser Arafat \nopenly embraced the Hamas leader, specifically condoning and supporting \nthe Hamas terrorism in a picture seen around the world: The famous shot \nheard around the world. This is the famous picture seen around the \nworld as depicted on the front page of the New York Times. And in this \nembrace and in this kiss facially, Yasser Arafat has thumbed his nose \nnot only at the Israelis but at the United States and our allies and \nall others who have poured billions of dollars into the Palestinian \nauthority.\n\n  My point is, simply stated, that it is time to stop that U.S. aid, \nand it is time that the U.S. exert its maximum influence to persuade \nour allies to stop that aid because of what has in fact happened. The \nPalestinians now have a police force of some 30,000. They have highly \nsophisticated weapons which are really not designed for a police force. \nShould Israel now turn over an airport to the Palestinians so that they \ncan develop air power as well?\n  The fundamental principle of the Camp David accord and the Oslo \naccord was that there would be confidence measures established, that \nthere would be assistance to the Palestinians in Gaza and on the West \nBank, that there would be an improvement in the standard of living, \nthat there would be an opportunity for Israel and the Palestinians to \nlive side by side. But the brutal fact of life is that that has not \nhappened. And when the U.S. policy now suggests going to final status \nnegotiations, it seems totally inappropriate when the confidence \nbuilding measures have not worked.\n  U.S. law now prohibits economic aid to the Palestinians on conditions \nimposed in an amendment introduced by\n\n[[Page S8938]]\n\nSenator Shelby and myself in 1994 which became part of the foreign aid \nbill of 1995. That amendment provided that further U.S. economic aid \nwas conditioned on two factors. No. 1, a maximum effort by the \nPalestinians to stop the terrorism. Realistically there cannot be \nguarantors. There is no such thing as an absolute success requirement. \nBut there is a requirement of a 100 percent effort, and that certainly \nhas not happened. The second requirement of the Specter-Shelby \namendment was that the PLO charter be changed to eliminate the language \ncalling for the destruction of Israel. That, too, has not been done, \nwith some excuses about the Palestinian legislative group not \nconvening, some representation that the accord signed on September 13, \n1993, in effect changed the charter, but that is legally incorrect. The \ncharter has not been changed.\n  After the March 21 terrorist attack on a Tel Aviv restaurant, Prime \nMinister Netanyahu charged that Chairman Arafat had given a green light \nto the terrorists. When Secretary of State Madeleine Albright appeared \nbefore the Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, I asked \nwhether in fact it was true that the Secretary of State knew the facts \nthat Chairman Arafat had given a green light. Secretary Albright \nreplied that there had not been a green light but there had not been a \nred light either.\n  Now, Mr. President, if there is not a red light, then U.S. law \nrequires an end to the economic aid. There is an absolute obligation on \nthe part of Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian Authority to make that \nmaximum, 100 percent, effort and it was not made. Earlier this year, in \nMarch, Deputy Secretary of Education Moshe Peled of Israel charged that \nChairman Arafat had knowledge in 1993 before the bombing of the World \nTrade Center. When I noted that accusation, I called upon the \nDepartment of Justice to conduct an investigation as to what had \nhappened there. I then pursued the matter by calling Deputy Secretary \nPeled myself. I could not talk to him because he spoke only Hebrew, and \nI spoke only English. But my associate, David Brog, who works with me \non these issues, who speaks Hebrew, talked to Mr. Peled, who stood by \nhis earlier comments. And it is my understanding that the FBI has \nquestioned Mr. Peled and that an investigation is ongoing, but as yet \nwe have not heard what the results of that investigation are.\n  It was a difficult day for me back on September 13, 1993, when \nChairman Arafat was honored at a ceremony on the lawn of the White \nHouse. It was an especially difficult day because many of us felt that \nChairman Arafat should have been prosecuted for his complicity in the \nmurder of our American Ambassador to the Sudan, Cleo A. Noble, Jr., and \nour Charge, George C. Moore in Khartoum back in 1973. Many thought \nArafat should have been prosecuted for the murders of 11 Israeli \nathletes at the summer Olympics in Munich in 1972. Many thought, \nincluding this Senator, that Chairman Arafat should have been \nprosecuted for the hijacking of the Achille Lauro and the murder of Mr. \nLeon Klinghoffer who was pushed overboard in October 1985.\n\n  But in the world of real politics, remarkable, strange, bizarre \nthings occur, and I think such an occurrence was presented at the White \nHouse lawn back in September 1993 in conferring a joint Nobel Peace \nPrize on Chairman Arafat. It seemed to me that when Prime Minister \nRabin shook Chairman Arafat's hand and then Foreign Minister Peres \nshook Chairman Arafat's hand, considering the fact that Israel had \nborne the brunt of the PLO terrorism, I should shake his hand as well, \nand I have on a number of occasions. Senator DeConcini led a delegation \nof which I was a member back in December 1993. Senator Hank Brown and I \nvisited Chairman Arafat in Gaza in 1995, August. Senator Richard Shelby \nand I visited Chairman Arafat in Gaza in January 1996, and on each \noccasion we pressed him hard about stopping terrorism. And in August \n1996 Senator Brown and I had obtained a long list of terrorists from \nnow Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. At that time, Mr. Netanyahu was \nthe leader of the opposition. And one by one, we went over this list of \nterrorists with Chairman Arafat, and we heard his excuses one by one. \nBut now Chairman Arafat has run out of excuses.\n  The U.S. policy appears to be continuing to work with Chairman Arafat \nbecause there is no one else to work with, but I suggest that if \nChairman Arafat is the best we have to work with, then the reality is \nwe have no one to work with. From meetings that I have had with \nPalestinian leaders over the course of the past decade, it is my view \nthat there may well be someone to succeed Chairman Arafat. We know on \nthis state of the record, with what Chairman Arafat has done on \nrepeated pronouncements and this embrace seen around the world, it is \nsimply not workable to continue to deal with him.\n  Now, it may be that the zebra can change its stripes, but on this \nstate of the record my sense is that it is futile to continue to deal \nwith Chairman Arafat. The terrorists whom Israel has tried to have \nextradited for trial, of which 31 are now on the list, some 11 have \neither joined the Palestinian Authority police force or are awaiting \nentry there. I have discussed with the distinguished Presiding Officer, \nSenator Hutchinson, who introduced a sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nlast week, combining our efforts in seeking hearings on this matter to \ngo into some detail and hear from the Secretary of State after her \nreturn from the Mideast and to hear from the Department of Justice what \nare the ramifications of the inquiries conducted as to Moshe Peled's \ncharges, because leadership is necessary to our foreign policy at the \npresent time and it is counterproductive and simply not sensible to \ncontinue on the policy which is being undertaken at the present time, \nto continue to have United States dollars and our allies' dollars \npoured into the Palestinian Authority, which only increases the ability \nof some Palestinians to conduct terrorism and also to prepare to wage \nan all-out war.\n\n  The thought about a Palestinian state had been deferred, awaiting to \nsee what confidence-building measures could arise, but when the \nDeConcini delegation arrived in Jericho in December 1993, just a few \nmonths after the signing of the accord on the White House lawn on \nSeptember 13, 1993, the Palestinian flags were already in full \nevidence. As far as the Palestinians were concerned, it was a de facto \nstate.\n  There had been concern that there would be a Trojan horse within \nIsrael. That has not happened because it hasn't been a secret Trojan \nhorse; it has been an army out in the open, some 30,000 strong with \nsophisticated military weapons and with the chief of police being under \nindictment under charge of having worked with the terrorists.\n  It is my hope, Mr. President, that President Clinton himself will \nbecome engaged in the Mideast peace process. I think it is a very good \nmove for Secretary of State Albright to go to the Mideast, and I \ncompliment the President for the decision to send our Secretary of \nState there, notwithstanding the terrorist attack of last week. It is \nmy hope that there will be a renewed effort by the United States to \npress to resume the Israeli-Syrian dialog. I believe that the visit \nthat President Clinton made to Damascus in 1994 was a very fruitful \nvisit. There have been reports that President Clinton was engaged in \nnegotiations as an intermediary between Prime Minister Rabin and \nPresident Assad which might have led to an accord between Israel and \nSyria, depending on what happened to the Golan Heights. That matter \nmight have been referred to Israel for a referendum, and there are \nsigns now that it would be fruitful to resume those discussions.\n  I think it also might be helpful to the Israeli-Palestinian situation \nto take the world's spotlight and the glare of the television cameras, \nso thoroughly enjoyed by Chairman Arafat, away from the Israeli-\nPalestinian controversy and focus some attention on an Israeli-Syrian \npeace accord. If a peace could be brokered between Israel and Syria to \ngo along with the peace between Egypt and Israel from the Camp David \naccords and the more recent peace negotiations between Jordan and \nIsrael, that would leave the Palestinian issue the odd man out. I \nbelieve that a direct involvement by the President, which I had \nsuggested last August after I returned from conversations with both \nPrime Minister Netanyahu and President Assad, would be very, very \nfruitful.\n\n[[Page S8939]]\n\n  I have seen in my foreign travels in my capacity as Chairman of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee and my work on the Foreign Operations \nSubcommittee of the Appropriations Committee the enormous respect and \nadmiration that the United States is held in around the world. We are \nthe only superpower, and we are greatly admired for our tremendous \neconomic success. We have the potential for enormous influence. When \nthe President of the United States, when that office is involved, \nregardless of who the President is--President Reagan, President Bush, \nPresident Carter, President Clinton--when the Presidency exerts that \npower, there are enormous potential benefits to be gained in bringing \nadversaries together.\n  It is my hope that Secretary Albright will make some progress. It is \nmy hope that the President will personally intervene in these matters, \nbecause his participation in the past has been very, very productive, \nbut it ought to be very plain that on the current state of the record, \nthe United States will not, should not, cannot, must not provide \nfurther economic aid to the Palestinian Authority, that we should use \nour utmost persuasive powers to get our allies to follow the same \ncourse of not giving economic aid to the Palestinian Authority, because \nto do so is just to build up their military capacity, their capacity \nfor terrorism, the police force, the army of some 30,000 and the \nsophisticated weapons they now have. The reality is that the emperor \nhas no clothes. There is no peace process. There is a war engaged, one \nside of the war is terrorism, with the efforts of the Palestinians to \nuse terrorism to replace warfare as a method of getting their political \nobjectives.\n  The time has come for a fundamental reassessment of U.S. policy for \nthe Mid-East.\n  The brutal fact of life is that there is no peace process.\n  It is time to acknowledge there is a war going on. The PLO is at war \nwith Israel.\n  There can be no other conclusion from these facts:\n  First, the PLO/Hamas in three terrorist attacks in the past 6 months \nhave murdered 21 Israelis and wounded over 330.\n  Second, Chairman Arafat has literally and figuratively embraced Hamas \nopenly. His front page kiss of the Hamas leader seen around the world \ntells the Arab world and certainly the Palestinians that the \nPalestinian Authority condones and supports Hamas.\n  Third, even after last week's terrorist attack, Hamas threatens more \nviolence if its demands are not met.\n  Terrorism has replaced conventional warfare in the Mid-East as the \nprime method to obtain political objectives. After losing the wars of \n1948, 1956, 1967, and 1973, the Arab world has not directly confronted \nIsrael militarily. Instead the PLO has sought to obtain its objectives \nby killing women, children, and any other available civilians by \ncowardly sneak attacks in restaurants, shopping centers, and street \ncorners.\n  Yet, we continue to talk of the peace process while this one-sided \nwar is being waged. President Reagan correctly noted that the Soviets \nliked the arms race as long as they were the only ones in it. The \nUnited States changed course in the 1980's with military preparedness \nand brought the U.S.S.R. to its knees in bankruptcy.\n  It is now time--really past time--to change U.S. policy in the Mid-\nEast.\n  This week's visit by Secretary Madeleine Albright presents an \noccasion to do just that.\n  While the PLO makes a pretense at peace, the United States and our \nallies are making the Palestinian Authority stronger by financing their \nbuildup.\n  The concept of the Camp David agreement and the Oslo accords was \nsound. Give the Palestinians local autonomy. Develop confidence \nbuilding measures. Set the stage for the Palestinians to live side by \nside in peace with Israel.\n  The problem is that it just has not worked. It's time to acknowledge \nthat the emperor is wearing no clothes.\n  I had long thought Chairman Arafat should be prosecuted for his \ncomplicity in the murder of our Ambassador to the Sudan, Cleo A. Noel, \nJr., and our Charge d'Affaires, George C. Moore, in Khartoum on March \n2, 1973; for the murders of 11 Israeli athletes at the Summer Olympics \nin Munich in 1972; and the murder of Mr. Leon Klinghoffer on the \nAchille Lauro in October 1985. But I thought, if Prime Minister Rabin \nand Foreign Minister Peres could shake Chairman Arafat's hand--\nconsidering Israel had born the brunt of PLO terrorism--then so could \nI.\n  I have shaken his hand in meetings with a delegation led by Senator \nDennis DeConcini in Cairo in December 1993, with Senator Hank Brown in \nGaza in August 1995, and with Senator Richard Shelby in Gaza in January \n1996. On each occasion, our delegation pressed him on stopping \nterrorism. In our August 1995 meeting, Senator Brown and I had obtained \nfrom now-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, then the leader of the \nopposition, a list of PLO terrorists against whom Chairman Arafat \nrefused to act. One by one we listened to his excuses why nothing could \nbe done. By now, he has run out of excuses.\n\n  Following the Oslo accords, the United States took the lead with our \nallies in providing financial aid in the billions to the Palestinian \nAuthority. Our calculation was that improving the lives of the \nPalestinians would provide stability to the region and promote peace.\n  The issue of a Palestinian state was supposedly deferred. But not as \nfar as the Palestinians were concerned. When the DeConcini delegation \narrived in Jericho in December 1993, we found flags for the Palestinian \nstate with the PLO taking it as a fait accompli.\n  Some were concerned that the Oslo accords would create a Trojan \nhorse--a concealed military force within Israel. But it was not that \nway at all. It was not concealed, but it was a force.\n  We now find a Palestinian police force--really an army. Although the \nOslo accords limit the Palestinians to 24,000 policemen in the West \nBank and Gaza, the Israeli Government reports that the PLO currently \ndeploys over 30,000 policemen. The Palestinian police have acquired \nsophisticated weapons typically used by armies, not police forces, such \nas LAU and RPG antitank missiles, antiaircraft missiles, and Kayushas.\n  Of the 31 suspected terrorists whose extradition is being sought by \nIsrael, 11 are either serving in the Palestinian police or are in the \nprocess of joining its ranks. The Palestinian police chief, Ghazi \nJabali, stands accused by Israel of planning terrorist attacks on \nIsraeli civilians. The Israelis cited evidence that General Jabali \nhelped plot a July 1997 attack on Jewish settlers near Nablus. Israel \nhas issued a warrant for his arrest and a formal order for his \nextradition to Israel to face these charges. The Washington Post \nreported on August 7, 1997, that the Clinton administration has said it \nhas proof that Jabali helped organize this attack.\n  What next? Israel has resisted giving the Palestinians their own \nairport. Should a Palestinian air force be permitted? Will continued \nU.S. and allied aid be funneled into such air power and further \nmilitary development?\n  Assessing blame for the deterioration in the Israeli-Palestinian \nrelationship is an endless and futile undertaking. Whatever blame is \nattached to Prime Minister Netanyahu's rhetoric and policies, that \ncannot be placed on the same scale as PLO terrorist murders.\n  I strongly believe that the United States should now cut off any \nfurther aid and persuade our allies to do the same unless and until the \nPalestinian Authority demonstrates a 100-percent effort to stop \nterrorism. They cannot be guarantors, but they can and should be held \nto a 100-percent effort.\n  When PLO terrorism continued after the Oslo accords were signed, \nSenator Shelby and I introduced the Specter-Shelby amendment which \nbecame law on August 23, 1994, as part of the fiscal year 1995 foreign \noperations bill. That amendment provided for a cutoff of United States \naid if: First, the PLO did not change its charter calling for the \ndestruction of Israel; and second, the Palestinian Authority did not \nmake a 100-percent effort to stop terrorism.\n  In a report published in the Jerusalem Post on March 26, 1997, Deputy \nEducation Minister Moshe Peled charged that Chairman Arafat knew in \nadvance about the plan to blow up the Trade Center in New York in 1993. \nI then wrote to Attorney General Reno on April 1, 1997, asking for an \ninvestigation on that matter. After receiving a reply from the \nDepartment of Justice legislative liaison that they\n\n[[Page S8940]]\n\nknew of no evidence to support that charge, I called Mr. Peled on May \n2, 1997. Since he did not speak English and I do not speak Hebrew, I \nasked my assistant, David Brog, who does speak Hebrew, to talk to him. \nMr. Peled stood by his charge, but declined to elaborate.\n\n  On May 14, 1997, I again wrote to Attorney General Reno with more \nspecific requests on what her Department should do in its \ninvestigation. When I announced on June 13, 1997, that I intended to \nput a hold--that is, hold up on the confirmation of Deputy Attorney \nGeneral Eric Holder, the Department of Justice committed to undertake \nan investigation. I have since heard media reports that the FBI \ninterviewed Mr. Peled in his Tel Aviv office for some 2 hours on June \n26, 1997. On June 4, 1997, and again on July 28, 1997, I asked FBI \nDirector Louis Freeh about the progress of the investigation during \nJudiciary Committee hearings. Both times, I was told he would let me \nknow. To date, I have received no report on the progress of that \ninvestigation.\n  In light of Mr. Peled's charge and the March 21, 1997, terrorist \nattack on a Tel Aviv restaurant, I proposed an amendment to the fiscal \nyear 1998 foreign operations bill providing that no aid shall be given \nto the Palestinian Authority unless:\n       First, the Palestinian Authority is using its maximum \n     efforts to combat terrorism and, in accordance with the Oslo \n     accords, has ceased the use violence, threat of violence, or \n     incitement to violence as a tool of the Palestinian \n     Authority's policy toward Israel;\n       Second, after a full investigation by the Department of \n     Justice, the executive branch of government concludes that \n     Chairman Arafat had no prior knowledge of the World Trade \n     Center bombing, and\n       Third, after a full inquiry by the Department of State, the \n     executive branch of government concludes that Chairman Arafat \n     did not authorize and did not fail to use his authority to \n     prevent the Tel Aviv cafe bombing of March 21, 1997.\n  That amendment was adopted on July 16, 1997, as part of the Senate \nbill and now awaits action in the forthcoming Senate-House conference.\n  The subsequent terrorist attacks on July 30 and September 4 require \nincreased sanctions of an unconditional elimination of U.S. aid plus \nour efforts to persuade our allies to do the same.\n  I support the President's decision to send Secretary of State \nMadeleine Albright to the Mid-East notwithstanding the September 4 \nbombing and urge greater U.S. involvement including action by the \nPresident himself. However, I disagreed with the administration's \ndecision to continue United States aid to the Palestinian Authority \nafter the March 21 bombing and I oppose the suggested administration \npolicy to move to final status negotiations promptly.\n  After the March 21 bombing, Prime Minister Netanyahu accused Chairman \nArafat of giving a green light to that terrorist attack. On March 24, \n1997, I wrote Secretary of State Madeleine Albright asking if that was \ntrue. Receiving no answer, I pursued that question when the Secretary \nof State appeared before the Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign \nOperations on May 22, 1997.\n  The Secretary of State responded that Chairman Arafat had not given a \ngreen light, but had not given a red light either. That is totally \nunsatisfactory. Under United States law, embodied in the Specter-Shelby \namendment, a red light is mandated if the Palestinian Authority is to \ncontinue to receive United States aid.\n  The administration continues a policy of giving financial aid to the \nPalestinian Authority to promote the so-called peace process and to \ndeal with Chairman Arafat on the argument that there is no one else \nwith whom to deal.\n\n  I emphatically disagree on both counts.\n  Further financial aid to the Palestinian authority only strengthens \nthe PLO's ability to carry out terrorist attacks and ultimately wage an \nall-out war.\n  To continue to deal with Chairman Arafat on this date of the record \nis counter-productive and foolish. How can we deal with a man who \nopenly embraced the Hamas terrorist leader which condones prior murder \nand encourages future mayhem.\n  If Chairman Arafat is the best we have to deal with, then their best \nis not good enough. After extensive dialogue with moderate Palestinians \nfor more than a decade, I believe there are others who could to a \nbetter job than Chairman Arafat. None could do worse.\n  I would not categorically rule out further dealings with Chairman \nArafat if he again changes his stripes. Not to discredit the zebra or \nto unduly mix metaphors, Chairman Arafat makes the chameleon look \nconstant.\n  The Chairman Arafat who embraced Hamas leader Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi--\npictured on the front page of the New York Times on August 21, 1997--is \ntotally unacceptable as was the Chairman Arafat who was implicated in \nthe murders of our Ambassador and Charge d'Affairs in the Sudan in \n1973, the murder of 11 Israeli athletes at Munich in 1972 and the \nhighjack/murder of Leon Klinghoffer on the Achille Lauro in 1985.\n  But, in the distasteful world of real politic, who knows? What will \nbe the future of Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian Authority? We know \nthat Chairman Arafat responds to pressure. If the United States applies \nthe most pressure, perhaps he will again be minimally acceptable. But \non today's record, the cutoff of aid from the United States and our \nallies and the rejection of Chairman Arafat should be absolute.\n  The desperate situation in the Mid-East calls for more intense U.S. \ninvolvement in new directions. We should continue to urge all the \nparties, including Prime Minister Netanyahu, to improve the climate for \nnegotiation. However, we should not place on the same scale Israel's \npolicy to build settlements on its own land with PLO's terrorist \nmurders.\n  Somehow, we must reach the daily preaching of hatred against Jews by \nthe PLO and Moslem fundamentalists. It may well be that until we solve \nthat underlying problem, the reach for peace in the Mid-East will be a \ncontinuing generation away.\n  The record continues to demonstrate the spewing of hate by Chairman \nArafat and his ilk. Just weeks ago, on August 25, 1997, a moderator on \nPLO controlled television declared that ``the Jews exaggerate what the \nNazis did to them'' and that ``no more than 400,000'' Jews were killed \nin the Holocaust. Likewise, PLO officials including their \nrepresentative to the United Nations in Geneva have embraced a modern \nversion of the age-old blood liable by claiming that Israeli \nauthorities injected hundreds of Palestinian children with the HIV \nvirus.\n  These messages of hatred are not directed against Israel alone. On \nJuly 11, 1997, the PLO-appointed Mufti of Jerusalem, Sheikh Ikrama \nSabri, said in a sermon broadcast on the Palestinian Authority's \nofficial radio station: ``Oh Allah, destroy America for she is ruled by \nZionist Jews . . . Allah will paint the White House black . . . Allah \nshall take revenge on behalf of his prophet against the colonialist \nsettlers who are sons of monkeys and pigs.''\n  Beyond the current visit by the Secretary of State, I continue to \nurge the personal involvement of the President. At the right moment, \nhis personal touch on the Israeli-Palestinian problem could be \npowerful.\n\n  My foreign travels on behalf of the Senate Intelligence Committee and \nthe Appropriations Foreign Operations Subcommittee have shown me the \nenormous impact the United States has around the world. The United \nStates is respected and admired. As the only remaining superpower, our \npower is acknowledged as awesome.\n  Bringing peace to the Mid-East is an awesome task in the face of \nmillennia of strife in that region. By properly deploying our \npersuasion and power, we may still be able to do it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all letters and articles referred to be \nprinted in the Congressional Record at the conclusion of this floor \nstatement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 1, 1997.\n     Hon.

The news report further said that Arafat was \n     privy to the conspiracy and met with Sudanese and Islamic \n     terrorist leaders.\n       With this letter, I am enclosing for you a photostatic copy \n     of the news report from the Jerusalem Post on March 26.\n       I would very much appreciate it if you would conduct the \n     appropriate investigation to determine what evidence exists, \n     if any, of Arafat's complicity in this matter.\n       It appears to me that, if true, Arafat would be \n     prosecutable under U.S. criminal laws.

Janet Reno,\n     Attorney General, Department of Justice, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Attorney General Reno: By letter dated April 1, 1997, \n     (copy enclosed) I wrote to you concerning Israeli Deputy \n     Education Minister Moshe Peled's statement that Palestinian \n     Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat had prior knowledge of the \n     1993 plot to bomb New York City's World Trade Center.\n       By letter dated April 29 (copy enclosed) Assistant Attorney \n     General Andrew Fois responded with a very generalized \n     statement about having ``queried the Israeli authorities.'' \n     No mention was made whether the Department of Justice talked \n     to Deputy Education Minister Moshe Peled or did any real \n     pursuit on the matter.\n       Since I do not speak Hebrew, my assistant, David Brog, \n     Esquire, talked to Mr. Peled. Mr. Peled said that he was not \n     prepared to disclose any more information on Chairman \n     Arafat's connection in the World Trade Center bombing beyond \n     what he told the Jerusalem Post. Mr. Brog said that Mr. Peled \n     was not flexible on this point and that he (Mr. Brog) had the \n     impression that Mr. Peled had gotten into some trouble for \n     his previous disclosure.\n       I am interested to know whether the Department of Justice \n     talked to Mr. Peled before Mr. Fois's letter to me of April \n     29. If so, what he said. If not, why wasn't Mr. Peled \n     questioned.\n       I consider this an extremely serious matter. As you know, \n     Chairman Arafat could be extradited to the United States if \n     there is evidence to support Mr. Peled's charge.\n       I formally request the Department of Justice to conduct a \n     real investigation on this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 24, 1997.\n     Hon. Madeleine Albright,\n     Secretary of State,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Albright: According to the weekend press \n     reports, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has stated \n     that Palestinian Chairman Yasir Arafat has indirectly given a \n     green light to the terrorists resulting in the suicide bomb \n     which killed and wounded many Israelis last Friday.\n       According to the news reports, Chairman Arafat and the \n     Palestinian authority released Ibrahim Maqadmeh. Prime \n     Minister Netanyahu further stated that Chairman Arafat and \n     the Palestinian authority have failed to detain known \n     terrorists and to confiscate weaponry.\n       In my judgment, it is very important for the State \n     Department to make a factual determination as to whether \n     Chairman Arafat and the Palestinian authority did give a \n     green light indirectly to the terrorists and whether there \n     was a failure to detain known terrorists and to confiscate \n     weaponry.\n       I would appreciate your advice, as promptly as possible, on \n     your Department's conclusion as to whether Chairman Arafat \n     and the Palestinian authority gave an indirect green light to \n     the terrorists.\n       As you know, an amendment offered by Senator Shelby and \n     myself to the Middle East Peace Facilitation Act of 1995 \n     conditions the $500 million in U.S. aid to the Palestinian \n     authority on presidential certification that the Palestinian \n     authority is complying with all of its commitments under its \n     peace accords with Israel, including its commitment to \n     prevent acts of terrorism and undertake ``legal measures \n     against terrorists, including the arrest and prosecution of \n     individuals suspected of perpetrating acts of violence and \n     terror''.\n       The Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Foreign \n     Operations, on which I sit, will soon be considering this \n     issue for fiscal year 1998 so I would appreciate your prompt \n     response.\n       In addition, I would appreciate your advising me as to \n     whether there is any U.S. aid in the pipeline which has not \n     yet been turned over to the Palestinian authority.

Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: This is in response to you letter to \n     the Attorney General dated April 1, 1997. Your letter \n     encloses a news article from The Jerusalem Post in which it \n     is reported that Yasser Arafat may have had prior knowledge \n     of the bombing of the World Trade Center building on February \n     26, 1993.\n       Aside from the news report enclosed with you letter, the \n     Department of Justice is unaware of any information that \n     Yasser Arafat either had prior knowledge of the bombing of \n     the World Trade Center or was in any way involved in the \n     conspiracy to bomb the building. We have queried the Israeli \n     authorities about this information and they deny the accuracy \n     of the statements attributed in the article to the Deputy \n     Education Minister.\n       I hope this information is helpful. If we can be of further \n     assistance with regard to this or any other matter, please do \n     not hesitate to contact this office.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Andrew Fois,\n     Assistant Attorney General.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the Jerusalem Post, Mar. 26, 1997]\n\n                 Arafat Knew of World Trade Center Plot\n\n                           (By Steven Rodan)\n\n       Israeli intelligence has evidence that Palestinian \n     Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat had prior knowledge of the \n     successful 1993 plot to bomb New York City's World Trade \n     Center, which killed six people. Deputy Education Minister \n     Moshe Peled said Tuesday night.\n       ``More than that, he was part of the discussions on the \n     operation,'' Peled said, ``I call on the prime minister to \n     give the information to the Americans, so they'll know who \n     they're dealing with.''\n       Peled confirmed information relayed by intelligence sources \n     that, several days before the February 26, 1993 bombing, \n     Arafat met with Sudanese and Islamic terrorist leaders who \n     discussed the plot.\n       The sources said Arafat was privy to the conspiracy because \n     of his close personal ties to Sudanese leader Hassan Turabi, \n     head of the National Islamic Front. According to a U.S. State \n     Department report on terrorism, Turabi is a leading advocate \n     of closer ties between terrorist groups and their government \n     sponsors. He was also a leading figure in the Fatah-Hamas \n     dialogue in 1995.\n       Two Sudanese diplomats were arrested and later deported in \n     July of 1993, after U.S. authorities directly linked them to \n     the explosion at the World Trade Center and a plot to bomb \n     the United Nations.\n       Israeli government spokesmen refused to comment on the \n     intelligence reports or on Peled's call for Prime Minister \n     Binyamin Netanyahu to release them to the U.S. ``I don't know \n     anything about it,'' said David Bar-Illan, director of \n     communications and policy planning in the Prime Minister's \n     Office.\n       A Defense Ministry spokesman also refused to comment.\n       But U.S. and Israeli intelligence sources agree that Arafat \n     continues to maintain a large number of Fatah guerrillas in \n     bases in Sudan, 1,200 of whom arrived from that country in \n     1994 and now serve in the Palestinian security forces. One \n     Israeli source said the number of Fatah guerrillas in Sudan \n     is close to 3,000.\n       ``Arafat continues to maintain a training base in Sudan and \n     the Fatah people there and work closely with the regime and \n     with Iran,'' said Yonah Alexander, a Pentagon consultant and \n     director of the terrorism studies program at George \n     Washington University. ``If there hadn't been an agreement \n     with Israel, then Fatah would definitely have been on the \n     U.S. list of terror organizations.''\n       But a U.S. counterterrorism official disputed the claim and \n     said Israeli officials might be confusing Fatah with Abu \n     Nidal's Fatah Revolutionary Council, which trains in Sudan.\n       ``There's no doubt there are terrorist groups training in \n     Sudan, but (Fatah) isn't one of them,'' he said.\n       U.S. counterterrorism officials have ``never heard any \n     report of Fatah'' training there, he said. He also stated \n     that ``there's been no indication of that kind of Sudan \n     connection'' to the World Trade Center bombing.\n       At one of the Sudanese camps, Kadru north of Khartoum, \n     Iranian experts trained terrorists, including Fatah forces \n     headed by Jaber Amer, as commanders, intelligence operatives, \n     and bombmakers, according to the sources.\n       A U.S. congressional investigator with close ties to \n     Israeli officials said Hamas and Fatah have training camps in \n     Sudan. ``They work together,'' he said. ``Arafat has \n     strategic ties with Turabi and he has exploited them in order \n     to forge cooperation with Hamas.'' But the investigator said \n     although he has heard of reports that Arafat knew of the \n     World Trade Center bombing plot, and was said to have even \n     praised the idea, he is skeptical of the veracity of the \n     information, ``I have yet to be convinced,'' he said.\n       U.S. State Department officials said the PLO has not \n     authorized any terrorist attacks since Arafat signed the \n     Declaration of Principles with Israel in September 1993. One \n     official who works on the State Department's report on global \n     terrorism said he does not know of any Fatah bases in Sudan.\n       In another development, Israeli officials said the Clinton \n     administration has quietly dropped its dispute of Israel's \n     assertion that\n\n[[Page S8942]]\n\n     Arafat has allowed the Islamic opposition groups to resume \n     terrorist attacks on Israel.\n       The officials said the CIA now shares Israel's assessment \n     that Arafat gave Hamas and Islamic Jihad a green light to \n     carry out terrorist attacks, at least while he is abroad.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Aug. 21, 1997]\n\n           Defying Israel, Arafat Embraces Islamic Militants\n\n                          (By Joel Greenberg)\n\n       Gaza.--Defying Israeli and American demands that he crack \n     down on Islamic militants, Yasir Arafat kissed and applauded \n     leaders of the Hamas and Islamic Holy War movements today and \n     warned that Palestinians were prepared to resume their \n     violent revolt against Israel.\n       At a conference of Palestinian factions here, Mr. Arafat \n     returned to the combative language of the seven-year uprising \n     against Israeli occupation, which ended in 1994 with the \n     beginning of Palestinian self rule.\n       ``There was an uprising for seven years,'' Mr. Arafat told \n     the conference, which he called to protest the policies of \n     Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel. ``Who did it? \n     The lion cubs, our children--this glorious uprising. Seven \n     years. We can erase and do it again from the beginning. There \n     is nothing far from us. All options are open to us.''\n       As he has many times in his career, Mr. Arafat was fighting \n     on several fronts at once.\n       His remarks came just days after Dennis B. Ross, the \n     American mediator, prodded him to renew security cooperation \n     with the Israelis and take action against Hamas and other \n     hard-line Islamic groups that have carried out terrorist \n     bombings in Israel. Mr. Arafat met Tuesday with the head of \n     Shin Bet, the Israeli domestic security agency, as he began \n     to comply with that request.\n       But at today's session in Gaza, called the National Unity \n     Conference to Confront the Challenges, Mr. Arafat was lining \n     up support from a broad array of factions, including the \n     militant Islamic groups who favor a more confrontational \n     stance toward the Israelis. The Islamic groups said they saw \n     the meeting as a means of resisting the crackdown by the \n     Palestinian Authority that Israel and the United States are \n     demanding.\n       [In Washington, senior American officials were dismayed by \n     Mr. Arafat's remarks. ``It simply makes an already difficult \n     situation more difficult,'' one official said. ``We have a \n     crisis of confidence, so no party should do or say things \n     that undermine confidence about a peaceful resolution of \n     their differences.''\n       [James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said the \n     United States remained convinced that Mr. Arafat would carry \n     out his pledge to cooperate with the Israelis against \n     terrorism. ``We are going to judge, in the area of security \n     cooperation and anti-terrorist cooperation, Chairman Arafat \n     by deeds,'' he said. ``Deeds are the coin of the realm when \n     it comes to fighting terrorism.'']\n       Today's conference in Gaza was significant because it \n     marked the first time Islamic Holy War, a militant group that \n     operates primarily in Gaza, had joined a meeting of \n     Palestinian factions under Mr. Arafat's leadership. Unlike \n     Hamas, which has both social programs and a military wing, \n     Islamic Holy War has devoted itself almost exclusively to \n     attacks on Israel.\n       At the conference, representatives of Hamas and Islamic \n     Holy War, who are political leaders of their organizations, \n     not members of their clandestine military wings, exchanged \n     customary kisses with Mr. Arafat after their speeches.\n       They said later that their participation in Mr. Arafat's \n     conference did not mean they were renouncing violence, as the \n     Palestinian leader did in reaching an accord with the \n     Israelis. The delegates said they remain implacably opposed \n     to the agreement reached in Oslo in 1993 between Israel and \n     the Palestine Liberation Organization.\n       ``This is not a conference to support Oslo, but to support \n     the stance of our people against the American and Israeli \n     pressures on the Palestinian Authority to arrest and crack \n     down on the Islamic movements,'' said Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi, \n     a Hamas leader.\n       The relationship between Mr. Arafat and the Israeli \n     Government, which had been strained, worsened considerably \n     last month after a suicide bombing in a Jerusalem market on \n     July 30 in which 14 people and the two attackers were killed.\n       Israel demanded that Mr. Arafat take action against Hamas \n     and Islamic Holy War and it imposed economic sanctions and \n     other punitive measures that the Palestinian leader condemned \n     as a declaration of war against his people.\n       The measure included closing borders, demolishing houses of \n     Palestinians on the grounds that they were built without \n     permits, and freezing payments of taxes and other money to \n     the Palestinian Authority.\n       Israel's moves united Palestinians of all political stripes \n     behind Mr. Arafat. Many perceive him as standing up to heavy \n     Israeli and American pressures to suppress the militants.\n       United States officials have backed the Israeli demands, \n     but they have also urged Israel to rescind economic sanctions \n     that are not directly linked to its security. To ease the \n     economic pressure, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt pledged \n     Tuesday to give the Palestinian Authority $10 million.\n       Israeli officials criticized Mr. Arafat for inviting Hamas \n     and Islamic Holy War to the Gaza conference, asserting that \n     his invitation of groups responsible for bombings that killed \n     scores of Israelis contradicted his commitment to fight \n     terrorism. Mr. Arafat is ``giving the terrorist organizations \n     a stamp of approval,'' said David Bar-Illan, communications \n     director for Prime Minister Netanyahu.\n       Mr. Arafat and his aides might think that ``appeasing, \n     pacifying and placating these organizations will do the \n     trick,'' Mr. Bar-Illan added, ``but they already tried that, \n     and we found that all this dialog does is give these \n     organizations the respectability and legitimacy which makes \n     it easier for them to continue their terrorist activity with \n     impunity.''\n       But Tayeb Abdel Rahim, a close aide of Mr. Arafat who was \n     chairman of the conference, rejected the Israeli criticism. \n     ``None of the speakers advocated explosions or terrorism,'' \n     he said. ``They all protested the Israeli policy that \n     disregards the peace process. They agreed on a common \n     denominator of rejecting the policy of dictation.''\n       The speakers, apparently following rules agreed upon in \n     advance, did not call explicitly for violence against Israel, \n     but instead urging ``resistance,'' ``confrontation'' and \n     ``struggle'' against the Israeli ``enemy.''\n       Many called on Mr. Arafat to stop security cooperation and \n     negotiations with the Israelis, and urged a boycott of \n     Israeli products in response to the Israeli border closures. \n     They criticized American officials for what they described as \n     a stance that favors Israel, and they urged Mr. Arafat to \n     resist Israeli ``dictates'' backed by the Americans to crack \n     down on militant groups.\n       Mr. Arafat has recently renewed security contacts at the \n     urging of the Americans, and he met on Tuesday with Ami \n     Ayalon, the head of Shin Bet, the Israeli security services. \n     But before the conference delegates he vowed never to submit \n     to Israeli economic and political pressures.\n       ``In the name of our children,'' he said, ``the children of \n     the uprising, I say: No one can humiliate the Palestinian \n     people, no one can defeat the Palestinian people, no one can \n     make our Palestinian people bow!''\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/09/senate-section/article/S8937-5", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

If you are not able to read sufficiently in \nfourth grade, you are not going to do well beyond that. If you don't \nhave a basic grasp of the concept of mathematics by the eighth grade, \nyou are not going to do well beyond that. The question is, What are we \ngetting for our education dollars? We spend a substantial amount of \nmoney in this country on elementary and secondary education. What are \nwe getting for it?\n  The proposal is a proposal that says, let us measure that, let us \nevaluate that, student to student, school to\n\n[[Page S8943]]\n\nschool, State to State, so that we know what we are getting out of our \neducation system. There isn't a more important subject, in my judgment, \nfor this country's future than the subject of education. Is our \neducation system a good one? Does it work? Does it prepare our country \nfor the future?\n  Benjamin Franklin once said that if you invest your purse in your \nhead, no one will ever take your purse from you. His point was that, if \nyou invest in education, nobody can ever take from you what you have \nachieved yourself. That is a very important point. That is why it is so \nimportant for our country to make sure that we have an education system \nthat works.\n  Although reading is the foundation for virtually all other learning \nin our country, it is estimated that 40 percent of America's fourth \ngraders cannot read at a basic level. Likewise, nearly 40 percent of \neighth graders in our country are not achieving at a basic level, and \n76 percent are not achieving at a proficient level. According to a \nrecently released Third International Math and Science Study, 55 \npercent of U.S. eighth graders score below the international average in \nmath.\n  Now, the point about national testing is not to suggest in any way \nthat the Federal Government try to run the local school systems. School \nsystems ought to be run locally. They are now and they will be in the \nfuture. But we ought to give parents information about how their \nstudents and schools in our States are doing, comparing them student to \nstudent and school to school and State to State. We simply don't have \nthat capability. Providing parents with that information, through a \nnational testing program, will be an important step in trying to \nevaluate where we are in the educational system and then what we need \nto do to strengthen and improve it.\n  Again, this is a proposal that says, let us try to evaluate across \nthis country how our children are doing in reading at the fourth grade \nlevel and how our children are doing in mathematics at the eighth grade \nlevel. Giving parents that information will be enormously beneficial. I \nhave two children in public schools this morning. They are the most \nwonderful young children that live in this country--as all parents feel \nabout their children. I want them to have the finest education \navailable to them. They are in public school. I like their teachers, I \nrespect their school. But I happen to believe that, to the extent that \nwe can improve this country's educational system, we will do that if we \narm parents with more and more information about how the system does, \nhow the schools are doing, how the teachers are doing, and how our \nstudents are doing.\n  There are three things that will work to improve education in this \ncountry, and all three are necessary in order for the educational \nsystem to work well. First is a student that is willing to learn. Secod \nis a teacher that knows how to teach. And third is a parent that is \ninvolved in their student's education. The failure to have any one of \nthe three means we don't do nearly as well as we can.\n  Now, the proposal for a national testing program has substantial \nsupport. Polls have shown that 77 percent of the American people \nsupport national standards for measuring the academic performance of \nschools. It has substantial support from leaders all across this \ncountry, national business leaders like the National Chamber of \nCommerce, the Business Roundtable, the National Alliance of Business, \nand it is clear to them that our ability to succeed in the long term \nand compete in the long term with other countries rests in our ability \nto provide an educational system that educates our children \nsufficiently so that we do succeed and prevail.\n  Here is the testimony from the business leaders in America. Let me \nread a couple of the pieces of testimony. This is Jim Barksdale, the \nCEO of Netscape Communications, and L. John Doerr, a partner in the \nfirm of Kleiner, Perkins, Caulfield & Byers, on behalf of 240 \ntechnology industry leaders in a bipartisan call for national education \nstandards in reading and math:\n\n       Every State should adopt high national standards, and by \n     1999, every State should test every fourth grader in reading \n     and eighth grader in math to make sure these standards are \n     met. President Clinton's national testing initiative offers a \n     new opportunity to widely accept national benchmarks in \n     reading and math against which States, school districts, \n     and parents can judge student performance.\n  Now, the proposal is completely voluntary. No student is required to \ntake tests. Any student can opt out, any school can opt out, any State \ncan opt out--a completely voluntary proposal. Then we had some \namendments offered in the other body, the House of Representatives, an \ninitiative, and some amendments here in the Senate, which I think will \nbe withdrawn, that would prohibit any kind of national testing. So \nthere has been discussion back and forth in recent days about, should \nwe prohibit any kind of national testing? I think the answer to that \nshould be no.\n  We are proposing that the National Assessment Governing Board, called \nNAGB--a bipartisan, independent board--will oversee and ensure the \nintegrity of these national tests. NAGB was established by Congress in \n1989 to independently formulate policy guidelines for the National \nAssessment of Educational Progress.\n  I don't have any interest, again, in having the National or the \nFederal Government decide that we are going to, in any way, impose \nrestrictions or arbitrary requirements on school districts across this \ncountry. That is not my interest. It is my interest to provide some \nleadership to see if we can't describe some kind of national \nachievement levels which we aspire to reach as a country.\n  It is interesting. You go on a radio show, talk radio, these days--\nand it has been that way for some years now--and somebody calls in and \ntalks about how any effort by anybody to test some sort of achievement \nlevel is some intrusive encroachment on education. I don't think that \nat all. As much as we spend on education, we ought to try to find out \nwhat we are getting for all of this. Where are we succeeding and where \nare we failing? That is what this initiative is all about. It is not an \nattempt to eclipse the powers, rights, or interests of local school \nboards. It is an attempt to see if we can't, all across this country, \ngive parents more information about what they are getting for their \neducation dollar and give school administrators and give other \nadministrators who are interested in this an evaluation of where we are \nwith respect to reading at the fourth grade level and mathematics at \nthe eighth grade level, to see whether we are reaching the goals that \nwe aspire to reach as a country. If we can't take that first baby step, \nif we don't have the opportunity or courage to take that step, then we \nare not in any way going to achieve the goals we have for this \ncountry's education in the years ahead.\n  I thought this was going to be resolved last week, and I understand \nit is still ricocheting around the Chamber. If it's not resolved, I am \ninclined to offer a second-degree amendment to one of the first degrees \nthat has been noticed, which would simply say that the National \nAssessment Governing Board would be the board that would be empowered \nto help provide this national testing. I want us to have an affirmative \ndiscussion and decision on this. I think that will be a very important \nthing for the Senate to say with respect to this appropriations bill \nbecause it is likely the appropriations bill coming to conference from \nthe House side will say, in a negative way, that they don't want \nanything to do with this kind of national testing.\n  So I came to the floor today to say that I thought this had been \nresolved last week, and it has not been. If it is not resolved soon, I \nwould like to offer an amendment. Senator Bingaman has one noticed. If \nthat is not offered, I will probably offer a second degree, and we \nshould have a vote on this issue. This country can do better in \neducation. One way to do that is to aspire to have a national \nevaluation of what we are getting and what our performance levels are \nat the fourth grade level for reading and at the eighth grade level for \nmathematics.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nfor up to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  \n                            ____________________\n  \n  \n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/09/senate-section/article/S8942-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8944-S8945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S8944]]\n\n\n\n                      NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL TESTING\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I want to say to the Senator from North \nDakota that I have listened with great care to his remarks and with a \nstrong degree of sympathy and support for all that he has to say. I do \nwant to add two cautions or questions that I know he will consider very \nthoughtfully in this connection, however.\n  I am here on the floor to speak to an amendment I introduced last \nnight that would take dozens, perhaps hundreds, of categoric programs \nfor education and consolidate them and distribute them on a formula \nbasis to each school district, with a firm belief that our school board \nmembers and teachers in various schools throughout the country can make \na better determination as to how to use that money than can bureaucrats \nhere in Washington, DC.\n\n  But a part of my talk in a few moments will relate to this very \nquestion of achievement. I agree with the Senator from North Dakota, \nbut the two caveats I have are these. Will we have a set of national \nstandards or national tests that truly measure learning, knowledge, as \nwe wish it to be?\n  There is great suspicion that anything sponsored by the Federal \nDepartment of Education will be of questionable validity in the real \nworld in showing where our students are. And will a set of national \ntests drive out more sophisticated and better quality State and/or \nlocal tests? Will school districts and State superintendents of public \ninstruction across the country say, fine, we have these national tests \nnow, we don't need to do anything other than to teach to those tests--\nthe very modest one subject in fourth grade and one subject in eighth \ngrade?\n  I say that because, in preparing for my other comments, I have here \nthe results of the first experimental year of a new set of tests given \nin the State of Washington to a wide number of students in more than \n250 school districts and some private schools throughout the State. \nNow, these tests are far more sophisticated and far deeper than \nanything we are talking about here on a national level. Starting in the \nfourth grade but to be extended up to the tenth grade in the future, \nstudents were tested in listening, reading, writing, and mathematics. \nIn other words, four sets of tests, rather than the one called for in \nthe President's proposal.\n  Moreover, they were tested for their actual mastery of the subjects, \nrather than just on some sliding scale: Are you in the fiftieth \npercentile of all the people who took the test, either in the State or \nacross the country? The State of Washington does use the current \nnational tests in some of these areas, which are simply true, false, or \na fill-in-the-blank-with-a-pencil kind of test. These new tests, \nhowever, in a number of the areas, include essay examinations as well \nas true, false, or multiple choice tests.\n  This is what some of the national organizations or experts have to \nsay about this. I am quoting from last Thursday's Seattle Times.\n\n       Washington's new test gets high marks from experts familiar \n     with similar assessments in other States. Most say it will \n     take time for students to meet the new standard and that \n     these kinds of tests, called performance-based assessments, \n     are more demanding than the fill-in-the-bubbles tests most \n     parents and students are used to.\n       The problem with standardized tests is that they hold \n     schools accountable not for how students do in relation to a \n     fixed standard, but rather in relation to how other students \n     do --``a fuzzy concept,'' said Dr. Philip Daro of the New \n     Standards Project, a consortium of States and urban districts \n     creating education-reform models.\n       ``Performance-based tests are more realistic, more \n     practical, more like people evaluated in the workplace,'' \n     Daro said.\n       The American Federation of Teachers said Washington's \n     standards in English and science meet its criteria for being \n     strong, coherent and useful to teachers and parents. The \n     State's math standards are borderline and its social-studies \n     standards are considered below par, with too little attention \n     given to that history.\n\n  Under those consensuses, one of the reasons for the criticism of \nmathematics is that even in the Washington State tests, among students \nwho rank very high in National College Board examinations and the like, \nyou can get a perfect score in the fourth grade mathematics test even \nthough you have the wrong answer. Some of the SAT questions give a \nperfect score in this test if you get the reasoning right even if you \ncome up with the wrong answer. That is not going to please the real \nworld, or a potential employer is not going to be comforted by having \nan employee who may think logically but reaches the wrong answer in a \nmathematical computation.\n  Given that, however, Mr. President, it is breathtaking and \ndisappointing to report that in these four areas 62 percent of the \nfourth graders who took the test in my State exceeded the standard for \nlistening, 48 percent for reading, 32 percent for writing, and 22 \npercent for mathematics even with the possibility of getting a perfect \nscore on some of the tests on some of the questions in the test without \ngetting the right answer. Twenty-six percent of our fourth grade \nstudents flunked all four, or failed to meet the standard in all four, \nand only 14 percent met the standards in all four.\n  I was very disturbed by the fact that our State superintendent of \npublic instruction, who is new, and, may I say, said, ``We must not be \ndiscouraged by results of the assessment, or try to hammer children and \nteachers.'' I think we should be discouraged by those results. I don't \nthink we should hammer children and teachers. And I will speak in a few \nminutes on the proposition that I think they ought to get more direct \naid from ourselves, and fewer bureaucrats telling them what to do and \nhow to do it. But these are very disappointing results.\n  I guess my fear and my only reservation is about the remark on \nnational standards, with which in theory I certainly agree, in \nconnection with the talk by the Senator from North Dakota is that I \nwould hate to see a set of national standards that we work down to \nrather than up from.\n  The same article said that only one State, Iowa, is not engaged in \nsome kind of testing at the present time.\n  So my real question on this is how do we see to it that a set of so-\ncalled ``national standards'' don't end up depreciating, or making less \ndemanding, the requirement to meet certain standards that many States \nhave now and others like my own are moving toward with great rapidity?\n  I simply have that as a question.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Washington yield for \na question?\n  Mr. GORTON. He certainly would.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, before I ask the question, I say I think \nthe remarks by Senator Gorton are important and raise the right \nquestion.\n  I would not suggest that we have some sort of aspiration for national \ntesting that would in any way lower standards. We need to raise \nstandards. It seems to me that the proposals that have been advanced, \nfor example, with respect to the reading at the fourth grade level is \none of these gateway activities. If you do not get through that fourth \ngrade level and are able to read and go beyond, and you are beyond that \nand aren't able to read sufficiently, nothing else will come together \nin your educational career. That is the problem. That is why you need \nto measure on some of these gateway activities like reading at the \nfourth grade level and mathematics at the eighth grade level.\n  The Senator from the State of Washington made a couple of important \npoints. There are some good testing activities going on in some States. \nSome are terribly deficient. It is important to understand that, \nwhether it is the National Chamber of Commerce, the Business \nRoundtable, or the technology firms in our country who are asking for \nthis and who believe this is an essential part of understanding what we \nare getting from our educational system and how to fix it. They feel \nthat we have a significant problem. And, in order to fix that problem, \nyou need to figure out where you are, and where you go from that point \nto fix it. I share that feeling.\n\n  I say to the Senator from Washington that the points he made are \naccurate. Isn't it the case, however, that we should be able to \nrecognize the concern some people have about who would do the testing, \nor what kind of testing would be done? Shouldn't we be able to overcome \nthose concerns by saying at least we aspire as a Nation to achieve some \ngoals with respect to our children who are in the fourth grade and the \neighth grade, and with respect to their meeting the mathematics skills? \nShouldn't we be able to meet the concerns that the Senator from \nWashington expresses?\n\n[[Page S8945]]\n\n  Mr. GORTON. My answer to that question is an unqualified yes. Of \ncourse we should do just that. What we must take great care with is \nseeing to it that any national standards strengthen and encourage the \nstandards that are already being set in any of the States; that they be \nable to move forward; not an excuse to move backward; and that they \nmeasure real knowledge. I believe that the heart of some of the \nobjections to the national standards are the ones made by the American \nFederation of Teachers to Washington State mathematics. There just is \nno way except in the heart of some totally abstract profession that you \ncan justify giving 100 percent to a student who gets the wrong answer \nto a question. It may be encouraging students to move towards a way to \ncome up with the right answer. But that is not something that ought to \nget 100 percent.\n  I hope we derive a system for whatever national tests come, and I \nthink some are likely to come that measure real knowledge and real \nprogress, and that encourages States to make their own standards even \ntougher and their assessments to take place more frequently.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time allotted to the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask for two additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. I would just like to say in summary that I am in no way \ncritical of what my State has done, and the movement towards these \nstandards I find very encouraging. I think absent these constructive \ncriticisms that they are likely to set very, very good and very \nsignificant standards. It is just that I have to predicate the comment \nthat we shouldn't be discouraged by the results. We should be \ndiscouraged by the results. And we should resolve that we are going to \ndo everything possible to cause those results to improve markedly and \nas quickly as possible.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I may ask the Senator to yield for one \nadditional question, I come from a school where I was involved in a \ngraduating class of nine. I come from a county that has 3,000 people. \nThe community in which I grew up has 300 citizens. My high school class \nwas a class of nine. That school district was educating the children in \nmy school to go out into the workplace and to do things with the kind \nof background they gave us in a different time. And that school \ndistrict still exists, and the school still exists. It is still a very \nsmall school. But now those children that are being educated in that \nschool are going out into the marketplace in a different era. We are \nnow involved in much different kinds of global competition in which we \nare competing against kids in Germany and Japan who are going to school \n240 days a year. Our kids are going to school 180 days a year competing \nwith respect to jobs and economic opportunity. And it is a much \ndifferent world. That ought not suggest that we manage in any way our \nschools differently. The control and the authority and the payment for \nthe schools ought to come from local government and local school \ndistricts and State governments.\n  But the point that is made by the people in the technology area, by \nthe chamber of commerce and elsewhere, is that we are involved in \nglobal competition, and our education system must produce the quality \nof education that meets that competition in order for this country to \nsucceed and to achieve what we want to achieve in the future.\n  That is why it is important for us to be discussing these issues. \nWhat are we getting for our education dollar? And are we achieving with \nour children proficient levels of mathematics in the fourth grade and \neducation in the eighth grade, and how do we measure that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 85, after line 23, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \n     the Secretary of Education shall award the total amount of \n     funds described in subsection (b) directly to local \n     educational agencies in accordance with subsection (d) to \n     enable the local educational agencies to support programs or \n     activities for kindergarten through grade 12 students that \n     the local educational agencies deem appropriate.\n       (b) The total amount of funds referred to in subsection (a) \n     are all funds that are appropriated for the Department of \n     Education under this Act to support programs or activities \n     for kindergarten through grade 12 students, other than--\n       (1) amounts appropriated under this Act--\n       (A) to carry out title VIII of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965;\n       (B) to carry out the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act;\n       (C) to carry out the Adult Education Act;\n       (D) to carry out the Museum and Library Services Act;\n       (E) for departmental management expenses of the Department \n     of Education; or\n       (F) to carry out the Educational Research, Development, \n     Dissemination, and Improvement Act;\n       (G) to carry out the National Education Statistics Act of \n     1994;\n       (H) to carry out section 10601 of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965;\n       (I) to carry out section 2102 of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965; or\n       (J) to carry out part K of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965;\n       (K) to carry out title IV-A-5 of the Higher Education Act; \n     or\n       (2) 50 percent of the amount appropriated under title III \n     under the headings ``Rehabilitation Services and Disability \n     Research'' and ``Vocational and Adult Education''.\n       (c) Each local educational agency shall conduct a census to \n     determine the number of kindergarten through grade 12 \n     students served by the local educational agency not later \n     than 21 days after the beginning of the school year. Each \n     local educational agency shall submit the number of the \n     Secretary.\n       (d) The Secretary shall determine the amount awarded to \n     each local educational agency under this section as follows:\n       (1) First, the Secretary, using the information provided \n     under subsection (c), shall determine a per child amount by \n     dividing the total amount of funds described in subsection \n     (b), by the total number of kindergarten through grade 12 \n     students in all States.\n       (2) Second, the Secretary, using the information provided \n     under subsection (c), shall determine the baseline amount for \n     each local educational agency by multiplying the per child \n     amount determined under paragraph (1) by the number of \n     kindergarten through grade 12 students that are served by the \n     local educational agency.\n       Lastly, the Secretary shall compute the amount awarded to \n     each local educational agency as follows:\n       (A) Multiply the baseline amount determined under paragraph \n     (2) by a factor of 1.1 for local educational agencies serving \n     States that are in the least wealthy quintile of all States \n     as determined by the secretary on the basis of the per capita \n     income of individuals in the States.\n       (B) Multiply the baseline amount by a factor of 1.05 for \n     local educational agencies serving States that are in the \n     second least wealthy such quintile.\n       (C) Multiply the baseline amount by a factor of 1.00 for \n     local educational agencies serving States that are in the \n     third least wealthy such quintile.\n       (D) Multiply the baseline amount by a factor of .95 for \n     local educational agencies serving States that are in the \n     fourth least wealthy such quintile.\n       (E) Multiply the baseline amount by a factor of .90 for \n     local educational agencies serving States that are in the \n     wealthiest such quintile.\n       (4) Nothwithstanding paragraph (3), the Secretary shall \n     compute the amount awarded to each local educational agency \n     serving the States of Alaska or Hawaii by multiplying the \n     base line amount determined under paragraph (2) for the local \n     educational agency by a factor of 1.00.\n       (e) If the total amount of funds made available to carry \n     out this section is insufficient to pay in full all amounts \n     awarded under subsection (d), then the Secretary shall \n     ratably reduce each such amount.\n       (f) If the Secretary determines that a local educational \n     agency has knowingly submitted false information under \n     subsection (c) for the purpose of gaining additional funds \n     under this section, then the local educational agency shall \n     be fined an amount equal to twice the difference between the \n     amount the local educational agency received under subsection \n     (d), and the correct amount the local educational agency \n     would have received if the agency had submitted accurate \n     information under subsection (c).\n       (g) In this section--\n       (1) the term ``local educational agency'' has the meaning \n     given the term in section 14101 of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965;\n       (2) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of \n     Education; and\n       (3) the term ``State'' means each of the several States of \n     the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth \n     of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands, the United States Virgin Islands, \n     the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of \n     Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, for the benefit of the Senator from \nVermont, the modification strikes all references to any departments \nother than those going through the Department of Education, and there \nis a modification with respect to the distribution formula for the \nStates of Alaska and Hawaii, States that have artificially high income \nlevels which do not necessarily reflect the standard of living in those \ntwo very expensive States, and adds one additional minor exception to \nthe scope of the bill.\n  Fundamentally, Mr. President, this amendment is based on the \nphilosophy that the school board members, the administrators, the \nteachers and the parents in communities all across the United States \nare better able to set their educational priorities and to meet their \neducational goals than is the Congress of the United States or \nbureaucrats of the Department of Education. You can't make a telephone \ncall because we tried to call the Congressional Research Service and \nask how many programs there are that support the education of our \nchildren between kindergarten and 12th grade.\n  Instead, they can identify a few programs, large programs, which are \ndevoted exclusively to that purpose, but there are hundreds of others \nwhich do so in part that they cannot identify.\n  Congressman Hoekstra of Michigan, in the House, has identified \napproximately 760 programs funded by the Federal Government directly or \nindirectly affecting the education of our\n\n[[Page S8947]]\n\nchildren between kindergarten and the 12th grade. No one can say how \nmuch of this money actually gets into teaching children as against \npaying for bureaucrats at the Federal level, the State level, the \nschool district level, or the time it takes the teachers to fill out \nall of the forms necessary to meet the auditor's requirements of each \nof these individual programs.\n  The Cato Institute has determined that of the roughly $15 billion \ngoing from the Department of Education for K through 12 programs only \nabout $13 billion gets to local education, but it does not and cannot \nreflect how much the local education agencies have to spend on the \nadministrative requirements of these 760 education programs.\n  So what this bill says is that with certain exceptions, the largest \nand most notable of which are the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act that was debated earlier this year, and impact aid, which \ngoes to school districts with a large Federal presence, for 1 year at \nleast we are going to ignore all of these hundreds of programs and \ntheir specific requirements and all of the bureaucracy in the \nDepartment of Education and simply take the exact number of dollars \nthat are included for those programs in this bill and to distribute \nthem on a per student basis to every school district in the United \nStates. To the best of our ability to do so--and I must confess that in \ndealing with this number of programs, we may have missed some--we are \nspeaking of a little bit more than $11 billion of the appropriations in \nthis bill.\n  We are going to say, instead of our deciding how they ought to be \nspent, instead of our saying that every school district in the country \nhas to meet exactly the same requirements for getting this money, let \nus accept the novel idea to which almost all of us give lip service \nwhen we are at home that maybe the men and women who are dedicated \nenough to run for positions on local school boards, maybe the teachers \nwho are in the classroom every day, perhaps the principals and \nadministrators there can use that $11 billion plus to provide more in \nthe way of educational services than are being provided at the present \ntime. Almost without exception our debates in this Chamber on education \npolicy, when we deal with budget resolutions, when we deal with \nreconciliation bills, when we deal with this appropriations bill, have \nto do with how much money we are going to spend on education. It is the \nfirm view of Members of this body and most of the general public that \nthe more money we spend the better the results will be. And yet we are \nall convinced that the results are not very good. We are disturbed \nenough about it so that we want to create national standards and \nnational tests.\n  I just had a discussion on that subject with the distinguished \nSenator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan]. At the same time I shared with \nthe body the pioneering work my own State of Washington is doing in \nsetting standards and testing students against those standards and the \nhighly disappointing results of the first of those sets of tests this \nyear, that only 22 percent of our fourth grade students meet those \nstandards in mathematics. I am convinced that we ought to talk about \nquality as well as quantity; that simply adding dollars to programs, \nthe net result of which are test results like these and like the others \nwe deprecate all across the country, is not the wisest course of \naction.\n  Last year, the Congress in its wisdom did something that Congresses \nrarely do. We decided that we did not know an awful lot about welfare \nand that maybe 30 years of an increasing nationalization of welfare \npolicy, the net result of which was worsening almost every social \npathology welfare was designed to cure, was not the right course of \naction. And so in essence we said perhaps we should not set all the \nrequirements ourselves. Perhaps we should let 50 States experiment \nbroadly with welfare policy and maybe all of us will learn more about \nwhat works and what does not work.\n  This amendment gives the Senate the opportunity to do just exactly \nthat with our education policies in kindergarten through 12th grade. \nCuriously enough, we seem to have largely accepted that policy with \nrespect to higher education. The great bulk of our higher education \nprograms go directly to students--guaranteed student loans, Pell \ngrants, other means tested aid to students go to the customer, the user \nof educational services rather than to some huge bureaucracy that is \ngiven the power to say what colleges and universities can teach and how \nthey teach it.\n  Now, we know that there are higher educational institutions that do \nnot do a very good job, but our cure has not been to cut off students \nand stop allowing them to make choices. We do allow them to make those \nchoices. Why don't we try in this particular case--this is not a debate \non vouchers and giving money directly to parents, as much as I may \nfavor that. This is a debate about giving the money directly to school \ndistricts, to the professionals who work in the classrooms, to the \namateurs in almost all cases who run for and are elected to school \nboards all across the United States. It is difficult for me to imagine, \nwith three Senators in the Chamber, that the priorities of the school \ndistricts in Rutland, VT, and Portland, OR, and Bellevue, WA, are going \nto be identical. It is impossible for me to justify the amount of \npaperwork that must go into justifying the expenditure of the money for \nthese hundreds and hundreds of programs that go to K through 12 \neducation at the present time, right from the level of the classroom on \nup through the individual school, to school district, to the State \neducation agency, to the U.S. Department of Education.\n\n  Let's take a page out of what we hope will be a successful \ndecentralization of our welfare policy and decentralize decisionmaking \nin our schools. Let our parents through their PTA's, our teachers, our \nschool board members, our principals, decide how to use this $11 \nbillion to educate kids. And then if we can devise it, we can in fact \ncome up with some tests, some standards that they ought to meet and \ntest them against those standards. What we know now is that the money \nis not being spent very well, at least it is not being spent very \nsuccessfully. Let's try temporarily to let someone else make those \ndecisions and see whether we cannot do better.\n  I am convinced that we will do a great deal better.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nVermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I wish to speak against the amendment.\n  I think the desires and the hopes of the Senator from Washington are \ncertainly admirable, but I think if one examines where the problems are \nin education right now the thought that it will be solved by just \ngiving a blank check to the local agencies to correct these problems I \nthink would find itself quite misdirected.\n  First of all, it goes without saying and everybody must recognize \nthat this is probably the grossest exercise of changing the situation \nfrom what is normally considered the authorization process that I have \nseen to date.\n  Now, I do not disagree with the fundamental problem that the Senator \nfrom Washington recognizes, and that is we have an awful problem in \nthis Nation educationally. When 51 percent of the students in this \ncountry graduate functionally illiterate, when we find ourselves \ntrailing way behind other nations in competition for the type of work \nthat is necessary in our country, we know we have a problem. Right now, \nfor instance, we have 190,000 jobs available in this Nation that we \ncannot fill because schools have not produced students with the skills \nto take them, whereas our competitors do not have that problem.\n  But where is the problem? The problem is at the local level because \nthey have not had the guidance from above or whatever to increase the \nmathematical skills and to ensure that we do not push young people \nthrough the school systems by what is called social promotion. Those \nare the big problems. Giving blank checks to the local governments is \nnot going to solve the problems. I would guess it would probably \nexacerbate them.\n  For instance, one of the programs that we have which is more aimed at \nthe problems than anything is the Eisenhower math program. It is \ndesigned to provide professional development. Congressman Goodling, who \nis chairman in the House, and I agree on one thing, that the most \nimportant thing we can do now is to improve the professional \ndevelopment of our teachers. If\n\n[[Page S8948]]\n\nthey don't know what the standards are they should meet in order to \nmeet worldwide competition, then it is difficult to expect that they \nare going to change to meet those standards. The Eisenhower program has \nbeen very successful in the math area, but it is so small that it \ncannot possibly do all the work. If we were to take and throw more \nmoney, if you want to call it throw, into the Eisenhower program and \nthings like that, it might make some sense. But just to give it carte \nblanche to the districts dependent on the wealth, not on the quality of \neducation, this makes a presumption that is not accurate in many cases, \nand that is, the quality of your education will be determined by the \namount of money that is spent; therefore, if you give more money to the \npoor areas, they are going to end up with better education, and if you \ntake it away from the ones with higher expenditures on education, they \nare not going to be hurt. There is no basis for making that kind of \nconclusion.\n\n  Title VI, a block grant, which is chapter 2, is the best hope we have \nfor getting the kind of professional development which Congressman \nGoodling and I agree is the greatest need of this Nation today that \nwould eliminate the money that goes toward that direction of trying to \nmake sure that we improve the ability of our teachers to meet modern \nneeds of our society.\n  You can argue about some of the other programs, but School to Work is \nanother one. School to Work is putting its finger on the basic problem \nin this country, and that is that we do not train our young people for \nwork; we ignore that. The educational institutions, in most cases, are \njust making some progress now with bringing the school into the work \narea and letting them know what the young people need for skills in \norder to get those very well-paying jobs that are out there. School to \nWork is aimed at that. To cut the funding for that and give more money \nto the local agencies to do what they want with it is not going to \nsolve the problems of this Nation.\n  We are going to try to in the Work Force Improvement Act, which we \nwill be moving out of committee very soon, consolidate a lot of these \nprograms that perhaps eat up more money in bureaucracy than they do in \nproducing results. I don't have a problem with that, but that should be \ndone during the reauthorization process. To make such a fundamental \nchange now on an appropriations bill where we would take away from the \nStates--remember, the States distribute title I money and things like \nthat in accordance with not only financial problems, but educational \nneed. This would do away with that aspect and give that role to the \nSecretary of Education. I am amazed to think the Senator from \nWashington would suggest we ought to give the money to the Department \nof Education to distribute. Granted, it is a formula distribution, but \nstill right now it is the States that make the decisions based upon the \neducational need as well as economic need.\n  So I think for all these reasons I would have to strongly oppose this \namendment. I encourage, though, as the Senator from Washington has \ndone, to raise the level of understanding of what the problems of this \nNation are in education. The basic problem is very fundamental, and \nthat is that the schools in this country are not equipped now to handle \nthe demands made upon them by the competition in the world economic \nsituation which requires us to produce kids that have better skills.\n  There is certainly no excuse for allowing young people to go through \nthe school system and come out the other end, like half of our kids do, \nwithout knowing how to read. That is why emphasis is being placed by \nthe administration, myself, Congressman Goodling and others on that. We \nhave to face up to the problem. Facing up to the problem is not going \nto solve it by throwing more money and taking it away from any \ndirection at all, but just giving it to the local school system.\n  I must strongly oppose the amendment of the Senator from Washington, \nbut I do praise him in the sense of raising again the awareness of this \nbody and the Nation to the serious problems we have with education at \nthe local level.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on this subject, it is obvious that \nbetween my friend, the Senator from Vermont, and myself there is a \ngreat gulf to fix. I note just a couple of his phrases. One was ``carte \nblanche.'' The other was the necessity for ``guidance from above.''\n  It is the view of the Senator from Vermont that without ``guidance \nfrom above,'' our teachers, our school board members, our principals \nwon't know what to do, that they will be clueless about the education \nof our children for our 21st century world, and that unless they are \ntold by us, right here in this body, U.S. Senators, what their \npriorities are, how they are going to meet those priorities, and unless \nwe let a group of bureaucrats in the Department of Education, right to \nthe tiniest detail, dictate how Federal money is going to be spent, our \nteachers, school board members, principals and parents won't have the \nslightest idea of how to meet these challenges, and they will waste all \nof this money, it will go for nothing.\n  Well, my golly, if we had been able to show by tests that we have \nbeen overwhelmingly successful, that everyone was doing well, I don't \nsuppose I would be out here now. But one of the other features we are \nalmost certain to authorize, with my conditional approval at least, is \nto come up with a rational way in which to test our students at various \nlevels with respect to their knowledge about the most important of the \nacademic subjects they are in school to learn.\n  My reservations on that is, I have grave fear that national testing \nmay actually drive out more rigid State testing in a number of places \nacross the country. If it encourages even stronger standards, then it \nseems to me that it is a very, very good idea. It is one thing to test, \nbut it is another thing to tell every teacher, ``Here's who you have to \nteach and here is how you have to teach and, by the way, here are all \nthe forms you have to fill out at some point or another during your \nschool day to make absolutely certain you didn't teach the wrong \nstudent and, therefore, disqualify our school district for some of its \ntitle I money.''\n  Obviously, every Member of this body who believes that he or she \nknows more about educational priorities than do his school board \nmembers, his teachers, his or her parents should certainly vote against \nan amendment like this. If Members are content, Mr. President, with \nbetween 700 and 760 different education programs coming out of probably \nfive or six different Departments of the U.S. Government, each with its \nown requirement and its own forms to fill out, if they believe that is \na satisfactory way to do things, fine, they should vote for the status \nquo.\n  I have more trust in the American people. I have more trust in the \npeople who give up their time without compensation to serve on school \nboards and in parent-teachers associations. I have more trust in the \nteachers that we have in the schools themselves. I think they will do a \nbetter job with the money. I think we will get better education. Of \ncourse, anyone can have a quarrel with the formula for distribution, \nwhich is a rough formula giving slightly more money to poor States or \nschool districts in poor States than it does to school districts in \nwealthy States. But I believe I can make this representation, Mr. \nPresident. It will be difficult to find a school district anywhere in \nthe United States that doesn't have more money for the actual education \nof its students under this formula than it does at the present time. \nWhy? Because at the present time, a whole bunch of this money, hundreds \nof millions of dollars, gets taken out right here in Washington, DC, by \nthe bureaucracy. More hundreds of millions of dollars get taken out by \nthe State educational entities, and tremendous burdens, nonteaching \nburdens, are imposed on local schools, school districts and teachers in \nkeeping track of all of it and filling out the forms. So the most \ndisfavored school districts under this formula will actually get more \nmoney to put into the education of their students than they do at the \npresent time.\n  I will be the first to admit, Mr. President, that on the floor of the \nSenate, this is a brand new and a radical proposal. I would be \nsurprised if it became\n\n[[Page S8949]]\n\nlaw as a part of this appropriations bill. But, Mr. President, we are \n10 years past due in discussing this subject. It is time we did here \nwhat we say we want to do when we are at home. I can't speak for every \nother Senator, but I know that one of the most popular statements I can \nmake at a town meeting or to any group in the State of Washington is, \n``I believe you, through your schools right here, should have more say \nas to how you spend the money that goes into educating your children.'' \nPrincipals approve of it, school board members approve of it, teachers \napprove of it, parents approve of it, the taxpaying public approves of \nit.\n  I would be willing to make a small wager that, in general terms, \nalmost every Member of this body makes the same speech under \nappropriate circumstances in his or her own State when he or she is \nasked about that question. ``Yes, I believe in local control of \nschools. Yes, I believe in locally elected school boards. Yes, I \nbelieve decisions can be made better close to the student, but * * *'' \nUsually they don't articulate the ``but.'' ``But'' comes back here when \nthey actually vote in a manner totally contrary to the way in which \nthey speak at home.\n  So this provides a simple opportunity, Mr. President, an opportunity \nto say whether you really do believe that educational policy, that \nmoney for education is likely to be spent more wisely and more \neffectively by those who are in the field doing it professionally, \nmeeting with their students every day, or whether, in the phrase of the \nSenator from Vermont, they need ``guidance from above,'' guidance from \nright here in these seats, because otherwise, a carte blanche will \nresult in educational disaster.\n  I hope Members will give serious consideration to this philosophy. \nThis may be the first time we have discussed this in the form of an \namendment like this in a number of years, but I do not think, Mr. \nPresident, it is going to be the last time. I believe we will discuss \nthe general philosophy of this proposal, at least, increasingly until \nthe time that we are willing in fact to place a degree of trust in \nlocal educational authorities that we all say we have in theory.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I will make a couple more comments here.\n  Let us just think about what would happen if we did this, what it \nwould do for education. All of a sudden, without any qualifications or \nrequirements, or anything else, if we were to send checks to our local \ngovernments, with a hope they would spend it on education--I know what \nwould happen in my State.\n  We have just gone through property tax reform. Everybody is up in \narms over the cost to the local governments from property tax reform. I \nbet if you were to do it, this would end up in property tax relief. \nMaybe that is a good thing. Maybe it is a good thing to relieve the \nlocal property tax in communities around the country. But it is not \ngoing to tackle or do anything to solve the very basic problems we have \nin education. There is nothing in here that would in any way determine \nthat the local governments are going to spend it on education.\n  Now, ``above'' can mean the superintendent of a region, they are \nknocked out. The State's school system has no control or no suggestions \nin any way how to spend this money. We are just sending checks to the \nlocal communities and saying, ``Gee, we would kind of like you to spend \nthis on education, but there's no requirement, or you can say you do, \nbut then you just cut yours back and you spend this money on education, \nbut you cut back on the local money, on what you're spending on \neducation now, and you can cut your property taxes.'' It might be very \npopular. I think it would be. I expect it would sell very well with the \ntaxpayers of local communities saying, ``Wow, finally we can start \ngoing down on the cost of education in this community.''\n  Will it benefit the students? Not at all. This is, again, \nauthorization of the grossest kind in the appropriations process.\n  So I say to Members that this is one area where we have huge needs \ntrying to change what is going on in this country in education, to \nraise the levels to be able to meet international competition, to make \nsure we are not embarrassed again as we have been for years now on \ninternational tests with our young people, especially in math and \nscience. We know we have to make changes. Anyone here who believes that \njust throwing money at the local communities is going to bring about \nthese kinds of changes, I do not think you will find anyone who can \nconsider this is seriously the way to go.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished occupant of the chair, the junior Senator from Oregon, be \nadded as a cosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, that is a truly incredible statement on \nthe part of the Senator from Vermont. In the first place, of course, \nthis amendment does not give this money to local governments. It gives \nit to local education authorities, that is, school boards and school \ndistricts. Evidently the Senator from Vermont feels that his own \nconstituents have so little regard for education in the State of \nVermont that they would immediately cut their contribution to the \neducation of their children by the amount of the distribution to those \nlocal school boards. I would be ashamed to make that comment about the \npeople of the State of Washington. I cannot imagine that that would \nhappen.\n  Moreover, Mr. President, the Senator seems to forget that at least a \nsignificant part of this money is in the educational system at the \npresent time. It is my view that just not enough of it gets there, that \ntoo much of it gets siphoned by the bureaucrats on the way to a school \ndistrict in Vermont or in Oregon or in the State of Washington. But to \nmake the statement that only we are wise and only 100 Members of the \nU.S. Senate are really concerned about education and that, if we were \nto allow a local school agency to set its own priorities with the money \nwe appropriated to education, that they might not do it, that they \nwould just simply decide, ``Oh, no, education isn't very important. We \ncan now cut down our own contribution level,'' is insulting, I would \nsay, Mr. President, to every citizen of the United States who cares \nabout his or her children or his or her country or their future.\n  This money is going into education now. That is why we are \nappropriating it. Too much of it is going to a bureaucracy and not \ngetting to the children who are being educated. Too many priorities are \nbeing set here, and too few at home. That is what the question is \nabout.\n  Mark my words, Mr. President, successful or unsuccessful, if this \namendment passes, more money--not less--more money will get into the \neducation of almost every student in the United States of America. The \nfundamental question is not how much; the fundamental question is, who \nought to make the decision as to how it is spent? We here in this body, \ngreat educational experts as we seem to think we are, or the people who \nare actually providing the teaching in the day-to-day operations of our \nschools?\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to yield the floor to the \ndistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee who needs some time \nhere to take up another issue, but just quickly before I do that, I do \nwant to congratulate the Senator from Washington, Senator Gorton, for \nhis proposal here, because it has highlighted what is the core debate \nin the issue of education, which has been raised in part by the \nPresident.\n  This administration's approach to education is about the same as it \nhas approached campaign finance reform--talks one game; does another \ngame. Basically, the purpose of almost all the\n\n[[Page S8950]]\n\nmajor initiatives that have come out of this administration on the \nissue of education have been to encourage and strengthen the control of \nthe Federal Government over the process of educating children. Every \ninitiative that seems to come out of this administration seems to have \nbeen drawn up in the bowels of the major labor unions, major teaching \nunions here in Washington, the purpose of which appears to be the \nfundamental goal of moving the control of education out of the local \ncommunities and into the Federal sector, out of the hands of the \nparents, out of the hands of the teachers, out of the hands of the \nschool systems at the local level, into the hands of the Federal \nbureaucracy, into the hands of the big labor unions centered here in \nWashington.\n  Their education initiatives can almost all be characterized as having \nthat as their basic philosophical groundwork, whether it happens to be \ntheir initial proposal on Goals 2000, which luckily was amended so that \nthat did not happen, or their initial proposal on national educational \ntesting, which the President has now backed off of because the country \nhas been alarmed by it and which he is changing.\n  What Senator Gorton's proposal does is say, ``Let's end it right \nhere. Let's return to the local folks, people who control the \neducational process, people who should be involved in the educational \nprocess, specifically, the parents, the teachers, the principals, local \nschool boards, the capacity to manage the money we have the Federal \nGovernment presently controling. Let's end this huge bureaucracy which \nis draining off billions of dollars annually from the students of this \ncountry, turning it over to a class of individuals whose basic goal is \nto perpetuate their own careers versus perpetuating better education. \nLet's put an end to that. Let's give the dollars right to the schools. \nLet's let the schools, the parents, the teachers and the principals \nmake the decision.''\n  It really should not be a unique or radical idea. It should be a very \ncommon, very appropriate idea. But in the context of the strange \nthought process which dominates the beltway, it appears to be a radical \nidea.\n  Actually, I congratulate the Senator from Washington, Senator Gorton, \nfor putting forward this initiative. I think it is going to generate a \nvery huge and positive debate of the question of where the control of \neducation should be. I look forward to participating in that debate. \nBut I do not wish to take further time from the Senator from Delaware. \nTherefore, I yield the floor at this point.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1091\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the McCain amendment on \ngraduate medical education, amendment No. 1091. I oppose it, although I \nam sure it is well-intentioned. I believe this amendment is not \nappropriate on this bill. I also believe the amendment is based on some \nmisunderstandings.\n  But first, as a general rule, I do oppose any amendments on \nappropriations bills designed or related to Medicare or any other \nmatter that we dealt with in the Balanced Budget Act. Some of these \namendments may seem noncontroversial or even desirable; however, it is \nsimply not appropriate to begin loading up important appropriations \nlegislation with amendments unrelated to the underlying bill.\n  Let us remember the ink is hardly dry on the Balanced Budget Act. If \nwe begin the process of reopening this legislation, I assure you there \nwill be no end to other amendments.\n  Many of these amendments will likely affect matters important to \nother Members and their States.\n  Then there is the matter of good faith. A provision in the McCain \namendment would strike a House provision we accepted in the conference \non BBA. I am sure there are many Senate provisions the House would like \nto strike.\n  Mr. President, I will briefly comment on the substance of the McCain \namendment. The McCain amendment eliminates funding for a program that \nwould provide assistance to teaching hospitals that voluntarily choose \nto downsize their residency programs. The funds provided through this \nprogram will partially cushion the financial losses teaching hospitals \nwill incur as they reduce the number of doctors in training.\n  Members should know that Medicare does not simply pay teaching \nhospitals for training but rather for care given to Medicare patients. \nThese funds do not reimburse hospitals for doing nothing, as some \nclaim. Far from it. Hospitals will use their funds to hire staff \ndoctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and other personnel \nto replace the residents. These funds will also help teaching \nhospitals, often the Nation's best hospitals, to adjust to a highly \ncompetitive health care marketplace and develop alternate means of \ncaring for vulnerable uninsured patients.\n  One last point. The provision that the McCain amendment would strike \nsaves at least $380 million in Medicare over the next 5 years, \naccording to CBO. Let me emphasize this important point. Medicare will \nactually save money as we help the Nation's teaching hospitals. The \nMcCain amendment would add to the deficit by almost $400 million \nbecause no offset is provided.\n  Mr. President, once again, I urge Members to oppose the McCain \namendment on graduate medical education.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to support my revered and \nrespected chairman in this regard. It is the case, sir, that 5 \nlegislative days ago we passed this measure. It is a measure which \noriginated in the House and in a good faith exchange in conference the \nSenate accepted it, the conferees did. There were three of us--Mr. \nLott, the chairman, and myself. The bill passed Congress in a spending \nmeasure that was appropriate to the occasion.\n  Now, first, although it is not technical, it is so profoundly \nimportant. This is legislation on an appropriations bill. It is the \nancient wisdom of this body not to do such things. A point of order \nwould obviously lie against the amendment. It is important. It is how \nwe proceed in this body.\n  Further, sir, on the merits of this matter, I, for my part, would \nhave to say I would like to see how this works. This is a 5-year \nperiod. I can attest, and I know that my colleague from New York and \nour chairman would agree, the Finance Committee has been seized with \nthis subject. As the medical care system of our country becomes more \nrationalized, as economists would put it, as price considerations enter \ninto markets and decisions are made, and health maintenance \norganizations rise and you see all manner of mergers and acquisitions \nand the general evidence of a market which is good, you also find \nyourself with some of those effects which are common which involve \ninstitutions or desirable behaviors that markets do not provide.\n  In the profession of economics, they are known as public goods. \nEverybody benefits from public goods so nobody will pay for them. If \nyou want them, you have to find them in a public mode. That is why we \nhave public schools. That is why we have, come to think about it, why \nwe have the Marine Corps. These are public goods that you have to \nprovide for in the collective mode.\n  In 1994, as the Finance Committee was considering the health care \nlegislation sent to us by the administration we found ourselves more \nand more interested in the question of medical schools. In this new \nworld, who takes care of these special institutions which have high \nprices? They have high prices because they have high costs. They have \nhigh costs because they are teaching.\n\n  We had a wonderful exchange and I am sure the chairman recalls it. \nOne morning a witness from Fordham University, an ethicist, Father \nCharles J. Fahey said, ``What I am seeing is the ``commodification'' of \nmedicine--a wonderful phrase. The then head of the UCLA Medical Center, \nRaymond G. Schultze, said at another hearing ``Can I give you an \nexample? In southern California we now have a spot market for bone \nmarrow transplants.''\n  All that is something that is to be welcomed. It is happening anyway, \ngoing to happen in whatever market for medical care, and we have to \nprovide some nonmarket provisions for these singular institutions, \nthese great teaching hospitals, in the great age of\n\n[[Page S8951]]\n\nmedical science. In the history of the species it is only in the last \n40 or 50 years--40 some say, 50 radicals would say--that medicine has \nreally been able to do something. It is learning exponentially, \nlearning by the hour.\n  In this situation there can be a surplus of some doctors generally, \nof some specialists in particular, some judgments need to be made, and \nthis transition needs to be made.\n  As I understood the legislation, I think the chairman would agree, we \nwere proposing a 5-year transition period to see whether we did not get \ngood results--we will not know in the next 5 years, at least--to save \nmoney.\n  It has a clear and necessary purpose. On both grounds, Mr. President, \nI rise to join the chairman. First of all this is legislation on an \nappropriation bill, which we must not have. Secondly, this is a measure \nthat was included in the Balanced Budget Act only just this moment, and \nit is in response to a real life situation in an open experimental \nmode. In 5 year's time we will know more, and I plead--this is a \nsubject that will not go away. We will be debating this matter, the \nmatter of teaching hospitals and medical schools on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate for a quarter century to come.\n  I join the chairman in proposing that we not approve this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I am pleased to have the opportunity to \njoin with the distinguished ranking member and the senior Senator from \nNew York, the ranking member on Finance and the chairman of Finance, \nthe distinguished Senator from Delaware, in opposing the McCain \namendment.\n  Let me say that the rhetoric is rather fascinating, the rhetoric that \nis used in support of this amendment, that we are paying for something \nthat we are not getting. The fact of the matter is that it totally \nignores the reality that teaching hospitals that administer to the \npoorest of the poor, that provide training for our Nation's doctors, \nthat provide medical services to those who would otherwise in many \ncases find it difficult to get those services, will actually be saving \nthe taxpayer money as a result of the legislation that has been \nenacted, a legislation which the amendment that we are now discussing \nwould strike down.\n  The fact is the Congressional Budget Office as recently as this \nmorning has scored the McCain proposal as one that would cost the \nTreasury $350 million. So it is rather disingenuous to say that we are \npaying for something, in the rhetoric which is used, to suggest that \n``Government rationing of medical training, ultimately the rationing of \nhealth care, smacks of socialism, not democracy'' does not recognize \nthe problem that exists.\n  It costs approximately $100,000 a year. That is what the Government \nis paying, for every resident who is employed at the various hospitals \nthroughout the country. There is a recognition that there is an \noversupply. So the Congress, with the administration, developed a \nformat whereby over a period of time, hospitals would reduce the number \nof doctors and would actually be then saving the Government $350 \nmillion.\n  Now, if we want to continue business as usual, want to continue \nsubsidizing the oversupply, then we strike this amendment. That is what \nthe Senator would be doing. What he would be doing is absolutely in \ncontravention of what good planning and what good medical practice and \nwhat is in the best interests of the taxpayer--allow this amount to \ngradually go down in the number of doctors who are being trained.\n  Now, I understand the Senator from Arizona has asked for the ability \nto debate this measure later in a fuller context and would like an hour \nequally divided. At that point in time I hope the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, Senator Domenici, would raise a point of order \nagainst the amendment pursuant to section 302(f) of the Budget Act \nbecause that point of order, in my opinion, lies, it is proper, and \nwould request a ruling of the Chair. I am not going to do that. I hope \nwe would have the chairman of the Budget Committee review this as to \nwhether or not technologically this would cost the taxpayers $350 \nmillion and there is no offset provided.\n  Now, do we really want to say we want to knock out a program that \nwill reduce the number of doctors and save the taxpayers of this \ncountry close to half a billion dollars? That is what the McCain \namendment would do, as well-intentioned as it might be. And believe me, \nI do not question the Senator's intentions. I think he has a legitimate \npoint.\n  Are we paying for something that we are not getting? I think the fact \nis we are going to be reducing the supply and we will be saving $350 \nmillion but we are doing it in an orderly manner. We are allowing those \nwho are on the battlefield, those who are providing services for the \nneediest of the needy, for those who do not have adequate health \ninsurance, those people who would otherwise not receive the kinds of \nmedical services and high quality, they are in our inner core cities \nthroughout our Nation because those are the hospitals in most cases \nthat will be affected, the great institutions in our metropolitan \ncommunities throughout this country.\n  It makes no sense, it seems to me, to knock out a program that will \ndeprive us of the opportunity of seeing an orderly downsizing, and, \nyes, save taxpayers money at the same time.\n  I join in opposition to this amendment and I commend the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee from Delaware and my distinguished colleague from \nNew York, Senator Moynihan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1076\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I should now like to turn to Amendment 1076, \noffered by the Senator from Washington. I must oppose this amendment \nwhich alters the complexion of the newly created State children's \nhealth insurance program. The appropriations bill is simply not the \nvehicle for reopening the Balanced Budget Act. The amendment raised \nissues which should be addressed for all States, not just a few. Barely \na month has passed since the bill was enacted. This is not the time to \nreopen the balanced budget amendment.\n  Mr. President, as reported out of the conference with the House, it \nis clear that the fundamental purpose of the new $24 billion children's \nhealth program is to expand health insurance coverage for children who \ndo not presently have health insurance.\n  Under the new children's health program, the Federal Government will \nincrease its share of the cost of providing public insurance in some \nStates by as much as 30 percent. This so-called enhanced match is to \nact as an incentive to expand coverage to more children. And, indeed, \nthat is what we all expect will happen.\n  At the same time, we do not want to simply shift new costs to the \nFederal Government to provide services to individuals who are already \ncovered by insurance whether through the private sector or the public \nsector. Nor should these funds be used to merely supplant State funds. \nAt the very least, we should try to minimize this from happening.\n  As the Senate considered the children's health legislation over the \nsummer, it limited eligibility to 200 percent of the Federal poverty \nlevel. The Senate was gravely concerned, and rightly so, about the \ncrowding out effect in which public insurance would replace private \ninsurance.\n  But States which had already expanded eligibility above 200 percent \nof poverty argued that they would not be able to use their new child \nhealth allotment because of this limitation. There would be no children \nto cover, they argued.\n  In deference to those States, we agreed to raise the eligibility \nlimit to 50 percentage points above a State's Medicaid standard in the \nconference with the House. We also provided States with options for \nparticipating in the program above their current levels.\n  The Gorton amendment is not about States expanding coverage for \nchildren beyond their current commitment. It is about claiming \nadditional Federal dollars to do what the States have already agreed to \ndo.\n  This is an important issue which should not be determined after a few \nminutes of debate on an appropriations bill.\n  Furthermore, the amendment would create another inequity which should \nbe carefully considered and addressed, if necessary.\n\n[[Page S8952]]\n\n  The Gorton amendment applies to only a handful of States which have \npreviously expanded coverage to children. The Gorton amendment applies \nonly to those States which have expanded Medicaid at least up to 200 \npercent of the poverty level and up to age 17. These States are to be \ncongratulated for their leadership. But there are also at least 20 \nother States which have also expanded Medicaid eligibility, which would \nnot gain the advantage extended by the Gorton amendment.\n  While the amendment provides the enhanced match for total expansion, \nit does not provide the same advantage for those States which have made \nonly a partial expansion. For example, a state which has expanded to \n185 percent of the poverty level would not be eligible for the enhanced \nmatch for new children up to that level.\n  Creating such inequities illustrates a fundamental problem with using \nthe appropriations process for legislating in place of the authorizing \ncommittees. While perhaps a problem might be solved for a few States, \nthat solution might create new inequities among several more States.\n  If the policies in the new children's health program should be \nchanged, then let us examine the issue in a thorough and complete \nmanner which is equitable for all States. But we cannot and should not \nattempt to do so today.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President----\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. ROTH. If the Senator will yield, I ask unanimous consent that \nconsideration of Senate Resolution 120 begin following the remarks of \nthe distinguished senior Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise simply and succinctly for the \npurpose of endorsing the statement by our revered chairman and, once \nagain, to say, as he put it, the ink is scarcely dry on this \nlegislation and here we are changing it. Could it have been 5 \nlegislative days since it was last enacted, and we are changing it?\n  And, importantly, this is legislation on an appropriations bill. It \nis not in the interest of our institution to let that begin. It is a \nlesson we have learned in difficult ways in the 19th century, and we \nhave shown how important it has been in this century. As we approach a \nnew century, it is no precedent to establish.\n  I believe we will now move to the measure indicated by the Senator \nfrom Delaware.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/09/senate-section/article/S8945-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8952-S8958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE DEATH OF MOTHER TERESA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 120) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate on the occasion of the death of Mother Teresa of \n     Calcutta.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am here today to address the \nresolution introduced in the Senate by the Senator from Oklahoma on \nMother Teresa. Last week, we lost a saint when Mother Teresa passed \naway at age 87. We are poorer, but Heaven is richer.\n  She died owning, as I have read in the news accounts, very few things \nhere. She owned about two pairs of sandals, three robes, rosary beads. \nThat was here. But in Heaven, she has a mountain of gold. She had \ntouched so many different lives on this Earth. It is an incredible \ndefinition of a successful life: a loving, caring, compassionate, \nselfless, child of God, caring for, in many cases, the most downtrodden \nof God's children. Would that I could live my life as well.\n  I have been struck by some of her writings and things that she has \nspoken about. They have been accumulated in different books. Some of \nthe statements are absolutely precious. I want to give a couple of them \nhere in the Senate today because I think they are so touching of \nindicative of what a successful life is. A successful day isn't \nnecessarily when you pass a bill in the Senate, or that you have a \nsuccessful business transaction, or you pass a test, or you win a game. \nBut a successful day is when you positively touch another life. She did \nthat thousands of times, millions of times, across this globe. She \ncared for the poorest of the poor. She said this at one point in time:\n\n       I see God in every human being. When I wash the leper's \n     wounds, I feel I am nursing the Lord himself. Is it not a \n     beautiful experience?\n\n  Imagine if each of us, every day, if we saw everything that we did as \nnursing and touching the Lord himself. Here she is talking about caring \nfor the least of God's children in that way, and she sees it as serving \nthe Lord himself. What about us here in the Senate? If we did something \nsimilarly, saw ourselves as touching other lives in the most positive \nway we possibly could, what sort of world would that make?\n\n  Think of another quote that she gave in one of her speeches where she \nsaid this:\n\n       Our mission is to convey God's love--not a dead God but a \n     living God, a God of love.\n\n  And then she added:\n\n       I am just a little pencil in his hand.\n\n  But what a beautiful picture he drew with that little pencil. What if \neach of us looked at ourselves as that little pencil, but being used to \ndraw a beautiful picture, a panorama for others to see and to be able \nto enjoy, and for others to be able to grow by, for others to be able \nto be loved by that picture that we draw.\n  I have this quote posted in my office, which I think particularly is \napropos giving her just passing this week:\n\n       At the moment of death, we will not be judged by the amount \n     of work we have done, but by the weight of love we have put \n     into our work.\n\n  You just think about that in measuring each day, not by the success \nof whether or not we did things like a bill passing through or, again, \nwhether we passed a test, but by the weight of love that we put into \nour actions and what we actually did that very day and how we touched \npeople. Did we do it in a positive, loving fashion? Would that the \nworld operated that way.\n  My own experiences with Mother Teresa were here in the Senate. The \nonly time that I had a chance to meet her was when she came here and \nreceived the congressional gold medal this year. We were all nervous \nabout whether she would actually be able to physically get here because \nshe had been ill, in poor health. She was able to make it here and she \nshared an hour and a half with us here in the House and in the Senate, \nin the rotunda area, meeting with different people. I remember so much \ngoing through that experience and thinking of reading these quotes, \nthese pearls of wisdom she had laid out on how to live life, thinking \nshe was going to put forward another one that day. I was holding onto \neach word to see, is there going to be another line like ``I am just a \nlittle pencil that you can guide one's life by.'' But it didn't seem to \ncome that day. She would talk about a number of different things, but \nthere, seemingly, were no pearls.\n  Then I remember walking her out to the car, and there were throngs of \npeople excited to see her as she waved and touched different people. \nThe motorcade was waiting to get away. She was sitting in the car, and \nI went over to thank her one last time for coming in and honoring us by \nbeing here and receiving the presentation. She grabbed my hand with \nboth of hers and stared at me with those deep eyes of hers and that \nlittle frame that she had, and she looked up at me and just said three \nwords, and she said them four times. She said:\n\n       All for Jesus.\n\n  We can all have different faiths and views of the world, but that was \na driving focus for her, serving her Lord. How she did it each day is a \ntestimony to each of us of how we should live.\n  We lost a saint, but the tragedy isn't that she died; the tragedy \nwould have been had she never lived. She lived fully and gave us so \nmuch in raising our consciousness, lowering our line of sight, and \nredefining compassion for an entire planet. For that, I thank her and I \nam thankful for her life. I think we\n\n[[Page S8953]]\n\nshould all consider and contemplate what we can add to our own lives by \nthe model that she gave.\n  So I am delighted to support this resolution of recognition for \nMother Teresa for all that she has done for this world and for the \nexample she has lived.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask unanimous consent Senator Ashcroft be added as \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am pleased to sponsor this resolution \nwith Senator Lott, Senator Daschle, Senator Brownback, and Senator \nHutchinson.\n  I want to compliment Senator Brownback for his outstanding statement, \nand also thank Senator Brownback and Senator Hutchinson for their work \nto award Mother Teresa the Congressional Gold Medal. Earlier this year, \nwhen she spoke to both the House and the Senate, and, frankly, to the \ncountry, we had a real honor, a real pleasure, maybe of seeing a real \nsaint in our presence.\n  I have had the pleasure of greeting Mother Teresa two or three times \nin my Senate career: Once in 1985, when she received the Presidential \nMedal of Freedom, and then also when she addressed the National Prayer \nBreakfast, I believe it was in 1994.\n  At the conclusion of my remarks, Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record Mother Teresa's statement, her \nspeech to the National Prayer Breakfast. It was an outstanding speech; \na moving speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, Senator Brownback used the word \n``saint.'' And I can't recall too many living individuals that I ever \nreferred to as a saint. But I remember during Mother Teresa's life, \nafter meeting her in 1985 and subsequent to her speech at the National \nPrayer Breakfast, I referred to her as ``a living saint.''\n  The very fact is that her life touched other lives in letting them \nknow that they are loved by God. Looking at her speeches and at her \nstatements, she truly did make this world a better place. She did love \npeople who were downtrodden. She did love the people that no one else \nwould love. She did reach out to protect all individuals. Her love for \nthe ailing and for the sick is well known. Her love for the unborn is \nwell known. In her speeches at the National Prayer Breakfast, she was \ntalking about abortion and what a terrible cruelty it is. Then she \nended up, and concluding said, ``Well, send me your children. If you do \nnot want your child, I will take your child.'' Again we are talking \nabout a real missionary of love.\n  So, Mr. President, it is with sadness that we note Mother Teresa's \npassing. But we did want to recognize her great contributions to \nmankind throughout the world.\n  And so it is with a sense of sadness that the Senate today will be \nvoting on this after lunch today, but we wanted to recognize the \nwonderful expression of love that Mother Teresa of Calcutta has had and \nthe impact she has had on our lives, and really the lives of countless \npeople throughout the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n        Whatever You Did Unto One of the Least, You Did Unto Me\n\n                     (By Mother Teresa of Calcutta)\n\n       On the last day, Jesus will say to those at his right hand,\n       ``Come, enter the Kingdom. For I was hungry and you gave me \n     food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was sick and you \n     visited me.''\n       Then Jesus will turn to those on his left hand and say.\n       ``Depart from the because I was hungry and you did not feed \n     me, I was thirsty and you did not give me drink, I was sick \n     and you did not visit me.''\n       These will ask him,\n       ``When did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or sick, and did \n     not come to your help?''\n       And Jesus will answer them,\n       ``Whatever you neglected to do unto one of the least of \n     these, you neglected to do unto me!''\n       As we have gathered here to pray together, I think it will \n     be beautiful if we begin with a prayer that expresses very \n     well what Jesus wants us to do for the least. St. Francis of \n     Assisi understood very well these words of Jesus and his life \n     is very well expressed by a prayer. And this prayer, which we \n     say every day after Holy Communion, always surprises me very \n     much, because it is very fitting for each one of us. And I \n     always wonder whether eight hundred years ago when St. \n     Francis lived, they had the same difficulties that we have \n     today. I think that some of you already have this prayer of \n     peace, so we will pray it together.\n       Let us thank God for the opportunity he has given us today \n     to have come here to pray together. We have come here \n     especially to pray for peace, joy, and love. We are reminded \n     that Jesus came to bring the good news to the poor. He had \n     told us what that good news is when he said,\n       ``My peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you.''\n       He came not to give the peace of the world, which is only \n     that we don't bother each other. He came to give peace of \n     heart which comes from loving--from doing good to others.\n       And God loved the world so much that he gave his son. God \n     gave his son to the Virgin Mary, and what did she do with \n     him? As soon as Jesus came into Mary's life, immediately she \n     went in haste to give that good news. And as she came into \n     the house of her cousin, Elizabeth, Scripture tells us that \n     the unborn child--the child in the womb of Elizabeth--leapt \n     with joy. While still in the womb of Mary, Jesus brought \n     peace to John the Baptist, who leapt for joy in the womb \n     of Elizabeth.\n       And as if that were not enough--as if it were not enough \n     that God the Son should become one of us and bring peace and \n     joy while still in the womb, Jesus also died on the Cross to \n     show that greater love. He died for you and me, and for the \n     leper and for that man dying of hunger and that naked person \n     lying in the street--not only of Calcutta, but of Africa, of \n     everywhere. Our Sisters serve these poor people in 105 \n     countries throughout the world. Jesus insisted that we love \n     one another as he loves each one of us. Jesus gave his life \n     to love us, and he tells us that he loves each one of us. \n     Jesus gave his live to love us, and he tells us that we also \n     have to give whatever it takes to do good to one another. And \n     in the Gospel Jesus says very clearly, ``Love as I have loved \n     you.''\n       Jesus died on the Cross because that is what it took for \n     him to do good for us--to save us from our selfishness and \n     sin. He gave us everything to do the Father's will, to show \n     us that we too must be willing to give everything to do God's \n     will, to love one another as he loves each of us. If we are \n     not willing to give whatever it takes to do good for one \n     another, sin is still in us. That is why we too must give to \n     each other until it hurts.\n       Love always hurts.\n       It is not enough for us to say, ``I love God.'' But I also \n     have to love my neighbor. St. John says that you are a liar \n     if you say you love God and you don't love your neighbor. How \n     can you love God whom you do not see, if you do not love your \n     neighbor whom you see, whom you touch, with whom you live? \n     And so it is very important for us to realize that love, to \n     be true, has to hurt. I must be willing to give whatever it \n     takes not to harm other people and, in fact, to do good to \n     them. This requires that I be willing to give until it hurts. \n     Otherwise, there is no love in me and I bring injustice, not \n     peace, to those around me.\n       It hurt Jesus to love us. We have been created in his image \n     for greater things, to love and to be loved. We must ``put on \n     Christ,'' as Scripture tells us. And so we have been created \n     to love as he loves us. Jesus makes himself the hungry one, \n     the naked one, the homeless one, the unwanted one, and he \n     says, ``You did it to me.'' On the last day he will say to \n     those on his right, ``whatever you did the least of these, \n     you did to me,'' and he will also say to those on his left, \n     ``whatever you neglected to do for the least of these, you \n     neglected to do it for me.''\n       When he was dying on the Cross, Jesus said, ``I thirst.'' \n     Jesus is thirsting for our love, and this is the thirst for \n     everyone, poor and rich alike. We all thirst for the love of \n     others, that they do out of their way to avoid harming us and \n     to do good to us. This is the meaning of true love, to give \n     until it hurts.\n       I can never forget the experience I had in visiting a home \n     where they kept all these old parents of sons and daughters \n     who had just put them into an institution and, maybe, \n     forgotten them. I saw that in that home these old people had \n     everything: good food, comfortable place, television--\n     everything. But everyone was looking toward the door. And I \n     did not see a single one with a smile on his face.\n       I turned to Sister and I asked, ``Why do these people, who \n     have every comfort here--why are they all looking toward the \n     door? Why are they not smiling? '' (I am so used to seeing \n     the smiles on our people.'' Even the dying ones smile.) And \n     Sister said, ``This is the way it is, nearly everyday. They \n     are epxecting--they are hoping--that a son or daughter will \n     come to visit them. They are hurt because they are \n     forgotten.''\n       See, this neglect to love brings spiritual poverty. Maybe \n     in our family we have somebody who is feeling lonely, who is \n     feeling sick, who is feeling worried. Are we there? Are we \n     willing to give until it hurts, in order to be with our \n     families? Or do we put our own interests first? These are the \n     questions we must ask ourselves, especially as we begin this \n     Year of the Family. We must remember that love begins at \n     home, and we\n\n[[Page S8954]]\n\n     must also remember that ``the future of humanity passes \n     through the family.''\n       I was surprised in the West to see so many young boys and \n     girls given to drugs. And I tried to find out why. Why is it \n     like that, when those in the West have so many more things \n     than those in the East? And the answer was, ``Because there \n     is no one in the family to receive them.'' Our children \n     depend on us for everything: their health, their nutrition, \n     their security, their coming to know and love God. For all of \n     this, they look to us with trust, hope, and expectation. But \n     often father and mother are so busy that they have no time \n     for their children, or perhaps they are not even married, or \n     have given up on their marriage. So the children go to the \n     streets, and get involved in drugs, or other things. We are \n     talking of love of the child, which is where love and peace \n     must begin. There are the things that break peace.\n       But I feel that the greatest destroyer of peace today is \n     abortion, because it is a war against the child--a direct \n     killing of the innocent child--murder by the mother herself. \n     And if we accept that a mother can kill even her own child, \n     how can we tell other people not to kill one another? How do \n     we persuade a woman not to have an abortion? As always, we \n     must persuade her with love, and we remind ourselves that \n     love means to be willing to give until it hurts. Jesus gave \n     even his life to love us. So the mother who is thinking of \n     abortion, should be helped to love--that is, to give until it \n     hurts her plans, or her free time, to respect the life of her \n     child. The father of that child, whoever he is, must also \n     give until it hurts. By abortion, the mother does not learn \n     to love, but kills even her own child to solve her problems. \n     And by abortion, the father is told that he does not have to \n     take any responsibility at all for the child he has brought \n     into the world. That father is likely to put other women into \n     the same trouble. So abortion just leads to more abortion. \n     Any country that accepts abortion is not teaching the people \n     to love, but to use any violence to get what they want. That \n     is why the greatest destroyer of love and peace is abortion.\n       Many people are very, very concerned with the children of \n     India, with the children of Africa, where quite a few die of \n     hunger, and so on. Many people are also concerned about all \n     the violence in this great country of the United States. \n     These concerns are very good. But often these same people are \n     not concerned with the millions who are being killed by the \n     deliberate decision of their own mothers. And this is what is \n     the greatest destroyer of peace today: abortion, which brings \n     people to such blindness.\n       ``I want this child!''\n       And for this I appeal in India and I appeal everywhere: \n     ``Let us bring the child back.'' The child is God's gift to \n     the family. Each child is created in the special image and \n     likeness of God for greater things--to love and to be loved. \n     In this Year of the Family we must bring the child back to \n     the center of our care and concern. This is the only way that \n     our world can survive, because our children are the only hope \n     for the future. As other people are called to God, only their \n     children can take their places.\n       But what does God say to us? He says, ``Even if a mother \n     could forget her child, I will not forget you. I have carved \n     you in the palm of my hand.'' We are carved in the palm of \n     his hand; that unborn child has been carved in the hand of \n     God from conception, and is called by God to love and to be \n     loved, not only now in this life, out forever. God can never \n     forget us.\n       I will tell you something beautiful. We are fighting \n     abortion by adoption--by care of the mother and adoption for \n     her baby. We have saved thousands of lives. We have sent word \n     to the clinics, to the hospitals, and police stations: Please \n     don't destroy the child; we will take the child.'' So we \n     always have someone tell the mothers in trouble: ``Come, we \n     will take care of you, we will get a home for your child.''\n       And we have a tremendous demand from couples who cannot \n     have a child. But I never give a child to a couple who has \n     done something not to have a child. Jesus said, ``Anyone who \n     receives a child in my name, receives me.'' By adopting a \n     child, these couples receive Jesus, but by aborting a child, \n     a couple refuses to receive Jesus.\n       Please don't kill the child. I want the child. Please give \n     me the child. I am willing to accept any child who would be \n     aborted, and to give that child to a married couple who will \n     love the child, and be loved by the child. From our \n     children's home in Calcutta alone, we have saved over 3,000 \n     children from abortions. These children have brought such \n     love and joy to their adopting parents, and have grown up so \n     full of love and joy! I know that couples have to plan their \n     family, and for that there is natural family planning. The \n     way to plan the family is natural family planning, not \n     contraception. In destroying the power of giving life, \n     through contraception, a husband or wife is doing something \n     to self. This turns the attention to self, and so it destroys \n     the gift of love in him or her. In loving, the husband and \n     wife must turn the attention to each other, as happens in \n     natural family planning, and not to self, as happens in \n     contraception. Once that living love is destroyed by \n     contraception, abortion follows very easily.\n       The greatness of the poor\n       I also know that there are great problems in the world--\n     that many spouses do not love each other enough to practice \n     natural family planning. We cannot solve all the problems in \n     the world, but let us never bring in the worst problem of \n     all, and that is to destroy love. This is what happens when \n     we tell people to practice contraception and abortion.\n       The poor are very great people. They can teach us so many \n     beautiful things. Once one of them came to thank us for \n     teaching them natural family planning, and said: ``You \n     people--who have practiced chastity--you are the best people \n     to teach us natural family planning, because it is nothing \n     more than self-control out of love for each other.'' And \n     what this poor person said is very true. These poor people \n     maybe have nothing to eat, maybe they have not a home to \n     live in, but they can still be great people when they are \n     spiritually rich. Those who are materially poor can be \n     wonderful people. One evening we went out and we picked up \n     four people from the street. And one of them was in a most \n     terrible condition. I told the Sisters: ``You take care of \n     the other three, I will take care of the one who looks \n     worse.'' So I did for her all that my love can do. I put \n     her in bed, and there was a beautiful smile on her face. \n     She took hold of my hand, and she said one thing only: \n     ``Thank you,'' Then she died.\n       I could not help but examine my conscience before her. I \n     asked, What would I say if I were in her place?'' And my \n     answer was very simple. I would have tried to draw a little \n     attention to myself. I would have said, ``I am hungry, I am \n     dying, I am cold, I am in pain,'' or something like that. But \n     she gave me much more--she gave me her grateful love. And she \n     died with a smile on her face.\n       Then there was the man we picked up from the drain, half-\n     eaten by worms. And after we had brought him to the home, he \n     only said, ``I have lived like an animal in the street, but \n     am going to die as an angel, loved and care for.'' Then, \n     after we had removed all the worms from his body, all he \n     said--with a big smile--was: ``Sister, I am going home to \n     God.'' And he died. It was so wonderful to see the greatness \n     of that man, who could speak like that without blaming \n     anybody, without comparing anything. Like an angel--this is \n     the greatness of people who are spiritually rich, even when \n     they are materially poor.\n       A sign of care\n       We are not social workers. We may be doing social work in \n     the eyes of some people, but we must be contemplatives in the \n     heart of the world. For we must bring that presence of God \n     into your family, for the family that prays together, stays \n     together. There is so much hatred, so much misery, and we \n     with our prayer, with our sacrifice, are beginning at home. \n     Love begins at home, and it is not how much we do, but how \n     much love we put into what we do.\n       If we are contemplatives in the heart of the world with all \n     its problems, these problems can never discourage us. We must \n     always remember what God tells us in the Scripture: Even if \n     the mother could forget the child in her womb--something that \n     is impossible, but even if she could forget--I will never \n     forget you. And so here I am talking with you. I want you to \n     find the poor here, right in your own home first. And begin \n     love there. Bear the good news to your own people first. And \n     find out about your next-door neighbors. Do you know who they \n     are?\n       I had the most extraordinary experience of love of a \n     neighbor from a Hindu family. A gentleman came to our house \n     and said, ``Mother Teresa, there is a family who have not \n     eaten for so long. Do something.'' So I took some rice and \n     went there immediately. And I saw the children, their eyes \n     shining with hunger. (I don't know if you have ever seen \n     hunger, but I have seen it very often.) And the mother of the \n     family took the rice I gave her, and went out. When she came \n     back, I asked her, ``Where did you go? What did you do?'' And \n     she gave me a very simple answer: ``They are hungry \n     also.'' What struck me was that she knew. And who were \n     ``they?'' A Muslim family. And she knew. I didn't bring \n     any more rice that evening, because I wanted them--Hindus \n     and Muslims--to enjoy the joy of sharing.\n       But there were those children, radiating joy, sharing the \n     joy and peace with their mother because she had the love to \n     give until it hurts. And you see this is where love begins: \n     at home in the family. God will never forget us, and there is \n     something you and I can always do. We can keep the joy of \n     loving Jesus in our hearts, and share that joy with all we \n     come in contact with. Let us make that one point: that no \n     child will be unwanted, unloved, uncared for, or killed and \n     thrown away. And give until it hurts--with a smile.\n       Because I talk so much of giving with a smile, once a \n     professor from the United States asked me, ``Are you \n     married?'' And I said, ``Yes, and I find it sometimes very \n     difficult to smile at my spouse--Jesus--because he can be \n     very demanding--sometimes this is really something true. And \n     there is where love comes in--when it is demanding, and yet \n     we can give it with joy.\n       One of the most demanding things for me is traveling \n     everywhere, and with publicity. I have said to Jesus that if \n     I don't go to heaven for anything else, I will be going to \n     heaven for all the traveling with all the publicity, because \n     it has purified me and sacrificed me and made me really ready \n     to go to heaven. If we remember that God loves us, and that \n     we can love others as he loves us, then America can become a \n     sign of peace for the world. From here, a sign of care for \n     the weakest of the weak--the unborn child--must go out to the \n     world. If you become a burning light of justice and peace in \n     the world, then really you will be true to what\n\n[[Page S8955]]\n\n     the founders of this country stood for. God bless you!\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nDomenici be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in \noffering this resolution to establish a National Day of Recognition for \nthe humanitarian works of Mother Teresa.\n  This past Friday the world suffered a great loss with the death of \nMother Teresa, a woman called not only to minister to those in the \nshadows of life, but to be among them and shed on them the light of \nlove and human decency.\n  Someone once asked St. Francis what a person needed to do to please \nGod. He answered, ``Preach the Gospel every day. If necessary--use \nwords.'' Mother Teresa lived just that sort of life. She was a living \nlesson to all of us that faith is more than words. It is the good deeds \nwe do in this world. For that lesson, we owe Mother Teresa not only a \ntremendous debt of gratitude, but the resolve to carry on her difficult \nbut extremely important work.\n  Mother Teresa's life certainly was one of action and deeds. She was a \ntireless builder. She founded the Missionaries of Charity in 1950. An \norder that began with 12 members now has grown to a worldwide community \nof 4,000 nuns who administer orphanages, AIDS hospices, and other \ncenters of charitable activity in the United States and around the \nworld.\n  Later, she founded the Nirmal Hriday Home for Dying Destitutes. From \nthis beginning sprang numerous other facilities for the sick and dying \nshunned by traditional institutions. This dedication to those on the \nmargins of life is perhaps Mother Teresa's most profound legacy.\n  It is one thing--certainly important and meaningful--to give \noccasionally to charitable causes or lend valuable time to charitable \nwork. These are personal sacrifices that give us a stronger connection \nto our community and more meaning to our own lives. It is quite another \nthing--nearly incomprehensible to those of us blessed with the material \ncomforts of our modern American life--to give up all one has and to \nmake this sacrifice and dedication to others the sole focus of one's \nlife. To do this among conditions of squalor and misery--at risk to \none's own health and life--and to focus on those on the margins of life \nshunned even by hospitals and other institutions dedicated to improving \nhuman life, that is the character of Mother Teresa's life that earned \nher the affectionate label, ``the Saint of the Gutter.''\n  Mr. President, Mother Teresa was a tiny woman, but she was an \nenormous inspiration. The best way for us to honor Mother Teresa is to \nreach outside ourselves and try, each day, to show a little more \ncompassion in our own lives. I hope this resolution serves to remind us \nof that goal and to signal to the world our tremendous gratitude, \nrespect, and admiration for Mother Teresa--an extraordinary woman who \nhas touched and enriched all our lives.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I want to express my deep sorrow over \nthe loss of Mother Teresa. At the age of 87, she had made infinite \nstrides in promoting peace and goodwill throughout the world. In a long \noverdue gesture, the Senate recently bestowed upon Mother Teresa the \nCongressional Gold Medal for her role as head of the Missionaries of \nCharity. For a woman of her stature, it was a humble honor.\n  As I listened this weekend to the many replays of interviews with \nMother Teresa, I could not help but be stunned by endless depths of her \ncompassion. Her desire to hug and touch people otherwise reviled by \nsociety, the strength of her hands and enormity of her presence despite \nher diminutive size, are just a few images which come to mind. Mother \nTeresa was a woman who measured and understood the rest of humanity in \na way few, if any, others do. In recognizing her today, it is with \nreverence and the utmost respect for a person who labored as a living \nsaint on behalf of mankind.\n  She will never be forgotten. Her charitable mission will be carried \non in her adopted home of India, as well as the dozens of countries \nwhere her works have been taken up by others. While Mother Teresa is \nirreplaceable, we can only hope to learn and live by her example in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor of this \nresolution honoring the memory of a woman who may be the 20th century \nworld's greatest role model and humanitarian, Mother Teresa.\n  Words cannot express the contribution she has made to humankind. By \nher selfless acts over the past five decades administering to the \npoorest of the poor, she has set an example for how we all should try \nto live. The world would be a far better place if all people followed \nthe light of her shining example.\n  I have heard the word ``Saint'' used in the same breath as the name \nMother Teresa. It is hard to imagine any other person who has lived in \nthis century to whom that appellation would better apply. Hers was \ntruly a life of selflessness, where the totality of her identity comes \nthrough service to God.\n  I have, in my life, met many people who have been major actors on the \nworld stage--Presidents, Prime Ministers and other leading officials at \nhome and abroad. This year, I had the opportunity to meet and briefly \ntalk with this very frail nun in our Capitol. This was an honor that I \nwill cherish throughout my life.\n  It is not often that I have had the chance to be with someone whose \nvery presence is so intensely humbling. That was the case with Mother \nTeresa. She truly was representative of the best in the human spirit \nand will be remembered for centuries to come.\n  She will be sorely missed.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, in a week already saddened by the loss \nof Diana, Princess of Wales, we were further grieved to learn Friday of \nthe death of Mother Teresa. Her presence, that of a living saint, will \nbe sorely missed.\n  Mother Teresa has played the role of world conscience. Throughout her \nlife, she has lived in the most pure and basic manner. While caring for \nthe destitute and sick, she insisted on living in poverty herself. \nMother Teresa believed that ``the more we empty ourselves, the more \nroom we give God to fill us.'' She practiced what she preached.\n  Mother Teresa's remarkable and selfless works have been recognized \naround the world. In 1979, she was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. In \n1980, she was bestowed India's highest honor, the Jewel of India award. \nLast year, President Clinton conferred honorary American citizenship on \nMother Teresa. Most recently, she was awarded a congressional Medal of \nHonor. Mother Teresa knew that these were merely earthly rewards.\n  While she was an international figure, she remained focused and \ncommitted to her mission. She rejected the media attention these awards \ndrew, saying that she must get back to her work. Any money that came \nwith these awards was immediately given to the poor.\n  Mother Teresa will be sadly missed but her work will continue. I pray \nthat Sister Nirmala will be given the same strength and world support \nto continue the mission Mother Teresa founded in 1948, the Order of the \nMissionaries of Charity. I also pay tribute to Mother Teresa's life by \nrecommiting myself to work for the poorest members of society. Mr. \nPresident, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, just as the world was recovering from the \nshock last week of the sad news about the tragic and untimely death of \nPrincess Diana--including the disturbing discovery that alcohol may \nhave been linked to the crash--it was again rocked by reports of the \ndeath of another of its beloved heroines. Mother Teresa, considered by \nmany to be a living saint, died last Friday at the age of 87. Like \nPrincess Diana, who dedicated much of her attention to the needs of the \nunfortunate, Mother Teresa was a beacon of hope for countless people \nwho were all but abandoned by mainstream society. But, unlike Princess \nDiana, Mother Teresa chose to highlight the plight of the destitute by \nbecoming destitute herself. Although a physically small woman, Mother \nTeresa was a colossus of inspiration. She had little more to offer than \nkindness, faith, and tenacity, but Mother Teresa ably provided the \nworld with much, much more.\n  Mother Teresa embodied hope. She served God by reaching out to the \npoor. She dedicated her life to humanitarian\n\n[[Page S8956]]\n\naid, making personal sacrifices that most of us cannot easily \nunderstand. Mother Teresa traveled to areas where most would fear to \ngo; she embraced AIDS patients and lepers, cradled dying babies, and \nbrought a glimmer of hope to the hopeless. She rejected modern-day \ncomforts, and when she left this world she owned little more than her \nsari and her rosary beads.\n  Mother Teresa's name is recognized throughout the world, and her \ninfluence is immeasurable. In 1979, she was awarded the Nobel Peace \nPrize. Earlier this year she was presented the Congressional Medal of \nHonor. She is one of only five people ever to be awarded honorary \ncitizenship to the United States. Mother Teresa shared her time with \nsome of the world's most impoverished and unfortunate citizens. Her \nlight burned with superhuman brightness to illuminate the darkness in \nothers' lives.\n  Born in 1910 in an Albanian region which later became a part of \nYugoslavia, Mother Teresa's father died unexpectedly when she was a \nyoung girl, and she first learned to care for others while helping her \nmother look after her two sisters and others in the community. At the \nage of 18, she joined the Sisters of Our Lady of Loreto, an active \nmission in India, and spent two decades with the order, first as a \nteacher and then as a principal. In 1948, an inner voice told her it \nwas time for a change. Sister Teresa left the convent with the vision \nof starting her own school, determined to dedicate her life to helping \nthe most forsaken and abandoned. Possessing no capital, she first \ntaught by scratching letters in the dirt with a stick. By 1950, she had \nestablished a new religious order, and named it the Missionaries of \nCharity.\n  The vision that began with a tiny stick drawing on a gritty street, \nhas grown into an assembly of 600 clinics, orphanages, soup kitchens, \nmaternity homes, refugee centers, and havens for the poor, sick, and \ndying in more than 100 countries. These facilities are staffed by 4,500 \nnuns, 500 brothers, and thousands of volunteers from around the globe.\n  She refused to accept steady funding or fund-raising money from \ngovernment, private, or religious institutions, relying instead on her \nfaith in God. Yet, she soothed those in pain and brought smiles to \ncheerless faces, never forgetting the forgotten. The world is a better \nplace because of the sacrifices she made and the warmth she radiated. \nMother Teresa once said, ``To God there is nothing small. The moment we \nhave given it to God, it becomes infinite.'' With her passing, Mother \nTeresa joins with God's infinity. May her acts of unselfishness and \ncompassion be an inspiration to us all to strive, each in our own way, \nto make life better for all of those who lives we touch.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thought I might put in the Record, \nand in the resolution there is listed a number of things that Mother \nTeresa did, but just for the interest of the body, it might be \ninteresting to note some of those things that happened.\n  Mother Teresa expanded her personal dedication by founding the \nMissionaries of Charity, which people may not be familiar with but I \nthink most are, which included well over 3,000 members of 25 countries \nwho devote their entire lives to serving the poor without accepting any \nmaterial reward in return. She has been recognized as a humanitarian \naround the world in various forms: The first Pope John XXIII Peace \nPrize in 1971; the Jawaharal Nehru Award for International \nUnderstanding in 1972; the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979; the Presidential \nMedal of Freedom in 1985; and the Congressional Gold Medal in 1997.\n  She was born in 1910 in the former Yugoslavia, and received a calling \non a train saying she should go serve the poorest of the poor, a \ncalling, that was recently just celebrated, of nearly 50 years ago. \nThat is when she went to India to start her Missionaries of Charity.\n  There are a couple of things that also stand out in my mind. When she \nreceived the Nobel Peace Prize she refused a dinner, the banquet that \nthey normally put forward for those who receive that, and asked that \nthe cash equivalent instead be used for money to build more missions \nand help more people instead of having the lavish dinner.\n  I know that in the discussions with her group on the Congressional \nGold Medal she suggested that rather than presenting a Congressional \nGold Medal to her could they just melt the medal down and give them the \nequivalent of that in money so they could use that to put up more \nbuildings and help more people of the poorest of the poor.\n  You look at some selfless things like that, and you just become \namazed at what she did, and, yet, also what she could accomplish when \nthere is that much selflessness that goes into it.\n  I think one should recognize all of those accomplishments. And those \nare just the tip of the iceberg because those speak of kind of the big \nthings that we can identify. But they don't speak of the faces that she \nhas stared into, or the feet that she has washed, and the people she \nserved, one at a time.\n  I think that is worthwhile to add into the Record.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to attempt something that I \nknow will not fully succeed. I stand to speak to the legacy of Mother \nTeresa who in my opinion, was one of the greatest of all humanitarians \nand advocates for the poor, for the unclothed, the unhoused, the \nignored, and the forgotten poor of the world--not only the forgotten \npoor of India but of the world at large.\n  Many, of course, have remarked on the striking coincidence that last \nweek we saw the passing of two of the world's most famous women--the \nPrincess of Wales, and the guardian of India's poor, and really the \npoor of the world. Their association was coincidence. And those who \nagain say that Diana's commitment to the poor, to the sick, and to the \nmaimed simply ignored the profound friendship that had formed between \nthese two remarkable women. As Diana was moved to even greater \ncompassion by the small nun from Calcutta, so were all of us who knew \nMother Teresa.\n  I don't have a power wall in my personal office--pictures of me with \nother dignitaries. In my office you will find a lot of paintings. And \nthe only photographs are of my family and one other individual. For \nyears I have had a photo of Mother Teresa and me from one of the \nseveral meetings that I was most fortunate to have with her over the \nyears. I met her here in Washington at least twice. And I visited her \nin Calcutta, and visited her orphanage there. In Washington one time \nwas with a number of others. But the second time was just Mother Teresa \nand myself and one staff member.\n  For me, Mother Teresa embodies the highest commitment to spiritual \nprinciples in this very imperfect world. And her memory I will always \nkeep alive to remind me that we can in fact hold spiritual principles \ndeeply relevant to this harsh world. That little nun from Calcutta held \nthe greatest power that anyone can have--the power of love. She \nradiated it through her actions by serving the destitute, the maimed, \nand the forgotten.\n\n  There have been some trivial criticisms about her--that she didn't \naddress the root causes of the horrible poverty in which she lived. We \nshould never forget the distinction between the abstractions of policy \nand the practice of charity. We must never lose the humility that \nrecognizes that the policy attempts that governments and their leaders \nmake often fall short while the commitment to love can be endless. And \nin the end the love given to a homeless child or to a dying street \nperson cannot be legislated.\n  I recently heard a particularly telling anecdote concerning Mother \nTeresa. She was in the ghetto of Calcutta\n\n[[Page S8957]]\n\nputting salves on the wounds of a desperately sick person. A devout \npriest who was accompanying her said, ``I wouldn't do that for \n$100,000.'' I think maybe it could have even been $100 million. ``I \nwouldn't either,'' the dear, wise woman responded. ``I do it for \nChrist.''\n  I know that it is considered by some inappropriate to mention \nanything religious. But Mother Teresa reminded all of us of the great \ngood that all religions do for man. And her Christian compassion will \nbe an inspiration to me as long as I live.\n  Mr. President, I will never forget seeing her emotional remarks about \nabortions and the heinous nature of abortion in our society and in our \nworld today--30 million children aborted just in the history of our \ncountry since 1972. I remember her saying, ``If you do not want them, \ngive them to me.'' She meant it. She took care of the poor, the sick, \nthe maimed, the forgotten, those who were rejected by the rest of the \nworld. She took them to her bosom. She took them to her best ability to \nhelp, and, because of her, literally thousands--hundreds of thousands--\nof people have been helped around the world. And millions know what it \nis like to do charitable giving.\n  Mr. President, God bless the memory of Mother Teresa, as he blessed \nall of those who knew this woman, who I think will be known as one of \nthis century's most selfless and wonderful humanitarians.\n  So I am happy to cosponsor any resolution that supports Mother \nTeresa. And I hope that all people throughout the world will take her \nexample and realize that all of us in our own sphere, in our own little \nlife, can do a little bit more for our fellow men and women than we \nhave been doing, and use her as an example of one who gave her all for \nher fellow men and women and children.\n  I thank her personally, and that is why I am making these remarks \nthis day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, let me say to Senator Hatch that \nI am pleased that I was present for his eloquent remarks. I thank him \nvery much.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnot go in recess until I have completed my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask the occupant of the chair. Is that too much of an \ninconvenience for him?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his \nconsideration. No, under my schedule I am willing to stay here until \nyou finish your comments.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I had thought that sometime today or tomorrow I would \nsit down and write a series of remarks and reflections and thoughts \nabout Mother Teresa. But I think it would be more appropriate that I \nnot delay that and that I say a few words now so that it is \nincorporated into this Record as reference to this wonderful and quite \nappropriate resolution.\n  Let me first say I am not one of the privileged Senators who has met \nMother Teresa and been with her for any length of time, although I have \nmet her once. But I believe it is fair to say that even while I have \nnot met her, I have probably never, in my years of life and certainly \nmy years in the Senate, observed from a distance such a remarkable \nperson. That is what makes it difficult, because she is so remarkable, \nbecause she is so different from what the world talks about today and \nwhat the world espouses as success, as the way we ought to live our \nlives so we can be successful. She is so far removed from that and is \nyet great without any question, that sometimes it is hard to find words \nin our kind of world to talk about her.\n  But I was thinking, from my own standpoint, over the weekend I was \nprivileged as a member of my own family in Albuquerque, NM, to be \npresent with our entire family and many hundreds of friends at the 50th \njubilee of one of my own sisters being a Sister of Charity. She is a \ncouple years older than I and has been a Sister of Charity for 50 years \nand has taught kids all across this country. She assumes she has \ntouched and taught no less than 10,500. So I feel I could talk about \nher for a minute while we talk about the great sacrifices of Mother \nTeresa.\n  But obviously, it was an interesting weekend in that regard, for \nwhile we are all grieving the death of this saint, I was privileged to \nbe part of a family event where I think we have somebody very close to \nthat title who is our own blood.\n  Then, as I thought about what we ought to say here today, I hearkened \nback to a long, long time ago when we were taught a little bit about \nthe Old Testament and the New Testament. What I was thinking about is \nthat this is a pretty muddled up world. Things aren't going so well. \nThere are a lot of people terribly worried about our value system and \nwhere are we going versus our Maker, where is this world apt to end up \nwith what appears to be such an absence of what we understand is the \nright thing to do and the right way to go and right and wrong on a \ndaily basis. I was thinking back to the Old Testament of Sodom and \nGomorrah and Abraham negotiating with God. They had a very interesting \nnegotiation. It shows that Abraham was a wonderful negotiator even in \nworking things out with the Maker, for as you recall he talked about \nhow many good people you have to find in Sodom and Gomorrah to save it. \nThe negotiations started very high and ended up I believe at 10--10. I \ndon't think they could find 10, so Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed.\n  What does this have to do with Mother Teresa? Well, I guess I would \nsay that it is pretty clear to me that the kind of relationship we were \ntalking about back in the Old Testament is still a relationship with \nthe Maker, with the God Almighty, and I believe it is imperative that \nthe world give great confirmation and credence to someone whom we know \nis the kind of person that is so good and so much in touch with what \nthe Almighty thinks and wants that they are clearly capable of \nintervening and saving us. So I don't think we should just praise her \nfor the marvelous acts of love, but I think we should thank her, we \nshould thank her from the bottom of our hearts for contributing in a \nvery big way toward a more positive relationship between the Almighty \nand humankind.\n  Now, having said that, I want to make just a couple of other points. \nI know it is very easy for people to talk about Mother Teresa and not \nwant to talk about her faith, but I do not think you can do that. I do \nnot think you can say she is a great humanitarian. In fact, I do not \nbelieve she would want to be called a humanitarian. Her faith is very \nsimple, profound, and real. She believes what her faith tells her, and \nthat is that the poor and the downtrodden, the sick, and those who are \non their death beds with all kinds of infirmities present in their \nbodies and minds, that they are Jesus Christ.\n  Now, I am not offended, nor am I concerned, about saying that right \nhere on the Senate floor because that is true. So we must talk about \nher in that context, for to do otherwise is to deny her existence and \nwhy she did what she did.\n  Now, having said that, it is very hard for most mortals to live their \nfaith that way--very hard. Nonetheless, I think what I choose to honor \ntoday and to thank her for is that she did, as a matter of fact, live \nher faith, totally to the core. Every bit of her being was living that \nNew Testament admonition, for we recall that Jesus Christ said, ``If \nyou are taking care of somebody who is desperately hungry, you are \ntaking care of me; if you are taking care of those who are suffering, \nyou are taking care of me.''\n  Now, most of us are not able to bridge that gap of faith that she \nbridged every day, every moment, for she literally lived her life fully \naware of and practicing that admonition. So it seems to this Senator \nthat it is most befitting, and in particular in the kind of world we \nlive, in which just 2 weeks ago we had a poll of the American people \nand with the economy humming and with all the material things seeming \nto go well, huge numbers of Americans said we are on the wrong path. I \nthink the wrong path did not have much to do with material wealth. I \nthink they are frightened about the way we behave, and they are worried \nabout what that is going to end up doing to us.\n  So I think it is fair that we step back and say, well, here is one, \nthe lady\n\n[[Page S8958]]\n\nfrom Calcutta, here is one who sees it completely different than we do, \nand yet look how many lives she affected, look how many people came \nwithin the yoke of this little, tiny, frail body, which probably at her \ndeath was not bigger than 75 to 80 pounds at the most.\n  So I thank Senator Nickles and others, and I join as a cosponsor of \nthis resolution, but it is again as you look at things really \ninadequate. As I look at the occupant of the chair and I think what do \nwe really feel about this lady and we can't quite write it down, we can \nsay with absolute assurance that she is the right kind of person to \nrespect, that she is the right kind of person and personage for the \nU.S. Senate to pay tribute to.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, in behalf of \nthe leader, that following the 2:15 p.m. vote on Senate Resolution 120, \nthe pending resolution, the Senate begin 60 minutes of debate on the \nMcCain Amendment 1091, and, at the expiration or yielding back of the \ntime, the Senate vote on or in relation to amendment 1091.\n  I understand this is cleared on the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, under a previous agreement, the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, will proceed with \nhis amendment for 1 hour.\n  I have discussed the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Washington, Senator Gorton. He has two amendments pending. Let me \nbe sure which of the amendments we have here. It is an amendment \ndenominated to allow States to use funds under the Social Security Act \nto provide health insurance coverage for children with incomes above \nthe minimum Medicaid eligibility requirements.\n  Senator Gorton advised me he would be agreeable to a time agreement \nof 1 hour equally divided. He is not now on the floor, but he made that \nrepresentation to me. I do not, frankly, like to proceed without having \nhim on the floor, but I ask unanimous consent that we may proceed--\nwell, I am advised there may be a question on the other side of the \naisle.\n  But let me proceed, Mr. President, to say that if we are able to lock \nin that time agreement, then the managers would like to proceed to the \ntwo debates, 1 hour each, which would bring us to 4:40, at which time \nwe would have two votes stacked back to back.\n  At the conclusion of those votes, or after the first vote, when the \nSenators are present, it would be my intention, as manager of the bill, \nto try to seek time agreements on the outstanding amendments which are \npending at that time. The Senators will all be on the floor after the \nfirst vote and before the second vote.\n  We are within striking distance of seeing some light at the end of \nthe tunnel. If we could have Senators on the floor at that time, I \nthink we could come to closure. We have the amendment by the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin, pending on the tax \nissue. It is my hope that we can get a 1-hour time agreement on that, \nequally divided. I know that is agreeable to Senator Durbin, but there \nare others who may offer a second-degree amendment, Senator Ford \nperhaps, and others who are not now present. If we could get that \nresolved after the first vote, it would be helpful on the management of \nthe bill.\n\n[[Page S8959]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, I think the suggestion \nmade by the distinguished Senator is a good one. I intend to support \nit. I ask, if we can add to that, a unanimous consent request that \nSenator Durbin be recognized to offer his amendment, leaving open the \noption of people offering second-degrees following the two votes that \nyou suggest.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if my distinguished colleague will yield, \nI would be agreeable to that. I had discussed with Senator Durbin his \nbeing next in sequence. I think that would be appropriate to lock that \nin by unanimous consent.\n  I am now advised, that even on recognition on our side of the aisle, \nwe need to check with some other people. But let me say to Senator \nDurbin that it will be my effort to have him proceed at that time, but \nI want to consult with some of my colleagues, so that is not in the \nform of a unanimous-consent request.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the Senator will yield, Mr. President, I say, if we \ncould have the understanding that as soon as it is cleared on his side \nthat he would seek recognition for purposes of propounding that aspect \nof the unanimous-consent request, I would not have any objection to the \nUC request that he currently has proposed.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would be delighted to do that, except I am not going \nto be on the floor. We have a Governmental Affairs hearing. Let me say \nthat when we get clearance on this side, it will happen, we will work \nit out.\n  Is the time agreement on the Gorton amendment cleared at this point? \nIt is?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent then that after the conclusion \nof the 1 hour of debate on the McCain amendment, we proceed to the \nGorton amendment for 1 hour equally divided, and that at the conclusion \nof the vote on the McCain amendment, we will have a discussion as to \nsequencing further on the bill and at that time seek to have unanimous \nconsent to proceed next to the Durbin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I withhold for just a moment, Mr. President.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, just one moment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, while they are discussing, may I seek \nrecognition for a comment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand now that there would be a \nbudget point of order raised against my amendment. A budget point of \norder, to my understanding, is debatable. I may seek some time to rebut \nthe budget point of order, so that may affect this unanimous-consent \nrequest, I say to my colleague from Pennsylvania. I do not intend to \ntake a lot of time, but I intend to take enough time to rebut it.\n  I thought I would get an up-or-down vote on this amendment. \nApparently, there is going to be a budget point of order. So since the \nbudget point of order is going to be posed, I feel that aspect of this \nissue ought to be addressed.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if my colleague will yield, could we \nenter into a time agreement on how long you would take on that \ndiscussion?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would be glad to discuss that. It would be a very brief \nperiod of time, like 10 to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from Arizona, \nbudget points of order are not debatable.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The motion to waive the budget point of order is \ndebatable. That is what I will propose once a budget point of order is \nmade.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator that generally \nthat is true, but if there is a time limitation on the amendment that \nhas already been agreed to that does not allocate time on debatable \nmotions, those motions are not debatable. It would be debatable within \nthe 1-hour time agreement.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if my colleague will yield, might I \nsuggest we alter the time agreement to give the Senator from Arizona an \nadditional 10 minutes to debate the point of order?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I appreciate that. That would be sufficient.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request by the \nSenator?\n  Mr. SPECTER. If the Presiding Officer will withhold for 1 minute, \nplease, we need to make one more telephone call, so I suggest we \nproceed with Senator McCain's amendment, with my leave to interrupt, if \nI might when the phone call is made, to complete the unanimous-consent \nagreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, my understanding is we have 1 hour equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1091\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment eliminates the financial \nincentive payments created under the Balanced Budget Act for teaching \nhospitals to reduce their medical residency program. The Federal \nGovernment has created an incentive program which gives hundreds of \nmillions of taxpayers' dollars to teaching hospitals for not training \nmedical students.\n  Mr. President, I strongly suggest if this amendment is defeated, \nwhich I guess in all likelihood it probably will be, that we now \npropose amendments that would restrict the number of graduates of law \nschool. Most Americans believe there are too many lawyers, although \nprobably the majority of my colleagues would not agree. Perhaps we \nshould put a cap on the number of graduates of journalism school. \nClearly there are way too many people in that business. And maybe we \nshould also cap the number of graduates of photography school. That \nwould cut down on the paparazzi and the problem we have there.\n  Mr. President, this is not a Republican or Democrat difference. This \nis capitalism versus socialism. Vladimir Lenin would be proud of this \nproposal for government control, government planning, and, frankly, it \nis remarkable that we would have included it even in the way in which \nit was included in the Balanced Budget Act, which was over 1,000 pages, \nand we had less than 24 hours to review the final draft.\n  It is just remarkable. It is a new subsidy program. I would like to \nread a couple of quotes. My friend from Texas wants to speak on it, so \nI will be fairly brief. The payment represents a rare attempt by the \nFederal Government to use subsidies as leverage to shrink a particular \nwork force. ``I know of no profession where there has been as much \nfederal effort to regulate,'' said Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at \nPrinceton University. ``You don't do it for economists, for architects, \nfor engineers.''\n  ``It is voluntary, but it isn't voluntary for the taxpayers,'' said \nthe Heritage Foundation.\n  The National Taxpayers Union supports Senator McCain's amendment to \neliminate the graduate medical education. ``We believe it is a wasteful \nuse of taxpayers' dollars.''\n  Others question whether it is necessary. The number of young doctors \ntraining to become anesthesiologists, for example, has declined from \n1,500 three years ago to 450 this year following well-publicized \nwarnings that the field was saturated. Starting a few years ago, \n``people weren't able to get the plum jobs in the cities they wanted. \n[They] would have to take jobs in Idaho, Oklahoma,'' said James \nKottrell, chairman of anesthesiology at the State University of New \nYork Health Center in Brooklyn.\n  Mr. President, 46 million Americans are underserved in health care \ntoday in America. That is a fact and everyone knows it. So now we are \ngoing to pay teaching universities hundreds of millions of dollars of \ntaxpayers' dollars not to train doctors that are needed.\n  This morning in the Washington Post--and I ask unanimous consent the \nentire article be printed in the Record--was an editorial by Daniel S. \nGreenberg, editor of Science & Government Report.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Med School Millionaires\n\n                        (By Daniel S. Greenberg)\n\n       Don't expect anything but a hemorrhage at the Treasury from \n     that new program to counter the doctor surplus by paying \n     hospitals to reduce the number of residency slots for the \n     final phase of medical training.\n       Reminiscent of the agricultural-support schemes that paid \n     farmers for not growing\n\n[[Page S8960]]\n\n     crops, the medical plan was inspired by an immutable law of \n     American medical practice: More doctors mean more medical \n     spending, despite the penny-pinching tactics of managed care. \n     So, stop them before they can start hustling patients, the \n     Washington strategists concluded. The medical-education \n     industry, however, is too profitable, inventive and resilient \n     to yield to that tactic.\n       The major factor in the medical-production pipeline is \n     medical-school enrollments. And data compiled by the American \n     Medical Association show that these have remained virtually \n     unchanged for more than 15 years, as have the number of \n     medical schools.\n       In fact, medical schools have supplanted military bases as \n     immortal institutions. In 1980-81, the 124 medical schools in \n     the United States enrolled 65,497 students; in 1996-97, the \n     number of schools remained duties. Over the past decade, this \n     income total for faculty at 124, and enrollments stood at \n     66,712--though a long succession of studies proclaimed a \n     surfeit of doctors.\n       The big change in medical education was a vast increase in \n     revenues, much of it from so-called practice plans that pay \n     medical faculty for attending to patients, usually in \n     conjunction with their teaching duties. Over the past decade, \n     this income total for faculty at the 124 schools has risen \n     from $5.2 billion to $10.6 billion.\n       And, in accord with the Willie Sutton principle, the number \n     of full-time faculty has soared, though the number of \n     students remains almost unchanged. In 1983-84, the nationwide \n     faculty totaled 56,564. In the current academic year, the \n     number of faculty members is 95,568.\n       Where are they coming from? to a large extent, they were \n     already there at the university on other payrolls, and were \n     switched to the more bountiful cash flow of medical \n     education, which draws on patient fees, federal research and \n     amply loans to finance runaway tuition fees--to be repaid by \n     high medical incomes.\n       A little-known fact of American higher education is that \n     the highest paid people on many prestigious campuses are not \n     university presidents. The big bucks go to the medical school \n     professors. At Columbia University, according to the \n     Chronicle of Higher Education, the president was pad $317,187 \n     in 1994-95, while one professor of surgery received \n     $1,526,397 and two others took in more than $1 million \n     apiece.\n       At Cornell University, the president received $294,687 in \n     pay and benefits in 1994-95. A professor of surgery at \n     Cornell received $1.7 million in pay that year, while two \n     others each took in over $1.2 million.\n       The president of New York University was paid $379,000. The \n     chairman of neurosurgery got $748,342, while four other \n     medical professors received more than $600,000 each.\n       At universities without medical schools, pay scales don't \n     approach these stratospheric medical incomes. At Princeton, \n     for example, the presidential pay was tops at $305,538, and \n     the next five highest salaries ranged between $197,796 and \n     $240,713. At MIT, the president received $285,000, and the \n     next highest salary was $236,000.\n       The medical-school industry, in alliance with local \n     politicians, is eternally resistant to downsizing pleas. The \n     Pentagon wants to close the medical school that was forced on \n     it by Congress in 1972, the Uniformed Services University of \n     the Health Sciences, in Bethesda. The General Accounting \n     Office says the school is excessive and satisfies only a tiny \n     proportion of the armed services' physician requirements. But \n     the school survives.\n       The Washington lobby for medical schools, the Association \n     of American Medical Colleges, says the solution to the doctor \n     surplus is to exclude foreign-trained physicians from \n     residency slots. The downside to that prescription is that \n     foreigners are willing to train and practice in inner-city \n     areas that home-grown physicians tend to shun.\n       But whatever is done in the quest for surplus reduction, \n     the odds are that it won't work. The medical-education \n     industry is too smart and well-connected to be deprived of \n     its golden goose.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reading from the editorial:\n\n       Don't expect anything but a hemorrhage at the Treasury from \n     that new program to counter the doctor surplus by paying \n     hospitals to reduce the number of residency slots for the \n     final phase of medical training.\n       Reminiscent of the agricultural-support schemes that paid \n     farmers for not growing crops, the medical plan was inspired \n     by an immutable law of American medical practice: More \n     doctors mean more medical spending, despite the penny-\n     pinching tactics of managed care.

The medical education \nindustry is too smart and well connected to be deprived from its golden \ngoose.\n  Mr. President, let me read from a quick letter that we got from the \nTaxpayers Foundation. This is directed to the Secretary of Agriculture.\n       Dear Sir: My friends, Wayne and Janelle, over at Wichita \n     Falls, Texas, received a check the other day for $1,000 from \n     the government for not raising hogs. So, I want to go into \n     the ``not raising hogs'' business myself next year.\n       What I want to know is, in your opinion, what is the best \n     type of farm not to raise hogs on, and what is the best \n     breeding hogs not to raise?\n\n  The story goes on and on.\n\n       I want to be sure that I approach this endeavor in keeping \n     with all government policies. I would prefer not to raise \n     Razor hogs, but if that is not a good breed not to raise, \n     then I can just as easily not raise Yorkshires or Durocs.\n       As I see it, the hardest part of this program is keeping an \n     accurate inventory of how many hogs I haven't raised. My \n     friend Wayne is very excited about the future of this \n     business. He has been raising hogs for 20 years and the most \n     he ever made was $420 in 1978, until this year, when he got \n     your check for $1,000 for not raising hogs.\n\n  Mr. President, the letter goes on.\n\n       If I can get $1,000 for not raising 50 hogs, will I get \n     $2,000 for not raising 100 hogs? I plan to operate on a small \n     scale at first, holding myself down to about 4,000 ``not \n     raised'' hogs, which will give me $80,000 income the first \n     year. Then I can buy an airplane. Now, another thing: these \n     hogs I will not raise will not eat 100,000 bushels of corn. I \n     understand that you also pay farmers for not raising corn and \n     wheat. Will I qualify for payments for not raising wheat and \n     corn not to feed the 4,000 hogs I am not going to raise? I \n     want to get started not feeding as soon as possible, as this \n     seems to be a good time of the year to not raise hogs and \n     grain. I am also considering the ``not milking cows'' \n     business, so please send me any information on that also.\n\n  I hope that the Secretary of HHS will be ready to supply various \nteaching hospitals around America and people who want to go into the \nteaching hospital business how they can qualify for these hundreds of \nmillions of dollars for not teaching doctors. I believe there will be a \nlot of entrepreneurs throughout the Nation that will want to qualify \nfor a program that pays them hundreds of millions of dollars for not \nteaching doctors.\n  Mr. President, we will have more debate on this. It is a serious \nissue. I think it is a defining issue as to what we feel is the role of \nGovernment in our society.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me ask the Senator from Arizona to \nyield me 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me begin where Senator McCain left off.\n  It is a great paradox in a dramatic change in public programs \nsubsidies. So, therefore, we are moving toward ending the practice of \npaying people not to produce things we do not want.\n  What an incredible paradox it is. At the very moment that we are \ngetting out of the business of paying people not to produce \nagricultural products, the Federal Government is on the verge of paying \nmedical schools not to train doctors.\n  Let me explain how the program came about and how it works and then \ntry to end up as quickly as I can by explaining to people why, as \nchairman of the Medicare subcommittee, I am for the McCain amendment.\n  First of all, we set up a program to fund graduate medical education. \nIt\n\n[[Page S8961]]\n\nwas done a long time ago, but in essence, we were running a surplus in \nMedicare, so rather than coming up with a funding mechanism for \ntraining doctors, Congress simply reached into Medicare and took the \nmoney away from beneficiaries and from payroll taxpayers to fund \ngraduate medical education.\n  It is an outrage that with Medicare on the verge of being insolvent, \nwe are still plundering the Medicare trust fund to pay for graduate \nmedical education. I believe that should end.\n  Basically, we have an entitlement program run by the Department of \nHealth and Human Services which pays teaching hospitals for residents \nto be trained in various specialties. The average subsidy is about \n$100,000 a year per slot. About $35,000 of that amount goes to the \nresident and $65,000 to help fund the cost of graduate medical \neducation.\n  Now, there is virtual unanimity that we are training too many doctors \nand too many specialists. Rather than going back and eliminating the \nentitlement or reducing the payment for the entitlement so that fewer \nschools will be providing the training to fewer students, Congress was \nafraid to change the program. It simply lacked the political courage to \ncut these entitlements to graduate medical schools.\n  So HCFA initiated a pilot program in one State, New York, and started \npaying medical schools not to train doctors.\n  Basically it works like this: If the teaching hospital agrees not to \ntrain a doctor they otherwise are entitled to receive funding to train, \nthen we pay them the money. Interestingly enough, in the first 2 years \nof the program we are going to pay them $100,000. Yet by not training a \nresident, they do not have to pay a resident $35,000. So now they are \ngetting $35,000 more for not training the doctor than they got for \ntraining the doctor during the first 2 years.\n\n  Now, basically, this is an absurd situation. The idea we are taking \nthe taxpayers' money and paying people not to train doctors is almost \nunbelievable. If you went out and did a survey of the American people \nand asked them about this program, they would not believe the \nGovernment would be doing this. But not only are we doing it in a very \nsmall provision in this budget bill we passed, a provision that most \nMembers knew absolutely nothing about, we are expanding this program \nfrom just New York to the whole country. So we are going to be paying \npeople all over America not to train physicians.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has used the 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I yield 1 additional minute and I will be through.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. There will be people who come over and say, well, in the \nlong run, it will save us money to pay medical schools not to train \ndoctors. My response is that this is an absurd program. We ought to \nstop doing it. We ought to end the program right here on the floor of \nthe Senate today. Then the committee can go back, because it will be \nforced to do something about the program, and come up with a coherent \nprogram to reduce the overall subsidy.\n  But we should not get into a situation where we are doing in medicine \nwhat we did in agriculture for years and years and years, and that is \npaying people to not produce things that we do not want.\n  It is unimaginable this has occurred. Yet it has. It needs to be \nstopped. I want to urge my colleagues to vote for the McCain amendment, \nand then all the technical things that need to be fixed about it we \nwill fix later.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I think we are now ready for the unanimous consent \nrequest which I now propound.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the debate on the Gorton amendment No. \n1122 be limited to 1 hour equally divided, that no amendments be in \norder to the Gorton amendment, and the Gorton amendment will be subject \nto a tabling motion at that time at the conclusion or yielding back of \ntime.\n  Let me specify, so there is no doubt, the 1 hour of debate would be \nprior to the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Just to be clear, I want to be sure that we have an \nadditional 10 minutes for the Senator from Arizona, in addition to his \n1 hour, on the point of order which may be raised.\n  I ask unanimous consent that, in addition to the 1 hour on the McCain \namendment, in the event a point of order is raised, Senator McCain will \nhave an additional 10 minutes to debate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection--\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President. As I \nunderstand it, the unanimous consent would be that after the hour of \ndebate, equally divided, under the McCain amendment, since points of \norder are not debatable, it would be a motion to waive. If there is a \nmotion to waive the point of order, that would be debatable, and \nSenator McCain wants 10 minutes under that process.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is correct. It was more precisely stated. It is 10 \nminutes to debate the motion to waive the point of order.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would want to have 10 minutes in the event somebody \nover here wants to speak. So I would like it to be 10 minutes for \nSenator McCain and 10 minutes on this side.\n  Mr. SPECTER. With that modification, I propound the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. So that our colleagues may be aware of the sequencing, \nMr. President, the debate on the McCain amendment, the first hour \nshould run at approximately 3:40, and the conclusion on a motion to \nwaive would be either at 3:50 or 4 o'clock, then an hour of debate on \nthe Gorton amendment, and then there would be a vote on the McCain \namendment. And in between, votes to be stacked on McCain and Gorton and \nafter the vote on the McCain amendment, we will try to reach time \nagreements on the remaining amendments and try to clear at that time an \nagreement that Senator Durbin proceed next on his amendment. I thank \nthe Chair.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will yield. For the benefit of Senators, \nwhat we are looking at right now is probably two votes that will take \nplace at about 4:45 or 5 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in the absence of any other Senator \nseeking recognition, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment \nbe set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\nAmendments Nos. 1119, 1120, 1109, 1092, 1121, 1085, 1086, and 1093, En \n                                  Bloc\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing pending amendments be considered, en bloc: amendment No. 1119 \nby Senator Murray, providing for an additional $1 million for the \nNational Institute of Literacy; amendment No. 1120 by Senator Bennett \nregarding school trust lands; amendment No. 1109 by Senator Nickles \nregarding the Social Security Administration and the reporting of \nemployer contributions; amendment No. 1092 authored by Senators McCain \nand Kerry, regarding eligibility for benefits under Medicaid and SSI; \namendment No. 1121, authored by Senator Kerrey, regarding child care \nfunding allocation errors; amendments numbered 1085 and 1086 by \nSenators Durbin and Levin, regarding organ donation; amendment No. 1093 \nauthored by Senators Craig and Bingaman regarding the maximum hour \nexemption for certain agricultural employees.\n  Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that Senators Roth and \nMoynihan be added as cosponsors to amendment No. 1109.\n  Each of these amendments I am advised, are appropriately offset and \nhave the approval of both managers, as negotiated by staffs, and with \nthe authorizing committees where necessary. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the amendments be agreed to, en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 1119, 1120, 1109, 1092, 1121, 1085, 1086 and \n1093) were agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1085\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Senator Levin will be offering a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment that complements this amendment. I want to commend him for \nhis\n\n[[Page S8962]]\n\nhard work in this area since 1979 when he succeeded in instituting \ndirectives aimed at increasing the number of military organ donors. \nSenator DeWine's staff has also been most helpful in suggesting \nmodifications to improve this amendment and we have incorporated all \ntheir suggestions into this amendment.\n  More than 50,000 Americans are waiting for organ transplants and \nhundreds of thousands more need tissue transplants. Every year, \nthousands die needlessly due to lack of donors. In 1996 alone, 3,916 \npeople on the transplant waiting list died because no organs were \navailable for them. Nearly one-fifth of all heart and liver transplant \ncandidates die while waiting for organs. Every 18 minutes another \nperson is added to the waiting list for organs. Each day, eight people \ndie because an organ was not available. Yet since 1986, hospitals that \nparticipate in the Medicare or Medicaid Program are required to have in \nplace policies to offer eligible families the option of organ and \ntissue donation. Last year at an HHS hearing on liver allocation and \norgan donation, Michael Evanisko, president of the Partnership for \nOrgan Donation testified that at least half of the solution to the \norgan donor shortage could be achieved by focusing on hospital \npractices. The partnership's research with 11 organ procurement \norganizations and over 130 hospitals nationwide, in conjunction with \nthe Harvard School of Public Health and Harvard Medical School, \nestimated that:\n\n       * * * if hospitals adopted optimal organ donation \n     practices, an additional 5,000 donors would result, bringing \n     the effectiveness of the donation system from one-third to \n     nearly 70%.\n\n  The major impediments to donation, according to Evanisko, are whether \nfamilies are approached about donation and how the request is handled.\n  Last year, Senators Dorgan and Frist here in the Senate joined forces \nwith myself and Dave Camp in the House and we added a section to the \nKassebaum-Kennedy Health Portability Insurance Act, which resulted in \ntaxpayers who were receiving a tax refund this year, at the same time \nreceived an organ donation request card. An estimated 70 million \nAmericans received this solicitation. Those of us who worked hard to \nincorporate that provision into the bill, certainly hope that it will \nincrease the number of organ donors. However, increasing the numbers of \nindividuals with organ donor cards alone will not save lives, if \nhospitals do not effectively identify these eligible donors. \nApproaching families in a sensitive manner about organ donation is also \nextremely important.\n  My amendment would ask HHS together with GAO, to survey 5 percent of \nthe donor hospitals in order to ascertain how the program is working \nnationwide. This information could be used to determine best hospital \npractices. This amendment complements our previous efforts to maximize \nthe numbers of lives saved for those in need of organ or tissue \ntransplants.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to support an amendment \noffered by my colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin. The Senator's \namendment calls for a report to identify the best ways to recover \norgans and tissue from those who have died suddenly so that the lives \nof others can be saved through organ transplants.\n  Today, more than 54,000 Americans are waiting for an organ \ntransplant; and 10 Americans will die each day before an organ can be \nfound. And the sad fact is that these deaths are preventable. We have \nthe technology to give these people a second chance through \ntransplants--but while we have the technology, we don't have the \norgans.\n  I am convinced that much of this problem can be solved by making \npeople aware of this problem and educating them about the need for \norgan donation. And I have been working on that for some time.\n  However, just as important is looking at the system we have in place \nfor organ procurement--to see if there are structural hurdles that we \ncan help remove. The law today requires hospitals to have a protocol in \nplace for organ procurement. Not all do. Those that do don't \nnecessarily work with the organ procurement organizations [OPO's] in \ntheir local areas. These are the hurdles that Senator Durbin's \namendment tries to address. The study that this amendment requires is \nan important one. I hope that it will provide us all with information \nabout how best to identify appropriate organ donors and then, how best \nto approach their families. I would hope that this study would take \ninto account the fact that these best practices may well be different \nin different parts of the country. To the extent the Secretary can \nidentify these differences in her report, I think it would be \nmeaningful to the hospitals and their respective OPO's.\n  When we fail to identify a potential donor or bungle our \ncommunication with a potential donor's family, we compound an already \ntragic situation. Already someone's family member--a mother, brother, \nor sister--has died. The second tragedy is that--despite that person's \nwillingness to donate and save another's life--that wish is ignored or \nthe request to the family is handled poorly, raising unnecessary doubts \nabout donation.\n  I'd like to thank Senator Durbin--I appreciate his thoughtful efforts \ntoward increasing organ donation and improving organ procurement. I \nalso want to thank him for accommodating my concerns in his amendment. \nI look forward to working with him in the future on this issue that is \nso important to both of us.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1086\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the need for organ transplants has \ncontinued to outpace the availability of transplantable organs. \nHowever, studies have shown that this trend can be reversed by \nimproving the process that families experience in hospitals. Congress \nrecognized the vital role that hospitals can play in organ donation \nwhen it enacted legislation to require hospitals to be responsible for \nfacilitating organ donation. The Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1986 and \nsubsequent legislation, requires organ procurement organizations and \nhospitals to establish organ donation protocols to enable hospitals to \ninitiate requests, on a routine basis, for organ donation.\n  A recent Harvard School of Public Health study, based on the \nexamination of thousands of medical records in 125 hospitals in four \nregions of the United States, found that despite the legal \nresponsibility to inform surviving family members of donation options, \nmany hospitals frequently fail to do so. According to the study, 27 \npercent of potential donors were lost either because health \nprofessionals did not identify potential donors or did not ask families \nabout organ donation.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I am offering today seeks to bring \nattention to the potential of hospitals to alleviate the donor \nshortage, and to shed some light on the fact that hospitals can improve \ntheir donor policy by instituting demonstrated best practices in organ \ndonation. There are a number of major initiatives underway focusing on \nhospital practices in organ donation that can result in saving \nthousands of additional lives in the not-too-distant future.\n  For example, the Michigan Hospital Association (MHA) is embarking on \nan important initiative to encourage its members to improve their organ \ndonation effectiveness. It includes identifying stragies designed to \nimprove the organ donation consent process and examining all aspects of \nthe process, from community education to provider interaction with the \nfamily. The initiative will also generate specific recommendations to \nimprove the tissue donation process, as well as major organ \nprocurement.\n  The Association of Organ Procurement Organizations is in the midst of \na major pilot project to conduct reviews of deaths that have occurred \nin hundreds of hospitals across the country. This project will provide \nan unprecedented level of information on organ donor potential and \nperformance and lead to targeted strategies to help hospitals improve \ntheir effectiveness.\n  Additionally, The Partnership for Organ Donation, in collaboration \nwith the University HealthSystem Consortium (an alliance of 70 academic \nhealth centers), has begun a major initiative to improve organ donation \npractices in hospitals across the country. The goal is to increase \norgan donation significantly in these hospitals by institutionalizing \nbest-demonstrated practices. The project follows an ``action research'' \ndesign, which includes diagnosing hospital performance, building\n\n[[Page S8963]]\n\nconsensus on the donation protocol, establishing a donation team in the \nhospital, educating all relevant staff in-depth, enacting the new \nprotocol, and on-going monitoring for quality assurance. The project \nultimately will lead to practice guidelines for organ donation, which, \nif adopted nationwide, could provide organs for many of the 53,000 \nAmericans currently awaiting transplants. it is currently being \nimplemented in a number of leading hospitals, including Henry Ford \nHospital in Michigan, Virginia Commonwealth University's Medical \nCollege of Virginia Hospitals, University of Iowa Hospitals and \nClinics, Oregon Health Sciences University Hospital and Clinics, Ohio \nState University Medical Center, Medical College of Ohio, St. Vincent \nMedical Center of Ohio and Riverside Hospital in Columbus, Ohio.\n  Collectively, these innovative endeavors will prove that patterns of \nnondonation can be modified. Mr. President, my amendment is aimed at \nencouraging hospitals to alleviate the donor shortage and sheds some \nlight on demonstrated best practices that can improve organ donation in \nhospitals. It also expresses the sense of the Senate that hospitals \nthat have significant donor potential shall fulfill their legal \nresponsibility to assure a skilled and sensitive request for organ \ndonation to eligible families. The Harvard study estimated that 5,600 \nadditional lives could be saved each year if hospitals improved their \npractices relative to donation requests. A Gallup survey indicated that \n85 percent of the American public supports organ donation, and 69 \npercent describe themselves as likely to donate their organs upon \ndeath.\n  Mr. President I understand that the amendment has been accepted. I \nthank the managers of the bill for their support. I would also like to \nacknowledge the support and cosponsorship of this amendment by Senator \nThurmond, Senator Durbin, Senator Inouye and Senator Dorgan. Mr. \nPresident, I understand that the managers will also accept the Durbin-\nLevin amendment requesting the U.S. Department of Health and Human \nServices together with the General Accounting to conduct a \ncomprehensive survey of donor hospitals to ascertain:\n  (1) the differences in protocols for the identification of potential \norgan donors\n  (2) whether each hospital has a system in place for such \nidentification of donors, and\n  (3) protocols for outreach to the relatives of potential organ or \nTissue donors.\n  The report will also include the Secretary's recommendations on the \nmost efficient and comprehensive practices for identifying organ and \ntissue donors and for communicating with relatives of potential organ \ndonors.\n  I commend Senator Durbin for all of the innovative work he is doing \nin the area of organ donation. Of particular note is Senator Durbin's \nOrgan Donation Insert Card Act which was enacted into law over a year \nago that I was pleased to cosponsor. The insert card is included along \nwith the tax refunds to millions of Americans giving them the \nopportunity to indicate if they want to become an organ donor.\n  Mr. President, these organ donor measures, including my negotiations \nover the past decade with Department of Defense Health officials to \nincrease the number of military organ donors, complement efforts to \nmaximize the numbers of lives saved for those in need of organ or \ntissue transplants. I am encouraged that the two Department of Defense \nDirectors instituted a number of years ago will result in every member \nof the military having an opportunity to indicate if they wish to \nbecome a donor. Under the Directive:\n\n       Unless contra-indicated medically, legally, or for \n     religious reasons, organ and tissue donation shall be \n     discussed with next of kin in every death in a military \n     Medical Treatment Facility including Uniformed Services \n     Treatment Facilities.\n\n  Additionally, the Department of Defense has instituted the process of \nincluding organ donor information in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility \nReporting System (DEERS). In April of 1995, the Department reported a \n30 percent positive response to this directive, which had not yet been \nfully implemented.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1109\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, in 1989, Congress enacted legislation \nthat requires that the Social Security Administration provide workers \nwith regular statements about the value of their Social Security \nbenefits. SSA is required to send these forms--known as the Personal \nEarnings and Benefit Estimate Statements (PEBES)--to any eligible \nindividual who requests one and was mandated to send an annual PEBES to \neach eligible workers over the age of 59 in 1995.\n  In FY 2000, the Secretary will be required to send this form annually \nto all eligible workers over the age of 25--An estimated 123 million \nAmericans are expected to receive this form in FY 2000. The SSA \nprojects that the cost of administering this law in FY 2000 will be $80 \nmillion.\n  These forms are specifically designed to help beneficiaries \nunderstand the value of their Social Security benefits. While I agree \nwith the stated goal of the PEBES forms, I do not agree that the PEBES \nform in its current design meets the test of providing that \ninformation. In fact, I believe that in its current structure the PEBES \nform is misleading to beneficiaries.\n  Right now, individuals are provided an estimate of their retirement \nbenefit. They are provided a yearly breakdown of their reported \nearnings, and a yearly breakdown of the taxes he or she paid. What is \nNOT reflected in this statement is the employer's contribution. My \namendment will require the Social Security Administration to include \nthe employer's contribution on the PEBES statement.\n  By not including the employer's contribution, the form misleads \nworkers on the actual amount of money being contributed into Social \nSecurity on their behalf and distorts the true rate of return on their \ntaxes.\n  Most people think that FICA represents 7.65 percent of their wages. \nActually, it is twice that when you consider the employer's \ncontribution totaling 15.3 percent--12.4 percent designated Social \nSecurity and 2.9 designated to Medicare.\n  Mr. President, the employer share of FICA is a labor cost. This is a \ncost of employing somebody in this country. This is compensation that \nis not available to go to the employee but instead is contributed on \ntheir behalf through FICA taxes. While we refer to this as the employer \nshare, in reality this additional 7.65 percent comes out of the \nemployee's compensation.\n  The PEBES is only telling half the story. Omitting the employer's \nshare of FICA is a gross misrepresentation. The worker who looks at his \nor her statement will falsely assume that their estimated benefit is \nproviding them a much higher rate of return. In fact, the rate of \nreturn is much lower because the taxes that a person is paying is \nactually TWICE what the PEBES form indicates.\n  The PEBES form does provide for representation of the self-employed \nshare, however, those workers who are not self-employed are not getting \nthe truth about the performance of their Social Security taxes.\n  Mr. President, my amendment is simple. It will require that we are \nhonest to taxpayers about not only what their full benefits will be but \nthat we are also honest on what the full cost of those benefits are. If \nwe are going to take the time and resources to educate workers on their \nbenefits we should ensure that it is done honestly and correctly.\n  Frankly, I believe that we would improve the PEBES form even more by \ntackling some of the issues that Senator Grams has laid out in his \nlegislation Workers should be informed on the real rate of return on \ntheir taxes; they should understand how the Social Security program is \nperforming compared to the private market; and finally, when the Social \nSecurity Administration projects benefit estimates they should also be \nrequired to inform beneficiaries that the trust fund won't be able to \npay benefits after 2029.\n  I am pleased that this amendment has been accepted by the managers of \nthe bill and I believe it will help improve one of the few tools \navailable to us in educating the public about planning for their \nretirement.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1093\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is considering \ntoday an amendment I am offering with Senators Bingaman and Domenici.\n  This amendment to S. 1061 would make a change to the Fair Labor \nStandards Act (FLSA) that is narrow\n\n[[Page S8964]]\n\nin scope, but is of critical importance to irrigators in Idaho and the \nWest.\n  Our amendment solves a problem with the interpretation of a provision \nof the FLSA.\n  Currently, nonprofit organizations that deliver water for \nagricultural purposes--such as water districts organized by local \ngovernments, co-ops, and non-profit corporations--are exempt from the \nmaximum-hour requirements of the FLSA.\n  However, according to the Department of Labor, if even one drop of \nthis water is used for purposes it considers ``non-agricultural'', then \nthe water delivery organization loses its exemption and severe \npenalties can be imposed. This is true even for minimal or incidental \nuses, such as road watering, lawn and garden irrigation, or livestock \nconsumption. Such uses may be closely related to, but technically not \ninterpreted as being, ``agricultural purposes''.\n  Our amendment clarifies that the maximum hour exemption applies to \nwater delivery organizations that supply 90 percent or more of their \nwater for agricultural purposes.\n  The work being done for these organizations is very seasonal. \nIrrigation has never been, and can not be, a 40-hour-per-week, 12-\nmonths-a-year, undertaking. During the summer, water must be managed \nand delivered continually. Later in the year, following the harvest, \nthe work load is light, consisting mainly of maintenance duties.\n  Our amendment is better for employers, workers, and farmers.\n  If a water delivery organization is forced to pay overtime during the \nsummer, it will have to lay off workers in the winter. Then it will \nhope that skilled, specialized workers, who know the equipment and the \narea, are available again next spring. Our amendment solves this \nproblem, by promoting a stable work force and level costs, year-round.\n  This adjustment also helps ensure year-round incomes and job security \nfor employees.\n  Our amendment restores the flexibility that traditionally existed and \nwas always intended by Congress. It more accurately reflects the \nrealities of agricultural water delivery.\n  Representative Mike Crapo of Idaho has introduced a similar measure \nin the other body. It is our hope that this adjustment finally will \nbecome law this year.\n  Finally, I want to acknowledge a former member of my staff, who is \nnow an attorney in Idaho, Norm Semanko. Norm actually began work on \nthis amendment some time back and laid the groundwork that has led up \nto its adoption by the Senate today. My staff still refers to this \namendment as the Semanko Act.\n  I understand this amendment will be accepted on both sides. I thank \nthe managers of the bill for their support and assistance; the chairman \nand ranking member of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, with \nwhom we consulted; and Senator Bingaman and his staff for their strong \nefforts on behalf of this amendment.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I'm cosponsoring this amendment to \nsection 13(b)(12) of the Fair Labor Standards Act, to make this law \nreflect the on-farm realities in the West. I believe this amendment \nfollows what must have been the true intent of legislation in the first \nplace. Section 13 is a long list of occupations that for one reason or \nanother we have exempted from the various overtime requirements of the \nlaw. Section 13(b)(12) in particular exempts employees of irrigation \ndistricts.\n  The reason for this exemption has to do with the requirements of \nfarming in the arid West. In my home state of New Mexico, for example, \nwe usually have two to three months each year, from about mid-May to \nthe end of July, where we get little or no rain. This yearly dry spell \nis right at the height of the dry season, and if a farmer can't \nirrigate his crops they die. Because of the expense of irrigation \nsystems, most farmers belong to an irrigation district that maintains a \nsystem of canals and ditches to supply water to their fields. Most \nirrigation districts employ their ditch riders year round so that they \nknow the system, the individual farms, and the needs of each farmer in \nthe district, and don't have to relearn the process every year. With \nyear-round employment these folks are an integral part of the farm \ncommunity. However, the work these people do is very seasonal. \nTypically, a ditch rider will work long and hard hours during the \nsummer irrigation season, and have a relatively lax work schedule the \nrest of the year. In enacting section 13(b)(12), Congress recognized \nthe importance that year-round employment has for both the ditch riders \nand their families, and the farming community. However, it appears that \nin acknowledging the unique working conditions required for western \nfarms, that the law was written too narrowly. The current section \nexempts:\n\n       . . . any employee employed in agriculture or in connection \n     with the operation or maintenance of ditches, canals, \n     reservoirs, or waterways, not owned or operated for profit, \n     or operated on a share-crop basis, and which are used \n     exclusively for supply and storing of water for agricultural \n     purposes.\n\nThe phrase ``exclusively for supply and storing of water for \nagricultural purposes,'' has recently been interpreted by rulings in \nthe 9th and 10th Circuit Courts to mean that all of the water from a \ndistrict's system must be used for irrigation or the district loses the \nexemption.\n  This strict all or nothing approach just doesn't match with the \nreality of western farming communities and the day-to-day life on a \nwestern farm. In the dry and dusty summer months it is very typical for \nfarmers to use of their irrigation water for dust control, and for \nwatering their lawns and flower beds. That is just human nature. \nHowever, the vast majority of water is used for growing crops.\n  Mr. President, this amendment, which changes the exemption to \nrequired that ``at least ninety percent'' of the water be used for \nagriculture, merely reflects a practical application of this long \nestablished exemption. As the irrigation season is just winding down \nfor this year, the farm districts will soon be making decisions \nregarding whether to retain their ditch riders in light of the recent \ncourt rulings. With this in mind, I ask my colleagues to accept this \namendment now, so that there won't be any disruption to these people's \nlives.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1120\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, in the Federalist Papers, Madison tried \nto allay fears of a Federal government overpowering state and local \nconcerns, by stating:\n\n       . . . where on one occasion improper sacrifices have been \n     made of local considerations to the aggrandizement of the \n     federal government, the great interests of the nation have \n     suffered on a hundred from an undue attention to the local \n     prejudices, interests, and views of the particular States.\n       . . . But what degree of madness could ever drive the \n     federal government to such an extremity?--Federalist Paper, \n     No. 46.\n\n  Mr. President, while Mr. Madison believed that Federal encroachment \nof local interests would be rare, I believe the State of Utah finds \nitself in that circumstance. Utah's education budgets are being \nimproperly sacrificed by federal action. Mr. Madison predicted that \nlegislative devices would be used to solve these types of problems. He \nwas right. Today I am offering an amendment in an attempt to do just \nthat.\n  Last September, the President created the 1.7 million acre Grand \nStaircase-Escalante Monument in Utah. While I vehemently disagreed with \nthe process the Administration used to designate this monument, it is \nnow a fixture on our map. We must now move on and work toward resolving \nthe problems that were created by this Proclamation.\n  One of the most important issues that must be addressed are the \n176,000 acres of school trust lands trapped within the boundaries of \nthe monument. For those of you who are not familiar with school trust \nlands, let me briefly explain. At statehood, the federal government \ngranted about one-ninth of the lands in Utah for the support of public \neducation. School trust lands exist solely to generate revenue for \npublic schools.\n  President Clinton, in designating the monument acknowledged the \nimpact to state education funds. He stated, ``I know the children of \nUtah have a big stake in school lands located within the boundaries of \nthe monument that I am designating today . . . creating this national \nmonument should not and will not come at the expense of Utah's school \nchildren.'' Utah's citizens, and\n\n[[Page S8965]]\n\neducation groups, including the Utah's Education Association, the \nParent-Teacher Association, the School Boards Association, the State \nBoard of Education, the School Superintendents Association, the \nAssociation of Elementary School Principals, the Association of \nSecondary School Principals, and School Employees Association agree, \nand have spoken loudly and clearly about the need to solve this problem \nfor the benefit of Utah's school children.\n  President Clinton then directed the Interior Department to conduct a \nland exchange of school trust lands located within the Monument. While \nthis is one of the most realistic solutions to this problem, it will \nnot be easy. Land exchanges are expensive, time-consuming, and \nunfortunately, will negatively impact tight State education budgets. In \na May 14 report on the Grand Staircase-Escalante Monument, the \nDepartment of Education reached the following conclusion:\n\n       The Department [of Education] recognized that the process \n     of arranging for land exchanges exacts costs on the State of \n     Utah . . . These costs are paid from funds that would \n     otherwise be available for public education.\n\n  Mr. President, this amendment provides a grant to the Utah State \nEducation Agency to partially defray expenses of conducting a land-\nexchange. State education funds are badly needed to educate Utah's \nchildren.\n  I would like to thank Senator Specter and Senator Harkin for their \nassistance, and leadership in education. I look forward to working with \nthem, the Department of Education and the Administration on this issue, \nand appreciate their willingness to work with me.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1111\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that the Senate turn to the consideration of \namendment No. 1111 to Senate bill 1061.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1123 to Amendment No. 1111\n\n   (Purpose: To assure the Medicare Commission examines the role of \n     medical research and long-term care in the future of Medicare)\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Harkin], for himself and Mr. \n     Feingold, proposes an amendment numbered 1123 to amendment \n     No. 1111.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of line 3 in the pending amendment insert the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That in carrying out its \n     legislative mandate, the National Bipartisan Commission on \n     the Future of Medicare shall examine the role increased \n     investments in health research can play in reducing future \n     Medicare costs, and the potential for coordinating Medicare \n     with cost-effective long-term care services''.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this amendment provides $900,000 for the \nfirst year costs for the bipartisan Commission on Medicare authorized \nin the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The additional funds are fully \noffset.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. That amendment is agreeable to this side of the aisle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the second-\ndegree amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1123) was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the amendment, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 1111), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I move to lay that on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that the Record be corrected to \nreflect that amendment No. 1115 is a Harkin amendment, cosponsored by \nSenators Bingaman and Kennedy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Bingaman be added as \na cosponsor to amendment No. 1101.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. How much time is remaining on both sides on the pending \nMcCain amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 15 minutes 30 \nseconds. The Senator from Iowa has 21 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. If the Senator will withhold, will the Senator yield for \na unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Yes.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Janet \nGoldberg, a detailee in my office, be permitted privileges of the floor \non the debate of the Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1091\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield myself 5 minutes, and then I hope that the \nopponents of the amendment will use part of their time because I don't \nintend to use all of my time since I would like to save some time at \nthe end.\n  Mr. President, there is going to be a budget point of order. I will \nrespond to that at the right time. I remind my colleagues that the \nprovision contained in the Balanced Budget Act was not contained in the \nbalanced budget bill passed by the full Senate. The full Senate never \nhad the opportunity to review this provision. Not only did the Senate \nnot have the opportunity to debate this provision when we considered \nthe budget bill in June, we were not given sufficient time to clearly \nexamine the budget bill after conference.\n  The Balanced Budget Act is over a thousand pages, and we had less \nthan 24 hours to review the final draft after receiving it from the \nconferees. Mr. President, it is also well known that a provision \noriginally was going to be included that would affect only the State of \nNew York, and then it was expanded to the entire country.\n  Mr. President, I just read a very amusing--at least to me --letter \nfrom a fellow that wanted to not raise hogs or not grow grain. I have \nbeen amused somewhat by this proposal that we would pay teaching \nhospitals not to teach, or pay farmers not to grow, or to pay anybody \nnot to do something. It is somewhat amusing, but at the same time, \noccasionally in this debate we should focus on the fact that there are \n46 million Americans who still lack access to doctors and medical care \nin America.\n  Here we have a situation where, according to the Health and Human \nServices Department, 46 million Americans don't have access to health, \ndoctors, and medical care, yet, now we are going to restrict the supply \nof doctors in America. It flies in the face of every fundamental belief \nthat I have, ranging from what capitalism and the free enterprise \nsystem is all about to what our obligations as a society are.\n  If we are going to restrict the number of doctors, how in the world \nare we supposed to take care of these 46 million Americans who live in \nrural communities and inner-city neighborhoods and have shortages of \nphysicians and health care professionals? The very poorest people in \nAmerica, Mr. President, are the ones who don't have health care, and \nnow we are going to deprive them of the possibility of treatment?\n  There are programs that serve underserved areas, including the \nNational Health Service Company, Area Health Education Centers, \nInterdisciplinary Training for Health Care in Rural Areas, Community \nHealth Center, Migrant Health Centers, and the Health Professions Work \nForce Development Program.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in rejecting this proposal \nthat somehow we are helping Americans by restricting the number of \ndoctors. Mr. President, in its own bizarre fashion,\n\n[[Page S8966]]\n\nthe CBO is claiming this will cost the American taxpayers money. I find \nit bizarre. I find it incredible. And the fact is that if we are now \ngoing to accept the assumption of the CBO that we save money by not \nhaving teaching hospitals teach, then clearly we can save money by not \nhaving other organizations in America that receive Federal subsidies do \ntheir job as well. It seems that it is only the medical profession that \nseems to be able to get away with this.\n\n  By the way, Mr. President, this experiment ``* * * will pay hospitals \nin the State''--the State of New York, not the entire country but just \nin the State of New York--``$400 million over the next several years, \nwhile they gradually decrease the number of young doctors they train.''\n  My understanding is that there will be no change for the first 2 \nyears of this.\n  That experiment ``* * * drew an outcry from teaching hospitals \nelsewhere that felt New York had wrangled a lucrative special deal. \nTheir protests attracted the sympathy of congressional Republicans who \ndecided that, instead of trying to block money for New York, they would \nexpand the opportunity nationwide.''\n  To quote further:\n\n       The payments represent a rare attempt by the Federal \n     Government to use subsidies as leverage to shrink a \n     particular work force. ``I know of no profession where there \n     has been as much Federal effort to regulate,'' said Uwe \n     Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University. ``You \n     don't do it for economists, for architects, for engineers.''\n       The payments also are the government's first effort to \n     constrict the pipeline of people entering the medical \n     profession. Several influential groups have warned lately \n     that the nation has too many doctors, particularly \n     specialists, and have urged the federal government to impose \n     limits on the number of recent medical school graduates, \n     known as residents, who pursue several years of advanced \n     training before beginning to work on their own. But until now \n     that advice has met with legislative resistance.\n       The New York experiment and the nationwide initiative hinge \n     on changes in Medicare, the largest federal insurance program \n     for the elderly and disabled. Since it began, Medicare has \n     underwritten residency training programs heavily and has, in \n     effect, made residents a prized, inexpensive kind of labor \n     for their hospitals. Taxpayers spend $7 billion a year on \n     such training.\n       Until now, many teaching hospitals have been reluctant to \n     cut back, because every resident translates into an average \n     subsidy of $100,000 a year. ``It has not been financially \n     rewarding to downsize,'' said Muncey Wheby, associate dean \n     for graduate medical education at the University of Virginia.\n       Under the budget agreement, hospitals that downsize will \n     not get extra money outright. But if they volunteer to reduce \n     their residency programs by 20 percent or 25 percent over \n     five years, Medicare will cushion the financial blow. For the \n     first two years, it will pay the whole subsidy for the \n     missing residents. After that, the payments will taper off \n     for three years.\n       The agreement also for the first time essentially forbids \n     hospitals to increase the sizes of their residency programs.\n\n  Mr. President, the article goes on with other suggestions:\n\n       But others suggest that hospitals will be rewarded \n     needlessly for cutbacks that some have started to make \n     without being paid to do it. Some say the initiative is the \n     medical equivalent of discredited agricultural programs that \n     have paid farmers not to grow certain crops.\n       ``I don't know where the hell as Republican Congress gets \n     off doing labor force planning for the medical profession,'' \n     said Robert E. Moffit, deputy director for domestic policy \n     studies at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think \n     tank. ``As an economic principle, it is absurd.''\n       How many physicians the nation produces has important \n     effects on the cost of the health care system. The greater \n     the number of doctors, research has shown, the more medical \n     tests and expensive specialty treatment patients tend to \n     receive, because physicians find subtle ways to keep \n     themselves employed.\n       With more than 700,000 physicians, the United States has \n     more doctors per capita than virtually any other country. In \n     particular, it has a vast supply of specialists, who are \n     starting to find themselves in less demand as more patients \n     are insured through ``managed care'' plans that favor \n     treatment by lower-cost medical generalists.\n\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, in light of the fact that I am the only \none here on the floor, I ask unanimous consent that the time be taken \noff the time of the opposition to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be taken from the opposition to the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, could I ask how much time remains on both \nsides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona controls 7 minutes; \nthe opposition controls 4 minutes and 53 seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I know that the opponents of this \namendment would like to make some comments.\n  Oh, here is one right now.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I seek recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Who is the opposition?\n  I guess I am the opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Who dealt away all my time in opposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It was running during the quorum call.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First let me apologize. I was at the Senate Committee \non Governmental Affairs. Frankly, of all the times you could have, I \nwas actually asking questions. But I do not need any more time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I was just going to say I ask unanimous consent to give \nthe Senator from New Mexico some additional minutes if he would need \nthem.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I do not need anything. The only thing \nis, did the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator \nRoth, speak?\n  Mr. McCAIN. No.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am wondering if he would like to speak.\n  That is the reason I raised this, I say to the Senator, but they are \ngoing to send for him.\n  He spoke earlier in the day.\n  Mr. President, I do not need but just a few moments. I was not \nprivileged to hear Senator McCain and those who proffered this \namendment. But let me first say that whatever they said about the \nstatus of the way we through the Federal Government are funding medical \ndoctors' education, both straight medical school and for specialties, \nwhatever they said about how egregious it is, they are probably right.\n  The point is that what they seek to do is not going to help a bit \nbecause what has actually happened is that we are paying for medical \neducation out of the Medicare fund, and we have been doing it for a \nlong time. That is sort of a way for you to fund medical education, and \nif nobody knows about it, it doesn't count very much because it is \ncoming out of what was always a very big trust fund. As a consequence, \nmedical education is costing a huge amount of money and the biggest \nplayer--so everybody will understand this issue of who is going to \ndecide how many doctors we have, right now the biggest player is the \nFederal Government. We are the ones putting huge amounts of money into \nthe teaching hospitals that permit them to teach as many doctors either \ngeneral medicine, their first years through, or their specialties.\n  Obviously, we are proud that that system has yielded the best doctors \nin the world, I do not think there is any doubt about that, including \nthe best specialists in the world. But the cost is enormous, something \nlike $100,000 a doctor. And let me repeat, we, the taxpayers, through \nthis mechanism are paying for that. So in a sense we already are the \nswitch that is going to determine how many doctors we have and how many \nwe do not have. And now all of a sudden in the budget debates there is \na recognition that we cannot afford to spend as much as we have been \nspending.\n  So the experts from the various committees and staffers--and I only \nregret to say I am not on the committee with jurisdiction. I was there \nnegotiating with our distinguished leader, but the\n\n[[Page S8967]]\n\nconclusion was we have to save some money on this Federal expenditure \nproducing these doctors in particular since there are too many being \nproduced, at least more than we ought to be paying for. Maybe that is \nthe way I ought to say it. If they want to produce more and somebody \nwants to pay more money, that is the marketplace, good luck. But we are \nthe marketplace substantially now, the taxpayers.\n  So nobody wants to cut the subsidy. The AMA does not want us to cut \nthe subsidy. The schools that are great schools do not want us to cut \nthe subsidy. So to save money somebody came up with an idea to start a \npilot project and see if in New York you said to the schools produce \nless doctors, we give you less money, and of the money saved, you get \nhalf and we get half.\n  As this budget worked its way through the Congress, through the \nconference and debates, somebody said if you are going to try the pilot \nin New York, try it all over the country. So what we have is language \nin a budget deal that has already been voted in that says try this \neverywhere in the country and see what we get out of it.\n\n  The end product, Mr. President and fellow Senators, is that the \nCongressional Budget Office estimates we will spend $230 million less \nthis way than if we did not do it this way. So essentially, whether one \nlikes the idea or not, the alternatives are very simple. One, if you \ntake it out, as Senator McCain is recommending, you spend more money.\n  Could I have an additional minute, 2 minutes?\n  You do what Senator McCain is asking us to do and you spend $230 \nmillion more according to the Congressional Budget Office. I have no \nreason to discount that information.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom New Mexico be granted 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  So one option is to take it out and lose $230 million which the \nbudget process has not found anywhere, and Senator McCain and his \nsupporters are not finding anywhere. So it is essentially breaking the \nbudget by $230 million, which means when the time has all expired, I \nwill make a point of order that it violates the Budget Act and the \nSenators can vote up or down do they want to violate the Budget Act or \nnot. If they do, we would lose $230 million, and that is their call \ncollectively, and we need 60 votes to do it.\n  One should ask, if the McCain amendment succeeds, where are we? The \ninteresting thing is if the McCain amendment passes, we are right back \nto where we were before with the Federal subsidy program in place. We \nhaven't reduced it significantly--a little bit, but we are still in \nthere subsidizing just as we have been with a little bit less money.\n  What we really ought to do is decide how we are going to change this. \nIf we are putting too much money into the education of doctors at every \nlevel including specialists, we ought to put less in, and that is what \nwe do not have the intestinal fortitude to do. And I guarantee you if a \ncommittee that has jurisdiction came to the floor with a proposal that \nsaid we are going to reduce the subsidy significantly so we don't spend \nas much money, thus you teaching hospitals get less, there would be a \nhuge uproar and every Senator who has a major medical hospital and \neducational institution that produces medical doctors will be here \ntalking--I see my friend from New York. He would be here certainly, and \nso would Senator Moynihan--saying it is the end of the world, it is the \nend of medicine as we know it. We did not do this.\n  I frankly believe in the long run we have to do it. We cannot have so \nmuch capacity paid for by the Government. In the long run the private \nsector can pay anything they want and families can pay if they want. \nBut the Federal Government to be the catalyst for producing more \ndoctors than anybody thinks we need is just kind of absurd.\n  So on the one hand I thank Senator McCain and his supporters for \nbringing this issue to the Senate. And maybe, win or lose, he will have \nprompted us to do something we ought to really do about this program, \nand I submit it is not to do what we have done in the budget. I do not \nhave any alternative but to support it today and say, if we take that \nout, we lose a substantial amount of money. Nonetheless, Senator McCain \nand those supporting him will have had an educational exercise here and \nI think I have contributed to it.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. May I make an inquiry?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Did the Senator raise the point of order?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No. I will when the time is up. You can't until the \ntime has expired. If I had any time----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator wants to speak in opposition?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will give the Senator the remaining minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I have heard the Senator from New Mexico, \nand I agree with him. I also think that the Senator from Arizona does \nus a great service by saying, look, this may not be the methodology, \nthe best method of paying for the training of our doctors, but, having \nsaid that, that is the system that exists. The legislation that the \nSenator's amendment would affect is designed, maybe imperfectly, to \nbegin to reduce those expenditures, those moneys that come out of the \nTreasury.\n  Let me say this to you: It is not fair to say that we are paying for \ndoctors that are not going to be in training and, indeed, again, the \nproposal that the administration has put forth and that the committee \nhas expanded that goes beyond New York and now nationwide, those \ndollars will be used to provide adjustment assistance, because as these \nhospitals downsize, they are going to have to hire additional staff \ndoctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants and other personnel \nto replace the residents who now treat Medicare patients.\n  So this is a canard to simply say we are giving you money not to \ntrain doctors. It is transition and, in the fullness of time, will save \nthe taxpayers, depending upon who is doing the scoring, as much as $350 \nmillion. You can't knock a program on one hand and say you are paying \nall this money and we should reduce it, and when you come up with a \nmethodology to reduce it then say, ``Oh, no, that's not the right \nmethodology.''\n  Show us a way in which you do that and don't throw the teaching \nhospitals into chaos. This is the manner that I would suggest, as \nimperfect as it may be, that the committee came up with. For those \nreasons, I hope that we will refrain from piling on and supporting the \nMcCain amendment which does not help the situation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time in opposition has expired. The \nSenator from Arizona has 6 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will be glad to give 2 additional \nminutes to the Senator from New York if he would like.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his generosity. I \nthink I have made our point, but the Senator couldn't be more gracious \nin providing us that opportunity.\n  Again, I do hope we can find a better way to fund this, because I \ndon't think people know that the Federal Government put so much money \ninto teacher training. If there is a better way to fund it and finance \nit, I think we should look for that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield me 30 seconds?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I made a mistake, Mr. President, in giving you the \nestimate of what this will cost the budget. I gave you $230 million. \nThe Congressional Budget Office has now looked at the whole country, \nbecause this applies to the whole country, and their estimate now is, \nso everyone will know, if the McCain amendment is adopted, the budget \nwill be, in the first 5 years, $390 million short. That is, that much \nwill be added to the deficit and, over 10 years, believe it or not, it \nis $1.9 billion. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 5 minutes 20 \nseconds remaining.\n\n[[Page S8968]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield myself 1 minute, and I will then yield the \nSenator from Texas the remaining time.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico asked where would we be if \nmy amendment is adopted? We would not be in the business of paying \npeople not to do things. We would not be, through central planning and \npure socialism, deciding what the supply of doctors in this country is \nwhen there are 46 million Americans that do not receive health or \nmedical care in America today. That is an outrage and an insult.\n  We spend our time fighting on the floor of this Senate about \nappropriating more money to take care of health care for kids, more \nmoney to take care of health care for elderly Americans. How in the \nworld are we going to do that if we don't have enough doctors? The fact \nis that the Senator from New Mexico asked where would we be? At least \nwe would not be in the bizarre and incredible situation where we are \npaying schools not to do anything.\n  We tried this with the agriculture program, Mr. President. We tried \nit before, paying people not to grow crops. It doesn't work. You don't \nadjust people's behavior by doing such things and, believe me, this \namendment, this provision--I allow myself additional 30 seconds--I want \nto point out again the process that this went through. Never a word of \ndebate on the floor of the U.S. Senate on the Balanced Budget Act. I \ndon't know what in the world this has to do with balancing the budget, \nbut what it had to do with was a provision that was stuck in on the \nHouse side and, in less than 24 hours, we had to examine a 1,000 page \ndocument which clearly nobody on this floor today, with the exception \nof the Senator from New Mexico, had a chance to examine or debate. This \nis not the right way to legislate. This is not the right way to conduct \nour business in America.\n  I yield my remaining time to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 3 \nminutes 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will just inform the Senator from \nArizona that I will be happy to yield back a minute of my time since he \nso generously has given me the last time.\n  Mr. President, let me just say that I am a supporter of medical \neducation. I have supported every amendment that has come through here, \nand I have sponsored amendments that add to the medical schools' part \nof Medicare funding. I want medical schools to be funded. But, Mr. \nPresident, this is not the way to do it. In fact, the University of \nTexas, which is a school that has one of the best medical schools in \nthe whole United States, has said this is bogus, and they have refused \nto take the extra funds in this way not to train medical doctors. They \nare not in the business of not training medical doctors, and they have \nrefused this money because this is the wrong way to go.\n\n  Only in Washington would we address the issue of an oversupply of \ndoctors by funding not teaching doctors. Some would say, if this were a \ndebate to increase spending not to educate lawyers, maybe it would be \nworthwhile. But, in fact, we are not going to do anything so silly as \nto pay not to train doctors or lawyers or any other professionals in \nthis country. This is not the way to address the issue of oversupply. \nThe issue of oversupply is real.\n  The issue of training doctors is very important. In fact, I would \nlike to increase funding. I wish that we could substitute what we would \nsave here and put it into other parts of Medicare funding, perhaps \nrural medical education, which is suffering greatly.\n  I believe in teaching hospitals. I do not believe in paying hospitals \nnot to teach, and I hope we can correct that inequity. I hope we can \nlegislate in a responsible way. I hope that we can put our money into \nMedicare, into medical education, into training doctors, into rural \nhealth care where we need the money, but I do not want to spend one \ndime not to train doctors with added funds. It doesn't pass the smell \ntest, and I am proud to say that the University of Texas, from my home \nState, is not taking these dollars because they believe this is bogus. \nThey need money to train doctors in the best way, but this is not the \nbest way.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 30 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I just will comment that I was very \ninterested in hearing the statement of the Senator from Texas that \nindeed there is a university in America that has decided they don't \nneed to be paid not to train doctors. Of course, I put a further \ncredibility test on this argument that somehow teaching hospitals \nacross America have to have this huge subsidy not to train doctors. I \nhope more schools and universities will follow the example of the \nUniversity of Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on amendment No. 1091. \nThe Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, can I have 10 seconds before I make my \nmotion? I, too, hope all the hospitals do that. If they do, we will \nsave $390 million and over 10 years we will save $1.9 billion. I think \nthat would be an exciting end product.\n  Mr. President, the McCain amendment increases mandatory spending and \nis scored against the subcommittee's allocation. This additional \nspending would cause the underlying bill to exceed the subcommittee's \nallocation. Therefore, I raise a point of order against the amendment \npursuant to section 302(f) of the Budget Act.\n\n\n                     Motion to Waive the Budget Act\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to waive the budget point of order \npursuant to section 904 of the Budget Act, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the yeas and \nnays be delayed until the managers of the bill decide the most \nappropriate time. There are important hearings going on at this time, \nand I don't think that they wish to have it interrupted. So I ask \nunanimous consent that, pending the decision of the managers of the \nbill and the leaders, that the yeas and nays be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous agreement, there is now 20 minutes equally divided \non the issue to waive the Budget Act. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield back any time I have on the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back then on the \nmotion to waive the budget point of order.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Have the yeas and nays been ordered on the motion?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, they have.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am astounded and very pleased to note \nthat the FY 1998 Labor/HHS appropriations bill is nearly devoid of any \npork-barrel language, at least in the bill itself. After careful \nscrutiny of the measure, I have found only one section of the bill \nwhich is clearly pork. That is section 506, which contains the language \non Buy America set-asides that appears to be standard practice in this \nyear's appropriations bills.\n  Other than these Buy America provisions, which I continue to \nstrenuously oppose, I can find no other egregious examples of pork-\nbarrel spending in the bill language. For this restraint, I thank the \nsubcommittee chairman, Senator Specter, and the members of the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  Unfortunately, the report does contain a number of earmarks of funds \nfor location-specific, unauthorized, or simply wasteful projects. And \nit contains, of course, language that is intended to have essentially \nthe same effect as an earmark; by this, I mean the use of words like \n``encourage'', ``urge'', and ``carefully consider'' in connection with \nreferences to particular institutions, projects, or proposals that the \ncommittee would obviously like the relevant agencies to fund. These are \nnot earmarks, but I am sure the programs which the committee encourages \nor urges the agencies to support will receive special consideration.\n  I would like to submit for the Record the full list of objectionable \nprovisions in the bill and report, but would take a few moments of the \nSenate's time to note just a few of the more interesting earmarks in \nthe bill:\n  Report language directs OSHA not to enforce methylene chloride \nregulations\n\n[[Page S8969]]\n\nbecause small employers in the furniture stripping and foam \nmanufacturing and fabrication industries are concerned about the cost \nof compliance.\n  The report earmarks $326,000 for the Central Montana Head Start \nProgram to secure donations of surplus property.\n  The report earmarks $1 million for the Very Special Arts Festival in \nLos Angeles.\n  The report earmarks $500,000 for the native Hawaiian education \ncouncil and island councils.\n  As I noted, the report language contains a multitude of expressions \nof support, short of earmarks, for particular projects. A few examples:\n  Encourages the Department of Labor to expedite consideration of a \nrequest by the Iacocca Institute for funding to create a work force \ndevelopment education curricula.\n  Encourages full and fair consideration of proposals by the Cabot \nWestside Clinic and Samuel U. Rodgers Health Center in Kansas City, MO.\n  Urges consideration of a proposal by the North Dakota State College \nof Science in Wahpeton, ND, to conduct a consolidation of instructional \nfacilities for allied health programs into one site in a rural area.\n  Urges the Centers for Disease Control to work with native Hawaiians \nto explore whether utilizing indigenous Hawaiian healing methods may \nimpact the incidences of diabetes and asthma.\n  Encourages consideration of a proposal to establish a dedicated Human \nIslet Processing and Distribution Center by the Miami VA Medical \nCenter, Jackson Memorial Hospital, and the University of Miami Diabetes \nResearch Institute.\n  Urges National Institutes of Environmental Health Sciences to study \nthe health aspects of volcanic emissions.\n  Urges NIA to consider providing assistance to the West Virginia \nUniversity's Year 2000 International Conference on Rural Aging.\n  Urges full consideration of a proposal by the Birmingham Alliance for \nthe Mentally Ill Crisis Intervention Task Force in Jefferson County, \nAL.\n  Urges consideration of a proposal by the Institute for Responsible \nFatherhood and Family Revitalization in Cleveland, OH, to replicate its \nprogram, and sets aside $300,000 for this project.\n  Urges consideration of a proposal from the Women's Institute for a \nSecure Retirement for pension counseling.\n  Urges $800,000 to be provided to assist in cataloging and preserving \nPennsylvania's library of anthracite coal region.\n  Urges the Department of Education to provide $27 million in funding \nto 18 different colleges and universities for unspecified purposes.\n  Again, this report contains far fewer earmarks than any other \nappropriations report considered by the Senate this year. By my count, \nthe total of the report language earmarks is approximately $35 million. \nCompared to the more than $10 billion in pork-barrel spending in the 10 \npreviously approved bills, this is not a large sum.\n  But the problem with pork-barreling is that the average American does \nthink that $35 million is a large sum. In fact, most Americans think \nthat $35 million is quite a lot of money. I certainly do.\n  And the fact is that this is $35 million that was taken from the \nAmerican people in the form of taxes. And now we, the representatives \nof the people, are earmarking these funds for special interest projects \nthat do not necessarily reflect the needs or priorities of all or even \na majority of the American people.\n  Mr. President, that is why pork-barrel spending is wrong. And that is \npart of the reason the American people hold the Congress is such low \nregard.\n  Again, my thanks to Senator Specter for exhibiting remarkable \nrestraint in the spending priorities in this bill. I hope others will \ntake his example to heart as we prepare to consider conference reports \non the fiscal year 1998 appropriations measures.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of objectionable provisions in \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n      Objectionable Provisions in the Fiscal Year 1998 Labor-HHS \n                     Appropriations Bill and Report\n\n\n                             Bill Language\n\n       Section 506.

Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Kerry, I \nhave an amendment at the desk, and I ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mr. Missouri [Mr. Bond], for himself and \n     Mr. Kerry, proposes an amendment numbered 1124.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is located in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1139, the \nSmall Business Reauthorization Act of 1997. This bill is the product of \nthe hard work of the members of the Committee on Small Business. In \nparticular, Senator John Kerry, the committee's ranking member, has \nbeen extremely helpful and supportive in our joint efforts to produce \nthis legislation.\n  The Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997 reauthorizes most of \nthe credit and noncredit programs at the Small Business Administration. \nOn June 26, 1997, the committee conducted a markup of this bill and \nvoted 18 to 0 to report the bill favorably to the full Senate.\n  In addition to reauthorizing the SBA programs that we are most \nfamiliar with, S. 1139 addresses two significant issues: Federal \ncontract bundling and the HUBZone Program.\n  The bundling of Federal Government contracts requirements is a trend \nthat is increasing in the Federal procurement system. Small business \nowners have testified before the Committee on Small Business about the \nnegative impact contract bundling is having on their ability to bid on \nGovernment contracts. The manager's amendment to the bill includes an \namended version of the contract bundling section that was worked out in \nclose consultation with Senator Thompson and Senator Glenn, the \nchairman and ranking member of the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  The manager's amendment clears up any misunderstanding over what is a \nbundled contract. The legislation makes clear that a bundled contract \nsolicitation is one in which ``two or more procurement requirements for \ngoods or services previously provided or performed under separate \nsmaller contracts'' are consolidated into one larger, bundled contract. \nThis language covers contracts that were previously performed by a \nsmall business and those that were suitable for award to small business \nconcerns.\n  The amended contract bundling section builds on the authority of the \nSmall Business Administration to challenge a Federal agency's decision \nto consolidate or bundle two or more contracts into a large contract. \nIn 1989, Congress gave specific authority to SBA's procurement center \nrepresentatives to challenge a decision to bundle multiple contract \nactions. Importantly, under the 1989 law, the SBA Administrator was \ngiven the authority to appeal a decision to bundle contract actions \ndirectly to a Cabinet Secretary or agency head if the SBA \nrepresentative and the contracting agency are not able to resolve their \ndifferences. The manager's amendment to S. 1139 adds some additional \nfeatures and procedures, and today's legislation does not weaken or \ndisplace the fundamental authority of SBA.\n  I thank both Senator Thompson and Senator Glenn and their staffs for \ntheir cooperation in helping us to address certain issues within the \njurisdiction of the Governmental Affairs Committee relating to the \nFederal procurement system and governmentwide acquisition policy. I \nbelieve the contract bundling section included in the manager's \namendment will help our efforts to be fair to small businesses by \nlimiting contract bundling where it is unnecessary and unjustified.\n  S. 1139 also includes the full text of S. 208, the HUBZone Act of \n1997, in the form in which it was approved by a unanimous 18 to 0 \ncommittee vote. This initiative is designed to stimulate economic \ndevelopment in America's most disadvantaged urban and rural communities \nand make welfare to work a reality.\n  The HUBZone provisions will make it easier for small businesses \nlocated in and hiring employees from economically distressed regions \nacross the country to obtain Government contracts. The measure will \nbenefit entire communities by creating meaningful incentives for small \nbusinesses to operate and provide employment within our Nation's most \ndisadvantaged inner-city neighborhoods and rural areas.\n\n[[Page S8972]]\n\n  To be eligible for special Federal contract consideration, a business \nmust be small, must be located in a historically underutilized business \nzone [HUBZone], and must hire not less than 35 percent of its work \nforce from a HUBZone. For these distressed areas, HUBZones would result \nin the immediate infusion of sorely needed capital as more and more \nbusinesses--both startups and existing enterprises--relocate into \nHUBZone areas in order to improve their chances of receiving Federal \ncontract awards.\n  Importantly, the HUBZone Program will help accomplish an important \nobjective of welfare reform by providing jobs for individuals who want \nto move from welfare to work in the very neighborhoods where many \npublic aid recipients currently live.\n  The Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997 is the culmination of \nhearings held by the Committee on Small Business beginning in early \nl995, and continuing into June 1996, just prior to the committee \nmarkup. The bill includes new authorization ceilings for the credit \nprograms, including the 7(a) Business Loan Program, the Small Business \nInvestment Company [SBIC] Program, and the 504 Certified Development \nCompany Program. In addition, the bill makes the Microloan Program \npermanent, while extending the guaranteed loan pilot for 3 years.\n\n  S. 1139 will make important changes in the SBIC Program to permit \nmanageable program growth while strengthening SBA's oversight of the \nprogram. The bill gives SBA the option to make 5 year leverage \ncommitments, which would conform the program to typical investment \nstrategy patterns. In addition, the bill permits SBA to use fees \ncollected from SBICs for licensing and examinations to offset the \nagency's costs to perform these necessary functions.\n  The bill also sets fees to be paid by borrowers and lenders under the \n504 Development Company Program. These fees are paid in lieu of \nCongress appropriating public funds to compensate for the Government's \nloss exposure as determined by the credit subsidy rate. S. 1139 \nprovides that the fees paid by the borrowers will be reduced should the \ncredit subsidy rate decline.\n  The committee's report addresses some of the operational problems \nconfronting the popular 7(a) Guaranteed Business Loan Program. Since I \nbecame chairman of the Committee on Small Business over 2\\1/2\\ years \nago, the credit subsidy rate, which determines the level of Government \nloss exposure for loans guaranteed under this program, has fluctuated \nwidely. Information and calculations which determine the subsidy rate \nare often not provided to Congress, the Congressional Budget Office \n[CBO], or the public. SBA and the Office of Management and Budget must \ndo a more thorough and accurate job in determining subsidy rate \nestimates. With this improved flow of documentation, CBO needs to \nbecome much more engaged early in the process when SBA and OMB make \ninitial subsidy rate estimates in order that Congress can be assured \nthat the annual estimates submitted with each fiscal year's budget \nrequest are accurate and reflect that best available data and \nassumptions.\n  S. 1139 recognizes the growing contributions women-owned small \nbusinesses are making in our economy. Testimony before the Committee on \nSmall Business has highlighted the importance of business loans and \nventure capital to ensure the growth of women-owned businesses. \nAdditionally, testimony and evidence brought to the attention of the \ncommittee also indicates the failure of the Federal Government to meet \nthe annual 5 percent goal for awarding prime contracts to women-owned \nsmall businesses. In fact, over the past 2 fiscal years, the volume of \nthese contracts has decreased.\n  The Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997 strengthens the role \nof key Federal organizations that are supposed to help women business \nowners: SBA's Office of Women's Business Ownership, the National \nWomen's Business Council, and the Interagency Committee on Women's \nBusiness Enterprise.\n  The bill expands the list of Federal agencies and departments that \nserve on the Interagency Committee, and each agency's designee to the \ncommittee is required to report directly to the agency head on the \ncommittee's activities.\n  The bill seeks to reinvigorate the role of the Women's Business \nCouncil, which is designed to advise Congress and the executive branch, \nby involving more closely the Senate and House of Representatives in \nthe activities of the council. The number of members on the council is \nexpanded to 14 members from 9 members, with attention placed on rural \nas well as urban representation on the council.\n  Most significantly, the bill adopts the text of S. 888, the Women's \nBusiness Centers Act of 1997, introduced by Senator Domenici and of \nwhich I was a principal cosponsor, along with Senator Kerry. The bill \nincreases the program authorization level for creating new Women's \nBusiness Centers to $8 million per year from $4 million per year. In \naddition, it will permit grantees receiving funds under the program to \nremain in the program for 5 years, an increase of two years over the \nexisting program. In adopting this program, the committee recognized \nthere are many states with Women's Business Center sites, and the \nexpanded program is designed to give SBA the flexibility to fund sites \nin those states.\n  The bill recognizes the central role played by SBA's Office of \nWomen's Business Ownership in overseeing and coordinating Government \nsupport for women-owned small businesses. In addition to overseeing the \nexpanded Women's Business Centers grant program, the OWBO and staff in \neach district and branch office within SBA serve critical roles in \nfocusing on the problems confronted by women business owners.\n  The bill recognizes the expanding role of the Small Business \nDevelopment Center program by increasing its responsibilities to assist \nsmall businesses to understand better how to deal with regulatory \nquestions and problems. In addition, the bill provides increases in the \nbase funding levels for SBDCs and sets a minimum floor for Federal \nfunding of $500,000 annually for each SBDC.\n  S. 1139 also extends other important SBA programs, such as SCORE, \nwhich provides counseling opportunities for small businesses by retired \nexecutives, the Small Business Technology Transfer [STTR] Program, the \nSmall Business Competitiveness Demonstration Program, the Preferred \nSurety Bond Program, and SBA's cosponsorship authority.\n  Mr. President, this is an important bill for all our small businesses \nin the United States, and I urge my colleagues' strong support for its \nfinal passage.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the passage of the \nSmall Business Reauthorization Act of 1997. With the passage of this \nbill the Senate will show its support for the very important work of \nthe U.S. Small Business Administration. Each year SBA programs assist \nmore than 1 million American small businesses through direct loans, \nloan guarantees, business counseling and training, and procurement \nassistance. Following a series of hearings this spring, the Committee \non Small Business voted unanimously for the provisions contained in \nthis bill on earlier this summer. There is much in this bill that we \ncan all be proud of and happy to support. In addition to the continued \nsupport of such SBA programs as the 504 Community Development Company \nand 7(a) Guaranteed Business Loan Programs, the Committee has elevated \nthe SBA's Microloan Program from demonstration to permanent status and \nintroduced new provisions that will benefit small businesses: the \nHUBZone Act and the Microloan Welfare-to-Work pilot project.\n  Title I includes the authorization levels for the various programs \nbeing reauthorized in this bill. Title II addresses the Microloan, \nSmall Business Investment Company, and Certified Development Company \nprograms. Title III deals with a very important sector of small \nbusinesses, women's business enterprises. Included in this section is a \nprovision increasing the authorization for women's business centers. \nTitle IV addresses the Small Business Competitiveness Demonstration \nProgram and a critical issue for small businesses: procurement \nopportunities. Title V contains provisions supporting the Small \nBusiness Technology Transfer (STTR) Program, Small Business Development \nCenters, and the pilot preferred surety bond guarantee program. \nFinally, Title VI creates a new\n\n[[Page S8973]]\n\nSBA program, the HUBZone Program that extends contracting opportunites \nto small businesses located in the poorer areas of our country.\n  Mr. President, it is a fact that small business owners often are not \nserved by traditional lending services. SBA operates several programs \ndesigned to fill this lending void and extend assistance to this \ncritical segment of the American economy. From the Microloan Program \nwhich makes loans only in amounts of less than $25,000 to the 504 \nprogram where loan guarantees can be as high as $1,250,000, SBA \nprograms meet a critical need for our country's entrepreneurs. \nAccordingly, I am pleased with the support the committee has shown by \nauthorizing adequate funding levels for most SBA programs. The 7(a), \n504, Small Business Investment Company, Delta and SCORE programs were \nall authorized at or above the administration's requests. All of these \nprograms are critical to the continued effectiveness of the Small \nBusiness Administration and for the future of small business \ndevelopment in our country.\n  The SBA's Microloan Program has been a tremendous success since its \ninception in 1991. Since its authorization, this program has provided \ntechnical assistance and made over 5,800 loans totaling over $60 \nmillion to small businesses in our country. The Microloan Program \nauthorizes intermediary lenders to provide loans under $25,000 to small \nbusinesses and to provide the business owners with technical assistance \non how to run their business more effectively. There are 103 Microloan \nintermediaries located in 46 of our 50 States, including 5 in my home \nState of Massachusetts. Forty-three percent of microloans go to women-\nowned businesses, 39 percent to minority-owned businesses, and 11 \npercent to veteran-owned businesses.\n  The results could not be more stunning. The Microloan Program has \nbeen so successful that there has only been one default of a loan to an \nintermediary in the years it has been in operation. Because of its \ndemonstrated success, the committee chose to elevate the Microloan \nProgram from demonstration status to a permanent part of the SBA \nportfolio of programs and to authorize $28 million per year for each of \nthe next 3 years for the essential technical assistance grants. After \nlistening to the testimonies of witnesses on the importance of \ntechnical assistance to microloan borrowers, it is clear that the \nsupport of the direct loan portion of the program requires supporting \nthe technical assistance portion. The borrowers will not be able to \nutilize the direct loans properly without first learning how to manage \ntheir businesses. I am pleased that the Microloan Program is receiving \nsupport from the committee and hope that we will continue to support \nthe important technical assistance component in the future.\n  Another section of this bill will assist many small businesses \nnationwide. The Women's Business Center provision was originally \nintroduced by Senator Domenici and cosponsored by Chairman Bond and \nmyself along with all the Democratic members of the Small Business \nCommittee. Section 306 makes the Women's Business Center program \npermanent, doubling the funding for the program to $8 million dollars \nfor each of the next 3 years, and extends eligibility for awardees from \n3 to 5 years. Women-owned businesses comprise one-third of all American \ncompanies, contribute more than $1.5 trillion dollars to the U.S. \neconomy and employ more people than Fortune 500 companies. The changes \nmade by this bill will better enable organizations, such as the Center \nfor Women & Enterprise, Inc., in Boston, to continue offering the \nservices that help women-owned businesses thrive.\n\n  This bill also reauthorizes the Small Business Technology Transfer \n[STTR] Program for 6 more years. In July, I had the opportunity to \ncohost with the Small Business Administration a conference on STTR in \nCambridge, MA, with representatives of my State's high-technology small \nbusiness companies. These businesspeople expressed their belief that \nthe STTR Program has been an unqualified success in meeting the goals \nestablished for it by Congress 5 years ago: to ensure that the \nfederally funded research conducted in America's nonprofit institutions \nis given an outlet through small businesses to be turned into \ncommercial products. That commercialization increases the American job \nbase, helps our economy, and allows American businesses to compete with \noverseas rivals. I was proud to be the sponsor of the original \nlegislation reauthorizing the STTR Program for 6 more years and I'm \nvery happy that it has been included in this bill.\n  Many sections of the Small Business Reauthorization Act establish new \nlevels of flexibility for the SBA to administer their programs. For \nexample, investment restrictions on Small Business Investment Companies \n[SBIC's] have been relaxed to allow greater investment in the SBICs by \ncommercial banks. SBIC's will also now be allowed to make quarterly \ndistributions to its investors. This may not sound important to many \npeople, but allowing quarterly distributions as opposed to yearly or \nbiyearly makes it easier for the SBIC's investors to meet their \nquarterly tax requirements. Therefore, an investment in an SBIC is a \nmore attractive investment. Attracting more investment helps the SBIC \nhelp more small businesses.\n  The committee has given SBA more authority in the selling of \ndebentures. Instead of requiring a sale every 3 months, SBA now must \nsell only every 6 months but can hold sales earlier if adequate demand \nexists. This change is also aimed at making the SBA's assets more \nattractive to investors and therefore, at attracting more favorable \nmarket prices. Microloan lenders are also given more flexible rules for \ntheir loan loss reserves. After a Microloan lender has been in the \nprogram for at least 5 years, they will be allowed to carry a loan loss \nreserve equal to the greater of 10 percent or twice that lender's \nhistorical loan loss rate. This provision frees up more resources for \nmany lenders to make more loans and provide a greater boost to the \neconomy. All of these changes have been undertaken in an effort to \nallow the SBA to run in a more businesslike, market-responsive manner. \nI am pleased to support these changes and look forward to the progress \nthat SBA will show in the coming years.\n  A new program authorized through this bill is the Welfare-to-Work \nMicroloan Pilot Program. I originally introduced this legislation to \nbuild on the successes of the Microloan Program by providing additional \ntraining and support for some of today's welfare recipients so that \nthey may be tomorrow's business owners. The bill authorizes $4, $5, and \n$6 million over each of the next 3 fiscal years for this purpose. At a \nhearing on the Microloan Program last month, members of the committee \nheard testimony that demonstrated how it is possible for welfare \nrecipients to become successful entrepreneurs given the proper \ntechnical assistance training. At that same hearing, Mr. John Else of \nthe Institute of Social and Economic Development in Iowa told the \ncommittee about the remarkable success rate they have with their \nMicroloan clients. These clients, mostly welfare recipients and other \nlow-income people, had a 70-percent success rate which is an astounding \ncontrast to the high failure rate for startup businesses. So the \ncommittee believes the goals of the Welfare-to-Work Pilot Program are \nattainable. I believe it is time that we give welfare recipients across \nthe country the opportunity to succeed by expanding the mission and \nscope of the Microloan Program.\n  Finally, I thank the chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee, \nSenator Bond, for his efforts throughout the reauthorization process \nthat have resulted in a very productive and effective bill. His support \nfor SBA programs is demonstrated through his willingness to make sure \nthat the effectiveness of these programs continues by adequately \nfunding them. A provision included in the reauthorization bill which \nwas initiated by the chairman and which I cosponsored after the \nchairman agreed to certain improvements, is the historically \nunderutilized business zone or HUBZone bill. Its stated purpose of \nassisting companies in economically depressed areas is a worthy goal \nthat gained widespread support on the committee. Through HUBZones, more \ncontracting opportunities will be available in the poorest areas of our \ncountry. This is definitely another strike against impoverished regions \nand a further opportunity for American small businesses. I am pleased \nthat is was included in the committee bill.\n\n[[Page S8974]]\n\n  Mr. President, our Nation's small businesses are the backbone of our \neconomy. By supporting the Small Business Reauthorization Act, my \ncolleagues have demonstrated their support for our Nation's small \nbusinesses and their commitment to our future.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, as the Senate considers the Small \nBusiness Reauthorization Act of 1997, S. 1139, I rise to express my \nthanks to Senator Bond for his leadership on behalf of small business. \nAs many of us have stated in the Senate, small businesses today face \nthe daunting task each day of meeting their payrolls, providing a \nquality work environment for their employees, and remaining \ncompetitive. All the while, they strive to comply with a myriad of \nregulations and struggle to satisfy the tax burden government imposes \nupon them.\n  The Committee on Small Business held a hearing earlier this year \nregarding women-owned business. The committee members heard testimony \nthat, in 1996, women-owned businesses employed 1 out of every 4 \nworkers, totaling 18.5 million employees. Last year, these businesses \naccounted for an estimated $2.3 trillion in sales. Increasingly, women \nare becoming small business owners and according to the National \nFoundation of Women Business Owners, the growth of these women-owned \nsmall businesses outpaced overall business growth nearly 2 to 1. In \nGeorgia alone, there are 143,045 women-owned businesses, both full and \npart-time. Women are a vital force in our economy, and we need to do \nmore to remove the obstacles that are in their way.\n  This leads me to think about Carolyn Stradley, a truly remarkable \nGeorgian from Marietta. She offered testimony before the Small Business \nCommittee where she described her experience as an entrepreneur. From \nhumble beginnings, she started and built her own paving business over \nmany significant obstacles. Unfortunately, chief among these obstacles \nwas, and continues to be, the Federal Government.\n  I believe support for women-owned small businesses is important. Such \nentrepreneurship has provided a vital means for many to break the cycle \nof poverty created and sustained by the welfare state. As we strive for \nwelfare reform, small businesses and entrepreneurship provide an \nimportant avenue for many.\n  Mr. President, at this point in my statement, I would like to take \nthe opportunity also to thank Senator Bond for his cooperation and \nsensitivity to the concerns of women-owned small businesses. This \nlegislation before us authorizes the National Women's Business Council \nwith the resources it needs to help women entrepreneurs. I was pleased \nto have worked with my good friend and fellow Georgian, Senator Max \nCleland, in committee to ensure the Council received this critical \nsupport.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Ms. Carolyn \nStradley be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                             C Paving, Inc.,\n\n                                      Marietta, GA, July 29, 1997.\n     Hon. Paul Coverdell,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Coverdell: Thank you so much for your support \n     of the National Women's Business Council. I truly appreciate \n     your efforts.\n       As you know, women entrepreneurs rely on the Council to get \n     a ``seat at the table'' in the decision making process. The \n     Council has successfully raised the profile of women business \n     owners and taken our views to the Senate, House and \n     Administration. In addition, the Council has helped us build \n     an infrastructure to support women's entrepreneurship and the \n     growth of women owned enterprises. Until women business \n     owners are fully integrated into the process, the role of the \n     National Women's Business Council is critical to our growth \n     and survival.\n       As a result of your advocacy, the Council received an \n     increased budget authorization for fiscal year 1998. In \n     addition, the amendment offered by you and Senator Cleland \n     during the Small Business Committee mark-up of the Small \n     Business Reauthorization bill granted the Council a research \n     budget of $200,000. With these additional funds, the Council \n     can continue to be an effective voice for women entrepreneurs \n     within the federal government and engage in seriously needed \n     research on women business owners.\n       It has been a pleasure working with Morris Goff. We have \n     greatly appreciated his hard work and counsel throughout this \n     process. Once again, thank you for your leadership on this \n     issue. I knew we could count on you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Carolyn Stradley,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I also thank Chairman Bond for \nincluding S. 925, the Women's Small Business Programs Act of 1997 that \nI introduced earlier this year, in the Small Business Reauthorization \nAct of 1997. My proposal will expand the pool of resources available to \nwomen-owned small businesses and would allow women business development \ncenters to enter into contracts with other Federal agencies and \ndepartments to provide specific assistance to small business concerns.\n  Far too often our Government serves as a roadblock to small business \nmen and women. Taxes are too high, regulations are too complex, the \ncosts of doing business are through the roof. It is time we did \nsomething to help our Nation's working women.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am proud to offer my support for the \nSmall Business Administration reauthorization. I am extremely proud to \nbe a part of the Small Business Committee and, I appreciate the work of \nmy chairman and the ranking member for their hard work and for working \ntogether to resolve all of the outstanding differences on the details \nof the bill. I also thank so many of the staff for their hard work.\n  Mr. President, there are several things I want to highlight in this \nlegislation. First, I want to offer my strong support for the Welfare-\nto-Work Microloan Pilot Program. Many times, good men and women have \ncome to this floor in support of programs and opportunities that \naspired to do great things for those who needed it most. Some of those \ninitiatives have gone on to become great public endeavors. I am proud \nto support such an endeavor, one that I believe will inspire and offer \nhope to Americans that truly want to break the cycle of poverty and \nbuild a business of their own. This program puts our money where our \nmouths are. It provides upfront technical assistance for business \nplanning, loan application assistance, and development of sound \nbusiness skills for people who we can provide a ladder of opportunity \nrather than just the same old welfare system. If we want to stand \nstrong behind the notion that public assistance should be a hand up, \nnot a hand out, we must pro-actively seek out ways to provide \nmeaningful job opportunities for welfare recipients. This program is a \nstep in the right direction.\n  This program targets traditionally under-served Americans and gives \nthem tools they can use to, not only take themselves off of the welfare \nrolls, but provide job opportunities in areas of the country that are \ndesperate for job growth. This legislation has been tried and shown \ngreat promise. With 2.8 million Americans moving off of welfare, the \npotential for this program is obvious. It's the kind of investment that \ncan return much, much more than what we put in. Let me add just a few \nmore points. The average microloan to an individual is $10,800, not a \nlot of money by Washington standards, but to the man or woman who just \nwants an opportunity to change the direction of their life and that of \ntheir loved ones, it may make all the difference in the world.\n  I also offer my support for the SBA's Small Business Technology \nTransfer Pilot Program. This important program builds on past successes \nof further advancing increased commercialization of federally funded \nresearch projects.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to say how proud I am of the National \nWomen's Business Council and the work that they have done. I am honored \nto have worked with Senator Coverdell and thank him for helping to \nobtain funding for this important organization and the work that they \ndo on behalf of women. I further add that Anita Drummond on the \nminority staff and Suey Howe on the majority side were particularly \nhelpful in this effort and should be commended for a job well done.\n  All in all, there are many provisions in this legislation that I am \nproud to have had a part in crafting. I look forward to even more \nsuccess on a bipartisan basis from within the committee, from the SBA \nand from the small business community in tackling the problems facing \nsmall businesses. I look\n\n[[Page S8975]]\n\nforward to the work ahead. I thank my colleagues and I thank the chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I submit for the Record a cost estimate \nprepared on August 8, 1997 by the Congressional Budget Office for S. \n1139, the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997, which was \nreported on August 19, 1997. The report of the Committee on Small \nBusiness states that the committee does not agree with the CBO estimate \nand therefore the committee did not include the CBO estimate in its \nreport. The Congress and the Budget Committees must rely on independent \ncost estimates from the Congressional Budget Office for reported \nlegislation. From time to time, I too have disagreed with CBO cost \nestimates. I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the official \nCBO estimate for S. 1139.\n  There being no objection, the estimate was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate\n\n\n               Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997\n\n       Summary: The bill would authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     years 1998 through 2000 for the Small Business Administration \n     (SBA) and would make a number of changes to SBA loan programs \n     and programs establishing preferences for government \n     contracting.\n       Assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts, CBO \n     estimates that enacting this legislation would result in new \n     discretionary spending of at least $4.4 billion over the \n     1998-2002 period. Of this total, $570 million is from amounts \n     specifically authorized in the bill for SBA programs--\n     primarily for administrative expenses. The remaining $3.8 \n     billion would be primarily for the subsidy costs of SBA loan \n     programs.\n       The costs include $13 million over the 1998-2002 period for \n     other federal agencies to carry out existing federal \n     procurement programs reauthorized by the bill. Implementing \n     the HUBZone program that the bill would create would also \n     increase costs to other federal agencies. While we cannot \n     precisely estimate the impact of the new program at this \n     time, its costs could be at least several million dollars \n     annually.\n       CBO estimates that enacting the bill also would result in \n     an increase in direct spending of $1 million in fiscal year \n     1998 and $5 million over the 1998-2002 period. Because the \n     bill would affect direct spending, pay-as-you-go procedures \n     would apply.\n       The legislation contains no intergovernmental or private-\n     sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform \n     Act (UMRA) of 1995 and would impose no costs on state, local, \n     or tribal governments.\n       Description of the bill's major provisions: Title I would \n     establish maximum levels for small business loans to be made \n     by the SBA in 1998, 1999, and 2000. It also would authorize \n     appropriations for the Service Corps of Retired Executives \n     (SCORE), technical assistance grants to microloan \n     recipients, and certain activities of the Small Business \n     Development Centers (SBDCs). Title I also would authorize \n     such sums as may be necessary for the disaster loan \n     program and for administrative expenses necessary to carry \n     out the Small Business Act and the Small Business \n     Investment Act.\n       Title II would establish a Welfare-to-Work Microloan Pilot \n     Program and would authorize the appropriation of $12 million \n     of the 1998-2000 period for the SBA to carry out the program. \n     The title also would convert the direct microloan program \n     from a demonstration program to a permanent program and would \n     extend the authorization for the microloan guarantee program \n     through fiscal year 2000. (The microloan program provides \n     technical assistance and loans ranging from $100 to $25,000 \n     to very small businesses.) In addition, Title II would modify \n     several SBA guaranteed loan programs and would allow the SBA \n     to charge fees to certain borrowers.\n       Title III would authorize the appropriation of $1.2 million \n     over the 1998-2000 period for the operations of the \n     Interagency Committee on Women's Business Enterprise and the \n     National Women's Business Council. The title would require \n     the National Women's Business Council to conduct two studies \n     on federal procurement practices and would authorize the \n     appropriation of $200,000 to carry out the studies. In \n     addition, the title would authorize appropriations of $8 \n     million per year for grants to Women's Business Centers.\n       Title IV would extend the authorization for the Small \n     Business Competitive Demonstration Program and the Small \n     Business Participation in Dredging Program through fiscal \n     year 2000. The title also would modify the Small Business \n     Procurement Opportunities Program to require federal agencies \n     to review their attainment of small business participation \n     goals and the effects of contract bundling on small \n     businesses.\n       Title V would extend the Small Business Technology Transfer \n     (STTR) Program through fiscal year 2003. Title V also would \n     authorize the appropriation of $2 million in each of fiscal \n     years 1998 through 2000 for the SBA to assist small \n     businesses in certain states in securing Small Business \n     Innovation Research and STTR awards. In addition, this title \n     would make numerous changes to the SBDC program and would \n     authorize the appropriation of $460 million over the 1998-\n     2002 period for the SBDC program.\n       Title VI would create a new program, to be administered by \n     the SBA, to provide federal contracting set-aside and \n     preferences to qualified small businesses located in \n     designated, economically distressed, urban and rural \n     communities, or HUBZones. The bill would establish goals for \n     awarding a percentage of all prime federal government \n     contracts (beginning at 1 percent in 1999 and increasing to 3 \n     percent in 2003 and subsequent years) to eligible HUBZone \n     businesses. Title VI would authorize appropriations \n     totaling $15 million for fiscal years 1998 through 2000 \n     for SBA to carry out this program.\n       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated \n     budgetary impact of implementing most of the bill's \n     provisions is shown in Table 1. Estimated additional outlays \n     total $4.4 billion over the 1998-2002 period. Nearly all of \n     that amount is for SBA spending that is subject to \n     appropriation. In addition, implementing the bill would \n     increase other federal agencies' contracting costs to comply \n     with the HUBZone provisions (Title VI), but CBO cannot \n     estimate those additional costs with precision at this time.\n       Basis of estimate: For the purposes of this estimate, CBO \n     assumes that the bill will be enacted by the end of fiscal \n     year 1997 and that both the authorized and additional \n     necessary amounts will be appropriated by the start of each \n     fiscal year. Outlay estimates are based on historical \n     spending rates for existing or similar programs.\n     Spending subject to appropriation\n       Most of the bill's budgetary effects would come from \n     reauthorizing existing SBA programs (primarily for the \n     subsidy costs of direct and guaranteed loans). The estimated \n     amounts would be subject to appropriation action.\n       Loan programs\n       The bill would permit the SBA to make direct loans totaling \n     $60 million in each of fiscal years 1998 through 2000. It \n     would permit the SBA to (1) guarantee business loans totaling \n     about $18 billion in 1998, $20 billion in 1999, and $23 \n     billion in 2000, (2) make direct loans totaling $60 million \n     in each of fiscal years 1998 through 2000, and (3) make an \n     indefinite amount of disaster loans over the 1998-2000 \n     period. Table 2 shows the loan levels authorized by the bill \n     for SBA's business and disaster loans as well as the \n     estimated subsidy cost and administrative expenses for those \n     loans.\n\n             TABLE 1.--ESTIMATED BUDGETARY EFFECTS OF THE SMALL BUSINESS REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1997            \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                      By fiscal years in millions of dollars--                  \n                                   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        1997         1998         1999         2000         2001         2002   \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                      SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION\\1\\                                      \nSpending Under Current Law:                                                                                     \n    Budget Authority\\2\\...........          873            0            0            0            0            0\n    Estimated Outlays.............          820          299           65           21            9            0\nProposed Changes:                                                                                               \n    Specified Authorization Level.            0          151          157          163          103          103\n    Estimated Authorization Level.            0        1,226        1,274        1,327           13           13\n                                   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Total Authorization Level...            0        1,377        1,431        1,490          116          116\nEstimated Outlays.................            0          871        1,276        1,444          583          189\nSpending Under The Bill:                                                                                        \n    Authorization Level\\2\\........          873        1,377        1,431        1,490          116          116\n    Estimated Outlays.............          820        1,171        1,341        1,465          592          189\n                                                                                                                \n                                           CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING                                           \n                                                                                                                \n    Estimated Budget Authority....            0            1            1            1            1            1\nEstimated Outlays.................            0            1            1            1            1           1 \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ All but approximately $15 million of the estimated amounts are for projected spending by the SBA.

(The subsidy cost is the \n     estimated long-term cost to the government of a direct loan \n     or loan guarantee, calculated on a net present value basis, \n     excluding administrative costs.) The bill does not provide an \n     explicit authorization for either the subsidy or \n     administrative costs for the guaranteed, direct, or disaster \n     loans.\n       Based on information from the SBA and on historical data \n     for these loan programs, CBO estimates that the subsidy costs \n     of guarantees for the authorized levels of business loans \n     would be $344 million in 1998, $374 million in 1999, and $415 \n     million in 2000. We estimate that the subsidy costs of the \n     direct business loans would be $6 million for each of \n     fiscal years 1998 through 2000. Based on recent \n     administrative costs for the SBA's loan programs, CBO \n     estimates that the administrative costs for the business \n     loan programs would be about $94 million in fiscal year \n     1998, $97 million in fiscal year 1999, and $100 million in \n     fiscal year 2000.\n       The estimated subsidy rates for business loans and \n     guarantees range from 0.5 percent to 8.1 percent, but most \n     are at 2 percent or less and the average for this estimate is \n     1.9 percent. The estimated subsidy rate for disaster loans is \n     about 30 percent.\n       Assuming that demand for SBA's disaster loans over the next \n     three years will be at the average historical rate for the \n     past six years, CBO projects that the SBA would make disaster \n     loans totaling about $1.5 billion in each fiscal year over \n     the 1998-2000 period. CBO estimates that the subsidy costs of \n     these loans would be $459 million in each fiscal year and \n     that the administrative costs for the disaster loan program \n     would be about $164 million in 1998, $169 million in 1999, \n     and $174 million in 2000.\n\n\n                              surety bonds\n\n       The bill would authorize the SBA to guarantee up to $2 \n     billion in surety bonds for small businesses in each of the \n     fiscal years 1998, 1999, and 2000. Such guarantees are not \n     considered loan guarantees under the definition in the \n     Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, and annual appropriations \n     are required only to cover the net cash losses to the program \n     within a given year. Based on information from the SBA, CBO \n     estimates that the authorized level of activity would result \n     in outlays of $4 million each year over the 1998-2000 period.\n\n\n                    government contracting programs\n\n       The legislation would modify a number of government \n     contracting programs administered by the SBA that provide \n     set-asides or other incentives for small businesses competing \n     for government procurement contracts. The costs to the SBA to \n     administer these programs are generally small or \n     insignificant but the programs result in additional costs to \n     the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) and various \n     federal agencies.\n       Small Business Competitive Demonstration Program. The bill \n     would reauthorize the Small Business Competitive \n     Demonstration Program through fiscal year 2000. This program \n     requires 10 federal agencies to establish contracting goals \n     for small businesses in certain industries. CBO estimates \n     that extending this program would cost each of the 10 \n     participating agencies and the SBA less than $100,000 a year \n     to report and compile the required data, assuming \n     appropriation of the necessary amounts. Hence, we estimate a \n     total annual cost of about $1 million for each year that the \n     program is extended.\n       Small Business Participation in Dredging Program. Based on \n     information from the Army Corps of Engineers, CBO estimates \n     that extending the Small Business Participation in Dredging \n     Program would cost less than $500,000 annually over the 1998-\n     2000 period.\n       STTR Progam. The bill would extend this program's \n     expiration date from 1998 through 2000. The STTR program \n     requires federal agencies with annual appropriations for \n     extramural research of more than $1 billion to set aside a \n     specified percentage of their extramural research budget for \n     cooperative research between small businesses and a federal \n     laboratory or nonprofit research center. The costs of the \n     STTR program to the participating agencies consist primarily \n     of personnel, overhead, printing, and mailing expenses. Based \n     on information from the affected agencies, CBO estimates that \n     the costs of administering the awards would be about $1 \n     million a year over the 1998-2000 period, assuming \n     appropriation of the necessary amounts.\n       Small Business Procurement Opportunities Program. The bill \n     would require federal agencies to follow certain procedures \n     when bundling procurement contracts. Based on information \n     from the OFPP, the SBA, and several other federal agencies, \n     CBO estimates that the government would incur costs of about \n     $2.5 million in fiscal year 1998 and $1.5 million a year in \n     1999 and 2000 to follow the procedures established by the \n     bill. The costs to the federal government would be slightly \n     higher in fiscal year 1998 because each federal agency would \n     incur expenses to modify its reporting systems in order to \n     track information on contract building.\n       HUBzone Program. The contracting goals and requirements \n     that would be established by Title VI would apply to \n     specified federal agencies, which make over 90 percent of all \n     federal contract obligations (as of 1996). Assuming the \n     federal agencies would attempt to meet the government-wide \n     contracting goals establishing in the bill, and assuming \n     appropriation of the amounts necessary to meet the increase \n     in costs, implementing the HUBZone program would \n     significantly increase discretionary spending. Such costs \n     could total tens of millions of dollars each year, but CBO \n     cannot estimate such costs precisely. The additional costs \n     would stem from both additional administrative \n     responsibilities for the SBA and other federal agencies, and \n     increased use of sole-source contracting.\n       Based on information from the SBA, we estimate that \n     implementing the HUBZone program would cost the SBA $6 \n     million in fiscal year 1998 and $12 million in each \n     subsequent year, assuming appropriation of the necessary \n     amounts. Thus, implementing the HUBZone program would result \n     in new discretionary spending by the SBA of $54 million over \n     the 1998-2002 period. Of this amount, $15 million is \n     specifically authorized in the bill for SBA to implement the \n     program. In addition to the authorized amounts, CBO estimates \n     that SBA would require another $39 million over the 1998-2002 \n     period to carry out the HUBZone program.\n       The other federal agencies affected by Title VI would have \n     additional administrative costs for reviewing contracts, \n     reprogramming computer systems, and reporting to the SBA. \n     However, CBO cannot estimate how much those new \n     responsibilities may increase spending because we do not have \n     sufficient data to project how many contracts would be \n     awarded under the HUBZone program or what administrative \n     resources would be required to carry out the program.\n       The HUBZone program would raise the government-wide goal \n     for awarding contracts to small businesses from 20 percent to \n     23 percent of all prime federal contracts, which would likely \n     increase the incidence of sole-source contracting. Federal \n     contract obligations total almost $200 billion a year, of \n     which about 19 percent is provided through sole-source \n     contracts. Although CBO cannot project a specific increase in \n     sole-source contracting, any increase resulting from the \n     HUBZone program would result in new federal costs because the \n     lack of competition often results in a higher price for the \n     product or service. While we cannot estimate precise costs \n     for the likely increase in sole-source contracting under the \n     HUBZone program, such costs could total at least several \n     million dollars annually.\n       Other programs\n       The bill would provide specific authorizations of \n     appropriations for SBDCs, SCORE,\n\n[[Page S8977]]\n\n     the Welfare-to-Work Microloan Program, and various women's \n     business programs. CBO estimates that these programs would \n     result in spending by the SBA of $555 million over the next \n     five years.\n       In addition, the bill would authorize such sums as may be \n     necessary to cover the SBA's costs of carrying out the Small \n     Business Act and the Small Business Investment Company Act. \n     CBO estimates that the general administrative costs to carry \n     out these acts would be $149 million in fiscal year 1998, \n     $154 million in fiscal year 1999, and $158 million in fiscal \n     year 2000, assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts. \n     (The estimate of general administrative costs excludes the \n     program-specific administrative expenses for business and \n     disaster loans.)\n     Direct spending\n       The bill would authorize the SBA to spend without further \n     authorization the Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) \n     examination fees currently collected by the agency but not \n     available for spending unless authorized in advance in an \n     appropriation act. Based on information from the SBA, CBO \n     estimates that the agency would collect and spend about $1 \n     million annually in examination fees.\n       Pay-as-you-go considerations: Section 252 of the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 sets up pay-\n     as-you-go procedures for legislation affecting direct \n     spending or receipts through 2007. CBO estimates that \n     enacting the bill would increase direct spending by $1 \n     million a year because SBA would be able to spend SBIC \n     examination fees without appropriation action.\n       Estimated impact on State, local, and tribal governments: \n     The bill contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in \n     UMRA, and would not impose any costs on State, local, or \n     tribal governments. The bill would, however, authorize \n     additional grant funds for State and local governments. It \n     would authorize $2 million annually (for fiscal years 1998 \n     through 2000) to create a pilot program that would provide \n     grants to eligible states to assist small businesses located \n     in the state. The bill would also authorize an increase in \n     funding of $5 million in fiscal year 1999 and $10 million \n     thereafter for the Small Business Development Center Program. \n     The program provides grants to state and local governments, \n     public and private institutions of higher education, and \n     state-chartered development corporations to establish and \n     operate small business development centers.\n       Estimated impact on the private sector: This bill would \n     impose no new private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA.\n       Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: Rachel Forward and \n     Lisa Daley. Impact on State, Local, and Tribal Governments: \n     Marc Nicole.\n       Estimate approved by: Robert A. Sunshine, Deputy Assistant \n     Director for Budget Analysis.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1124) was agreed to.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to support a critically \nimportant piece of legislation affecting small businesses across our \nNation--S. 1139, the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997. I \nwould like to begin by thanking Chairman Bond and ranking member Kerry \nfor their leadership and perseverance on this bill. We would not be \nhere today considering S. 1139 if it were not for their dedication to \nthe small business community.\n  As a Senator from Maine, a State whose future economic well-being is \ndependent on small business enterprise, I am extremely supportive of \nthe role the Small Business Administration [SBA] plays in promoting \nsmall business development and growth. The Small Business Committee, of \nwhich I am a member, held five hearings this past year on SBA's \nfinance, noncredit, and Microloan programs. As a direct result of \ntestimony given during those hearings by small businesses, the SBA and \nvarious industry organizations, the committee drafted a comprehensive \nbill that reauthorizes and improves upon even the most successful of \nSBA's programs.\n  I am particularly pleased that the committee accepted an amendment \nthat I offered regarding the Small Business Development Center [SBDC] \nProgram. The SBDC Program is a public-private partnership that \nleverages Federal dollars with State, local, university, and private \nresources to provide one-stop management and technical assistance to \nsmall businesses.\n  My amendment increases the SBDC minimum Federal contribution so that \nno State will receive less than $500,000. This will ensure that small \nState SBDC's will continue to be able to provide quality business \nmanagement assistance, which is essential to the future successes of \nAmerica's small businesses. If entrepreneurs are not sufficiently \nprepared with the financial, managerial, and technical knowledge needed \nto own and operate a business, then our Nation's future businesses have \nfailed before they have been given the opportunity to succeed.\n\n  One of the many reasons I support the SBDC program is because it \nserves as a successful example of what can be achieved when the private \nsector, the educational community and Federal, State and local \ngovernments work together. In fact, the SBDC program generates more in \ntax revenues that it costs to run the program itself. For example, in \nmy home State of Maine, $6.15 in new Federal, State and local tax \nrevenues is generated for every $1.00 invested in our state's SBDC. \nNationally, the return is $4.53.\n  While my amendment provides only a modest funding increase at the \nFederal level, the additional resources provided to a small State like \nMaine will have a disproportionately large and positive impact on \nMaine's economy. And I thank Chairman Bond for including my amendment \nin the Small Business Reauthorization Act.\n  I would also like to thank Chairman Bond for his leadership on S. \n208, the HUBZone Act of 1997, because the revitalization and community \ndevelopment of economically distressed regions with significant \nunemployment is a critical challenge confronting this Congress. It is \nessential that we discover ways to stimulate business and residential \nactivity within these economically and socially distressed communities, \nwhich is why I believe that it is so important that the HUBZone Act was \nincorporated into the Small Business Reauthorization Act.\n  The HUBZone Act will provide Federal contracting opportunities to \nsmall businesses located in historically impoverished urban and rural \nareas known as HUBZones. This bill will create a new class of small \nbusinesses that employ at least 35 percent of its workforce from a \nHUBZone eligible for Federal Government contract preferences. The \npurpose of the bill is to create incentives for small businesses to \nlocate and operate in our country's most economically disadvantaged \ninner-cities and rural counties. At the same time, these businesses \nwill foster job creation and community development in these \neconomically underutilized areas.\n  In Maine, Washington County with an extremely high unemployment rate \nof 12.5 percent--7.6 percent above the national average--will qualify \nas a HUBZone. Qualified small businesses located in this county will \nnot only receive Federal contracting set-asides but also will play a \nvital role in revitalizing this distressed area by encouraging job \ncreation.\n  Additionally, because of an amendment Senator Enzi and I offered, \nboth Aroostook and Somerset Counties with a 10.4 percent and 9 percent \nunemployment, respectively, will qualify as rural HUBZones. The Enzi-\nSnowe amendment establishes that economically distressed regions with \nextremely high unemployment rates will quality as HUBZones and receive \nmuch-needed relief. We must take action to stimulate business activity \nwithin these areas that face high unemployment rates and I believe that \nthe HUBZone Act of 1997 does just this.\n  The Small Business Reauthorization Act also includes another \nimportant piece of legislation, the Welfare-to-Work Microloan Pilot \nProgram Act of 1997, of which I am an original cosponsor. This \ninnovative pilot program will provide grants to community-based \norganizations, known as Microloan intermediaries, to help welfare \nrecipients start their own small businesses. These intermediaries will \nprovide technical assistance to potential small entrepreneurs who are \non public assistance.\n  This program is unique because it will provide up-front business \nassistance before a participant receives a loan. The future \nentrepreneur will learn basic business skills--how to develop a \nbusiness plan, start a business and apply for small loans.\n  In addition to this technical assistance, program participants will \nreceive assistance with the high cost of child care and transportation, \nboth of which are directly related to program participation. If a \nmother is unable to afford to put her child in day care or if she does \nnot have the money to get to the\n\n[[Page S8978]]\n\ntraining sessions, she simply will not go.\n  The combination of business training and child care and \ntransportation assistance will assure greater success for the \nparticipants receiving public assistance. This approach has been \nsuccessfully piloted in several state programs. Iowa, for example, has \na success rate of 70 percent in contrast to a national small business \nfailure rate average of 80 percent. I believe that these programs are \nsuccessful because they target the true cause of the high failure rate \nof small businesses--lack of business education.\n  Small businesses are playing an increasingly important role in \nAmerica's future prosperity, and they should play a vital role in any \neffort to revitalize our urban and rural communities and to solve the \nlong-term problem of getting individuals off, and keeping them off, \npublic assistance. This is exactly why I am a cosponsor of the HUBZone \nAct and an original cosponsor of the Welfare-to-Work Microloan Pilot \nProgram. And, that is why I strongly support the Small Business \nReauthorization Act of 1997 and encourage my distinguished colleagues \nto join me in supporting this critically important bill.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased that we are \npassing this bill to reauthorize Small Business Administration \nprograms. I commend Senators Bond and Kerry, the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Small Business Committee, respectively, for their work. \nIt is an excellent bill, providing adequate loan-guaranty authorization \nlevels for SBA's two principle credit programs--the 7(a) and the 504 \nprograms. The bill also expands and makes permanent the microloan \ndemonstration program, which is extremely important. All three programs \nare popular and successful in Minnesota. Our committee held a number of \nhearings this year to prepare for this reauthorization bill, and as \nusual we have worked in a productive, bipartisan way.\n  Our committee passed a very good bill, highlights of which I will \nmention momentarily. I would first like to note, however, two items \nwhich I am grateful could be included in the managers' amendment. The \nfirst is a provision clarifying SBA's policy regarding collateral in \nthe 504 Program.\n  The 504 Program is an excellent program. It operates through \ncollaboration between certified development companies (CDCs), private \nlenders and small business borrowers. 504 loans are for larger projects \nthan SBA's 7(a) guaranteed loans. They generally are for property, \nplant and equipment purchases. It is the only SBA program with job-\ncreation and economic development as its explicit primary objective. I \nam proud to point out that Minnesota CDCs made 359 loans worth $122 \nmillion last year, tops in the nation for the third or fourth year in a \nrow.\n  I appreciate steps that were taken by SBA officials in a recent \npolicy guidance on this matter of collateral. That policy guidance \nassures certified development companies that collateral is only one \nfactor evaluated in the credit determination of a small business in the \nprogram. Furthermore, the guidance establishes that collateral in \naddition to a subordinate lien position on the property being financed \nwill be required only on a case-by-case basis as determined by the \nAdministrator.\n  The provision now included in this bill relating to collateral simply \ncodifies that SBA policy guidance in statute. I thank the bill's \nmanagers for including the provision at my request in their amendment. \nAs I mentioned to my colleagues on the committee during our markup of \nthe bill, it is occasionally necessary for Small Business Committee to \nsave SBA from itself when it comes to policy proposals concerning its \nloan programs. Not too many years ago, SBA wanted to eliminate all \nsubsidy and appropriation for the 7(a) program. We on the committee and \nin Congress were right in preventing them from doing so.\n  Subsidy rate questions in the 504 Program remain somewhat unresolved. \nThe simple fact is that demand for the 504 program has been down \nsignificantly this year. It is down even after we discount for the \nburst of activity last September, just before new fees went into \neffect, putting many deals that normally would have been done this year \ninto last year's volume. I am pleased to say that the program's subsidy \nrate, which a witness from Minnesota told our committee earlier this \nyear is ``out of whack,'' is now finally being seriously examined by \nthe Administration despite the existence for some time of evidence that \nit has been based on methodology or calculations that keep the subsidy \nrate too high. That matters because it appears that the new fees which \nwe have had to impose on borrowers and lenders, required by the high \nsubsidy rate, suppressed demand for the program, exactly as both the \nChairman and I said we feared might happen.\n\n  That is the main reason for the amendment, which would keep \ncollateral for 504 deals valued at market value. That is rather than at \nliquidation value, as had at one point been suggested by some within \nthe Administration. The amendment does not change current SBA policy. \nRather, it prevents a suggested change, which in my view would \ncertainly have led to a further weakening of the 504 loan guaranty \nprogram.\n  Here is the issue. Under current SBA policy, in a project valued at \n$1 million, 90 percent of the value of a 504 project can be financed by \na CDC and a bank together in the form of loans. The remaining 10 \npercent is required to be provided as equity by the assisted small \nbusiness. Loan collateral is limited ``generally to the assets being \nfinanced.'' This allows the program to offer attractive, 90-percent \nloan-to-value financing. It seems like a good deal, and it is, for \nborrowers and lenders.\n  But it's also a good deal for taxpayers because this program creates \njobs with no appropriation. That's why I want to keep that policy \nworking the way it is. If we had allowed the Administration to change \nthat policy, by switching to a ``liquidation value'' approach for \ncollateral, as had been suggested by some within the Administration, \nthen assisted small business people could have been required to provide \nup to $300,000 of their own equity as collateral, on top of the \n$100,000 equity already required. When demand for this program already \nis being suppressed by high fees brought on by high subsidy rates--\nwhether justified or not--this new blow to the program could have \nseriously harmed it. The National Association of Development Companies, \nwhich represents CDC's around the country, told some of us it felt the \nprogram could have been ``destroyed.'' So I am pleased we could address \nthis concern in the bill.\n  The second provision I would like to mention immediately is a matter \nupon which I am pleased to have collaborated with Senator Abraham. The \nmanagers also have included this provision in their amendment. It will \nallow microloan intermediaries to use up to 25 percent of the grants \nprovided to them by SBA for the provision of technical assistance to \nprovide such technical assistance to prospective borrowers--that is, \nnot only small enterprises which are already borrowers, but to \nprospective borrowers, as well. I appreciate the inclusion of this \nprovision, which allows needed flexibility on the part of microloan \nintermediaries. Minnesota has four microlending intermediaries, and \nstaff from those organizations have told me how important it is that \nthey be allowed sometimes to counsel and assist potential entrepreneurs \nprior to the time they are ready to become an actual borrower. In fact \nthe very purpose of the technical assistance during this period is to \nallow the businessperson to reach the point in his or her business \nwhere credit is needed and he or she might become a borrower in the \nprogram.\n  The bill reauthorizes most SBA programs for an additional 3 years. \nThe loan guaranty authorization levels are adequate in my judgment. In \nthe case of both the 7(a) and 504 program, they exceed industry \nrequests. The loan authorization level for the microloan program meets \nthe Administration's request, although I had hoped to achieve a higher \nlevel for technical assistance grant funding. As I mentioned before, \nthe microloan program nonetheless is expanded and made permanent in \nthis bill, steps which are justified by the program's very beneficial \nperformance. As an original cosponsor of the legislation which first \ncreated the program, I am proud that Minnesotans who utilize it are \namong the nation's leaders. The very small firms which receive very\n\n[[Page S8979]]\n\nsmall loans through the microloan program often have a big impact in \ntheir communities.\n  The bill will allow SBA programs to continue to be among the most \npopular and effective business programs operated by the federal \ngovernment. I know they are popular and well used in Minnesota, where I \nam also proud to point out that we have one of the finest SBA district \noffices in the country, if not the finest. The bill also addresses a \nconcern which many small businesses across the country have brought to \nour attention. That is the issue of Federal Government bundling of \nprocurement contracts. The bill takes steps to help ensure that small \nfirms can compete for Federal contracts, and that the Government's use \nof bundling is strictly warranted when it occurs.\n  Mr. President, I hope the House of Representatives also will act soon \non their version of the bill, and I look forward to voting for passage \nof a conference report so the bill can be sent to the President. Thank \nyou.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nconsidered read a third time and passed, as amended; that the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table; and that any statements relating to \nthe bill appear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, what is the subject matter before the \nSenate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 1076 is the pending question.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, just a few short weeks ago, Congress and \nthe President of the United States agreed to provide $48 billion over \nthe course of the next 10 years as an incentive to States to provide \nhealth care coverage to uninsured, low-income children. To receive this \nincentive, States must expand eligibility levels to children living in \nfamilies whose incomes are up to 200 percent of the Federal poverty \nlevel.\n  Mr. President, this provided a real anomaly, a true injustice, with \nrespect to the State of Washington, and to varying extents to the \nStates of Hawaii, Minnesota, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Vermont as \nwell. In the case of each of these States, though I must speak most \nspecifically to my own, State legislatures had already expanded the \neligibility for Medicare to children in families with incomes up to \nroughly 200 percent of the poverty level.\n  Most of the other States, the States that were designed to be \nincentivized, have mandatory levels of 100 to 133 percent of the \npoverty level in incomes and, therefore, in many cases would get these \nincentives for a very significant expansion of Medicare eligible \nchildren for these Kidcare programs.\n\n  The net result, however, was that for States like the State of \nWashington, the fact that they had been more generous, more \nprogressive, more liberal, whatever one wishes to call it on their own, \nresulted in a dramatic penalty. Our taxpayers, of course, will \ncontribute to this expansion. We will, of course, be providing Kidcare \nto exactly the same group of children that all other States will be \nproviding under the Kidcare amendment, but we will not be eligible for \nthe incentive.\n  Mr. President, if that were allowed to stand, it would be a dramatic \nlesson to every 1 of the 50 States of the United States in dealing with \nevery program for which there is Federal assistance--every program--the \nexpansion of which is debated here, to make absolutely certain that \nthey did not expand those programs themselves, because if they just \nwaited, they would get more money from the Federal Government to do so; \nand if they went ahead on their own, they would be penalized.\n  That is exactly what has happened to us here. Our argument for more \nequitable treatment met with the approval of Members of the Senate when \nwe were debating this issue, and our States were at least in part \ncompensated for the work that they had already done. With the exception \nI think of a single State in the group of five that I have named, that \nbenefit disappeared in the ultimate conference committee report.\n  Justice would require, it seems to me, Mr. President, that each of \nthese States be made whole, receive the same Federal subsidy for all of \nits children who live in families between the previous Federal \nrequirement at 100 to 133 percent and the 200 percent. Because of \nopposition, however, we do not ask that in this amendment.\n  All this amendment does is to say that the allocation that is made to \nall States, on the basis of the number of eligible children, be \navailable for the State of Washington and for these other States to use \nto the extent that we have children living in families at less than 200 \npercent of the poverty level who are of course eligible under our law \nbut did not avail themselves of the opportunity to become insured.\n  In other words, like the other States, we will get the incentive only \nfor children who are not eligible now and who take advantage of the \navailability of such insurance in the future. Because allocations are \nmade by the Federal Government on the basis of eligibility and not this \nprecise use, and you just drawdown on the use, this amendment will not \naffect--I want to make this absolutely clear to every Member of the \nSenate--will not affect the allocations and the ability to use this \nprogram by any other State in the United States.\n  We are not raiding anyone else's money. The eligibility is created by \nwhat amounts to at least the State entitlement will only be using the \nallocation that we already get in theory but cannot use in practice. No \none else will lose anything as a result.\n  Just to make certain that Members do not say this is simply a \nstatement by the Senator from Washington without any basis, I ask \nunanimous consent a memorandum addressed to me from the Congressional \nResearch Service dated yesterday expressing exactly the same view be \nprinted in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                   Congressional Research Service,\n\n\n                                          Library of Congress,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 8, 1997.\n\n\n                               memorandum\n\n     To: Honorable Slade Gorton Attention: Kristen Michel.\n     From: Jean P. Hearne, Consultant, Education and Public \n         Welfare Division.\n     Subject: S. 1061--Amendment to Allow Title XXI Funding for \n         Certain Children.\n       As you requested, I have reviewed your amendment to Title \n     XXI, the State Child Health Insurance Program. The amendment \n     would allow states to use Title XXI funding for the costs of \n     covering under Medicaid certain waivered low-income children \n     whose income is below the Medicaid applicable income level in \n     the state but above the mandatory Medicaid income level for \n     children. These waivered low-income children are defined as \n     those living in states who have incomes at or above 200% of \n     poverty and who had previously not been covered by Medicaid \n     as of April 15, 1997. The provision would allow such children \n     to qualify for enhanced federal matching funds for the cost \n     of their Medicaid services.\n       The amendment would not change or otherwise affect the \n     allocation of Title XXI funds to states but changes the way \n     such funds may be used. The amendment would allow for certain \n     states' allotments to be spent on children who are currently \n     eligible for Medicaid coverage in such states but are not \n     participating in the program.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. I will read the end of that memorandum: ``The amendment \nwould not change or otherwise affect the allocation of Title XXI funds \nto states but changes the way in which state funds may be used.''\n  Will not change the allocation. It will change the way in which they \ncan be used in my State and I believe to a greater or lesser extent, \nthree other States.\n  I simply want to repeat for the purposes of this argument, these are \nStates that did what the policy behind Kidcare in effect requires of \nother States before it was required by this Congress and by the Federal \nGovernment. These are States that went out of their way to try to see \nto it that health insurance was available to these relatively low-\nincome families for their children. It is unconscionable, I believe, \nMr. President, that we should say because you did the job we came to \nsomewhat later, earlier, you are just out of luck. You can continue to \npay for it yourself. You will not get the incentive that Kidcare \nprovided, so on behalf of my own State and on behalf of a few others, \nwithout penalizing any other State in the Union, I am asking for the \nreasonable treatment, the fair treatment, that this amendment provides.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous consent it be \ncharged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, it is very unusual for me to come to \nthe floor to oppose an amendment by my two very distinguished \ncolleagues from the State of Washington, Senator Gorton and Senator \nMurray. I respect them both immensely. I have worked with them both \nclosely. In offering this amendment, I understand what it is they are \ntrying to do. There are many who look at States like Oregon and the \nState of Washington and Wisconsin and Minnesota and say these are truly \nprogressive States, their governments are doing things which other \nState governments ought to be doing. Philosophically, therefore, it \nwould be natural for them to come to the floor to ask for some kind of \nexemption with respect to the children's health care bill.\n  I come to the floor as somebody who has worked for a very long time \non\n\n[[Page S8991]]\n\nhealth care, and who has worked virtually full time on this children's \nhealth insurance bill. This legislation is a huge accomplishment in \nterms of this Congress and the President. The children's health \ninitiative is the biggest thing to happen in health care since the mid-\n1960's. Because of my experience in working on health care, and the \nchildren's initiative in particular, I am extremely leery about opening \nup the children's health legislation for amendment. I know that the \nchairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Roth, has said \nexactly that, and I know Senator Moynihan has said exactly that. I am \nnot sure there are many people who have talked against this amendment, \nwhich worries me because, on the face of it, it sounds like a \nreasonable request, a progressive State asking for an exemption because \nthey are doing things at 200 percent of poverty, which most of the rest \nof the States are not.\n  Mr. President, I can tell you that this was a very difficult \nagreement to reach, the children's health insurance bill. There was the \nwhole issue of whether funding should be made available for health care \nservices as opposed to health care insurance? There was the whole issue \nof whether the Federal Government should have a say, since it is \nFederal dollars, in terms of how the money should be spent. The benefit \npackage, which is something I care enormously about, in the children's \nhealth care bill is not as good as Medicaid, which is already currently \navailable to millions of children in this country. And there was the \nquestion that I fought for, as did others, and didn't succeed, on \nwhether vision and hearing should be included. You can make an \nenormously powerful case that if you don't provide hearing services, \nthen you won't catch the problems children are experiencing in hearing, \nwho then will stop learning. And, if you don't offer vision care, all \nkinds of other things happen. It was a very controversial bill. It was \nreached with great difficulty; the culmination and the consensus was \nreached with very great difficulty.\n  I firmly believe it would be very unwise for us to agree to the \nGorton-Murray amendment simply because there will be a lot of other \npeople following their lead, and leaders of other States will be \nfollowing them through the door saying they do 200 percent of poverty, \nbut we do 185 percent or 190 percent of poverty, or we are going to be \ndoing it next year. There will be this and that, and all of a sudden \nthe $24 billion will be quickly eroded.\n  Now, am I saying that as a knee-jerk response against what is a very \ngood-faith effort on the part of the Senators from the State of \nWashington to improve their situation? No. I am opposing the amendment \nout of a genuine concern, accompanied by some degree of terror that, if \nthis amendment passes, there will be many others that follow. One can \nalmost say that, for example, had there not been votes this evening, I \nwas meant to go to West Virginia to discuss with the Governor, Cecil \nUnderwood, a Republican, how he and I were going to work together to \nhelp implement--to make sure that the children's health insurance bill \nworks successfully in West Virginia. We don't do things as generously \nas the State of Washington because we cannot, we don't have the money. \nMy point is that the children's health program is just being \nimplemented. The ink is barely dry. The implementation date has not \neven arrived yet.\n  There is a very genuine concern on the part of those of us who care \nabout health care that if we start modifying the agreement on \nchildren's health that was reached by the Congress and the White House \nthat we will be in trouble. There are still 10 million children in this \ncountry that do not have health insurance. I remember there was common \nwisdom on the floor of the Senate that if we got the $16 billion for \nchildren's health insurance in the budget we could insure 5 million \nuninsured children. And if we got extra money--$8 billion or more from \nthe tobacco tax--then we could insure all of the 10 million children. \nThat was the hope for a period of time on this floor. As it turns out, \nit is much harder. It is much more difficult. And even with the full \n$24 billion we may only be able to reach 3.6 million American children \nwho do not now have health insurance. In fact, the Congressional Budget \nOffice, I think in responding to the submission of this amendment to \nthem by Senators Gorton and Murray, indicated that, if this amendment \nis passed, it will result in 30,000 fewer children receiving health \ninsurance coverage--not health services but health insurance coverage. \nHealth insurance coverage is all that matters. That is the wraparound. \nThat is the safety net. That is what guarantees your situation for the \nfuture. If we adopt this amendment, others will want special treatment \nand it would not be long before the $24 billion was eroded away.\n  So, again I emphasize the respect that I have for the two Senators \nfrom Washington. I emphasize that they have every right, just on the \nbasis of the progressiveness of their State, to request this kind of an \namendment. But, if they do, there are going to be many States--in the \nSouth, the Midwest, the Northeast, and the West--that are going to be \nlosing as a result of it because others will come in with other \nrequests, and gradually the $24 billion in new funding disappears.\n  So as somebody who cares passionately about health insurance being \navailable to all 10 million children, and who a few years ago fought \nfor health insurance to be available to 37 million Americans--now 40 \nmillion--who don't have it, I am rejoicing in the 3.6 million children \nwho will get health insurance under the children's health insurance \nbill. But I do not want to see any fewer get it.\n  Therefore, I reluctantly, but energetically, oppose this amendment. I \nhope that my colleagues will understand that there are a lot of \nchildren across America that need to be protected and can best be \nprotected by defeating this amendment.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it is difficult for me to express my \ndisappointment in the position taken by my friend from West Virginia, \nalthough across party lines we have become so close personally to one \nanother in a longtime, longstanding debate of great importance, that it \nalways seems to me emotionally at least that we are likely to agree on \nother issues as well. I am greatly disappointed that we don't on this \none.\n  He tells me that he had hoped to go and visit with the Governor of \nWest Virginia on this subject today. Yet, the position he takes here is \nthat while West Virginia should be--and I agree with him should be--\nentitled to an incentive for all of the new children who become \neligible for Kidcare because their families' incomes are not more than \n200 percent of the poverty line, that not only should the State of \nWashington be deprived of that incentive for children in exactly the \nsame position who receive Kidcare through the State at the present time \nbut that we shouldn't even be able to get the incentive for those who \ndo not yet receive it who are in precisely the position of the children \nin West Virginia for whose circumstances he so eloquently speaks. I \nfind it is hard to see that anyone could justify a situation such as \nthat. But that is the situation in the bill as it was passed, not the \nsituation as it was written here in the Senate.\n\n  We had the Senate version--Senator Murray and I. With this amendment \nit would have been unnecessary. The Senator expresses apprehension that \nif this amendment passes there will be many more States with requests.\n  But I simply say to the Senator that we already have an agreement on \nthe amendments that are going to be considered on this bill. Someone \nmay do it someday in the future in some other set of circumstances but \nnot on the bill that deals with Medicaid and Medicare for the whole \nnext year.\n  In any event, the idea that you can't do something that is right \nbecause it might create a precedent in the future to do something that \nis wrong is not a form of argument that seems to me to be especially \npersuasive. Since it is impossible for that to happen in connection \nwith this bill, it perhaps has even less weight.\n\n[[Page S8992]]\n\n  Obviously, there are differences with respect to this amendment. I \nregret that I have fought, and we worked diligently to see whether or \nnot we couldn't come up with something that simply could be agreed to, \nas many other amendments on this bill have--we have not obviously been \nable to do that. I greatly regret it. But I greatly regret the position \non the part of other Senators that, we have ours, it is tough on you, \nyou don't need it.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, will the Senator from Washington \nyield? I am not asking him to yield, but I simply would like to reply \nto what it was that he said.\n  The last thing in the world that I want the Senator from Washington, \nor anybody else, to think is we have ours, let others take care of \ntheir own.\n  First, I think the Senator from the State of Washington knows that is \nnot the kind of legislator I am, in the first place. And, second, this \nis not about we have ours, and let others take care of their own.\n  This is a question of trying to keep stitched together an extremely \nfragile program about which there was enormous controversy. Enormous \nheat was generated. I was actually almost surprised when it passed not \nonly in the Congress but was signed by the President. I would simply \nsay that I understand that the UC agreement on this bill prevents \nSenators from offering similar amendments on this bill. But as a \nSenator who is on the Senate Finance Committee, the Governors were \nalways asking for more ways to do things, new ways to get money, more \nflexibility. The list of demands kept growing.\n  Yes, I will fight for the children of West Virginia. But what I am \nthinking about here really is holding this program together, giving it \na chance to work, not precluding the idea of the Senators from the \nState of Washington being able to introduce this kind of amendment a \nyear or so from now, but simply let us get the children's health \nprogram implemented. Let us have a chance to see how it is going before \nwe start exempting this situation and then that situation.\n  I hope that will be cleared by the parties.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator be good enough to yield?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Of course.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I have listened to the Senator from West Virginia. I \nagree with his position. I heard earlier today Chairman Roth's \nopposition to this effort. And I understand other members of the \nRepublican leadership also intend to speak on their concerns and \nopposition to this amendment.\n  Even under the proposal as it was recently passed, we will only reach \nabout half of the currently uninsured children. As the Senator \nremembers, we had a more expansive and robust program that might have \nprovided the kind of extensive coverage that the Senator from \nWashington was talking about. And with the work of the Senator from \nWest Virginia and the Senator from Rhode Island, we explored options to \nexpand coverage among working families in a manner that would have also \nhelped states that have already acted to expand Medicaid eligibility \nguidelines. However, that proposal failed, and the program signed into \nlaw was designed instead to fit on top of what each state is currently \ndoing. The new $24 billion investment in children's health is supposed \nto provide assistance to the 10 million children in working families \nwhose parents are unable to afford health insurance and are not \ncurrently eligible for Medicaid.\n\n  So, with all due respect, it is difficult to argue in the abstract \nthat we are pitting one type of uninsured child against another. The \npoint of this new program is to build upon current state efforts to \nwork up the income scale from what is currently being done in a state \nto ensure that the sons and daughters of working parents receive \ncoverage. We are talking about teachers, nurses aides, janitors, and \nother professionals whose salaries are too low to enable them to \npurchase health insurance but too high to qualify for Medicaid. These \nare hard-working Americans who put in 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the \nyear.\n  I would join with the Senator from Washington and the Senator from \nWest Virginia to see an expansion of this program.\n  Through the work of the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Roth, \nSenator Moynihan and others in that conference, we were able with the \nleadership of the President to get a good program enacted. But we are \nstill probably going to need to enhance that program or strengthen it \ndown the road.\n  As I understand the Senator's position, we ought to put the new \nprogram in place, find out what those needs are, and then I am sure the \nSenator from West Virginia will be a leader here in the Senate to make \nsure that we are going to help and assist families in the State of \nWashington, West Virginia, or Massachusetts to try to make sure that \nthe sons and daughters of working families that are not covered are \ngoing to be able to get some coverage. Is that correct?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. In response to the Senator, I wholly agree with what \nhe said, by trying to make two points. One is that when we were first \ncontemplating this children's health insurance bill and the whole key \nconcept of maybe getting as much as $24 billion, or even perhaps more \nthan that, it was sort of understood that first we were going to insure \n5 million children of the families that had the least resources to buy \nhealth insurance, and then we would move on to those who had a little \nbit more resources but still would not be able to afford buying health \ninsurance from the private market for their children. We were talking \nabout 10 million children. There was a lot of opposition to insuring 10 \nmillion children. It wasn't 40 million Americans, but it was 10 million \nchildren. Then even with the $24 billion that was applied to the \nprogram we are now faced with the prospect of maybe only being able to \ncover 3.6 million children, leaving, therefore, many of the 10 million \nuncovered.\n  I think the Senator is also correct when he says this in no way \nprecludes--I said that in my remarks earlier--the State of Washington, \nwhich has clearly moved out ahead of others, from, once the ink is dry, \nonce we have seen a little bit more about how this works out, to be \nable to come back based on the ability of this particular State and \nothers to be able to do more.\n  But at this point, I am very, very nervous given, frankly, the rather \ncapacious nature of the Governors in trying to bring this money to \nthem, having to put in fairly strict guidelines about what could be \nspent on health care services as opposed to health interests, which \nregrettably are different things. I really want to see the program \nwork, and I think we need to give it a chance to work and then come \nback. And I will be the first to support the State of Washington and \nothers that have done more than other States. But let us take this \nincredibly, frankly, put-together program and let it work before we \nopen more doors.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. SNOWE). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. How much time is there?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 26 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What is the regular order at that time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington has 5 minutes, and \nthen the Senate will vote on a motion to table.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I see the other Senator from Washington here who I know \nhas an interest. I will withhold my remarks to permit her to speak.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise in support today of the pending Gorton-Murray amendment. I \nthink, as we are all aware, President Clinton recently signed into law \nlegislation that really calls for the largest expansion of children's \nhealth care since the creation of Medicaid in 1965. I worked very hard \non this initiative with my colleagues, Senator Kennedy and Senator \nRockefeller. I was really thrilled to be a part of this historic effort \nto provide real health care security to the most precious and \nvulnerable children in our Nation. I think that is an accomplishment of \nwhich we can all be\n\n[[Page S8993]]\n\nvery proud, and it will not only provide health care security for our \nchildren but economic security and peace of mind for millions of hard-\nworking parents as well.\n  I know the benefits of expanding health care benefits for children \nbecause my home State of Washington took a similar step back in 1994. \nThe State took the lead because it was concerned about the future of \nits children and it was expecting us to enact a comprehensive national \nhealth security act for Americans at that time. The State of Washington \nwanted to be sure that our children were the first priority in any \nhealth care security efforts, and I applauded the action by the State \nand am pleased to report that all children through the age of 18 in \nWashington State who live in families up to 200 percent of the Federal \npoverty level are covered. The State did not have to take that step and \nexpanded their Medicaid program beyond any Federal mandatory level. As \na result of that action, 427,000 children are now guaranteed access to \nquality, affordable health care. This is a fact that I take a great \ndeal of pride in, and I know that our public health system has \nbenefited.\n  In the last Congress, when I started working to expand health care \ninsurance for 10 million children, I was assured that any expansion \nwould benefit all States and that those States that had expanded their \nprograms up to 200 percent of poverty would not be treated differently. \nI had seen the success in my State and seen the benefits of providing \ncomprehensive health care to uninsured children. As a result, I worked \nhard to fight for nationwide expansion.\n  During negotiations, I worked with several other Members to ensure \nthat the amount of funding for children's health care was increased. I \nsupported efforts in the Chamber to fund this expansion at $24 billion, \nproviding the greatest amount of resources available that will ensure \nthe greatest number of children are insured.\n  The final budget reconciliation legislation was a major victory for \nchildren and families in this country, but unfortunately my State of \nWashington will not benefit to the degree I had hoped. My State and \nothers that made the commitment to their children previously and \nprovided coverage up to 200 percent of the Federal poverty level will \nnot be able to access the $24 billion that was provided for in this \nbill. The State will have to expand their current program by 50 percent \nin order to access any of those new funds. I am hopeful that the State \nwill act to cover more children, if the resources are available at our \nState level, but in the immediate future Washington State will not be \nable to provide additional coverage, meaning that the intent of the \nlegislation to cover more uninsured children will not be met in my \nState. We have made great strides in covering uninsured children, but \nwe still have over 300,000 children who have no health insurance. We \nshould be making every effort to encourage our States to expand the \nnumber of children covered, not discourage them from doing so.\n\n  The Gorton amendment would only allow States that have covered \nchildren up to 200 percent of the Federal poverty level to access the \nchildren's health block grant money to cover children from 133 percent \nto 200 percent of the poverty level, meaning that States could access \nthese funds for new children that are not currently required to be \ncovered. Again, this would apply only to new children as of October 1, \n1997. Any child currently enrolled up to 200 percent would remain in \nthe Medicaid Program. We are simply trying to treat new children in \nWashington State the same as they will be treated in Idaho or Montana \nor any other State. A new ensured child is a new ensured child \nregardless of which State they live in.\n  I have heard some of the concerns about this amendment and the impact \nthat it could have on States that are currently at 200 percent. Let me \nassure my colleagues that, unfortunately, there are not many at this \nlevel. I have also heard about the substitution effect. Included in \nthis amendment is a requirement that the State must certify that the \nchild has not been insured in the past. We are only talking about an \ninsured child as of October 1 of this year.\n  Finally, this amendment only applies to those new children that the \nState made the decision to cover, the optional children. Those below \nthe 133 percent will not be included for any match purposes.\n  My colleagues should also keep in mind that there is already strong \nmaintenance-of-effort requirements in the act which apply to the States \nas well. I listened to my colleagues, Senator Kennedy and Senator \nRockefeller. I understand their concerns and I want to remind them that \nwe all share the same goal. I hope we can continue to work on this so \nthat the children in my State are treated as equally as other children \nacross the Nation regarding that $24 billion. Our Governor has told us \nhe needs this amendment to look forward to ensuring new children. I \nhope we can continue to work together to make sure that happens for the \nchildren of Washington State as well as the rest of this country.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Gorton.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 1076, as modified, withdrawn\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, my colleague from the State of \nWashington and I have worked diligently on behalf of what we consider \nto be equity to our State and to two or three other States as well. It \nhad been our firm contention and our fond hope that we would be able to \nsecure the passage of this amendment by unanimous consent. It is quite \nobvious that we cannot. Each of us disagrees with the rationale \npresented by the other side on the amendment. But our preference is to \ntry to live and fight this issue another day, and for that reason I ask \nunanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1076), as modified, was withdrawn.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1109\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, earlier today the Senate adopted an \namendment No. 1109, an amendment that I introduced along with Senator \nRoth, Senator Moynihan, Senator Grams from Minnesota, and Senator \nHagel, that deals with Social Security Administration personal earnings \nand benefit estimate statements [PEBES].\n  The amendment that we passed requires the Social Security \nAdministration to include the employee contributions as well as \nemployer contributions on the PEBES. Right now, when those statements \nare compiled, they show employee contributions but not employer \ncontributions. Due to the support of the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee and Senator Moynihan, these statements in the future will \nshow not only what the individual contributed but also what the company \ncontributed and what their future anticipated benefits will be.\n\n  I think it is a good amendment. It is a disclosure amendment. A lot \nof people are not aware of the fact that not only do they contribute \n7.65 percent of their payroll for Social Security and Medicare, but \ntheir employer matches it, for a total of 15.3 percent of payroll. This \npersonal benefit statement will be sent to every eligible working \nAmerican from Social Security beginning in fiscal year 2000. Americans \nwill receive this financial disclosure every year, so people will know \nwhat they have contributed to Social Security and what their employer \nhas contributed as well.\n  I thank my colleagues for supporting this amendment, especially the \nchairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee and Senator \nSpecter.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I would like to have consent to be able \nto speak for 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to speak.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, there are items that we will be dealing with--the \nMcCain amendment, the Durbin amendment, and also the other Gorton \namendment which we will be voting on in just a few moments--and I would \nlike to speak very briefly on each of them.\n  I strongly support the Durbin amendment which will repeal language in \nthe\n\n[[Page S8994]]\n\nbudget agreement that deducts the cigarette tax devoted to children's \nhealth from the amount of the settlement.\n  In effect, this last-minute loophole inserted in the budget bill by \nBig Tobacco in the dead of night behind closed doors reduced the value \nof the settlement by $50 billion. It was one of the most devious and \nreprehensible actions that I have witnessed in my years as a Senator.\n  The lesson is clear. When tobacco issues are debated in the public, \nthe American people win. But when the debate moves into the backrooms \nof Congress, the tobacco industry's interests come first, and the \npublic interest comes last.\n  It's time that Congress stood up to the tobacco industry and said \n``no'' to Joe Camel and the Marlboro Man. This tobacco loophole has no \nplace in the budget agreement, I urge my colleagues to support the \nDurbin-Collins amendment.\n  I strongly oppose the McCain amendment which would have a devastating \neffect on our essential efforts to address physician work force issues.\n  Medicare pays approximately $9 billion per year for graduate medical \neducation. Over the years, these payments have been a strong incentive \nfor hospitals across the country to increase the size of their \nresidency programs. The increase has resulted in turn in widely \nreported concerns about an oversupply of physicians. The Institute of \nMedicine, the Pew Health Professions Commission, the Association of \nAmerican Medical Colleges, and the Council on Graduate Medical \nEducation have all emphasized the urgency of dealing effectively with \nthis problem, and Congress can't ignore it.\n  In addition, the longstanding hospital reimbursement policies have \nbeen more generous for specialist residents than primary care \nresidents. As a result, most of the growth in the number of residents \nhas come in specialist positions, not in primary care, and has produced \nan extremely serious oversupply of specialists.\n  Congress addressed these issues in the balanced budget legislation \nenacted this summer. We expanded the New York graduate medical \neducation demonstration project into a national program to encourage \nteaching hospitals across the country to adjust the numbers and types \nof physicians they train. The program provides incentive payments to \nteaching hospitals to voluntarily reduce the number of medical \nresidents in training, and to increase the proportion of residents \ntraining in primary care.\n  The program pays hospitals for residents who are not being trained. \nBut the payments are reduced over time and phased out completely after \n5 years. These payments help cushion the blow for institutions heavily \ndependent on the Federal funds, and allow an orderly downsizing of \nresidency training programs, with minimal disruption to the provision \nof health services.\n  The McCain amendment, however, would eliminate incentives for \nhospitals to downsize the overall number of resident positions and \nrecalibrate the number going into primary care. The glut of physicians \nand the imbalance between general practitioners and specialists would \ngo unaddressed.\n  The McCain amendment could also have a harmful effect on rural and \nunderserved areas. The budget agreement established a hospital-specific \ncap on residents, based on 1996 levels. It gave the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services the authority to lift the cap \nfor residency programs in rural and underserved areas if the total \nnumber of positions does not exceed the national cap. By eliminating \nthese payment incentives under the McCain amendment, large residency \nprograms will no longer downsize. This result will hamstring efforts to \nestablish new residency programs to address the health care needs \nin rural and underserved areas due to the overall cap.\n\n  Finally, the amendment would result in over $300 million in lost \nsavings, according to CBO estimates.\n  A critical part of health reform is responsible action to reduce the \nover-supply of physicians and correct the imbalance between primary \ncare practitioners and specialists. The Budget Act is helping us put a \nmore effective policy in place, and we should not reverse the progress \nwe have made. I urge my colleagues to reject the McCain Amendment.\n  The second Gorton amendment hurts students and goes against the \nNation's commitment to helping the poor and educationally disadvantaged \nstudents who need our strongest support.\n  Although meaningful education reform happens not at the Federal \nlevel, or even at the State level, but at individual schools, the State \nand Federal Governments are important partners in helping to improve \neducation for all children. We all need to work together to improve the \nNation's public schools.\n  This amendment does not support meaningful reform. Instead, it shifts \nFederal dollars away from the neediest communities to the wealthier \nones. It guts carefully crafted and widely supported programs with \nspecific purposes. And it undermines the State's role as a crucial \npartner in improving the achievement of all students.\n  This amendment is the wrong direction for the Nation's children and \nthe wrong direction for the Nation's future. It is not an attempt to \noffer a helping hand for local schools. It is simply a thinly veiled \nattempt to dismantle the Federal role in education.\n  Currently, Federal funds help schools and school districts improve \nreading and math skills of disadvantaged students, help teachers get \nthe extra skills they need to teach all children to high standards, \nhelp communities create safe and drug-free schools, and help \ncommunities modernize their schools. This amendment would strip Federal \nfunding of these crucial, targeted purposes intended to help children \nwho need it most.\n  Time and time again, research has indicated that it is in high-\npoverty communities that children are most likely to fall behind and \ndrop out of school. This amendment disregards the research and the \ntestimony that we have heard over and over about the need to help \ndisadvantaged and low-achieving students.\n  This amendment would shift funds from poor school districts to \nwealthier ones. Currently, some States depend heavily on Federal funds. \nAlabama, Arkansas, and Louisiana get more than 10 percent of their \nschools funds from the Federal Government. Mississippi depends on the \nFederal Government for a full 21 percent of its education funds. We \nshould not do anything to weaken that support.\n  As a Nation, we have made a commitment to help all students have the \nopportunity to get a good education. We have a responsibility to make \nsure that public tax dollars are well spent. This amendment provides no \naccountability mechanisms and it is not fiscally responsible. Reforming \nthe Federal role in education is neither a casual nor quick decision, \nand it should not be taken lightly.\n  Federal education laws are more flexible and school-friendly than \never before. States and local education agencies are working in greater \nand more effective collaboration. Schools are helping all children meet \nhigh standards of achievement. We should not undermine these efforts \nwhen they are just getting off the ground. We should support efforts to \nimprove education for all students, not undermine them.\n  I also strongly support and am a co-sponsor of Senator Daschle's \nsense-of-the-Senate amendment with two key provisions--that Pell grants \nshould be funded at a total of $7.6 billion, and that a child literacy \ninitiative should be funded at $260 million this fiscal year.\n  Pell grants are an indispensable source of college aid for low- and \nmiddle-income students. But too often, the current eligibility rules \nshortchange too many students.\n  Today, single independent students at public 4-year institutions are \nnot eligible for a Pell grant if their annual income is over $10,000. \nMany of these students will not benefit from the tax credits for \ncollege expenses recently enacted in the budget law. Greater Federal \nassistance is needed to help them meet their most basic college \nexpenses.\n  A similar problem faces parents trying to pay for college for their \nchildren. Current law is actually a disincentive for college students \nto work part-time to help pay for the cost of their education. Yet over \nthree-quarters of undergraduates now work part-time while enrolled in \ncollege.\n  It makes no sense for the current law to penalize students who are \nwilling\n\n[[Page S8995]]\n\nand able to work their way through college. Many students work full-\ntime during the summer and part-time during the school year. But if \nthey do so, the response by current law is to reduce their eligibility \nfor Pell grants. We should be encouraging students to take part-time \njobs, rather than take out additional loans, as long as their jobs do \nnot become so burdensome and time-consuming that they interfere with \nthe students' education.\n  The budget agreement contained a clear commitment to allocate $700 \nmillion to reform the needs analysis formula for Pell grants. The House \nappropriations subcommittee provided $500 million to meet this \ncommitment, but that is not sufficient. The Senate bill is far worse--\nit contains no funds at all for this needed change.\n  The second part of the amendment will help more children learn to \nread well. We know the dimensions of the current problem. Some 40 \npercent of the Nation's fourth grade children cannot read at the basic \nlevel.\n  Low achievement in reading is a national crisis, and it demands \nimmediate attention. Children who lack good reading skills by the \nfourth grade are far more likely to fall farther and farther behind, \nand eventually drop out of school. President Clinton is right to focus \non this critical problem, and Congress should respond.\n  This amendment will provide $260 million for a child literacy \ninitiative--and it will provide the funds this year. As the ranking \nmember of the Labor and Human Resources Committee, I am strongly \ncommitted to seeing that legislation authorizing the initiative is \nenacted as soon as possible. But it makes no sense to delay the \nappropriation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these two important sense-of-the-\nSenate provisions. We all know that the final bill will be written in \nthe conference between the Senate and the House. I hope we will have an \noverwhelming vote of approval to insist that the conferees find a way \nto pay for these two essential reforms in school and college education.\n  Another essential reform for elementary and secondary students is the \nPresident's proposal for a voluntary national test for fourth grade \nreading and eighth grade math. Schools need clear standards of \nachievement and realistic tests to measure their achievement. These \ntests are a tool they can use to measure their progress and identify \nareas of need to bolster student achievement.\n  I strongly support having the National Assessment Governing Board \ntake responsibility for formulating policy guidelines for the voluntary \nreading and math tests. NAGB is in the best position to oversee this \nimportant issue. This bipartisan group has done an excellent job \nmanaging the National Assessment of Educational Progress. As we all \nknow, NAEP has served to point out how we are doing as a nation and \nhelped educators think about ways to improve our education system.\n  The voluntary national tests, however, will go further. They will \nhelp each school district, each school, each student to identify areas \nof need in order to make the necessary changes to improve individual \nstudent achievement.\n  The tests are linked to national and international standards. They \nwill show whether individual students are meeting widely accepted \nstandards in reading and math. No current test is available to provide \nthis essential information to students, parents, teachers, and school \nadministrators. For families that move from community to community or \nState to State, there is no current way to measure the performance of \nstudents on a comparative basis.\n  The President's proposal for voluntary national tests has broad \nsupport from business leaders, including the Business Roundtable, the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Business Alliance, and many \nothers.\n  It also has strong support from the education community, including \nthe Council of Great City Schools, the Chief State School Officers, and \nthe National School Boards Association.\n  Seven States, including Massachusetts, and 15 major cities have \nalready agreed to use the voluntary test.\n  Voluntary national tests are an excellent way to support local school \nreform and hold schools and districts accountable for student \nachievement. I urge the Senate to reject any effort to deny Federal \nfunds for these tests.\n  Finally, the Nickles amendment is a blatant attempt to punish the \nTeamsters Union for winning the UPS strike, and it does not deserve to \npass. The amendment would require the Federal government to abdicate \nits responsibility under the court-approved consent order signed by the \nJustice Department under the Bush administration. If the Federal \nGovernment abdicates this responsibility, it could be subject to \ncontempt proceedings in Federal court.\n  This is an unacceptable result. It would substitute the Senate's \njudgment for that of the Federal court about the meaning of the consent \norder. This is not how the judicial process was meant to operate, and I \nurge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote \nthat was originally scheduled to occur immediately after the Gorton \namendment occur at 6 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1078\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I have an amendment that is pending, I \nbelieve, amendment No. 1078. I ask for the regular order that this \namendment be considered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Amendment No. 1078, previously proposed by the Senator from \n     Illinois [Mr. Durbin].\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to dispense with further reading \nof the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Madam President.\n  It is my understanding that there is an agreement that in 25 minutes \nor so a vote will be taken which will interrupt this debate. And during \nthis pending period, I am sure that others will be joining us to \ndiscuss the amendment which I have called up. It has not only been my \nintention to call up this amendment, but any amendments thereto this \nevening. I hope we can dispense with this matter. I have waited all day \nfor this opportunity.\n  I think it is an important amendment. It is one that has received a \nlot of attention, but it was an amendment which people almost missed \nbecause, you see, in the tax bill that we considered just a few weeks \nago, it was not until the final hours before the vote that someone \ndiscovered a provision buried deep in this tax bill, which literally \ngave a $50 billion tax break to tobacco companies in the United States.\n  The reason why amendment came as such a surprise was it was not in \nthe House version of the tax bill, it was not in the Senate version of \nthe tax bill. No committee hearings were heard on this issue. No debate \nwas held on the floor of the House or the Senate on the wisdom of this \nissue. But in fact we have come to learn that the tobacco companies, \nthrough their lobbyists, inserted this provision in the tax bill at the \nlast minute.\n  It was a provision which I have called a ``legislative orphan,'' \nbecause for weeks afterward, after it was discovered, no one would \nclaim parentage of this poor little $50 billion amendment--no fathers, \nno mothers, no living relatives. People said it appeared mysteriously, \nthat it was approved by the leadership but no one could quite tell us \nwhere it came from.\n  Well, finally, after weeks of investigation, the USA Today reported, \nthrough a staff member, that it was a product created expressly by the \ntobacco companies and slipped into this tax bill at the last minute in \nan effort to deal with some of the politics of raising the tobacco tax.\n\n[[Page S8996]]\n\n  The tobacco companies have come before us time and again and said, \n``It's a new day. We have learned our lesson. We are no longer the \noppressive industry, ignoring the reality of public health. We now want \nto sit down and settle. We want to work with our legislative leaders in \nWashington.''\n  Well, it was a new day when it came to the speeches, but not when it \ncame to propose this amendment to the tax bill. In fact, it was an old \nday, old politics, old time religion. Wait for the dark of night, and \nin that stealthy atmosphere come in with an amendment worth $50 \nbillion.\n  Here is what it said. We were going to raise the tobacco tax, over \nseveral years, 15 cents. That money was to be raised to provide health \ninsurance for uninsured children across America so that States could \ninvent their own programs and create their own approaches to cover \nthese children. And the tobacco tax revenues would help defray that \ncost.\n  Well, the tobacco companies have decided that they want the value of \nthis tobacco tax increase to be set off against anything they would \nhave to pay in a final settlement, the so-called universal or global \nsettlement.\n\n  So, at the last minute, they come in with this provision, a $50 \nbillion setoff, or break, for the tobacco companies, without a minute \nof hearings, without any consideration in the House or the Senate, \nwithout any deliberation. They said, ``Let's make this part of any \ntobacco deal. We get a $50 billion break.'' It is no wonder that \ncynicism grows across America when this sort of thing is done. It \nreally raises a question about whether we are doing our job right.\n  Some of the tobacco companies have come back and said, ``Now, wait a \nminute. This is nothing unusual. A $50 billion setoff against our offer \nof $368.5 billion--it is a natural thing.'' Well, I am afraid it isn't. \nIt turns out State attorneys general, including Michael Moore of \nMississippi, sent a letter on behalf of this group, and they said that \n``. . . [the] recent action by Congress to use revenues raised by new \ntaxes as a credit toward our settlement is unacceptable. . .'' This \ncomes from Michael Moore of Mississippi. ``As you know, this concept \nwas discussed and rejected by us during our negotiations. This \nindustry''--the tobacco industry--``has agreed to specific dollar \namounts in the settlement, and we will not agree to any diminution of \nthose amounts not specifically set forth in the agreement.''\n  Attorney General Moore, who led this effort of 40 different States to \nbring an action against the tobacco industry, has in fact said that \nthis is not part of the agreement. It was expressly rejected.\n  So the tobacco companies, having lost in their negotiations with the \nState attorneys general, came up to find some friends on Capitol Hill. \nAnd they clearly must have found them, because now in fact we have this \namendment as part of the tax bill, signed into law.\n  The amendment which I propose today repeals it. It says that the \ntobacco companies cannot sneak in here in the dark of night and put \nthis kind of provision in the law. I tried to attack this provision in \nthe closing hours before the tax bill was voted on. Some of my \ncolleagues told me later they were not sure what I was doing, and it \nwas late, and they were not certain what the point of order was setting \nout to do, but they want a chance to vote on it again. Well, we are \ngoing to give them that chance today, I hope, if we do not get muddled \ndown by the efforts of the tobacco companies again to pull a fast one.\n  I am reminded of a story because of what we are setting out to do \nhere. An Irishman was seen digging around the wall of his house. He was \nasked by his neighbor what he was doing. He said, ``Faith, I'm letting \nthe dark out of the cellar.'' That is what we are trying to do here. We \nwant to let the dark out of the cellar in the tax bill. That section of \nmiscellaneous provisions which was supposed to be innocuous, not \ncostly, noncontroversial, turned out to include this $50 billion break \nfor these tobacco companies.\n  I think that what the tobacco companies are trying to do here is to \nstart writing the tobacco liability settlement legislation even before \nCongress gets its chance. And they want this $50 billion break to start \nwith.\n  The tobacco company provision in the tax cut bill says the increase \nin the tobacco excise taxes collected as a result of the balanced \nbudget law will be credited against the total payments the tobacco \ncompanies would make as a result of Federal legislation implementing \nthe settlement.\n  The tobacco tax increase in the final version of the balanced budget \nbill raised $5.2 billion in the first 5 years, and a total of $16.7 \nbillion over 10 years. Projected out to the 25-year life of the \nproposed settlement, we can estimate that the revenues at stake amount \nto around $50 billion over 25 years. I do not know if there was another \nprovision in that tax bill of this magnitude. One small section that \nwill literally cost the taxpayers of this country $50 billion that was \nput in this bill without a minute of debate or hearing.\n\n  That means the new balanced budget law, as amended by the tax cut \nbill, would give the tobacco companies a $50 billion credit in any \nfuture settlement. Boy, that is a good day at work if you can come home \nas a lobbyist for the tobacco companies, and the spouse says to the \nlobbyist, ``How was your day at work?''\n  ``I had a great day.''\n  ``What did you do?''\n  ``I just saved the tobacco companies of America $50 billion without \nanybody noticing. We stuck it in the bottom of the tax bill, and now no \none will ever know.''\n  Well, that isn't what happened. It was discovered. And today it will \nbe addressed directly.\n  The revenues in this bill were not intended to set off the liability \nof the tobacco companies. They were in there to provide health \ninsurance for low-income kids. They should not be used to lessen the \nfinancial liability of the tobacco companies.\n  Moreover, if this provision is not repealed, the tobacco industry is \ngoing to argue that $50 billion should be taken out of the money the \nsettlement envisions for public health initiatives. Keep in mind, these \ntobacco companies sat down with 40 State attorneys general and said, \n``We are willing to reach a settlement. And we are willing to invest \nmoney in public health initiatives to reduce children's smoking, for \nexample.''\n  Now they have said, ``We won't give you $368.5 billion as promised \nover 25 years. We want a reduction of $50 billion.''\n  So what will be at stake here? Enforcement of this agreement, public \ninformation campaigns, smoking cessation programs, industry liability \npayments. We should not give the tobacco industry this $50 billion \nwindfall.\n  I am pleased that Senator Collins is joining me. I see she has come \nto the floor here. Senator Collins of Maine has agreed with me that we \nshould repeal this sweetheart deal for big tobacco. American taxpayers \nshould not be subsidizing the tobacco industry to reduce its liability \nfor past misconduct.\n  The amendment is very simple. It simply says that subsection (k) of \nsection 9302 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, as added by section \n1604(f)(3) of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, is repealed. Or, in \nplain English, the tobacco industry credit added to the balanced budget \nbill by the tax cut bill is repealed.\n  The groups that have joined me in support of this effort grow by the \nhour. I am very proud of those who are endorsing the Durbin-Collins \namendment to repeal that $50 billion tobacco credit.\n  I will read the groups for the Record: Action on Smoking and Health; \nthe American Association of Critical Care Nurses; the American Cancer \nSociety; the American College of Preventive Medicine; the American \nHeart Association; the American Lung Association; the American Medical \nAssociation; the American Public Health Association; the American \nSociety of Addiction Medicine; Children's Defense Fund; the HMO Group; \nthe Latino Council on Alcohol and Tobacco; the National Association of \nCity and County Health Officials; the National Center for Tobacco-Free \nKids; the National Council of Churches; the National Education \nAssociation; the National PTA; the National Women's Law Center; \nPartnership for Prevention; Public Citizen; Taxpayers for Common Sense; \nU.S. Public Interest Research Group; and the Women's Legal Defense \nFund.\n\n[[Page S8997]]\n\n  Some have argued we should just let this provision stand and then try \nto adjust the settlement accordingly, by adding $50 billion to the \nrequired payments. We should not have to expend valuable energy trying \nto increase the settlement price just to return to where we stood \nbefore July 31.\n  We should repeal this provision now, clear the decks, and start from \na level playing field in deciding what the settlement price would be. \nMany of us think the final settlement price should be higher than $368 \nbillion.\n  I might add that my colleague from Kentucky, Senator Ford, is \noffering an amendment in the second degree to this. He suggested at one \npoint he thinks $368.5 billion should be the total that is in the \nsettlement. Though I will not oppose his amendment as written, I \ndisagree with that particular aspect. But whatever the price, it should \nnot have to be artificially adjusted to fix a provision added in the \ndark of night that almost no one knew about and almost no one agreed \nto.\n  Some have also argued that the settlement provision has no meaning \nand no effect. When I brought it up on the floor some of my colleagues \nsaid, ``Well, this is not binding. It is not a matter of law.''\n  I said at that point, ``Then take it out of the bill.''\n  ``No, no, we have to keep it in the bill.''\n  Clearly, the people fighting for it in the bill wanted a strong \nbargaining position. They wanted to say when the tobacco settlement \ncame down, we will start with a $50 billion credit for the tobacco \ncompanies. I do not think the tobacco industry would have worked so \nhard to put the provision in the bill if it was not important.\n  In fact, news reports have indicated that the provision was supposed \nto have been put in the Balanced Budget Act and was added to the \nTaxpayer Relief Act after being inadvertently left out of the budget \nbill. If it had no meaning or effect, no one would have bothered to \nwrite it into the tax cut bill.\n  But make no mistake about it, this provision is very meaningful. \nAlthough it was originally characterized as an ``orphan'' provision \nbecause no one would own up to having written it, the truth finally \ncame out that the tobacco industry provided the language directly to \nthe Joint Tax Committee staff which put it in the bill at the behest of \ncertain congressional leaders. The provision is very meaningful to \nthose who wrote it, namely, the tobacco companies. They stand to gain \n$50 billion for 46 words of legislative language. That is more than $1 \nbillion a word.\n  When you think about the history of Washington, DC, and all that we \nhave done on Capitol Hill, we have literally reached the point where an \neffective lobbyist working in the stealth of the night can come up with \na provision which saves his clients more than $1 billion a word. What \nan effective lobbyist that must be.\n  Regardless of whether we support or oppose the details of the \nproposed settlement, we should all be able to agree that the taxpayers \nshould not be underwriting the cost of the settlement.\n\n  Some have argued we should not adopt this amendment because it might \nslow down this appropriations bill, and it is a very important \nappropriations bill. But I believe the American people and most Members \nof Congress don't support this tobacco giveaway. We must not pass up \nthis opportunity to eliminate it. It is a bad law and it needs to be \nchanged.\n  Those who want to derail the Labor-HHS bill will try to do so \nregardless of whether this provision is in it. We must not let a threat \nto slow down the bill turn courage into cowardice. If we stand up to \nthe forces behind this amendment they will shrink away. They don't \nreally want to try to defend the indefensible.\n  The question also comes up as to whether, if the amendment is \nadopted, the Labor-HHS appropriations bill could be ``blue slipped'' by \nthe Ways and Means Committee in the House, pursuant to the origination \nclause, article I, Section 7 of our Constitution.\n  As a practical matter, the answer is no. Of course, the House could \ndo whatever it wishes. It is a sovereign body. But as a practical \nmatter, it wouldn't have a good case for blue slipping this bill over \nthis amendment because it is not a revenue measure.\n  We talked to the House Parliamentarian's office. They agreed. The \nsubsection of the budget bill that would be repealed by this amendment \ndoes not amend the Internal Revenue Code. It does not impose or remove \na tax. It does not even change the tobacco industry's current \nobligations. It addresses only a possible future credit against the \npayments the tobacco industry would make in a settlement. That credit \nis not a tax credit. It is simply a reduction of the tobacco company's \npayment obligations under a settlement, if there is one. Therefore, \nthis is not a tax revenue measure subject to that objection.\n  Any Member of the House could try to offer a privileged resolution \nclaiming that the provision was a revenue measure subject to the \norigination clause and asking the House to reject the bill and send it \nback to the Senate, but they would have a hard time convincing the \nmajority in the House to reject this important appropriations bill on \nthe grounds this amendment was supposedly a revenue matter, even though \nthe amendment, as I said, does not affect the Tax Code nor anyone's tax \nliability and does not even affect the tobacco industry's obligations.\n  Tobacco products in the United States kill more than 400,000 \nAmericans every year. The U.S. economy suffers a tragic and unnecessary \nloss of $50 billion each and every year from tobacco-related health \ncosts and another $50 billion from tobacco-related loss of \nproductivity.\n  Historically, the tobacco industry was unwilling to admit to any \ndamage caused by its products. Even today, tobacco company executives \nchoke on statements that their products ``might have'' caused some \ninstances of cancer.\n  But the settlement currently being discussed was agreed to by the \ntobacco industry.\n  This secret credit should never have been written into the tax bill. \nIt should be repealed immediately.\n  Madam President, I say to my colleagues, they may have had an excuse \nfor not voting to strip this provision from the tax cut bill on July \n31. Perhaps many of them genuinely did not know it was there. I only \nlearned about it a few hours before the vote. But there is no excuse \ntoday. There is no excuse for the Senate to leave this provision in \nlaw.\n  Now my colleagues have a chance to vote straight up to rectify the \nsituation. The American people do not want this credit to remain on the \nbooks. It is time for Congress to agree and to vote to repeal it. So, I \nsay to my colleagues, don't let the tobacco companies take $50 billion \nout of taxpayers' pockets to reduce their settlement liability.\n  I hope they will join me in voting for the Durbin-Collins amendment. \nThis amendment, to paraphrase an old literary quote, ``shines and \nstinks like rotten mackerel by moonlight.'' We are now bringing it to \nthe attention of our colleagues to let them know that this rotten \nmackerel should be excised from the Federal law, that the tobacco \nlobbyists, as effective as they were in placing this provision in law, \ndid the wrong thing. They played old politics under the old rules.\n\n  I am happy now to yield the floor to my cosponsor on this amendment, \nSenator Collins of Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I am pleased to be joining with my \ncolleague from Illinois in offering this amendment to repeal the tax \nbreak that was slipped into the tax bill at the very last minute to \nbenefit the tobacco industry. I note that the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer, my colleague, the senior Senator from Maine, is also a strong \nsupporter and cosponsor of our effort.\n  This provision, which amounts to a $50 billion giveaway to big \ntobacco, has generated justifiable outrage across the country and \nfueled the tremendous cynicism that already colors the American \npublic's view of politics and politicians.\n  Now, Madam President, where did this tax break come from? It was not \nin the Senate tax bill. It was not in the House version of the bill. \nThere was never any public debate. The one-sentence provision just \nmagically appeared at the end of a 327-page conference report tucked \ninto a section entitled ``Technical Amendments Related\n\n[[Page S8998]]\n\nto Small Business, Job Protection, and Other Legislation.''\n  No one claimed parentage. Like Harriet Beecher Stowe's Topsy, ``She \nwasn't born, she just was.''\n  While no one has officially spoken up to claim this orphan, it turns \nout, according to press reports, that the provision was written not by \nMembers of Congress, but by the tobacco industry.\n  Madam President, this is outrageous. It is backroom politics at its \nworst, and represents the kind of abuse of the legislative process that \nthe American public is rightfully sick and tired of--a secret \nagreement, negotiated behind closed doors, by powerful tobacco industry \nlobbyists, in the closing hours of consideration of a massive tax bill.\n  Congress is currently considering the proposed $368.5 billion global \nsettlement negotiated between 40 attorneys general and the tobacco \nindustry. As we review this settlement, one of our primary objectives \nis to ensure that the tobacco industry has negotiated in good faith and \nis held fully accountable for their past misconduct.\n  Many of us have harbored suspicions about the tobacco companies' \nsupposedly good intentions during these negotiations. We have been \nconcerned that the tobacco companies would simply raise prices and \nwrite off the settlement payments, effectively passing on the costs of \nthe settlement to the taxpayer and the tobacco consumer.\n  Well, Madam President, worst suspicions confirmed. Not only can the \ntobacco companies write off the entire $368 billion as a business \nexpense, which means that 30 to 40 percent of the tobacco settlement \ncosts will be subsidized by the taxpayers, but now the Congress, in a \nmoment of midnight madness, has carved out a brand-new tax break for \nthese companies that effectively reduces the costs of the settlement by \n$50 billion.\n  It is outrageous that we should even consider approving this tax \nbreak and passing on these costs to the American taxpayer. Tobacco is \nthe No. 1 preventable cause of death in the United States. It accounts \nfor approximately 500,000 deaths a year and billions of dollars in \nhealth care costs. The tobacco companies have agreed to the settlement \nas a means of reducing their future liability and are providing some \ncompensation to States and individuals for the costs they face because \nof the disease and addiction associated with their products.\n  Regardless of our position on the proposed tobacco settlement, we \nshould all agree to reject this $50 billion special tax break for the \nindustry.\n  Now, some would have us believe that the $50 billion tax credit is \npart of the tobacco settlement. This is simply not true. In fact, this \nconcept was discussed and soundly rejected during the negotiations \nbetween the attorneys general and the tobacco industry. In fact, the \nStates attorneys general strongly oppose this new tax credit.\n  I have a letter from the States attorneys general. I ask unanimous \nconsent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         State Attorneys General, (a Communication From the Chief \n           Legal Officers of the Following States,\n                                                   August 6, 1997.\n     Hon. Phil Carlton,\n     Carlton Law Firm,\n     Pinetops, NC.\n       Dear Mr. Carlton: We are writing to inform you that the \n     recent action by Congress to use revenues raised by new taxes \n     as a credit toward our settlement is unacceptable. Apparently \n     this action was taken with approval by or at the urging of \n     representatives of the industry. As you know, this concept \n     was discussed and rejected by us during our negotiations. The \n     industry has agreed to specific dollar amounts in the \n     settlement, and we will not agree to any diminution of those \n     amounts not specifically set forth in the agreement.\n       We have continued our support for this settlement because \n     we believe it to be in the best interest of the American \n     public. We have always made it clear, however, that should \n     Congress substantially alter material terms of the agreement, \n     the States would exercise the option of rejecting the \n     settlement and continuing the prosecution of their lawsuits. \n     We regard this action as a substantial alteration of a \n     material term. We ask your immediate agreement that this must \n     be eliminated from any final resolution of this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mike Moore,\n                                     Mississippi Attorney General.\n     Grant Woods,\n                                         Arizona Attorney General.\n     Christine O. Gregoire,\n                                      Washington Attorney General.\n     Robert A. Butterworth,\n                                         Florida Attorney General.\n     Richard Blumenthal,\n                                     Connecticut Attorney General.\n     Dennis C. Yacco,\n                                        New York Attorney General.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. In that letter they state that they regard this action \nas ``a substantial alteration of a material term'' of the agreement and \nthat they will ``exercise their option of rejecting the settlement and \ncontinuing the prosecution of their lawsuits'' if it is included.\n  Madam President, this secret tax break should never have been written \ninto law in the first place. It should be repealed immediately. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in supporting the Durbin-Collins amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \noffered by the junior Senator from Illinois. This amendment would \nrepeal a provision that was inserted in the recently enacted Taxpayer \nRelief Act of 1997 at the last minute that could potentially reduce the \ncost to tobacco companies of the proposed global settlement of tobacco \nlitigation.\n  Mr. President, as my colleagues are aware, a global settlement on \ntobacco litigation was announced on June 20. This settlement would \nresolve lawsuits brought by 40 States against the tobacco industry that \nsought to recoup State Medicaid spending for smoking related illnesses.\n  Under the terms of the settlement, the industry would pay an \nestimated $386 billion over the next 25 years to compensate State and \nindividuals for tobacco-related health costs and to finance nationwide \nantismoking programs. The settlement would further restrict the \nadvertising of tobacco products and impose new labeling requirements on \ncigarettes and smokeless tobacco. At the same time, the tobacco \nindustry would gain closure to the State lawsuits, and protect the \nindustry from all but individual lawsuits in the future.\n  Mr. President, in light of this proposed agreement, I was very \ndisappointed that a provision was included in the recently enacted tax \ncut package that would potentially reduce the cost to the tobacco \nindustry of their proposed settlement. Specifically, the provision--\nwhich was agreed to by the administration and congressional negotiators \nat the last minute--would allow the tobacco industry to treat the \nexcise tax on tobacco products as a credit against their proposed $368 \nbillion payment, assuming that the settlement is codified. Although the \nenactment of that settlement is far from certain, the value of this \npotential credit is estimated to be $50 billion over 25 years.\n  Mr. President, regardless of whether or not Congress and the \nPresident ultimately enact, modify, or reject the proposed tobacco \nsettlement, I do not believe that the already-enacted Federal excise \ntax on tobacco products--which is paid by consumers and is intended to \nhelp provide health insurance for uninsured children--should \npotentially become a downpayment by the industry on their proposed \nsettlement. The fact that the Clinton administration and congressional \nnegotiators agreed to include this provision at the last minute does \nnot mean it should remain in law indefinitely--so I have cosponsored \nthe Durbin amendment to repeal this provision.\n  Mr. President, I regret that this provision was inserted in the tax \nagreement without providing the House and Senate with an opportunity \nfor consideration. As my colleagues will remember all too well, the \nnegotiated tax package was a take-it-or-leave-it proposition: Members \nwere unable to remove this or any other specific provision without \ntaking the risk that the entire agreement would unravel and be killed.\n  Fortunately, we now have the opportunity to consider this provision \nindependent of the broader tax agreement, and I would urge that my \ncolleagues vote to repeal this settlement-reducing provision by \nsupporting the Durbin amendment.\n  Mr. FORD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S8999]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call.\n  Mr. FORD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Vote on Motion to Waive the Budget Act\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act for the consideration of the McCain amendment \n1091. The yeas and nays have been ordered.

I announce that the Senator from Utah [Mr. Bennett] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 45, nays 54, as follows:\n\n                     [Rollcall Vote No. 223 Leg.] \n\n                               YEAS--45 \n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Boxer\n     Brownback\n     Campbell \n     Coats\n     Collins\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Dodd\n     Faircloth \n     Feinstein\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin \n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johnson \n     Kempthorne\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain \n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby \n     Smith (NH)\n     Specter\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner \n     Wellstone \n\n                               NAYS--54 \n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Bryan \n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Cochran\n     Conrad \n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin \n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Grassley \n     Hatch\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Landrieu \n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Moseley-Braun \n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller \n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens \n     Torricelli\n     Wyden \n\n                             NOT VOTING--1 \n\n       \n     Bennett\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 45, the nays 54.\n  Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained and the amendment falls.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, perhaps the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, perhaps the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please come to order.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, may I request that my colleagues who have \namendments on the floor and who have amendments pending stay on the \nfloor so that we can have a sequencing and see where we are proceeding.\n  I would like to see, Mr. President, if we might reach a time \nagreement on the pending amendment by Senator Durbin. I am advised that \nthere may be second-degree amendments to the Durbin amendment. May we \nreach a unanimous consent agreement to proceed with the Durbin \namendment? Senator Durbin is prepared to accept a short time agreement. \nHe has already argued the matter. Senator Durbin is prepared to accept \na short time agreement of 20 minutes equally divided.\n  Is that acceptable to the Members?\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I have an amendment in the second degree, \nand I would be willing to take 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent then that we \nproceed with the Durbin amendment with 20 minutes equally divided, and \n10 minutes for a second-degree amendment by Senator Ford, unless there \nis an objection.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I object.\n  Mr. SPECTER. May I inquire of my distinguished colleague from Alabama \nif he would accept a time agreement on his second-degree amendment?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. How long is the time agreement?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would suggest 10 minutes, which has been offered by \nthe Senator from Kentucky. How about 10 minutes for the second-degree \namendment of the Senator from Alabama?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Just a minute, if the Senator would suspend.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That would be appropriate.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from Alabama.\n  Mr. President, I amend the unanimous-consent request to add 10 \nminutes for the amendment by Senator Sessions in the second degree?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Thirty minutes.\n  Mr. FORD. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Let's please have order. Let's have one \nSenator speaking at a time.\n  Mr. FORD. I would like to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. We have to see the amendment and then we can agree. I \napologize to the Senator. But I have been asked to object since we \ndidn't know what the amendment is, and I am objecting for my \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, might I ask the Senator from Alabama to \nstate the amendment that he proposes to offer?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes. The amendment would deal with attorney fees, \ninvolving payment of attorney fees--payments of attorney fees.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, might the Senator from Alabama give a \nlittle more specification?\n  [Laughter.]\n  Mr. SESSIONS. My amendment would limit the amount of money that could \nbe paid for the plaintiffs attorneys that have been hired as private \nattorneys by the attorneys general, and would not vitiate Senator \nDurbin's amendment, but, in fact, would be in addition to that, and \nwould not undermine or kill that amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alabama.\n  I would inquire of the Senator from Kentucky if that would be \nsufficient to let us proceed with the unanimous-consent agreement with \n30 minutes for that second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I say to \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania, if the Senator from Alabama would be \nkind enough to show us a copy of his amendment, we may be able to enter \ninto this agreement very quickly.\n  I would like to see the amendment, if he wouldn't mind. I have seen \nSenator Ford's amendment. I believe the time allocation we have been \ntalking about is a reasonable one. But I wonder if the Senator from \nAlabama is asking for 30 minutes for his amendment in the second \ndegree. Is that my understanding?\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is correct.\n  Mr. FORD. That is 15 minutes on the side.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Equally divided.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So as I understand it, the suggestion is that we agree to \n20 minutes on my amendment, and then another 10 minutes equally divided \non Senator Ford's second-degree amendment, and 30 minutes on the \namendment of the Senator from Alabama as a second-degree amendment. Is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, that correctly states the issue.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It is my understanding that there will no further votes \ntonight.\n  Mr. SPECTER. My suggestion is that we proceed to vote tonight. \nPerhaps we can, if we can find agreement on putting these all on the \ncalendar with the consent of the majority leader, vote tomorrow. But I \nwould like to see us come to terms with the complete list and at least \nhave a disposition pattern, if we do not vote tonight.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  I hope that we can reach an agreement on this amendment in the second \ndegree on a time limit, and if we can reach an agreement on a couple of \nmore that we have, then I hope the majority and minority leaders would \nagree that we could roll those over and vote tomorrow, and not have any \nmore votes tonight.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, may we proceed? If the Senator from \nAlabama could give the Senator from Illinois a copy of his amendment \nwhile we are talking about the others before we move on, if we can \nsolidify the agreement, it would be helpful. Our experience has been \nthat once we move on\n\n[[Page S9000]]\n\nwithout getting the agreement, sometimes they evaporate.\n  May I inquire of the Senator from Washington--is Senator Gorton in \nthe Chamber--as to a time agreement on his pending amendment?\n  Mr. GORTON. I am not yet prepared to enter into a time agreement on \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, may I inquire of the Senator from Indiana \nabout the testing amendment. Are we in a position to move for a time \nagreement on that amendment?\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I am just \ndiscussing that with Senator Dorgan and others. I just had a discussion \nwith the majority leader on that. We are in the process of discussing \nthat concept, and we are talking to numerous people on both sides of \nthe aisle. We will not be ready to go with that this evening, I do not \nbelieve, but I believe we will be by tomorrow.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, might I inquire if we could reach a time \nagreement whenever the matter is ready for debate?\n  Mr. COATS. I am not 100 percent sure it is going to need a lot of \ndebate if we are able to work out a procedure and agreement on proper \nlanguage, and so forth, in terms of how we will dispose of this. It may \nbe that we don't need an agreement, but I can't give the Senator an \nanswer.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, will the distinguished manager yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would.\n  Mr. FORD. I have a second-degree amendment offered, 10 minutes \nequally divided. I understand it is acceptable. I will not ask for a \nrollcall vote. That might help expedite the decision here a little bit. \nWe could proceed with my second-degree amendment which would have to go \nbefore the Durbin amendment, and then the amendment of the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama which would be after that. We can go \nahead and get his out of way, if that would be acceptable.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I think that would be acceptable. I first \nwould like to explore what we can do on the other pending amendments.\n  If we could hear from the Senator from Oklahoma as to how much time \nhe would need on his amendment or perhaps the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts as to whether we could reach a time agreement and \nvote on the issues raised on the Teamsters matter.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as was pointed out by the Senator from \nAlaska and others, this is an extraneous matter. We had a good debate \non it the other evening. I believe that it would probably take--we did \nnot really complete the debate on it the other evening, so it will \nprobably take some time to reach a resolution of it. But the majority \nleader has spoken to the minority leader about it and talked to me \nabout it in terms of time, but I think it will probably take some time. \nI know the Senator from Maryland was very much involved in it. I don't \nsee him in the Chamber at this particular time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, might I inquire of the Senator from \nMassachusetts whether he thinks it would be worthwhile to explore \ntrying to find some outer parameter of time, 4 hours equally divided--\nsome time limit?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. This has been a matter of some discussion with the \nmajority leader, and I think it would be prudent for us to allow the \nnegotiations to continue without pressing for any kind of conclusive \nagreement tonight. I think we are making progress, but I do not think \nwe are going to be in any position to come to any final conclusion on \nthe amendment until we have had some additional discussions with the \nSenator from Oklahoma and others. So my preference would be to allow \nthese negotiations to continue as we work on other amendments and \nrevisit the question tomorrow afternoon, or tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield to me?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I appreciate the statements made by the distinguished \nDemocratic leader, but I have just counted days and we have 8 more days \nin this month to vote. And we have 14, 15 bills to bring across this \nfloor from the Appropriations Committee that should all be passed by \nSeptember 30. Tomorrow night is the President's picnic, and by \ntradition we would not be voting tomorrow night. That means we are not \ngoing to be voting Friday. Unless we get some agreement very quickly, I \nwould say by tomorrow afternoon, we probably cannot finish this bill \nthis week. We have the Interior bill and we have the D.C. bill yet to \npass and 14 bills after that--13 conference reports, managers' \nstatements from the conferences, and 1 continuing resolution.\n  I am beginning to see a problem developing as far as our ability to \nhandle these bills if these extraneous amendments are going to weigh \nthem down. I urge that we find some way to make up a list to see how \nmany more amendments we have out there and then see what we can do \nabout the time or getting some agreement to terminate this. This bill \nactually is a larger bill than the defense bill. We have been on this \nbill now for a substantial period of time. I think we have to find some \nway to get it to a resolution by at least Thursday afternoon and lay \ndown the Interior bill so we can start that and get some of the debate \ngoing on Friday on that at least. I hope that we would find some way to \nget some resolution on some of these items that appear to be \nunlimitable right now.\n\n  Is there some way we could agree on getting a list and say there will \nbe no more amendments? Could we get a list that there will be no more \namendments raised?\n  Mr. SPECTER. We have such a list.\n  Mr. STEVENS. You have a dozen second-degree amendments so I do not \nthink you can find an end to this unless you get an agreement there \nwill be no more amendments.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank our distinguished colleague, Senator Stevens, \nthe chairman of the Appropriations Committee, for what he has just said \nand for his management of the overall appropriations process. He is \nexactly right. We had discussed this matter, and that is why I am \npressing now to try to get time agreements.\n  We do have a list, but we have not precluded under the customary \narrangement second-degree amendments. We could not incorporate that \ntype of limitation.\n  May I inquire of the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Wellstone, if he is \nin the Chamber, with respect to the amendments he has pending?\n  Might I inquire of the Senator from Washington, Senator Murray, of \nher willingness to enter into a time agreement on the amendment \nrelating to family violence?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would be happy to enter into a time \nagreement after the Durbin amendment is disposed of. I would need a \nhalf-hour of time. I do not know what the opponents would need.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, then I ask unanimous consent that we \nenter a time agreement on the amendment just referred to by the Senator \nfrom Washington, 1 hour equally divided, so she will have 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Washington.\n  I again inquire of the other Wellstone amendments--if the Senator \nfrom Minnesota is not in the Chamber, perhaps we can call him and ask \nhim to come to the floor--if he would be willing to enter into time \nagreements.\n  Mr. President, might I inquire of the distinguished Democratic \nleader--if I might have the attention of the Senator from South Dakota, \nthere is an amendment pending regarding Pell grants and child literacy.\n  I ask, if I might, the Senator from South Dakota, the distinguished \nDemocratic leader, what his intentions are, whether he would be \nagreeable to a time limit?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would be happy to agree to a 20-minute time agreement, \n20 minutes equally divided, if it is a contested amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we have the \nagreement, 20 minutes equally divided.\n\n[[Page S9001]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, I would assume there \nwould be no second-degrees--with that timeframe assuming that there are \nno second-degree amendments.\n  Mr. LOTT. I would accept that in the unanimous-consent agreement, \nwithout second-degree amendments, and then a vote on or in relation to \nthe Daschle amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I inquire of the Senator from Illinois if \nhe has had a chance to see the amendment by the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I might be able to enlighten my \ncolleague, the manager of the bill. We are told by a number of our \ncolleagues that they are not prepared to enter into a time agreement on \nthe amendment of the distinguished Senator from Alabama at this time. \nSo I think it will probably be some time before we are able to do that. \nWe may want to proceed. But at least at this point I do not think we \nare in a position to agree to a timeframe on the amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Democratic \nleader and would ask that they make the review as promptly as they can \nbecause we are ready to really proceed with the conclusion of the \namendment by Senator Ford and Senator Sessions and also Senator Durbin.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from Pennsylvania will yield, I suggest we \nreturn to my amendment, and Senator Ford has an amendment in the second \ndegree and he is prepared to offer it. And at that point, if there are \nany other amendments in the second degree, they can be offered. But I \nwould like some understanding as to whether or not any more votes would \nbe taken this evening on any of these amendments.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I think we \nhave to be prepared to vote, on this state of the record. We are in a \nstate of considerable flux, if not confusion, as to where this bill is \nheaded, and our experience is that unless we stay and debate and vote \nwe are not going to get through this bill. I say that with reluctance \nbecause I know Senators have other plans.\n  Mr. President, I would suggest that we proceed at this time to the \ndebate on the amendment by the Senator from Kentucky on his second-\ndegree amendment and perhaps in that intervening 10 minutes we could \nget Senator Wellstone to the floor to find a time limit. If we are \nunable to come to an agreement on the second-degree amendment by \nSenator Sessions, perhaps we would proceed with Senator Murray's \namendment which is 1 hour equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized for a \nperiod of 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FORD. I ask, is it necessary that I call up my amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's amendment is pending.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1117\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, this amendment is cosponsored by Senator \nRobb, Senator Hollings, Senator McConnell, Senator Faircloth, Senator \nHelms, and Senator Thompson.\n  As many of my colleagues already know, I have been extremely \ndisappointed that the national tobacco settlement includes no \nprovisions whatsoever to help the tobacco farmer. There is no question \nthat this proposal will affect them. Yet there is nothing in the \nproposal for them. They were not invited to the negotiations. They were \nnot consulted about the negotiations. They were not even briefed about \nwhat was going on during the negotiations.\n  The proposed settlement contains money to compensate promoters of the \nNASCAR races who lose tobacco sponsorship. It contains money to \ncompensate promoters of rodeo events who lose tobacco sponsorship. It \ncontains money for other events, teams, or entries in such events who \nlose tobacco sponsorship. It contains money, big money, for a tobacco \ncounteradvertising program. It contains money for smoking cessation \nprograms. It contains money for individual lawsuits. It contains money \nfor Medicaid lawsuits filed by the State.\n  Mr. President, the proposed tobacco settlement contains compensation \nfor just about everything you can think of, everything except the \ntobacco farmer.\n  The negotiators found a way to compensate promoters of sporting \nevents, but they completely ignored a 200-year tradition that is the \ncornerstone of many small communities in my State. In other words, the \nfarmers got the shaft.\n  I intend to do everything I can to keep any legislation from passing \nunless there is a fair compensation for tobacco farmers included in the \n$368.5 billion package. We have to take into account the future of \nthese small families. We have to take into account the future of these \nsmall farm communities.\n  There are about 60,000 tobacco farms in my State alone, Mr. \nPresident. Most of them grow a couple acres of tobacco, but they get \nabout one-fourth of their farm income from tobacco. The national \ntobacco settlement leaves them out in the cold. It leaves the local \neconomies of entire communities in shambles. We must do something about \nit.\n  I have been working with my farmers and with other tobacco State \nSenators to develop a package that will provide fair compensation to \ntobacco farmers and tobacco-growing communities. We intend to have such \na package included in any legislation to implement the tobacco \nsettlement. I think other Senators from tobacco States share my view \nthat we will simply not support any future legislation which does not \naddress the tobacco farmers' future.\n  So, Mr. President, all my amendment says is that farmers ought to be \ntaken into account. We should not forget them. My amendment is a \nsecond-degree amendment which expresses the sense of the Senate that \ntobacco growers and tobacco-growing communities should be fairly \ncompensated as a part of any Federal legislation for the adverse impact \nwhich will follow from enactment of a national tobacco settlement. I \nthink this is a reasonable request, and I believe my colleagues are \nprepared to accept my amendment by unanimous consent. I am perfectly \nwilling to do that without asking my colleagues to vote. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, speaking to the second-degree amendment \noffered by the Senator from Kentucky, he and I have been in \ndisagreement on this issue in the short time I have served in this \nbody, but I stand today in support of his second-degree amendment. \nThough I may disagree with one or two provisions in it, I believe the \ncentral element of his amendment is a suggestion that tobacco growers \nshould be protected in any settlement agreement, and I certainly think \nthat is a worthy goal as part of the settlement negotiations. For that \nreason, though I may disagree with some other particulars, I will \nsupport his second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I did not object to the Ford sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment to S. 1061. I agree with its sentiment that the needs \nof tobacco farmers should be taken into account when Congress considers \nthe proposed tobacco settlement.\n  I wish to express reservations about two points in the Ford \namendment's language. First, the amendment says that any compensation \nto tobacco growers should ``be included within the $368.5 billion in \npayments.'' However, we do not now know that the size of the settlement \nwill be precisely $368.5 billion. It may be larger. Moreover, payments \nto growers might be additive to the settlement amount, whatever its \nsize.\n  Second, the amendment expresses a desire to ensure ``the continued \nadministration of a viable federal tobacco program which operates at no \nnet cost to the taxpayer.'' I favor compensating tobacco farmers for \nthe equity they have built up in the quota system over the years. Such \na buyout of the quota program should lead to, at most, a minimal price-\nsupporting role for the Government. That is what we have done for the \nproducers of most other commodities in the 1996 FAIR Act: Transition \npayments, and price supports at market-clearing levels.\n  I believe that to continue the present tobacco program without change \nis not\n\n[[Page S9002]]\n\nlikely to be viable, so I find the amendment's language acceptable. \nBecause some might read it to imply an endorsement of the status quo, I \nsimply want to register my view that such a reading is neither required \nby the amendment's language, nor in the long-term interest of tobacco \nproducers.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I believe that the Senator from Kentucky \nhas offered a worthwhile amendment. There is no doubt about the \ndislocation to tobacco growers occasioned by a settlement which will \nhave the effect of crippling their business for public policy reasons \nwhich may yet be worked out.\n  It is obviously uncertain at this point as to what will happen with \nthe proposed global settlement on the tobacco industry, but I think \nthis is another matter where public policy calls for certain action. \nThere are some employees, some workers in the industry who are hurt. I \nthink it is sensible to provide for those individual workers.\n  Certainly, we have seen the demise in my State of the steel industry \nand the glass industry and the coal industry, and we have tried to take \ncare of dislocated workers. As the distinguished Senator from Kentucky \nhas articulated the amendment, the sense of the Senate to do that I \nthink is acceptable. There may be a fair distance between the sense of \nthe Senate and how it is going to be effectuated. With some frequency \nwe see on this floor the Senate express its sense and then back off \nwhen it comes to putting dollars up to druthers.\n  But in terms of the public policy behind looking out for the \ninterests of the employees who will be injured by a global tobacco \nsettlement, I believe the Senator from Kentucky has offered a \nworthwhile amendment, and we are prepared to accept it on this side.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, if I have any time left, I will yield it \nback after asking unanimous consent that Senator Frist of Tennessee be \nadded as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his support, and I \ndo agree, once we have a sense of the Senate, they should be helped. \nHow they are helped is another issue.\n  I thank my colleague from Illinois for his effort here.\n  I yield back whatever time I might have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1117) was agreed to.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1125 to Amendment No. 1078\n\n (Purpose: To provide for certain limitations on attorneys' fees under \nany global tobacco settlement and for increased funding for children's \n                            health research)\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions], for himself, Mr. \n     Craig and Mr. Faircloth, proposes an amendment numbered 1125 \n     to amendment No. 1078.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following:\n       Sec.   . (a) General Limitation.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, if any attorneys' fees are paid (on behalf \n     of attorneys for the plaintiffs) in connection with an action \n     maintained by a State against one or more tobacco companies \n     to recover tobacco-related medicaid expenditures or for other \n     causes of action, involved in the settlement agreement, such \n     fees shall--\n       (1) not be paid at a rate that exceeds $250 per hour; and\n       (2) be limited to a total of $5,000,000.\n       (b) Fee Arrangements.--Subsection (a) shall apply to \n     attorneys' fees provided for or in connection with an action \n     of the type described in such subsection under any--\n       (1) court order;\n       (2) settlement agreement;\n       (3) contingency fee arrangement;\n       (4) arbitration procedure;\n       (5) alternative dispute resolution procedure (including \n     mediation); or\n       (6) other arrangement providing for the payment of \n     attorneys' fees.\n       (c) Expenses.--The limitation described in subsection (a) \n     shall not apply to any amounts provided for the attorneys' \n     reasonable and customary expenses.\n       (d) Requirements.--No award of attorneys' fees shall be \n     made under any national tobacco settlement until the \n     attorneys involved have--\n       (1) provided to the Governor of the appropriate State, a \n     detailed time accounting with respect to the work performed \n     in relation to any legal action which is the subject of the \n     settlement or with regard to the settlement itself; and\n       (2) made public disclosure of the time accounting under \n     paragraph (1) and any fee agreements entered into, or fee \n     arrangements made, with respect to any legal action that is \n     the subject of the settlement.\n       (e) Provision of Funds for Children's Health Research.--Any \n     amounts provided for attorneys' fees in excess of the \n     limitation applicable under this section shall be paid into \n     the Treasury for use by the National Institutes of Health for \n     research relating to children's health.\n       (f) Effective Date.--The limitation on the payment of \n     attorneys' fees contained in this section shall become \n     effective on the date of enactment of any Act providing for a \n     national tobacco settlement.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to address a very important \nissue that has not been discussed much. It has been raised a few times \nbut not openly discussed. I think it is consistent with Senator \nDurbin's concern that a tax benefit being proposed has not had full \npublic discussion.\n  One of the things that has not had public discussion regarding the \ntobacco settlement is attorney's fees. Many of the States have \nundertaken very lucrative agreements with plaintiff lawyers who States \nattorneys general have hired to represent their States to carry on this \nlitigation.\n  Less than a year ago, I was attorney general of the State of Alabama, \nand I was asked and it was suggested to me to hire plaintiff attorneys \nto represent the State of Alabama. It was suggested that a 25-percent \ncontingent fee would be appropriate in those cases. I rejected that. I \nfelt like it was not necessary for the State of Alabama to undertake \nsuch a generous fee agreement. Other States have undertaken such \nagreements, and that is of much concern to me.\n  Now we have the case coming before this Senate of being asked to \nbless or to approve by legislation those agreements. It is important \nfor us to consider that every dollar that is spent on attorney's fees \nis a dollar that does not go to children's health. So this amendment \nlimits the amount of money that can be spent on attorney's fees and \nsays any excess moneys that are saved in that regard will be sent to \nthe National Institutes of Health to be used for research for \nchildren's illnesses.\n  I think that is the appropriate way to do this. We have a lot of \nattorneys who have been talking a lot about children's health, so let's \ntalk about that seriously, and let's ask about how this has happened.\n  Let me just say, the way this agreement has been entered into, the \nattorneys general, with their attorneys who they have hired, have \nentered into an agreement, a global settlement agreement, with the \ntobacco industry. Oddly enough, it mentions nothing about attorney's \nfees.\n  What we have learned since then is that there is a side agreement \nbetween the plaintiffs' attorneys who represent the States and the \ntobacco industry to pay their attorney's fees directly by the tobacco \nindustry, apart from the State that they represent, which is a very odd \nsituation and, in fact, in my opinion, Mr. President, represents a \nconflict of interest, because at this point, you have the attorneys \nsupposedly representing the State entering into an agreement, a side \nagreement, with the attorneys and the party on the other side of this \nlitigation, the tobacco industry.\n  So that puts them in a situation in which, if they do not agree and \nthis settlement does not go forward, they do not get their attorney's \nfee.\n  That is basic. That is a conflict, I submit, between their interests \nand their duty and fidelity to the State, their client, and the \nopposing side who\n\n[[Page S9003]]\n\nnow is paying their fees. Why didn't they put it in the agreement? Why \ndidn't they state it publicly? Because they don't want to talk about \nit.\n  Most of the estimates and many reports have been suggested as to how \nmuch these fees might be. Some have said $10 to $14 billion. That is \nwhat I have seen published in several different instances. Let me \nrepeat that: $10 to $14 billion. That is the greatest legal fee ever \npaid in the history of this Nation, in the history of this world. It is \nthe mother of all attorney's fees. We are talking about $10 to $14 \nbillion. Outside of education, the budget of the State of Alabama is $1 \nbillion. So we are talking about an incredible sum of money that could \nprovide tremendous amounts of research and care for children. That is \nwhere this money ought to go.\n  We are talking about a secret side agreement by which the attorneys, \nsupposedly representing the States and the children, have gone over \nhere now and have set up a side agreement with the people they have \nbeen accusing of being so bad, the tobacco industry, the people they \nare suing. That is not an appropriate way to do it.\n\n  I think if this body is to approve a global settlement and enact \nlegislation in that regard, this body ought to make clear where we \nstand with regard to attorney's fees. We cannot allow some secret side \nagreement representing billions of dollars that could be going to \nchildren to be paid under the table by the party for the other side to \nthe attorneys to the States who are representing the children.\n  I think this is a very important subject, Mr. President, and I care \nabout it very deeply.\n  I think Senator Durbin's amendment deals with a tax question that has \nnot been fully aired. This is a question that has not been fully aired, \nand it needs to be.\n  Our amendment would do something else. It would say that every fee \nagreement that has been entered into between the State attorneys \ngeneral and the lawyers they hired, the plaintiffs' lawyers they hired \nto represent them has to be made public, and the statement has to be \nmade public. We limit the amount of fees. I think this is a large fee, \nmost people think this is huge. Mr. President, $5 million is the limit \nper State we think is appropriate for this kind of litigation. In \naddition to that, we say it should not exceed $250 per hour in billing \ntime. So that would be the cap on the fees that this bill would set \nforth: that no more than either $250 per hour, which is far more than \nwhat the average working man in this country makes, I assure you, $250 \nper hour would be the maximum time. If it goes over that, we would cap \nit at $5 million.\n  I think that is a reasonable proposal. It would not take effect until \nand if this body enters into a global settlement of this litigation. I \nthink it is quite appropriate. I think that we need to deal with this \nissue.\n  I will just say this, as to the secretiveness of it. There have been \nseveral inquiries made by members of various committees of this Senate \nand one made by me of an attorney general about what the fee agreement \nwas, and he did not set forth that agreement. Right after that hearing, \nover a month ago, I wrote a letter to the parties involved in this \nlitigation, and I asked them to state the agreement they had with the \nattorneys representing those States publicly. We have a response not \nfrom one of them. They have not responded.\n  This is a public contract between the attorneys general of the States \nand the lawyers who are representing the States. So I think something \nis amiss here. It is something we ought to deal with. This amendment \ndeals with it straight up. I believe it fulfills the needs that we are \nhere for, and that is to make sure we get the most money possible for \nchildren and children's health.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I stand to join my colleague from Arkansas \nthis evening in offering this second-degree amendment. I must tell you, \nwhen the Senator approached me, I was hesitant. I don't get involved in \nwhat I originally think is a private-sector relationship, a client \nrelationship that can be none of our business here. But when the States \nattorneys general and the trial attorneys have come together to craft a \nuniversal or a national agreement that the Senator from Illinois \napproaches tonight as part of his amendment, and they approach us to \nmake this national law, to make this the law of the land, it is now the \npublic's business, without doubt.\n  Clearly, the Senator from Arkansas has demonstrated that this \nevening. He has even clearly stated----\n  Mr. FORD. Alabama.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Excuse me. Excuse me, the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Alabama, thank you very much, I say to the Senator from \nIowa.\n  [Laughter.]\n  Mr. CRAIG. Touche.\n  But the Senator has very clearly pointed out there could well have \nbeen side agreements made or upfront agreements that go beyond any \naverage person's wildest imagination to the potential of tens of \nbillions of dollars in attorney's fees.\n  Here tonight the Senator from Illinois--and just a month ago this \nSenate agreed to tax an industry for the purpose of the health of the \nchildren of this country, a tax that in 1 year would not even \ndemonstrate this amount of money. How can it be possible that any one \nprofession could draw or come to draw or believe to be entitled to that \namount of money? And $250 an hour is a what the Senator's amendment \nsays is a reasonable and right fee, and even that the average working \nperson would pale to.\n  So I am extremely pleased that the Senator this evening has brought \nforward the amendment. It is something that this Senate will either \nface now or face in the future as we deal with the crafting of a \nuniversal agreement, if that becomes possible and ultimately gets to \nthe floor of this Senate.\n  I will join with the Senator however many times it takes to make sure \nthat what he has proposed as an amendment tonight can and must become \nthe law of the land, because in his wisdom and in the crafting of this \namendment, he says that the excess dollars go where they ought to go, \nto children's health because all of us are extremely concerned about \nthe rapid increase in teenage smoking in this country. That is part of \nwhat spurred this whole effort that is now nationwide as it relates to \nsmoking and the tobacco industry.\n  So I think the amendment to the pending amendment is appropriate this \nevening. It fits into what we are trying to do if in fact we become \nparticipants in the crafting of a global agreement as it relates to \nwhat is attempted to be resolved between the States attorneys general, \nthe tobacco industry, and the representatives of those States attorneys \ngeneral. So I join my colleague tonight. I am proud to be a cosponsor \nof this important second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by \nthe distinguished Senator from Alabama. I cannot think of any better \nmethod of cutting to the crux of this whole tobacco settlement than the \namendment that he has offered. We talk about here, on a regular basis, \ndoing something for children, for the health care of children, for \ntheir better care, and looking after children. And I strongly support \nthese initiatives.\n  Knowing the generous, caring, and giving nature of the trial \nattorneys, I have no doubt that they would all be in strong support of \nthe amendment of the Senator from Alabama if they were here to vote on \nit. Knowing of the eleemosynary history of trial attorneys, I know if \nthey were here, they would join us in strong support of Senator \nSessions' bill.\n  So I just say that this is a wonderful opportunity to make a major \ncontribution to the caring for children's health and their well-being \nin this country. I commend again the Senator from Alabama for bringing \nit to this body's attention. I stand in strong support of it.\n  I say again, knowing the nature of the trial attorneys of this \ncountry, that if they were here and knowing that they had the \nopportunity to make this strong contribution to the children of this \ncountry rather than it going into attorneys' fees, that they would \nstand in strong support of the\n\n[[Page S9004]]\n\namendment of the Senator from Alabama also.\n  I thank you, Mr. President, and I thank Senator Sessions.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I commend my friend and colleague from \nAlabama for an outstanding amendment. I listened carefully to his \ncomments, Senator Faircloth's comments, and Senator Craig's comments.\n  As I understand the amendment by the distinguished Senator from \nAlabama, he is in effect here giving the Senate a choice, if I \nunderstand correctly, a choice between legal fees and children's \nhealth. The Senator from Alabama pointed out that as a State attorney \ngeneral he had the option to retain private counsel to engage in this \nlitigation which is going on in 30-some odd States around the country, \nand that he chose not to do it, but that many State attorneys general \nchose to hire private counsel to pursue this litigation against the \ntobacco companies.\n  Now we understand, as the distinguished Senator from Alabama pointed \nout, there are fee arrangements not known to the public under which \nthere could be billions of dollars in fees paid to these lawyers who in \neffect were acting on behalf of State governments----\n  Is that right, I say to my friend from Alabama?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. You are correct. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Engaged in the business of the public to recover the \nMedicaid costs. And we are not sure how much those fees are.\n  Now, it is suggested that the Federal Government, the Congress of the \nUnited States, ratify--we will have a proposal at some point this year \nor next year--ratify what is referred to as the global tobacco \nsettlement. So the distinguished Senator from Alabama is simply saying \nthat this is a matter of public concern.\n\n  It will actually, if it is passed, be a matter of Federal law. If we \nare going to sanction this kind of agreement, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Alabama is saying we would like to make a decision as how best to \ndeploy the public money in this global settlement. Some of the public \nmoney, Mr. President, is obviously legal fees for those who, on behalf \nof State governments, brought these lawsuits.\n  The distinguished Senator from Alabama is not being unfair, it seems \nto me, to the lawyers. As I understand the amendment, he is saying, up \nto $5 million per State or at a rate of $250 an hour, whichever is \nless----\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Less.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would be the capped fee arrangement for these private \nlawyers doing public business at the behest of the State attorneys \ngeneral. And $5 million, Mr. President, is not a bad year's work, not a \nbad 2 years' work--for many Americans not a bad lifetime's work.\n  So the distinguished Senator from Alabama is not saying that these \nlawyers, if you have been hired by the State government, you have to do \nit for nothing. All he is saying in effect is you don't get to gouge \nus. So he has set here a reasonable limit, some would argue maybe even \ntoo generous, and saying any excess amounts that have been agreed to \nshould be diverted to the children of America at the National \nInstitutes of Health to fund research for children and children's \ndiseases.\n  I think it is an outstanding amendment. I commend the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama for his amendment. I think it makes an awful lot \nof sense. It is clearly an amendment in the best interest of the \nchildren of America. So, Mr. President, I thank the Senator from \nAlabama for his leadership on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, would the Senator from Alabama help me here \na little bit? I want to be sure--the eloquence of his amendment has \nalready been stated on the floor. Let us be sure, because this is a \nvery complex piece of legislation. And I yield to everyone because I am \nnot a lawyer and so, therefore, I have a hard time understanding side \nagreements, protocols, but I am learning. I am on the jury.\n  As I understand it, your amendment applies to the $368.5 billion \nsettlement?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct.\n  Mr. FORD. Inside there?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FORD. All right.\n  Now, that is not the bill. That is not the total bill here. There is \nalso added on to that about $24 billion more for tort liability. That \nis in addition to that. And then the lookback penalties, which is if \nthe reduction of youth smoking is not sufficient to meet the criteria \nset, there will be another $42 billion. So we are talking about $435 \nbillion here now, not $368.5 billion.\n  So I want to be sure that we all understand where we are going. We \nare beginning to put so much weight on this agreement that it is going \nto fall, and then we will lose, I think, all those goals that we have \nset for ourselves.\n  But one of the items yet to be decided is the plaintiff attorney's \nfees.\n  Your amendment does not get to that?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. It does, yes. Yes.\n  Mr. FORD. I am talking about the private litigants now.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. No, not the private litigants.\n  Mr. FORD. So private litigants, their attorneys are yet to be \ncompensated. So you add those on to the $435 billion. Now, if you are \ntalking about $10 to $14 billion in the other place, I wonder if we \ncould just add a low figure $10 billion, so we are now getting to \naround $495 billion, almost $500 billion. So I want to be sure that we \nall are on the same wavelength.\n  Then we are talking about the new taxes. That is another $50 billion. \nThat is another $50 billion. That is just over a few years. That is not \nover the term of the contract. So you add that on and you are at about \n$530 billion. So if there is a possible doubling of lookback penalties, \nwe are talking about another $42 billion.\n  So I want to be sure everybody understands that $368.5 billion is \njust within a range for the States for those Medicaid payments. The \nFederal Government will get about 60 percent; States will get about 40 \npercent.\n  There are a lot of things here I thought we ought to be sure about.\n  The Senator's amendment, I wanted to be sure that it was in the $368 \nbillion, and not in addition to.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Let me clarify that as best I can.\n  Mr. FORD. I think we are all going to have to work at this pretty \nhard.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. To put it real simply, almost every State that entered \ninto this litigation hired a law firm to represent the State. Some of \nthem used their own attorneys, I believe, but most hired private \nplaintiff lawyers to represent them. They then entered into agreements \nto pay them so much money.\n  Now those attorneys general, now those plaintiff lawyers, now the \ntobacco lawyers have come to this body and asked us to approve a global \nsettlement, ``but don't talk about attorney's fees,'' they say, \n``because we're going to take care of that between the plaintiff \nlawyers and the tobacco lawyers. We're going to work that out between \nus.''\n  What we are saying is, that needs to be public. The public needs to \nknow. It ought to be capped to a reasonable fee, and not be a windfall, \nbecause in many of these cases they hardly filed the lawsuits before \nthe settlement was agreed to, so almost no legal work has been done, \nyet they would stand to receive perhaps billions of dollars in legal \nfees. It is a matter we have to deal with.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Senator. I hope you understand what I am trying \nto do. It is a huge, a humongous piece of legislation. The $368 billion \nis just the beginning. It is now, in my judgment, at about $525 to $530 \nbillion. And we have not talked about the private litigants' attorney's \nfees, which are an add-on. You are not bothering that.\n  I think it might be well, Mr. President, if I submit these figures, \nhave them on a per year basis and with some question marks. There are \nother add-ons that will be question marks. And the attorney's fees are \nquestion marks. I think I will just put this in for a matter of the \nRecord just so everybody will understand.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S9005]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               NEW FEDERAL REVENUES FROM TOBACCO INDUSTRY               \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                     Per year \\1\\        Over 25 years  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCore Tobacco Settlement.........  $15 bil...........  $368.5 bil.       \nAdditional tort liability.......

I thank the Senator for helping me here.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. FORD. Yes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I do think that, depending on the wording of these \nunderstandings between the attorneys general and lawyers, that the fee \nmay be a percentage of the whole $500 billion that the Senator referred \nto.\n  Mr. FORD. Because it is not $368 billion, I say to my friend from \nAlabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes. I appreciate your correcting that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Who has the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Ford has the floor.\n  Mr. FORD. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I wonder if I might inquire of the author of the \namendment, the Senator from Alabama, a question.\n  I was reading it over, and as I read the amendment, under the first \nsection, paragraph A of your amendment, you put a limitation on the \nper-hour rate of attorneys, and then there is a cap total of $5 million \nthat applies per State?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The $5 million applies to per-State maximum.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That would be the maximum, but if they could not \njustify the fee by hour, they may not get that.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I understand that, but it is a maximum of $5 million in \nany regard.\n  Now, this has to do with attorney's fees paid in connection with a \nState recovering money. This does not have to do with the so-called \nproposed big settlement that is going to come to us in the future. This \napplies to States.\n  I wonder how we, here, can limit attorney's fees in a State action?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am delighted to try to answer that. It is a very \nunusual thing that is happening to this Senate and we have been asked \nby the attorneys general, by the defendants, the tobacco companies, \ntoo, in fact, by legislation legislate a lawsuit. So it is unusual.\n  They are asking us to do that because many of the things that they \nwant, each side wants, cannot be accomplished through private \nlitigation. They want to, in effect, control new tobacco companies that \nhave not been making tobacco and have not made people sick before, they \nwant to control them and others.\n  So they have asked this body for a lot of reasons to ratify this \nthrough our legislation. To that degree, they have asked us to ratify.\n  I think we need to find out what the attorney's fees are. I think as \npart of our legislation our legislation ought to control legal fees and \nwe ought not to pay any more than that mentioned in this amendment.\n  That is, basically, where we are.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I listened to the Senator make the explanation but I \nthought the amendment was going to go toward limiting attorney's fees \nif there is a global settlement, this thing we are being asked to do at \nsome point. We do not know if it is this fall, next year, or whatever, \nwhen we will be asked to ratify a so-called global settlement.\n  But your amendment does not just speak to that, it speaks to ongoing \ncases in the States. For example, as I understand it, the State of \nMississippi just settled, the State of Florida just settled, other \nStates will maybe be settling. Your amendment seems to me to apply to \nthose States that make those settlements. It has nothing to do with the \nproposed universal or global settlement that we will be asked to ratify \nat some point later on.\n  That is why I wonder, by what right or power do we have in the \nFederal Government of saying to a State government, a State attorney \ngeneral and the State government that you can't, in your agreement, \nwhatever your agreement is, you have to limit attorney's fees?\n  That seems to me to be an odd kind of a thing for us to do--the \nFederal Government telling the State government when you make your \nagreement, here is all you can do. It does not seem to me to be \nconstitutional.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would like to respond. I think you raise a very \ninteresting point.\n  First, I say it is unusual that the States would come to this body \nand ask the Congress of the United States to ratify a lawsuit, but they \nhave.\n\n  Our bill does not take effect and does not apply unless this body \nenacts a global tobacco settlement. It is the last sentence in the \namendment. In other words, we do not, and this legislation does not \nattempt to intervene in litigation that is ongoing unless there is a \nglobal legislation by the Congress of the United States, in which case \nwe would then also deal with attorney's fees as we should.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, I understand and I appreciate the Senator pointing \nthat out. Mississippi made an agreement, Florida has made an agreement, \nmaybe there will be a couple of other States that make agreements, what \nif later on we make a global settlement, do they have to go back and \nrenegotiate all the attorney's fees? That is what I wonder.\n  How can we tell a State what they have to do prior to our reaching \nthis national settlement--and whether we reach it or not, I do not \nknow. What would happen, for example, to a State like Mississippi that \nhas already negotiated and make their deals--I guess, I assume they \nhave.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. My understanding is that States that have settled have \nconditioned their settlement on the requirements of the congressional \nglobal settlement. If there is no congressional action, then their \nsettlements will be in full force and effect, but if it is, they are \nagreed to be vitiated by the congressional action.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator was not aware of that. I appreciate that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. I \nhave just seen this amendment this evening for the first time, but I \nknow the Senator from Alabama has offered it in the regular order of \nbusiness.\n  I have had a few minutes to read it over. I commend to my colleagues \nthe suggestion they should read this very closely. This amendment is \nthe dream of the tobacco companies. The Senators who have risen to \nspeak on behalf of this amendment from the tobacco-producing States I \nthink have given evidence of the fact that this is another one of the \nlast gasps of this industry.\n  Let me tell you why what appears to be so reasonable on its face is, \nin fact, a loaded deck for the tobacco companies again.\n  My friend, the Senator from Alabama, wants to limit attorney's fees \nand to take any excess and put it into health research for children. \nNow, who in the world could oppose that?\n  But look closely. He does not want to limit the attorney's fees for \ntobacco company lawyers. No. He just wants to limit the attorney's fees \nfor those on the plaintiffs' side, the States that have brought this \naction. Now that is curious. If he is afraid that the attorneys, who \nwill ultimately all be paid by tobacco companies when this is all over, \nare going to charge too much money, he only wants to limit the hourly \nrate to $250 an hour to attorneys representing the plaintiffs in this \naction. So he protects these fat cat law firms that have represented \nthe tobacco companies forever, who can charge $500 an hour, $1,000 an \nhour, he does not care. His interest is only the attorneys for the \nplaintiffs.\n  That does not make any sense. All of the money is coming out of the \nsame pot. If he wants to make this a reduction in the lifestyle of \nattorneys, why does it not apply to defense attorneys? Why does it not \napply to tobacco company attorneys? No, his only interest is\n\n[[Page S9006]]\n\nthe attorneys who stepped forward and filed these lawsuits on behalf of \nthe States.\n  Now, they have been characterized by their critics this evening as a \npretty motley crew. Remember that 40 different States decided through \ntheir own elected attorneys general that they would bring these \nlawsuits under fee arrangements so that they would have the legal \ntalent to be able to process the most complicated litigation in the \nhistory of the United States.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. May I interrupt my distinguished colleague for a moment \nto say there will be no further rollcall votes tonight. I have just \nbeen able to make that determination, and I know there are many \nSenators on the campus waiting to find out what is going to happen.\n  I regret interrupting Senator Durbin, but I think that is worth a \nstatement. We have the list fairly well pared down. When Senator Durbin \nfinishes, I will announce the prospects for tomorrow.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am pleased to be interrupted with that good news.\n  Isn't it curious that this effort to provide research funds for \nchildren's health, funded by excess attorney's fees, would only apply \nto attorney's fees in excess for the plaintiffs, that the law firms \nrepresenting Philip Morris and RJR and all the tobacco companies can \ncharge whatever they care to charge.\n  Now, I think that pierces the veil of what this is all about.\n  But let's read on. What else is the Senator from Alabama setting out \nto do here?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Would the Senator be agreeable to this amendment if we \nreworded it, in fact, make it apply to the tobacco lawyers? I will \ncertainly feel good about that.\n  The reason it was done this way is because many of the plaintiffs' \nattorneys apparently have it on a contingency fee basis, probably have \nfiled lawsuits, may be entitled to hundreds of millions of dollars and \nhave done very little work. It would be an unjust enrichment, it \nappears to me.\n  I would certainly entertain that amendment. I think it is a \nsuggestion that we ought to incorporate.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think that is an improvement, but let me read on.\n  The reason why this amendment should not be considered, why the \ntobacco companies will jump for joy if it is adopted, is that it will \ndiscourage any State from bringing its lawsuit against the tobacco \ncompanies.\n  The Senator from Alabama, for reasons I do not understand, has \ndecided that no State of the 40 that filed suits, no matter how deeply \nthey are involved in this litigation, can pay outside attorney's fees \nbeyond $5 million, which sounds like a huge sum of money until you \nconsider States like Minnesota.\n  Minnesota has been preparing for trial on January 19, has now \ncollected millions of documents from these tobacco companies, has \nwarehouses in London and in Minneapolis. They have attorneys scouring \nthrough the documents and processing them. They are preparing to go to \ntrial.\n  In my home State of Illinois, I do not think we have made nearly that \nprogress in moving toward litigation. But the Senator from Alabama does \nnot care that the attorneys in Minnesota have been working overtime for \nmonths and the attorneys in Illinois may not have been.\n  He says, we are going to pick an arbitrary figure--no State can pay \ntheir attorneys no matter how much work they have put into this, any \nmore than $5 million, period.\n  Now, that is fundamentally unfair. It really does not reflect the \neffort that has been put in by these attorneys in these States.\n  Let me tell you what else he is doing, and I think this is a pretty \ncrafty move by the tobacco companies. By putting this provision in the \nlaw to limit attorney's fees, he will have the attorneys come forward \nin these States and say to the attorney general, ``Well, listen, if we \ncannot, after all of this discovery and all of this preparation even \nrecover the amounts that we have expended in attorney's fees, we \ncertainly cannot take this to trial,'' so the tobacco companies will \nhave their way. The tobacco companies do not want these cases to go to \ntrial. They want to discourage that from happening.\n\n  In fact, representatives of those companies have told me point blank \nif any case goes to trial there will be no global settlement. The \nSenator from Alabama is offering them a great improvement here in \nsaying that they do not have to worry about a trial now because \nattorney's fees are going to be strictly limited.\n  Well, they will be jumping for joy at RJR and Philip Morris if this \nSenator's amendment is adopted this evening, because by limiting the \nattorney's fees and saying that there will be a strict limitation of \nthe amount that can be paid to the plaintiffs' attorneys he is, in \nfact, discouraging, if not stopping litigation and trials.\n  You will have accomplished with your amendment what the tobacco \ncompanies have been unable to accomplish to this point. You will have \nstopped these cases and they cannot move forward.\n  I do not think that is what the Senator set out to do when he \nexplained this amendment. But I think that is the net result of it.\n  It is interesting to me as you look into it, what will happen to the \nStates that have settled, Mississippi and Florida, what will happen to \ntheir attorney's fees? If I read this correctly, this may or may not \napply to it. It is not clear. This amendment is not drawn in a way that \ncan tell you it definitely applies in the case of Mississippi and \nFlorida. The Senator offers it for prospective payment of attorney's \nfees. Yet, we already have two cases settled and they are not \naddressed.\n\n  And then this whole question of the amount to be paid attorneys, a \n$250 rate. I don't know what a reasonable rate is in the Senator's home \nState. I don't know what attorneys might charge in any State, whether \nit is New York, Minnesota, Illinois or Alabama. But I think the Senator \nhas chosen a rate that is unrealistic--unrealistic in terms of what \nthese attorneys general face.\n  Keep in mind that most of the attorneys general in the United States \nlooked to these lawsuits and said right off the bat, ``We don't have \nthe resources to sue these tobacco giants. We have to bring in the \nresources and services of attorneys who will, in fact, represent us.'' \nOf course, those attorneys coming in to file those lawsuits expected to \nbe compensated if they won --only if they won. Contingency fees are \nbased on that. I know from my experience with the Senator in the \nJudiciary Committee, he doesn't think very kindly of contingency fees, \nparticularly in his own State. But I think, quite honestly, this is a \nclear illustration that if a contingency fee was not awarded to an \nattorney, the attorney general would not have had this army of lawyers \nto go forward.\n  When I heard comments from some of the Senators from tobacco-\nproducing States, it is clear that they resent these lawyers, these \nattorneys general, for bringing these lawsuits and they want to get \neven with them, they want to nail them and say, ``We are going to limit \nyour fees. You thought there was money in this, but there won't be any \nmoney in this. We will limit you as to how much you can recover.''\n  I don't think that is fair. It is curious to me at this time, when we \nare talking about whether or not the Federal Government is going to \nimpose its will on the States, that we have an amendment from a Senator \nfrom Alabama, which suggests that we in Congress should impose on 40 \ndifferent States, 40 different attorneys general, a fee arrangement \nthat we happen to think is reasonable.\n  Well, let me tell you what this is all about. The tobacco companies \nwere embarrassed when the amendment was disclosed that gave them a $50 \nbillion windfall in the tax bill, an amendment which we hope to repeal. \nThey had hoped to initiate the negotiations in the tobacco settlement \nby saying: Before we sit down at the table and reach an agreement, give \nthe tobacco companies $50 billion.\n  I think the public sentiment and the votes of this Senate will see it \nanother way. Now the tobacco companies come in with this amendment. \nThey want to see this amendment adopted because now they come to the \ntable and say to each of these States: There is a new arrangement. You \ncan't pay your attorneys. You can't go to trial. We have\n\n[[Page S9007]]\n\nyou where we want you. We don't care what your contingency fee \nagreement is going to be. You are limited to what we in Congress think \nattorney's fees should be and how much they should be paid.\n  Well, I think this amendment should be defeated. I think this \namendment is one the tobacco companies will enjoy, one that the \nAmerican people will regret. The States, including my own, that had the \ncourage to step forward and file these lawsuits against the tobacco \ncompanies should not be penalized at this point in time. They have done \na great service to this Nation. Each attorney general--Democrat, \nRepublican or Independent--who decided to enter into an agreement with \nattorneys to represent them did it with the understanding that they \nwill be held accountable for this. The Senator says that these are \nsecret agreements. Well, in my home State, I can tell you that whether \nthere was a secret agreement or not, the gentleman who entered into it, \nour attorney general, will be held accountable for it. Can he justify \nit? Did he say to the taxpayers from Illinois we have recovered enough \nmoney to justify the contingency money paid the attorneys? Of course, \nand he is held accountable.\n\n  The Senator suggests this is done in secret with no accountability. I \nthink he is wrong. I hope when this is all said and done, we will \ndefeat this amendment, and that we will not give the tobacco industry a \nvictory this evening or tomorrow when we vote, such as they secured at \nthe close of debate on the tax bill. These tobacco companies have to be \ntold, whether they are trying to stop the States from bringing these \nactions through this amendment by the Senator from Alabama, or \nrecouping $50 billion in the stealth of the night, that the party is \nover. The tobacco companies just can't have their way anymore. I think \nwe have to stand up for the people who are best represented by these \nlawsuits--the consumers, the children, those who unfortunately are \ngoing to be the losers if this amendment is adopted.\n  At this point, I would like to move to table this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion to table.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask if the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois will withhold that motion for the present time. We cannot \nproceed to a rollcall vote tonight under a determination made earlier \nby the majority leader, which I announced as soon as we had heard it. \nThere may be other Senators who wish to speak to this amendment. The \nSenator from Illinois would be preserving his position, in any event, \nsince we cannot vote tonight, to carry this matter over until first \nthing tomorrow morning. We are beginning at 9:30, so that we can \nconsider at that time if there are any other Senators on the floor who \nwish to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Illinois withdraw the \nmotion?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will withdraw it, as long as at 9:30 we will proceed to \nthe same order of business and the amendment will be the amendment of \nthe Senator from Alabama and we can proceed to my amendment after we \nhave considered all amendments in the second degree.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, that is agreeable to this manager of the \nbill. So that all Senators will be on notice that a motion to table \nwill be pending. Of course, if it is not tabled, then we can't proceed \nto the underlying amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I withdraw the motion to table, with that understanding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is withdrawn.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my friend from Illinois.\n  Mr. President, we have made some progress in limiting the number of \namendments. We have been advised by Senator Wellstone that he is \nprepared to withdraw a filed amendment on Pell grants. Senator \nWellstone is prepared to withdraw a filed amendment on infrastructure, \nwhich leaves one pending Wellstone amendment on Head Start. I have been \nadvised that Senator Wellstone is prepared to enter into a unanimous-\nconsent agreement for 1 hour, equally divided, providing he has an \nopportunity to modify his amendment. I will not ask unanimous consent \nfor the moment on that.\n  Senator Wellstone has arrived on the floor. Mr. President, since the \nSenator has just arrived, perhaps I can ask my colleague if the \ninformation is correct that the Senator is prepared to enter into a \nunanimous-consent agreement for 1 hour, equally divided, on his Head \nStart amendment on the understanding that it may be modified, and he is \nprepared to withdraw the other two amendments, one relating to Pell \ngrants and one to education infrastructure?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Yes. I say to my colleague from Pennsylvania, that is \ncorrect. I am prepared to lay this down tomorrow and debate it for 1 \nhour, if there are no second-degree amendments.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. We can enter into a unanimous-consent agreement right \nnow that there be 1 hour, equally divided, with no second-degree \namendments in order and then a motion on or in relation to the \namendment to be offered at the conclusion of 1 hour of debate. I make \nthat unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, did I understand my colleague from \nMinnesota to say that he preferred to offer and debate the amendment \nthis evening?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I had been home and I followed the debate on the \namendment of the Senator from Alabama, and I had wanted to come over \nhere and respond to that.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I renew my question. Did my colleague say \nhe was prepared, after he discusses the amendment by Senator Sessions, \nto debate the issue today so we can vote tomorrow morning?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. No. Mr. President, I would be prepared to lay the \namendment down tomorrow morning as early as he wants.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1125, As Modified\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to modify the amendment to \nreflect the change, which I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1125), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       Strike the last word in amendment.\n       No. 1078. As amended, and insert the following: \n     ``repealed''.\n       ``Sec.   . (a) General Limitation.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, if any attorneys' fees are paid (on \n     behalf of attorneys for the plaintiffs or defendants) in \n     connection with an action maintained by a State against one \n     or more tobacco companies to recover tobacco-related medicaid \n     expenditures or for other causes of action, involved in the \n     settlement agreement, such fees shall--\n       ``(1) not be paid at a rate that exceeds $250 per hour; and\n       ``(2) be limited to a total of $5,000,000.\n       ``(b) Fee Arrangements.--Subsection (a) shall apply to \n     attorneys' fees provided for or in connection with an action \n     of the type described in such subsection under any--\n       ``(1) court order;\n       ``(2) settlement agreement;\n       ``(3) contingency fee arrangement;\n       ``(4) arbitration procedure;\n       ``(5) alternative dispute resolution procedure (including \n     medication); or\n       ``(6) other arrangement providing for the payment of \n     attorneys' fees.\n       ``(c) Expenses.--The limitation described in subsection (a) \n     shall not apply to any amounts provided for the attorneys' \n     reasonable and customary expenses.\n       ``(d) Requirements.--No award of attorneys' fees shall be \n     made under any national tobacco settlement until the \n     attorneys involved have--\n       ``(1) provided to the Governor of the appropriate State, a \n     detailed time accounting with respect to the work performed \n     in relation to any legal action which is the subject of the \n     settlement or with regard to the settlement itself, and\n       ``(2) make public disclosure of the time accounting under \n     paragraph (1) and any fee agreements entered into, or fee \n     arrangements made, with respect to any legal action that is \n     the subject of the settlement.\n       ``(e) Provision of Funds for Children's Health Research.--\n     Any amounts provided for attorneys' fees in excess of the \n     limitation applicable under this section shall be paid into \n     the Treasury for use by the National Institutes of Health for \n     research relating to children's health.\n       ``(f) Effective Date.--The limitation on the payment of \n     attorneys' fees contained in\n\n[[Page S9008]]\n\n     this section shall become effective on the date of enactment \n     of any Act providing for a national tobacco settlement.''\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this is in the nature of a technical \nchange. It doesn't change the basic import of the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I respect the motivation of my colleagues \nwho are offering amendments on the proposed global tobacco settlement \ntonight. As we all know, the issues surrounding this settlement prove \neasy to frame, but difficult to resolve.\n  I have been listening carefully to this debate, and the timing is \nvery interesting to me.\n  Here we are now in September. Everybody would like to see this \nsession end sometime near the end of October, or early in November, at \nthe latest.\n  But as far as the proposed global tobacco settlement goes, people \naround here seem to be assuming it is going to happen when, really, \nbasically, nothing is being done.\n  Yet, tonight we are making arguments and amendments on the assumption \nthat something is going to get enacted.\n  I would suggest to my colleagues, though, that this discussion is \npremature. We do not have all the details of the agreement. No one, \nthat is no one, does, not even any of the parties to the agreement has \nfinal legislative language.\n  We have not even reached a discussion in this body of the most \ngeneral question we have to answer before we decide if the Senate will \nconsider the global tobacco settlement: do we want to further regulate \nthe use and sale of tobacco products in order to protect the public \nhealth and bring a degree of accountability and finality to the surge \nin tobacco-related litigation.\n  More precisely, the question we face during the remaining weeks of \nthis session is whether the global tobacco settlement proposal should \nbe implemented and, after we make that decision, then amendments would \nbe in order.\n  Mr. President, I don't think anybody in this body despises the use of \ntobacco more than I. Frankly, I think tobacco use is wrong, it is \ndeleterious to health, and it basically can ruin people's lives.\n  There is no question that--in the eyes of almost every research \nscientists--tobacco use causes cancer.\n  There is no question that it causes cardiovascular, respiratory, and \nother similar diseases, and still we treat it as though it is a \nsubstance that has every right to exist.\n  As long as it does have the right to exist as a legitimate business \nin this country--and I believe that it will continue to be available--\nthen it seems to me that we have to resolve these problems in an \namicable, decent manner that is in the best interests of this country.\n  As I see it, there is not much happening on the proposed tobacco \nsettlement.\n  There is no use kidding ourselves, the $368 billion settlement \nproposed by the attorneys general and most of the tobacco industry--all \nexcept Liggett & Myers--as I understand it, is an interesting proposal.\n  There is no question, that offers a substantial sum of money. It is \nto be paid over a 25-year period and, if my calculations are correct, \nthe tobacco companies will be able to write off about a third of the \ncost of that settlement at the expense of the taxpayers.\n  There are many, many issues that have to be resolved on the tobacco \nsettlement if we are going to have one at all. Let me name just a few \nof them, in no particular order of importance.\n  No. 1 would be an evaluation of the totality of the settlement. That \nis, as I have said, whether this Congress should seize the window of \nopportunity presented by the tobacco proposal which offers the \npossibility of significant advances in public health and liability \nreform. Are the public health gains it offers something we wish to \npursue? Are the legal reforms it contains sound public policy? Are the \ntwo in appropriate balance?\n\n  No. 2 would be whether the costs associated with implementation of \nthis agreement should be treated for tax purposes as ordinary business \nexpenses?\n  Third would be the appropriate role of the Food and Drug \nAdministration in the regulation of tobacco products. This is an \nextremely complicated issue. It involves an evaluation of the FDA's \ncurrent legal authority, the regulations FDA has promulgated on youth \ntobacco use and the Greensboro court decision, and the future authority \ncalled for in the agreement.\n  The fourth issue is an examination of the constitutional limitations \nposed by an agreement which some believe abrogates their first \namendment, free speech rights.\n  The fifth issue is what I call the ``show me the money'' issue. I \nchallenge anyone to undertake an exhaustive review of the 68-page \nproposed settlement and then delineate clearly how the $368 billion in \nfunds will be allocated. For example, many participants in the \nagreement have said there are funds for children's health. On what \npage? It simply isn't there.\n  And even for the amounts stipulated in the agreement, there is no \ndefinition of how the funds will be divided among states or parties to \nthe agreement.\n  The sixth issue is a consideration of civil justice concerns, such as \nchanging traditional plaintiffs' rights to seek redress through the \ncourts.\n  The seventh issue is how those who were not parties to the original \nagreement will be treated. One company, for example, Liggett & Myers, \nhas now signed agreements with about 25 States and all of the Castano \nclass members. How should those agreements be factored into the \nsettlement?\n  The eighth issue is related. Should there be an accommodation for \nthose who manufacture, sell, or use vending machines or for others who \nhave been engaged in legal businesses and have made a livelihood with \nproducts or services that might not be continued after a settlement is \nfinalized?\n  Here's another important issue. The ninth issue we need to address is \nthat of documents disclosure. Some in this body have called for full \ndisclosure of all tobacco-related documents before any settlement is \nconsidered. Others believe we will never get to a settlement if we \nbecome enmeshed in an investigation of abuses extending back over 30 \nyears.\n  One of the greatest advantages of having a tobacco settlement is the \npublic benefits that may derive from it for our children and indeed our \nsociety as a whole.\n  As we all know, 3,000 kids start smoking a day--teenagers, that is--\n1,000 of whom will become addicted over their lifetimes. These numbers \nare only going up, and it is no secret that part of the reason is that \nthe tobacco industry has basically enticed these kids into smoking.\n  Without a tobacco agreement, we will not be able to put meaningful \nresources into solving these teen tobacco use problems. It is \nquestionable whether we could ever provide the same nationwide \nincentives or resources to not only slow down teenage smoking, but \nperhaps end it forever.\n  And since we are debating the National Institutes of Health funding \nbill, I might mention that without the tobacco settlement, we won't be \nable to have as many funds as we would otherwise have for biomedical \nresearch.\n  It is also apparent that if we break the cigarette companies, we are \nnot going to be able to have 25 years of continual multibillions of \ndollars paid into a settlement agreement system for the benefit of our \nsociety as a whole.\n  There are so many other issues that I hesitate to even begin. But the \nfact is the proposed settlement is complex, it is difficult, and \nCongress basically has done nothing about it since it arrived here on \nJune 20.\n  It is true we have held three hearings in the Judiciary Committee. \nThey have been interesting hearings. They have enlightened us to a \ndegree. We think we now know the issues involved. We have listened to \nthe attorneys general. We have listened to people representing the \ntobacco industry. We have listened to constitutional experts. We have \nlistened to health care specialists.\n  And, frankly, we are going to hold some more hearings on this. But it \nseems to me that we need to address the proposed tobacco settlement \nwith a timetable and a process that will literally cause it to be done. \nWe aren't there yet, and piecemeal amendments\n\n[[Page S9009]]\n\non an appropriations bill won't get us to that point.\n  If the tobacco settlement is not completed by the end of this \nparticular session, I fear we may never have a tobacco settlement. If \nthat is so, we will lose this one-time opportunity to help our children \nand perhaps to help keep millions of kids from ever starting to smoke \nor chew tobacco.\n  If we lose that opportunity, it will be pathetic.\n  It is no secret that the tobacco industry has virtually won every \ncase but one in the history of litigation in this matter. In that one \nparticular case it was a $750,000 verdict. If I understand it \ncorrectly, that is on appeal. And that will be dragged out for another \n10 years by very, very good lawyers who are very, very capable of doing \nexactly that.\n  So, if we do not move ahead and we don't solve these problems, we are \ngoing to find ourselves in a morass where we are right back to business \nas usual, and the tobacco companies will be making billions of dollars \nat the expense of the society at large with no help to our young people \nin this society and not much money for research other than what we can \ngenerate through congressional appropriations. In the end, we lose all \nof the advantages that we could achieve.\n  In fact, there are several things which must occur if we are even \ngoing to try to move forward to an agreement, or move an agreement \nforward.\n  First, the President of the United States has to get off the dime and \nstart leading on this issue.\n  In July, we heard the President would speak out a few days before his \nplanned August 15 vacation. It didn't happen.\n  Earlier this week, we heard the President was supposed to speak out \nabout the settlement this Thursday.\n  Let's speak the plain truth here. Without the President's leadership, \nthe tobacco agreement can't happen.\n  The proposed settlement was announced on June 20. At that time \nPresident Clinton called the concessions attained by negotiators from \nthe tobacco industry ``unimaginable.'' He also tasked top executive \nbranch officials with the job of reviewing the settlement, consulting \nwith the public health community, and advising him on whether or not \nthis agreement adequately protects the Nation's public health \ninterests.\n  Eleven weeks have passed with no final word at all from the White \nHouse on what, if any, changes the President wishes to see. Almost \ndaily we hear, or so it seems, rumors that the President will speak--\nonly to find out that he does not.\n  The President's silence in this area speaks volumes.\n  It has been speculated in the press that the President will say that \nthe level of funding needs to be increased, that the FDA's regulatory \nauthority needs to be strengthened, and that there needs to be greater \naccountability on the part of the tobacco companies if the reduction \ntargets are not met, especially among the Nation's teenagers. But this \nis only speculation at best.\n\n  Should President Clinton support the idea of moving forward, he needs \nto tell our American people, and he needs to reveal what changes, if \nany, he deems to be necessary.\n  We need the President to speak out and tell us precisely where he \nstands and whether he believes there should be an agreement, and an \nagreement this year.\n  We need him to help us to understand where we are going on this \nissue. We need to know how much political capital he is willing to \nexpend on this issue, and we need to know whether he is really serious \nabout solving these problems.\n  With 3,000 children starting to smoke each and every day, I don't \nbelieve the Clinton administration can afford to delay this any longer.\n  Second, I call on parties to the agreement to resolve ambiguities and \nto help produce legislative language agreed upon by all parties so that \nCongress can be crystal clear about the details of the proposal and \ntherefore can plan and judge it accordingly.\n  If the President chooses to take advantage of this one-time \nopportunity, the parties to the agreement have a responsibility to \nsettle ambiguous points within the settlement agreement and provide the \nCongress with their version of the settlement in legislative form.\n  Today, I am challenging the parties to the agreement to do so, to \nprovide us with the details of the agreement beyond the 68-page \nprospectus.\n  I, for one, am willing to look at it. I think the other committee \nchairmen who are involved are willing to look at it as well. We are \nwilling to see if we can mold together an agreement that literally will \nbe in the best interests of the public at large.\n  Let me add that several weeks ago I sent the proposed agreement to \nlegislative counsel and asked them to try to draft a bill based on the \nlanguage of the settlement. We found that these expert draftsmen were \npresented with more questions than answers. So the parties need to get \ntogether and help us to formulate the legislative language. I am \ncalling upon them to do that. If there are problems or ambiguities that \nhave to be resolved, we will help them with that.\n  Third, the parties who negotiated this settlement presented it to \nCongress must also produce others willing to champion this \nunprecedented public health opportunity. Beyond the several attorneys \ngeneral, the plaintiffs bar, and public health groups, few have seized \non the settlement as a viable option. Major legislation such as the \nsettlement envisions has never been approved absent widespread support. \nAnd we aren't there yet, which is another reason why these amendments \nwe are considering tonight are premature.\n  The fact is we will not be there without the President and without an \nawful lot of hard work on the part of all of us here.\n  Fourth and finally, we must consider how we resolve this issue of \ndocument production. The proposed agreement provides that previously \nundisclosed documents be publicly disclosed through a national tobacco \ndocument depository open to the public and located centrally here in \nWashington, DC. These documents would include documents from the files \nof the tobacco companies, including those relating to internal health \nresearch, documents that we have not been able to get up until now.\n  Any documents already produced in the attorney general actions would \nbe immediately deposited, and additional existing documents would be \nplaced in the depository within 3 months of the enactment of the bill.\n  Despite this provision for open disclosure, some in Congress--those \nwho question the settlement most--have proposed immediate disclosure of \nthese documents. The documents in the Minnesota case alone brought by \nAttorney General Hubert Humphrey, who has testified before our \ncommittee, amount to 33 million documents. Such massive disclosure is \nneither practicable nor possible in the presettlement arena.\n  Naturally there are attorneys all over this country who believe that \nthe settlement will never make it through and they are trying to look \nout for their clients. Internal documents which have not yet been \nreleased could be invaluable in such suits.\n  But the greater good demands that we look at an agreement which could \nbring us tremendous public health advances, and it appears that \nagreement could actually be hindered by an exhaustive investigation of \ninternal tobacco documents.\n  I can't blame the cigarette companies for not wanting to produce the \ndocuments in advance--although I cannot in any way condone some of \ntheir past reprehensible behavior. I simply question whether it is the \nappropriate role of Congress to conduct discovery for private \nlitigants.\n  I think we are all indebted to the negotiators for stimulating a \npotentially fruitful public discussion on the public health issues \nattendant to tobacco.\n  I commend the States attorneys general, especially those involved in \nthe class action litigation. I commend the public health \nrepresentatives who have been speaking out, and the representatives of \nthe tobacco industry for advancing the ball in a meaningful direction.\n  The climate has been created for the Congress and the public to have \nopportunities to make significant strides on this whole set of tobacco \nissues.\n  It is clear that the Senate is only in the beginning stages of this \nprocess. Five congressional hearings having been held, and more are \nplanned.\n  I urge my colleagues to let the process work. Let us move a proposal \nin the\n\n[[Page S9010]]\n\nJudiciary Committee. Many of my colleagues here tonight are members of \nthat committee, and we will have ample opportunity for full discussion.\n  I just have to doubt if this is the right time and the place, on the \nLabor-HHS appropriations bill, to be raising these issues that could \nblow the settlement out of the water.\n  I personally believe we ought to move that settlement forward.\n  My study has led me to conclude it is a one-time opportunity to do \nsomething for our kids in this society.\n  It is a one-time opportunity to make significant advances in \nbiomedical research, And it is surely a one-time opportunity to have \nthe tobacco companies fully cooperate in providing all of their \ninternal research for the benefit of the public health at large.\n  There are so many benefits that could derive from a decent \nsettlement, if we can formulate one and keep the parties together.\n  It is time now for the President to speak out.\n  He was supposed to speak out this Thursday. Now they have put it off \nfor another week, knowing that every week that it is put off it is less \nlikely that we can pass something in this Congress.\n  Let me make a prediction. I believe that we are going to lose this \nhistoric opportunity if we do not seize the opportunity, bite the \nbullet, do the work that is necessary, get the involvement of the \ncompanies, the attorneys general and others who are interested in this \nprocess, and come up with a package, that literally, will realize all \nof the public health gains I have been talking about, and more.\n  It is no secret that the tobacco industry may not proceed with the \nsettlement if the North Carolina case, which does indicate that FDA \ndoes have some right to regulate in the area of nicotine, is overturned \non appeal. Many legal experts say that the Greensboro case is iffy at \nbest and that it could very easily be overturned on appeal. In fact, I \nthink there are many good arguments for overturning it on appeal based \non present law and our understanding of present law.\n\n  But let me admonish my colleagues that if that case is overturned on \nappeal, I am not so sure that the tobacco industry is going to proceed \nwith a settlement anyway, because they might just continue to take the \nrisk that juries in the respective States will almost invariably find \nthat those who smoked all of their lives assumed the risk, or were \ncontributorily negligent in doing so. That is why they have won these \ncases in large measure right up to today.\n  I was in Pittsburgh, PA, when the first anticigarette tobacco case \nwas brought, Pritchett versus Liggett & Myers, by the then fabled \nMcArdle law firm. Jimmy McArdle, was one of the leaders, if not the \nleader in the whole country, in paving the way for tobacco litigation. \nHe scared the daylights out of tobacco companies, but lost, one of few \ntimes that great lawyer did not prevail in court.\n  So I have watched this litigation for all of these years. If that \ncase in North Carolina is lost, we will lose a major incentive for the \ntobacco companies to come to the table.\n  Or let's put it another way. If Minnesota Attorney General Hubert \nHumphrey wins his case, the tobacco companies may very well decide not \nto go forward anyway. Or, conversely, if General Humphrey loses, what \nis the incentive for the tobacco companies to stay in the deal?\n  It would be a message to every other attorney general in the country. \nAlready they have decided to fight right to the end the case brought by \nthe Attorney General of Texas. What is the incentive to continue?\n  Right now we have an opportunity for all sides to put something \ntogether. The attorneys general have put inordinate amounts of time and \neffort into this matter, and there is an obligation on our part to try \nto resolve it.\n  But without Presidential leadership, it is very unlikely that we can \nresolve it. If we have the President's endorsement, then I think we \nhave to have leadership here in the Congress to move forward, and to do \nwhat is right.\n  No matter what we do, it is going to be difficult because there are \nthose in the Senate and in the House who resent anything done to the \ntobacco industry. And there are those who feel that anything the \ntobacco industry wants should be blocked.\n  My feeling is that the benefits that could come from a legitimately \nand well put together tobacco settlement clearly outweigh the desire of \nsome to just kill the industry, when in fact they don't have the tools \nto do so.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that the $368 billion figure has to \nchange. We have to give serious consideration to the tax implications, \nas some in this body have suggested. We have got to have some clear-cut \napproach toward FDA authority.\n  We have to do a number of things that literally will make that \nsettlement more acceptable. And we have to bring all sides and all \nparties together, and we have to bring the weight of the Federal \nGovernment, the weight of the administration, the weight of the \nlegislative branch of Government, and ultimately the weight of the \ncourts into bringing this all together so that the public at large can \nbenefit greatly.\n  Personally, I am willing to devote substantial effort toward that \nend. I know other committee chairmen, who have various jurisdictional \nareas in this matter, are willing to work on it as well.\n  In all honesty, we are not going to resolve this by bits and pieces \nin amendments to legislation like this.\n  With regard to the amendment of the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois, let's face it, the language in the Balanced Budget Act was \npretty ambiguous. I see any way that language could be binding; it is \ntoo ambiguous.\n  The language, in my opinion, is not really going to require any \ntobacco settlement to pay for child health insurance. Nevertheless, it \nwould be nice to clarify that matter, and we could do that in a true \ntobacco settlement.\n  With regard to attorneys' fees, I share some of the view of the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama. I agree that there should be a \nlimitation. This should not be a ripoff situation where we have a \nfeeding frenzy on attorney's fees. On the other hand, there are \nattorneys who have worked long and hard and spent a lot of money and a \nlot of effort and time, and without whom the settlement would not have \nbeen brought to this point. They do deserve some compensation for that.\n  I think we were all well aware that the issue of attorneys' fees is \ngoing to have to be solved in any tobacco settlement that happens.\n  I do not believe we can easily solve tonight the problem that has \nbeen raised by the Sessions amendment that would retroactively limit \nattorney fees which have already been a matter of contract between \nStates and private counsels.\n  But we can solve the problem as to how much of this money that \nactually has to be put up over 25 years is going to go for attorneys' \nfees.\n  That is something we are going to have to work to solve. It needs to \nbe done fairly; it needs to be done with wisdom, as with all other \naspects of this agreement, in totality.\n  The way to do it isn't by nit-picking or just by amendment after \namendment in the Chamber. We could literally get into 100 tobacco \namendments on just this appropriations bill alone.\n  I think the way to do it is to get the President to speak out. Let's \nkeep holding our hearings. Let's get a final legislative draft and look \nat it. Let's bring the parties together and demand that the attorneys, \nthe attorneys general, the public health groups, and the tobacco \ncompanies who originally negotiated the deal work to provide us with a \ndraft. Let's reform and refine that draft, factor in the President's \nperspective, and the views of others who did not participate, such as \nthe farmers, and let's move forward to resolution of this issue in the \nbest interests of the American people.\n  I just wanted to make these comments because I am very upset that we \nkeep playing around with this issue. Frankly, if we let it go beyond \nthe end of this year, it may be very difficult, it maybe impossible, to \ndo next year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Bruce Artim be granted access to the \nfloor for the remainder of the session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n\n[[Page S9011]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, a few administrative matters here.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Domenici be added as a cosponsor \nto amendment No. 1121.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1095, as modified\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that the Senate turn to the consideration of \namendment No. 1095 to S. 1061 very briefly and temporarily for \ndisposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. On behalf of Senator Landrieu, I send a modification to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       On page 44, line 2, strike ``$5,606,094,000'' and insert \n     ``5,611,094,000''.\n       On page 85, line 19, further increase the amount by \n     $5,000,000.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. This amendment, Mr. President, provides for an \nadditional $5 million for the adoption opportunities program, bringing \nthe total in the bill to $18 million. The amendment is offset by \nfurther reductions in administrative expenses. It has been cleared on \nboth sides, and accordingly I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1095), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1125\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, very briefly on the pending amendment \noffered by the distinguished Senator from Alabama, I think the debate \nthis evening has been very useful. The comments by the distinguished \nSenator from Utah are cogent. We have had the hearings as noted by \nSenator Hatch in the Judiciary Committee. It is tempting to eliminate \nthe very substantial tax break which is presented in the reconciliation \nbill. Perhaps that is something that can be done now although the \nconsiderations advanced by the Senator from Utah are very weighty.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Alabama to curtail the \nattorney's fees is very much worth considering. I am not sure that the \nproper place for it is on this bill because we really do not know all \nthe underlying facts. When you talk about $250 an hour, that is a \nsubstantial sum of money on an hourly rate. When you talk about a total \nof $5 million, that is a substantial sum of money. The reports are that \nthe attorney's fees in the agreement run into the billions. It may well \nbe that before an intelligent legislative decision can be made on this \nmatter, we will have to know a great deal more about the arrangements \nmade by each State with the attorneys, what their work has involved, \nevaluation of the contingent nature, that is, a likelihood of failure \nso that a contingent fee is set and some consideration on the \nlikelihood of success because if there is no settlement, then there are \nno attorney's fees to be paid, and that may be a fact-specific inquiry \nwhich will take some considerable time ultimately by the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  But in any event, the stage is set. There are other Senators who want \nto discuss this issue. We will proceed to the conclusion of it when we \nresume consideration of the bill tomorrow morning at 9:30.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, might I ask the manager a question? I \nhad come to the floor to speak tonight, but I know it is late and \npeople may be anxious to leave. What would be the order of business \ntomorrow? Is there additional time on the amendment of the Senator from \nAlabama?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I will be glad \nto respond. The pending amendment will remain in the Chamber. The \nSenator from Illinois, [Mr. Durbin], had made a motion to table and \nthen had withdrawn it at my request so that Senators who were not here \nmight have an opportunity to debate tomorrow morning. But that will be \nthe amendment which we will return to at 9:30 tomorrow morning.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I wonder whether, with the support of \nmy colleagues, rather than taking up more time tonight, I might ask \nunanimous consent to be included in the sequence of that order to be \nable to speak once we start for 5 minutes or 10 minutes? I will not do \nit tonight.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if I may respond, I don't think there is \nany unanimous consent order required. If the Senator is here tomorrow \nmorning when we proceed with the bill, I am sure he will be recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair. I will wait until tomorrow, then, \nto speak.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I want to express my appreciation to the distinguished \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, for his remarks. I \nappreciate them. His committee, the Judiciary Committee, of which I am \na member, has begun wrestling with these very complex issues. I think \nhe is exactly correct. It is a matter that requires the leadership of \nthe President. He is going to have to step up to the plate and bring \nhis departments of the U.S. Government on board if there is to be an \nagreement. It has so many possibilities of going awry.\n  I think, personally, I have not decided whether this legislative \nbody, the Congress, ought to get involved in this lawsuit or not. It \nmay be the right thing for us to do. Then again it may turn out that it \nis not. But if we do, I think it is appropriate that we limit the \namount of attorney's fees in these cases. Under the fee agreements that \nI understand are now in place, attorneys, private attorneys, who have \nbeen hired by the States have been involved in litigation maybe only a \nfew weeks and could stand to receive tens of millions, even billions of \ndollars. In fact, most published reports indicate that fees could be as \nhigh as $10 billion to $14 billion in this litigation.\n  That is far too much. That money needs to go to children. That is \nwhat these lawsuits were about, to have that money go to children for \nchildren's health, and that is what this bill would be involved with. \nSo I feel very strongly about that.\n  As to this being a tobacco industry bill, I am surprised the Senator \nfrom Illinois said that because I am supporting his amendment which \nwould add another $50 billion, $60 billion to the tobacco industry, at \nleast take away any benefit that now may come to them in that amount--a \nvery significant issue. And I have come down on his side.\n  I simply say, just as that amendment that came through to change \nperhaps the funding for the tobacco industry to save them a large \namount of money was not fully debated, likewise the attorney's fees \nthat have been out there have not been debated. As a matter of fact, \nthey have not been discussed. At the Judiciary Committee hearing at \nwhich I appeared with Senator Hatch, I asked about attorney's fees of \nseveral of the attorneys general, and I got only evasive answers.\n  So then I submitted written questions to them asking for detailed \nexplanations of what kind of fee agreements had been entered into and \nasked them to respond to me in writing. Over a month has passed, and we \nhave heard nothing from them. So I say there is a side agreement, an \nunhealthy, secret agreement, it appears, between the attorneys for the \nStates and the tobacco industry, that the attorneys general and the \nStates are saying they are not responsible for.\n  You cannot do that. Mr. President, as an attorney, let me say this. \nAn attorney's fidelity must be totally to his or her client, and in \nthis instance, these attorneys, these plaintiff attorneys who have been \nhired to represent most of the States involved who have contingent fee \nagreements with their States need to have their total loyalty to the \nState. But if they are over there on the side entering into a fee \nagreement negotiation with the tobacco industry and saying to the \nAmerican people and the people of the various States involved, ``Don't \nworry about the fee agreement, the tobacco industry is going to pay \nthat,'' make no mistake about it, that is money taken from the \nchildren. That is money taken from the settlement that would go to \nbenefit the health of people who have suffered from smoking. It is a \nside agreement that is not healthy.\n  I have serious questions in my mind as a practicing attorney whether \nor not\n\n[[Page S9012]]\n\nthat is ethical because, you see, if that private side agreement \nbetween the tobacco people and the attorneys about how much money they \nget falls apart, those attorneys get no money--perhaps. And maybe the \ntobacco company can say, well, if you will just agree to this \nrestriction or that restriction, we will agree to pay you two or three \nmore billion dollars in attorney's fees. That is the kind of unhealthy \nrelationship that should never occur in serious litigation, and this is \ncertainly serious litigation.\n\n  The Senator from Kentucky from the other party indicated that this \nsettlement may exceed $500 billion. We cannot allow 10-20 percent of \nthat money to go to attorneys, many of whom have filed lawsuits so \nrecently that the ink is hardly dry on them. They have done very little \nlitigation. Yet we are at the point of the tobacco industry coming in \nand agreeing to settle and pay it all and the litigation would \npresumably end and then they would get these huge sums in legal fees. I \nthink it is a very important matter, and as far as this Senator is \nconcerned I will not support any agreement, I will not support any \nglobal settlement legislation from this body that does not fully \ndisclose every dime that is being paid, and I don't think we should.\n  In addition to that, I think this body ought to make clear that if \nany settlement does occur, we should cap the amount of legal fees. I \nthink $250 an hour is fine pay for any good lawyer, and that is the \nmaximum they ought to be paid. If they are not worth that--they do not \nnormally charge that--they should not get $250. But we say no more than \n$250 an hour and no more than $5 million per State. So that is 50 \nStates to perhaps pay $5 million, and we could save substantial sums of \nmoney, Mr. President, that could go to benefit children's health in \nthis country and not be involved in windfalls to attorneys who may have \ndone very little work at all.\n  I think this is a good bill. I just point out that, of course, if \nthere is a global settlement and there needs to be some changes in the \nactual formula or caps involved in the payment of attorney's fees, that \ncould be made a part of it. But I think this body right now needs to \nsend a message to the people of this country that we are going to \ninsist on full disclosure and we are going to put some reasonable \nlimits on how much money can be spent on attorney's fees.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1125, as Modified Further\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, at this point I would like to further \nmodify my amendment to address the concerns of the Senator from Iowa \nwith regard to the ongoing State suits versus the national tobacco \nsettlement.\n  I send that to the desk at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to modify his \namendment. The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1125), as modified further, is as follows:\n\n       Strike the last word in amendment No. 1078, as amended, and \n     insert the following: ``Repealed.\n       ``Sec.   . (a) General Limitation.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, if any attorneys' fees are paid (on \n     behalf of attorneys for the plaintiffs or defendants) in \n     connection with an action maintained by a State against one \n     or more tobacco companies to recover tobacco-related medicaid \n     expenditures or for other causes of action, involved in the \n     National Tobacco Settlement Agreement, such fees shall--\n       ``(1) not be paid at a rate that exceeds $250 per hour; and\n       ``(2) be limited to a total of $5,000,000.\n       ``(b) Fee Arrangements.--Subsection (a) shall apply to \n     attorneys' fees provided for or in connection with an action \n     of the type described in such subsection under any--\n       ``(1) court order;\n       ``(2) settlement agreement;\n       ``(3) contingency fee arrangement;\n       ``(4) arbitration procedure;\n       ``(5) alternative dispute resolution procedure (including \n     mediation); or\n       ``(6) other arrangement providing for the payment of \n     attorneys' fees.\n       ``(c) Expenses.--The limitation described in subsection (a) \n     shall not apply to any amounts provided for the attorneys' \n     reasonable and customary expenses.\n       ``(d) Requirements.--No award of attorneys' fees shall be \n     made under any national tobacco settlement until the \n     attorneys involved have--\n       ``(1) provided to the Governor of the appropriate State, a \n     detailed time accounting with respect to the work performed \n     in relation to any legal action which is the subject of the \n     settlement or with regard to the settlement itself; and\n       ``(2) made public disclosure of the time accounting under \n     paragraph (1) and any fee agreements entered into, or fee \n     arrangements made, with respect to any legal action that is \n     the subject of the settlement.\n       ``(e) Provision of Funds for Children's Health Research.--\n     Any amounts provided for attorneys' fees in excess of the \n     limitation applicable under this section shall be paid into \n     the Treasury for use by the National Institutes of Health for \n     research relating to children's health.\n       ``(f) Effective Date.--The limitation on the payment of \n     attorneys' fees contained in this section shall become \n     effective on the date of enactment of any Act providing for a \n     national tobacco settlement.''\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the effect of this amendment would be to \nmake sure this amendment applies to tobacco attorneys, too. It would \nlimit their fees if they were in excessive amounts.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1122\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, my colleague Senator Gorton has introduced \nan amendment which would return federal funding for education programs \nserving grades K-12 directly to school districts. Currently, nearly one \nthird of all the money spent on education by the federal government \nends up at the Department of Education. However, of that amount, only \n13.1 percent actually reaches local school districts.\n  Mr. President, the Federal Government currently administers so many \neducation programs which it cannot efficiently control, nor can it \ndetermine if it is money well spent. The vast number of these programs \nare redundant and could be easily combined. Over the years, as new \nideas and innovations in education have been enacted, we have not \nreviewed programs currently in place which serve similar purposes. The \nresult has been a growing Washington bureaucracy, with more federal \nregulations affecting the day-to-day workings of our local schools.\n  Clearly, when it comes to the education of our young people, one size \ndoes not fit all. This amendment would remove Washington bureaucrats \nfrom what should be local decisions. Parents, teachers, and local \nschool officials are far better prepared to determine how best to use \nscarce resources. We should express our confidence in parents, our \nteachers and our principals to decide how best to use limited resources \nto meet the needs of children--who ultimately are the ones we must \nserve. Washington bureaucrats, far removed from these local situations, \ncannot accurately make those decisions.\n  Mr. President, I am sure that during debate on this amendment and \ndebate on this bill, we will hear from others in this body about the \nneed to preserve Congress' role in providing for the education of our \nnation's children. Certainly, there is a role for Congress in this \narea, but I believe it is a more limited role.\n  I must point out that this amendment would not reduce by one dime the \namount of funding provided by the federal government for education \nnationwide. Instead, it will ensure that the status quo which has \nsentenced our schools to mediocrity will be reformed to enable parents, \nteachers and local decisionmakers to enact innovative reforms to our \neducation system.\n  Mr. President, I believe in this approach because I believe in \nparents--who have the biggest stake in their parent's success and \nfulfillment. I believe in teachers--who, everyday, stand before \nclassrooms of children and challenge their minds with knowledge and \nideas, who inspire them to dream and imagine, who help them open the \ndoors to success. These are the ones we should seek to help, because \ntheir efforts will determine how America fares in the 21st Century--\nthey will determine whether we continue to lead in the world or whether \nwe will allow that leadership to fall on some other nation.\n  I'm confident that our parents, teachers, and students can build the \nbest education system in the world, if only Washington ``experts'' will \njust get out of the way. Let's show them that Congress believes in \ntheir abilities\n\n[[Page S9013]]\n\nto make the right decisions for the future of our children by \nsupporting this amendment. I thank the chair and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     Medicare Commission Provision\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Iowa \n[Mr. Harkin], for his efforts to include language in this \nappropriations bill relating to the Bipartisan Commission on the Future \nof Medicare. I also want to thank his colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom Iowa [Mr. Grassley], who chairs the Senate Special Committee on \nAging, for joining me in advocating some additional direction to the \nCommission with respect to long-term care. I very much enjoy working \nwith Senator Grassley on the Aging Committee, where he has continued a \nlong tradition of bipartisanship.\n  Mr. President, the language added to the bill at our request touches \non one aspect of an enormously important segment of health care, namely \nlong-term care. I have been deeply involved in long-term care issues \nfor nearly 15 years, and have advocated significant reforms to our \ncurrent system both at the State and Federal level.\n  Mr. President, many will recall that as part of the Balanced Budget \nAct of 1997, we created the so-called National Bipartisan Commission on \nthe Future of Medicare. Established because of the need to reform and \nmodernize the principal health care system of our Nation's seniors, \nthat Commission will examine a host of issues relating to health care \ncoverage and will make recommendations that we hope can lead to an \nimproved Medicare system, one which will not only deliver better health \ncare but also provide some relief from the growing pressure Medicare \nhas been placing on our Federal budget.\n  One of the key issues to be examined by the Commission is the area of \nchronic disease and disability.\n  Mr. President, effective treatment of individuals with chronic health \ncare needs requires a combination of acute and preventive care, disease \nmanagement, health monitoring, and long-term care services and \nsupports. However, as it is now structured, the Medicare fee-for-\nservice program responds to specific and discrete episodes of care \nthrough separate providers, and often discourages timely, coordinated \ncost-effective chronic care.\n  Mr. President, more than 20 percent of Medicare beneficiaries today \nhave chronic health care needs, and they are the fastest growing \nsegment of the Medicare population. A major part of the health care for \nthese beneficiaries with chronic needs are the long-term care services \nand supports which are separately financed by beneficiaries and their \nfamilies, or, for those without personal resources, by Medicaid and the \nStates.\n  This latter group of people with chronic care needs, those who are \neligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, help make up a particularly \nimportant group of beneficiaries. The so-called dually eligible make up \nabout one-sixth of the population of these two programs, but account \nfor nearly one-third of program expenditures and rightly have captured \nthe attention of policy makers as one of the critical targets for \npolicy reforms in the two programs. As a recent hearing of the Aging \nCommittee revealed, the lack of coordination between these two \nprograms, and more generally between Medicare and long-term care, \ncreates perverse incentives for cost-shifting in the health care \nsystem, and often results in excess cost, inappropriate care, or no \ncare at all.\n  Mr. President, while the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future \nof Medicare is already directed to examine this critical population, \nour proposal goes further be specifically calling on the Commission to \nexamine the potential for coordinating Medicare with cost-effective \nlong-term care services.\n  Mr. President, I want to underscore the language we had included in \nthe bill does not limit or even specify what the Commission might \nconsider in reviewing the potential for coordinating Medicare with \nlong-term care services. But there are a number of matters deserving \nthe Commission's attention that I want to highlight, including the \nsuccess of a number of States, such as Wisconsin, in developing \neffective long-term care programs built on flexible delivery systems \nthat deliver more cost-effective, individualized care. The Commission \nshould also take a particularly close look at efforts which build upon \nthe existing system of informal supports, often provided by family \nmembers and friends, that currently account for the vast majority of \nlong-term care provided in this country.\n  More generally, while the primary focus of the Commission will be the \nfuture of Medicare, as the Commission calculates the future cost of the \ncurrent Medicare program, I urge it take into consideration the total \ncosts of care for individuals with chronic illnesses and disabilities, \nincluding the cost of long-term care services and supports, whether \nthose costs accrue to Medicare, Medicaid, private insurers, or \nbeneficiaries and their families. It is neither good budgeting policy \nnor good health care policy to partition off health care service \nplanning, making changes to one program while ignoring the effect those \nchanges will have in other areas.\n  Mr. President, unlike the near-term focus of the budget process, the \nrecommendations that we expect the Commission will make regarding \nMedicare will be based on a much longer and broader view. Some of the \ndefects of the current Medicare program are arguably the result of \nshort-term budget considerations that have led to unintended, sometimes \nexpensive consequences. By taking a broader view, the Commission can \navoid some of these past errors, and possibly contribute to one of the \nhighest health care priorities we have, the need for significant long-\nterm care reform.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1074\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment offered \nby my distinguished colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain. The \namendment would dedicate an additional $100 million to research on \nParkinson's disease, an effort driven by my accomplished mentor and \ndear friend, Morris K. Udall.\n  The statistics are staggering. While over a million Americans battle \nParkinson's at a cost of $26 billion annually, the Federal commitment \nto Parkinson's research is only $27 million. While it is not only \nimpossible but unfair to try and determine what disease should get more \nfunding for research while another gets less, these statistics say \nunequivocally that Parkinson's deserves more.\n  While I have many fond memories of Mo, his thirty years of \nunparalleled service to this country, his ever present wit and his \nstatesmanship, one of my fondest memories is of a circumstance in which \nhe exhibited rarely matched courage and integrity. While both in the \nHouse of Representatives, I had the honor of crusading with Mo to \nremove a painting from a wall in the Capitol that was both offensive \nand demeaning to Native Americans. That painting, that symbol of \ndominance, hung for years. Mo Udall took it down. He took down many \nsuch injustices during his tenure in Congress.\n  Parkinson's has robbed us of too many valuable people. I feel very \nstrongly that the 64 Members of the Senate who cosponsored this bill \nshould follow through on their initial--overwhelming--show of support \nand adopt the amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/09/senate-section/article/S8989-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Background and purpose of this rulemaking\n       The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (``CAA'' or \n     the ``Act''), Pub. L. 104-1, 109 Stat. 3, 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 1301-1438, was enacted on January 23, 1995. The CAA \n     applies the rights and protections of eleven labor and \n     employment and public access laws to covered employees and \n     employing offices within the Legislative Branch.\n       Sections 204, 205, and 215 apply three of these laws. \n     Section 204 of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1314, applies the \n     rights and protections under the Employee Polygraph \n     Protection Act of 1988 (``EPPA''), by providing generally \n     that no employing office may require a covered employee to \n     take a lie detector test where such a test would be \n     prohibited if required by an employer under paragraph (1), \n     (2), or (3) of section 3 of the EPPA, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 2002(1), \n     (2), (3). Section 205 of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1315, applies \n     the rights and protections of the Worker Adjustment and \n     Retraining Notification Act (``WARN Act''), by providing \n     generally that no employing office shall be closed or a mass \n     layoff ordered within the meaning of section 3 of the WARN \n     Act, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 2102, until 60 days after the employing \n     office has provided written notice to covered employees. \n     Section 215 of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1341, applies the \n     rights and protections of section 5 of the Occupational \n     Safety and Health Act of 1970 (``OSHAct''), by providing \n     generally that each employing office and each covered \n     employee must comply with the provisions of section 5 of the \n     OSHAct, 29 U.S.C. Sec. 654.\n       For most covered employees and employing offices, sections \n     204 and 205 became effective on January 23, 1996, and section \n     215 became effective on January 1, 1997. However, ``with \n     respect to the General Accounting Office and the Library of \n     Congress,'' the CAA provides that sections 204, 205, and 215 \n     ``shall be effective . . . 1 year after transmission to the \n     Congress of the study under section 230.'' Sections \n     204(d)(2), 205(d)(2), 215(g)(2) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 1314(d)(2), 1315(d)(2), 1341(g)(2). This ``study \n     under section 230'' is a study of the application of certain \n     laws, regulations, and procedures at the General Accounting \n     Office (``GAO''), the Government Printing Office (``GPO''), \n     and the Library of Congress (``Library''), which the Board \n     was directed to undertake by section 230 of the CAA, as \n     amended, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1371. The Board transmitted the \n     completed study to Congress on December 30, 1996, and \n     sections 204, 205, and 215 will therefore become effective \n     with respect to GAO and the Library on December 30, 1997.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ The study under section 230, as well as copies of the \n     December 30, 1996 letters from the Board transmitting the \n     study to Congress, are available for inspection in the Law \n     Library Reading Room, at the address and times stated at the \n     beginning of this Notice. The study may also be viewed on the \n     Office of Compliance's Internet web site at either http://\nwww.compliance.gov/230.html or http://www.access.gpo.gov/\ncompliance/230.html.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The CAA requires that the Board adopt regulations to \n     implement sections 204, 205, and 215, and further requires \n     that these regulations be the same as the substantive \n     regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to \n     implement the provisions of applicable statute, except if the \n     Board determines, for good cause shown, that a modification \n     would be more effective for the implementation of the rights \n     and protections under these sections. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 1314(c), 1315(c), 1341(d). The Board has adopted \n     regulations implementing these sections with respect to \n     employing offices other than GAO and the Library, and the \n     purpose of this rulemaking is to adopt regulations \n     implementing these sections with respect to GAO and the \n     Library as well.\n     2. Record of earlier rulemakings\n       To avoid duplication of effort in proposing and adopting \n     regulations with respect to GAO and the Library, the Board \n     plans to rely, in part, on the record of its earlier \n     rulemakings. The regulations implementing sections 204 and \n     205 of the CAA were proposed, adopted, and issued during the \n     latter part of 1995 and the first part of 1996, and, during \n     that period, the Board solicited comment and explained the \n     basis and purpose of the regulations in several notices \n     published in the Congressional Record. On September 28, 1995, \n     the Board published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \n     (``ANPRM''), in which the Board solicited comments before \n     promulgating proposed rules under several sections of the \n     CAA, including sections 204 and 205. 141 Cong. Rec. S14542-44 \n     (daily ed. Sept. 28, 1995). On November 28, 1995, the Board \n     issued NPRMs proposing regulations under sections 204 and \n     205, among others, 141 Cong. Rec. S17652-64 (daily ed. Nov. \n     28, 1995), and on January 22, 1996, the Board published \n     Notices of Adoption of Regulation and Submission for Approval \n     and Issuance of Interim Regulations under these sections, 142 \n     Cong. Rec. S262-74 (daily ed. Jan. 22, 1996). The Board also \n     proposed and adopted separate regulations, pursuant to \n     section 204(a)(3) of the CAA, authorizing the Capitol Police \n     to use lie detector tests. 141 Cong. Rec. S14544-45 (daily \n     ed. Sept. 28, 1995) (NPRM); 142 Cong. Rec. S260-62 (daily ed. \n     Jan. 22, 1996) (Notice\n\n[[Page S9015]]\n\n     of Adoption, etc.). The adopted regulations were then \n     approved by Congress, and, on April 23, 1996, the Board's \n     Notices of Issuance of Final Regulations were published in \n     the Congressional Record setting forth the text of the final \n     regulations implementing several CAA sections, including 204 \n     and 205. 142 Cong. Rec. S3917-24, S3948-52 (daily ed. Apr. \n     23, 1996).\n       The Board published proposed regulations to implement \n     section 215 on September 19, 1996, 142 Cong. Rec. H10711-19 \n     (daily ed. Sept. 19, 1996), and published its Notice of \n     Adoption and Submission for Approval for these regulations on \n     January 7, 1997, 143 Cong. Rec. S61-70 (Jan. 7, 1997). The \n     House and Senate have not yet approved the section 215 \n     regulations, and, accordingly, these regulations have not yet \n     been issued.\\2\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\2\\ Although the Board's regulations implementing section 215 \n     have not yet been issued, section 411 of the CAA provides \n     that, in proceedings to enforce most provisions of the CAA, \n     including section 215, ``if the Board has not issued a \n     regulation on a matter for which this Act requires a \n     regulation to be issued, the hearing officer, Board, or \n     court, as the case may be, shall apply, to the extent \n     necessary and appropriate, the most relevant substantive \n     executive agency regulation promulgated to implement the \n     statutory provision at issue in the proceeding.'' 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1411.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     3. Proposed amendments\n       The Board is presently aware of no reason why the \n     regulations to be adopted under section 204, 205, or 215 for \n     GAO and the Library and their employees should be separate or \n     substantively different from the regulations already adopted \n     for other employing offices and their employees. The Board \n     therefore proposes in this NPRM to expand the coverage of the \n     regulations already adopted under sections 204, 205, and 215 \n     to include GAO and the Library and their employees, and to \n     make no other substantive change to the regulations.\n       a. Regulations Under Section 204--Rights and Protections \n     Under the Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988. The \n     Board's two regulations implementing section 204 of the CAA--\n     i.e., the exclusion for employees of the Capitol Police, \n     and the regulations covering all other employing offices \n     except GAO and the Library--were issued in final form and \n     published in the April 23, 1996 issue of the Congressional \n     Record, 142 Cong. Rec. S3917-24 (Apr. 23, 1996). In the \n     regulations for employing offices other than the Capitol \n     Police, the scope of coverage is established by the \n     definitions of ``covered employee'' in section 1.2(c) and \n     ``employing office'' in section 1.2(i). The Board proposes \n     to amend these regulations by adding any employee of GAO \n     or the Library to the definition of ``covered employee,'' \n     and by adding GAO and the Library to the definition of \n     ``employing office.''\n       b. Regulations under Section 205--Rights and Protections \n     Under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act. \n     Regulations implementing section 205 for employing offices \n     other than GAO and the Library were issued in final form and \n     published in the April 23, 1996 issue of the Congressional \n     Record, 142 Cong. Rec. S3949-52 (Apr. 23, 1996). The scope of \n     coverage of these regulations is established by the \n     definition of ``employing office'' in section 639.3(a)(1). As \n     presently drafted, the definition in section 639(a)(1) \n     incorporates by reference the definition of ``employing \n     office'' in section 101(9) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1301(9), \n     which includes all covered employees and employing offices \n     other than GAO and the Library. The Board proposes to amend \n     these regulations by adding to the definition of ``employing \n     office'' a reference to section 205(a)(2) of the CAA, which, \n     for purposes of section 205, adds GAO and the Library to the \n     definition of ``employing office.''\n       c. Regulations under Section 215--Rights and Protections \n     Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. \n     Regulations implementing section 215 for employing offices \n     other than GAO and the Library were adopted by the Board and \n     published in the January 7, 1997 issue of the ``Congressional \n     Record, 143 Cong. Rec. S61-79 (Jan. 7, 1997). The scope of \n     coverage of these regulations is established by the \n     definition of ``covered employee'' in section 1.102(c), the \n     definition of ``employing office'' in section 1.102(i), and a \n     listing in both sections 1.102(j) and 1.103 of entities that, \n     pursuant to the regulations are included as employing offices \n     if responsible for correcting a violation of section 215 of \n     the CAA. The Board proposes to amend these regulations by \n     adding any employee of GAO or of the Library to the \n     definition of ``covered employee,'' and by adding GAO and the \n     Library to the definition of ``employing office'' and to the \n     entities listed in sections 1.102(j) and 1.103 that can be \n     included as employing offices.\n       In addition to the proposed changes described above, \n     several typographical and other minor corrections are being \n     made to the regulations being amended, including a few \n     corrections and changes to the list of Department of Labor's \n     regulations under the OSHAct that are incorporated by \n     reference into the regulations adopted by the Board under \n     section 215 of the CAA.\\3\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\3\\ In the regulations implementing section 204 of the CAA, \n     in the definitions of ``employing office'' and ``covered \n     employee'' in sections 1.2(c) and (i), the references to the \n     Office of Technology Assessment (``OTA'') and to employees of \n     OTA are being removed, as OTA no longer exists. In the \n     regulations implementing section 205 of the CAA, the title at \n     the beginning of the regulations is being corrected. In the \n     regulations implementing section 215 of the CAA, in the \n     definition of ``employing office'' in section 1.102(i), ``the \n     Senate'' is stricken from clause (1) and ``of a Senator'' is \n     inserted instead, and ``or a joint committee'' is stricken \n     from that clause, for conformity with the text of section \n     101(9)(A) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1301(9)(A). In section \n     1.102(j) of those regulations, ``a violation of this \n     section'' is stricken and ``a violation of section 215 of the \n     CAA (as determined under section 1.106)'' is inserted \n     instead, for consistency with the language in section 1.103 \n     of the regulations. Furthermore, in Appendix A to Part 1900 \n     of the regulations, several editorial and technical errors \n     are being corrected in the cross-references to the Secretary \n     of Labor's regulations under the OSHAct and recent changes in \n     the Secretary's regulations are being incorporated. These \n     corrections comport with the Board's stated intention to \n     incorporate by reference the Labor Secretary's substantive \n     regulations in effect at the time the Board approved the \n     regulations under section 215 of the CAA, and to update the \n     list of incorporated regulations when necessitated by the \n     Secretary's changes to those regulations. See 142 Cong. Rec. \n     H10711, H10715 (daily ed. Sept. 19, 1996) (NPRM under section \n     215); section 1900.1(c) of the Board's regulations under \n     section 215, 143 Cong. Rec. S61, S67 (daily ed. Jan. 7, \n     1997).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     4. Request for Comment\n       The Board invites comment on these proposed amendments \n     generally, and invites comment specifically on whether there \n     is any reason why the regulations to be adopted under section \n     204, 205, or 215 for GAO and the Library and their employees \n     should be separate or substantively different from the \n     regulations already adopted for other employing offices and \n     their employees.\n       Recommended method of approval. The Board proposes that it \n     will adopt three identical versions of the amendments and \n     recommends: (1) that the version amending the regulations \n     that apply to the Senate and employees of the Senate be \n     approved by the Senate by resolution, (2) that the version \n     amending the regulations that apply to the House of \n     Representatives and employees of the House of Representatives \n     be approved by the House by resolution, and (3) that the \n     version amending the regulations that apply to other covered \n     employees and employing offices be approved by the Congress \n     by concurrent resolution.\n       The Board expects to adopt the amendments and to submit \n     them to the House and Senate for approval by three separate \n     documents, one for the amendments under section 204 of the \n     CAA, one for the amendments under section 205, and one for \n     the amendments under section 215. This procedure will enable \n     the House and Senate to consider and act on the amendments \n     under sections 204, 205, and 215 separately, if the House and \n     Senate so choose. The Board's regulations under section 215 \n     have not yet been approved by the House and Senate, and, if \n     the regulations remain unapproved when the Board adopts the \n     amendments under section 215, the Board recommends that the \n     House and Senate approve those amendments together with the \n     regulations.\n       Signed at Washington, D.C., on this 5th day of September, \n     1997.\n                                                    Glen D. Nager,\n                         Chair of the Board, Office of Compliance.\n       Accordingly, the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance hereby proposes the following amendments to its \n     regulations:\n\nAmendments to Regulations Under Section 204 of the CAA--Application of \nRights and Protections of the Employee Polygraph Protection Act of 1988\n\n       It is proposed that the regulations implementing section \n     204 of the CAA, issued by publication in the Congressional \n     Record on April 23, 1996 at 142 Cong. Rec. S3917-3924 (daily \n     ed.

Apr. 23, 1996), be amended by revising the title at the \n     beginning of the regulations, and the introductory text of \n     the first sentence 639.3(a)(1), to read as follows:\n\n\n ``application of rights and protections of the worker adjustment and \nretraining notification act\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n[[Page S9016]]\n\n\n     ``Sec. 639.3 Definitions.\n       ``(a) Employee office.

A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to make safety \na priority of the Federal-aid highway program; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n                    the highway safety priority act\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, there is a national health epidemic in \nAmerica that does not receive the attention it deserves. This epidemic \nis responsible for the loss of 1.2 million pre-retirement years of life \na year; more than is lost to cancer or heart disease. It is the leading \ncause of death for Americans between the ages of 15 and 24. Last year, \nmore than 41,900 Americans died from this epidemic and more than 3 \nmillion suffered serious injury. In Nebraska alone, the epidemic \nclaimed 293 lives in 1996 up from 254 the year before. The only good \nnews has been that in Nebraska, during the first 6 months of this year, \nthe death rate has slowed slightly. Most tragic, is the fact that this \nepidemic is almost 100 percent preventable.\n  This epidemic I am talking about is death and injuries related to \ndriving. While America has made significant progress in reducing \ntraffic accident rates, deaths, and injuries have trended upward in the \n1990's.\n  Traffic accidents impose extraordinary costs on our health care \nsystem. About $14 billion a year in health care costs are attributable \nto traffic accidents. Taxpayers bear $11.4 billion of that cost. In \nterms of lost productivity, property damage and health care costs, \nthese accidents extracted $150 billion out of the economy for the last \nyear that statistics are available.\n  The most important point is that traffic accidents are almost \ncompletely preventable. The smallest actions of a driver can make the \ndifference between life and death. One lapse in judgment, one moment of \ninattention can end in tragedy. As drivers, too often, we take for \ngranted the immense power and responsibility we possess when behind the \nwheel. As public officials we need to be constantly attentive to the \nneed to make our transportation system safer.\n  The Congress is working on legislation to reauthorize the Nation's \nbasic highway law. It is one of the most important bills the Senate \nwill consider. I strongly believe that we should use this opportunity \nto commit ourselves to enhancing safety on America's highways and \nbyways. In that spirit, I introduce the Highway Safety Priority Act.\n  This legislation systematically makes clear that safety is a priority \nin highway construction and maintenance programs. It sends a strong \nmessage to Federal, State, and local transportation planners that they \nshould focus on enhancing safety.\n  I encourage my colleagues to study and support the Highway Safety \nPriority Act which I introduce today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1155\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill disapproving the cancellations transmitted by the \nPresident on August 11, 1997, regarding Public Law 105-34; to the \nCommittee on Finance, pursuant to the order of for 7 days of session \npursuant to section 1023 of Public Law 93-344.\n\n\n                        DISAPPROVAL LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am introducing today a bill to disapprove \nthe President's line-item veto of a provision providing tax relief when \nan agricultural production facility is sold to a farmer cooperative--a \nveto that has produced a cry of outrage from Idaho's farm families.\n  I am disappointed that the President vetoed this provision of the Tax \nRelief Act of 1997. This provision had strong bipartisan support in \nboth the Senate and the House. This type of tax relief deserves to be \ndebated on the merits and enacted into law.\n  Because of the large number of ultimate beneficiaries involved in \nthis kind of tax provision, it is my opinion that this item was \nerroneously identified as a candidate for a line-item veto.\n  In Idaho, for example, in a single co-op, there are 1,130 family farm \nmembers who have been interested in this kind of tax law change for a \nlong time.\n  Changes in agricultural policy over recent years are intended to make \nAmerican agriculture more market based. Prior changes in tax laws \nraised hurdles for agriculture at a time when world markets were \nbecoming more competitive. Current tax law allows some advantages to \ncorporations and other entities that are denied to farmer cooperatives.\n  To allow family farmers in Idaho and across America to remain \nproductive and effective in this changing environment, our tax laws \nneed further revision. The provision the President vetoed would have \nhelped, by allowing farmer cooperatives, by expanding their operations \nand compete more fully and fairly.\n  I do not believe the President vetoed this provision without \nreservations. The White House has said publicly that the issue of \nensuring the competitive ability of farmer cooperatives should be \naddressed. The administration had technical objections which, I \nbelieve, we should be able to work out.\n  It is my hope, and it is fully my intention in introducing this bill \ntoday, that Members of Congress, from both sides of the aisle, and the \nadministration can now sit down and work out the details of similar \nlegislation and produce a win-win solution--one that helps farm \nfamilies and addresses technical concerns expressed by the \nadministration.\n  I also want to address some important procedural matters.\n  I am optimistic that, ultimately, legislation providing relief to \nfarmer cooperatives and making any necessary and reasonable technical \nchanges, will move on a track totally separate from this bill. That is \nmy hope and intent.\n  But we are constrained by procedure and timing in the introduction of \nthis bill. Introduction of this bill, in this form, no later than \ntoday, is the only way to keep all procedural options open to the \nCongress.\n  The Line Item Veto Act prescribes the precise form and content of \nthis type of bill. Therefore, this bill refers to one other vetoed item \nbesides the farmer cooperative item I have addressed. It is my \nunderstanding that persons supporting that item already are working out \nits consideration on a separate track.\n  I hope and expect that the same will be true of the farmer \ncooperative item many in this body have supported. I stand ready to \nwork with my colleagues and the administration on any reasonable, \ntechnical changes needed to enact such needed tax relief into law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1157\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     Congress disapproves of cancellations 97-1 and 97-2 as \n     transmitted by the President in a special message on August \n     11, 1997, regarding Public Law 105-34.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Res. 119\n\n       Whereas the basic formula price for milk established by the \n     Secretary of Agriculture under Federal milk marketing orders \n     fell to a 6-year low of $10.70 in May 1997 following months \n     of substantial price volatility and remained at similarly low \n     levels throughout the summer of 1997;\n       Whereas the basic formula price for milk announced for each \n     month since April 1997 has been below the cost of producing \n     milk for milk producers in all regions of the United States, \n     as calculated by the Department of Agriculture;\n       Whereas income losses to milk producers resulting from low \n     milk prices have imposed economic hardship on milk producers \n     in all regions of the United States;\n       Whereas lost income to milk producers may create economic \n     losses to businesses and result in loss of jobs in rural \n     communities;\n       Whereas milk producers, rural residents, and agribusinesses \n     in rural areas have petitioned the Secretary of Agriculture \n     to implement an emergency milk price floor to provide price \n     relief to milk producers;\n       Whereas the Secretary of Agriculture has authority under \n     the Agricultural Adjustment Act (7 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), \n     reenacted with amendments by the Agricultural Marketing \n     Agreement Act of 1937, to establish minimum prices paid to \n     milk producers covered by Federal milk marketing orders; and\n       Whereas the Secretary of Agriculture has authority under \n     section 143 of the Agricultural Market Transition Act (7 \n     U.S.C. 7253) to use informal rulemaking to reform Federal \n     milk marketing orders: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     Secretary of Agriculture should immediately use the authority \n     of the Secretary under the Agricultural Adjustment Act (7 \n     U.S.C. 601 et seq.), reenacted with amendments by the \n     Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, to establish a \n     temporary emergency minimum milk price that--\n       (1) is equitable to all producers nationwide; and\n       (2) provides price relief to economically distressed milk \n     producers.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to submit a resolution which I \nhope all of my colleagues will support. Milk is\n\n[[Page S9021]]\n\nproduced in every State of this country and in recent months the dairy \nfarmers who produce that milk have suffered from unusually low milk \nprices. I am pleased to be joined in offering this resolution by the \nSenator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter], my senior Senator from \nWisconsin [Mr. Kohl], the Senator from New York [Mr. Moynihan], and \nboth Senators from Louisiana [Mr. Breaux and Ms. Landrieu] all of whom \nhave worked hard over the past 10 months to find solutions to the \nproblem of low milk prices.\n  The resolution we are introducing today expresses the sense of the \nSenate that the Secretary of Agriculture should use his administrative \nauthority under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 to set \na temporary emergency price floor under milk prices.\n  Mr. President, as I am sure many Members are aware, milk prices have \nfallen in the past several months to levels far below the amount it \ncosts many dairy farmers to produce that milk. In fact, the basic \nformula price for milk as calculated by USDA for every month since \nApril has been below the cost of producing milk for all regions of the \ncountry--including the lowest cost milk producers in California. This \nsituation might be bearable if dairy farmers had any assurance that \nprices might rebound--that the financial strain they are under would be \nalleviated--but many predictions about milk prices over the past 10 \nmonths have simply proven inaccurate.\n  Last fall, milk prices fell from $14.13 per hundred pounds in October \nto $11.61 in November. This dramatic decline in milk prices was nearly \nunprecedented. And while milk prices were strong prior to the milk \nprice collapse last fall, the higher prices of mid-1996 reflected the \nextremely high cost of feed last year which left dairy farmers with \nlittle to show from those high milk prices. Feed is the single most \nimportant, and most expensive, input to milk production. It is \nfrequently the case that the cost of the input--in this case, forage \nand feed grains such as corn--is reflected in the cost of the output--\nmilk. So while some dairy producers may have found 1996 to be a good \nyear, many more were struggling under high feed bills that still had to \nbe paid long after the strong milk prices had evaporated.\n  Despite the milk price crash late last year, many dairy farmers had \nexpressed optimism for 1997 as milk prices incrementally rose early \nthis year, and were expected to continue to rise throughout the year. \nMany of my colleagues joined me and other dairy State Senators in \nasking the Secretary of Agriculture to take administrative steps to \nshore up milk prices, such as making advance purchases of cheese and \nother dairy products for the school lunch and breakfast programs and to \nexport more dairy products under the Dairy Export Incentive Program. \nThe Secretary took a number of steps in that regard that may have \nfacilitated the slight increase in milk prices and we thank him for his \nefforts.\n  Unfortunately, the milk price recovery was not sustained and in May, \nthe basic formula price for milk hit a 6-year low of $10.70 per \nhundredweight and remained at roughly that level throughout the summer. \nEven the mailbox milk prices--that is, the milk prices that farmers are \nactually paid including all premiums--were below the cost of production \nfor many milk producing regions of the country this summer. These tight \nmargins have squeezed even the most efficient operators and have placed \na great deal of financial stress on small- to mid-size family dairy \nfarms who are less able to absorb the price shocks.\n\n  While the recently announced basic formula price for August increased \nmilk prices by about $1.00 per hundredweight, few farmers believe this \nis enough for them to continue to pay their bills through the fall and \nmany farmers are skeptical that prices will increase much beyond this \nlevel.\n  Mr. President, it has been a long summer for dairy farmers who have \ncome to Washington today to demand our action and our support. They \nhave brought with them thousands of petitions from farmers, rural \nresidents, and agribusinesses seeking emergency price relief for milk \nproducers. It is in response to those petitions, the hard work that has \ngone into gathering the signatures, and the months of exasperatingly \nlow milk prices that we introduce this resolution today.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support their dairy farmers by \nsupporting this resolution.\n  This resolution simply expresses the sense of the Senate that the \nSecretary of Agriculture should use the substantial administrative \nauthority and discretion the Congress has provided him under the \nAgricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937 to provide temporary \nemergency price relief to dairy farmers throughout the Nation. The \nresolution stipulates that such price relief will be provided in a \nmanner that is equitable to farmers throughout the country. As many of \nmy colleagues know, dairy policy has frequently been embroiled in \nregional battles over pricing. This resolution stipulates that all \nproducers will receive the same price relief regardless of where they \nmilk their cows.\n  Many Senators have already asked the Secretary to implement this type \nof emergency price floor. Earlier this year over 30 Senators from all \nregions of the country contacted the Secretary urging that he provide \nprice relief for economically stressed dairy farmers. And those \nrequests came even before prices hit bottom this summer. I urge those \nSenators to join me in sponsoring this resolution.\n  Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, however, has indicated that he \nneeds more than just letters from Senators to provide this type of \nemergency price relief. Rather, he indicated in a July 9 letter to the \ndistinguished chairman and ranking member of the Senate Agriculture \nCommittee [Mr. Lugar and Mr. Harkin] that he needs Congress to provide \na more formal expression of support for temporary emergency price \nrelief for dairy farmers. This resolution, when agreed to by the \nSenate, will provide the Secretary with the support he needs to provide \nmilk price relief.\n  The resolution, while directing the Secretary to take action, \nprovides him with flexibility in providing price relief. If milk prices \ndo indeed recover this fall, a price floor may be unnecessary and the \nSecretary will be able to take that into account. However, analysts are \nunsure as to what milk prices will ultimately be this fall when they \nnormally reach their peak. High levels of nonfat dry milk stocks may \ncontinue to depress prices through the end of the year.\n\n  Some might ask why dairy farmers should be given this assistance. The \nanswer, Mr. President, is that a temporary emergency price floor is \nnecessary because unlike other commodity producers, dairy farmers were \nsingled out in the Federal Agricultural Improvement and Reform Act by \nhaving their only support mechanism--price supports--phased out. No \nother commodity program was terminated by the 1996 FAIR Act. Dairy \nfarmers were not provided with the ``Freedom to Farm'' payments that \nhave been provided to wheat and feed grain producers each year \nregardless of crop prices. These payments, also known as transition \npayments, were provided to crop producers in order to help them \ntransition to a market without Government intervention. However, no \ntransitional income assistance has been provided for milk producers \neven though their commodity program has been, in effect, eliminated.\n  Similarly, while wheat and feed grain producers, as well as producers \nof many other commodities, have federally subsidized crop insurance \navailable to help them manage their production risk, and in some cases, \ntheir price risk as well, there is no USDA insurance program for milk \nproduction.\n  While producers of other commodities may be able to hedge their price \nand production risk using high volume futures and options markets that \nhave operated in those commodities for decades, dairy farmers have no \nsuch markets to rely on. While futures and options markets exist for \ndairy products, the trading volumes for most of these markets are so \nlow that few farmers are able to use them.\n  For whatever reason, Mr. President, dairy farmers were not provided \nthe tools to weather a transition to a more market oriented \nagricultural sector.\n  Mr. President, I am not a strong advocate of Government intervention \nin dairy markets. I have seen the types of division and inequity that \nFederal involvement in dairy policy and milk\n\n[[Page S9022]]\n\nprices can create in the dairy industry. So, I do not introduce this \nresolution lightly. But if there was ever a time for the Federal \nGovernment to step in to help dairy farmers, it is now. During the \nmonth of August, I traveled throughout Wisconsin conducting the \nlistening sessions which I hold in each county, each year. And in the \n15 years I have represented Wisconsin farmers, I have never seen a \ngreater sense of despair among farmers and other rural residents.\n  Mr. President, there is a sense in the countryside that Washington, \nDC, has turned a blind eye to the low milk prices of 1997. While that \nmight be a misperception, as I know many of my colleagues have worked \nwith me to find solutions to low milk prices, it is understandable that \nfarmers feel this way. Farmers began asking for this type of price \nrelief at the end of 1996 and 9 months later, nothing has come of that \nrequest. That must change.\n  Mr. President, we must act now to provide some very short-term relief \nthat will help economically distressed dairy farmers through this milk \nprice crisis. We can do that by passing the resolution we are \nintroducing today. The long-term solutions to volatile milk prices and \nfarm income are more nebulous and we must work to address them. But \nfirst, we must take some steps to lessen the immediate financial strain \non farm families throughout the Nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important resolution.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleague \nfrom Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, in submitting a sense of the Senate \nresolution calling for the Secretary of Agriculture to immediately \nestablish a temporary emergency minimum milk price that is equitable to \nall producers nationwide, and that provides price relief to \neconomically distressed milk producers. We are joined by Senators Kohl, \nMoynihan, Breaux, and Landrieu.\n  I have been working with my colleagues in the Senate over the past \nyear in order to provide a more equitable price for our Nation's milk \nproducers. Last year, dairy prices set an all-time high, with an \naverage price of $13.38 per hundredweight. The price reached its peak \nin September at $15.37 per hundredweight, but the market experienced \nits largest drop in history during November, falling to $11.61 per \nhundredweight, which represents a 26 percent decline. During this same \nperiod, the cost of the dairy production reached a record high due to a \n30-50 percent increase in grain costs.\n  This record drop in prices has placed a tremendous strain on our \nNation's dairy farmers, who have been forced to sell their milk for a \nprice below the cost of production for much of the past year. In an \nattempt to provide some relief, and to ensure that thousands of small \ndairy producers were not forced out of business entirely, I joined with \n19 of my Senate and House colleagues on November 22, 1996, in writing \nto Agriculture Secretary Glickman, urging him to take action to help \nraise dairy prices. Secretary Glickman responded on January 7, 1997, by \nannouncing several short-term actions to stabilize milk prices. While \nthese actions did have a small positive effect in increasing dairy \nprices, they did not provide adequate relief to our nation's dairy \nfarmers.\n  In order to hear the problems that dairy farmers are facing first \nhand, I ask Secretary Glickman to accompany me to northeastern \nPennsylvania, which he did on February 10. We met a crowd of \napproximately 750 angry farmers who complained about the precipitous \ndrop in the price of milk.\n  During the course of my analysis of the pricing problem, I found that \nthe price of milk depends on a number of factors, one of which is the \nprice of cheese. For every 10 cents the price of cheese is raised, the \nprice of milk would be raised by $1 per hundredweight. I further \nlearned that the price of cheese was determined by the National Cheese \nExchange in Green Bay, WI. According to a report created by the \nUniversity of Wisconsin, there was an issue as to whether the price of \ncheese established by the Green Bay exchange was accurate or not. The \nauthors of the report used a term as tough as manipulation. Whether \nthat is so or not, there was a real question as to whether that price \nwas accurate. Therefore, 3 days after the hearing in northeastern \nPennsylvania, I introduced a sense-of-the-Senate resolution with \nSenators Santorum, Feingold, Kohl, Jeffords, Leahy, Wellstone, Snowe, \nCollins, and Grams. The resolution, which passed by a vote of 83-15, \nstated that the Secretary of Agriculture should consider acting \nimmediately to replace the National Cheese Exchange as a factor to be \nconsidered in setting the basic formula price for dairy.\n  In my discussions with Secretary Glickman, I found he had the power \nto raise the price of milk unilaterally by establishing a different \nprice of cheese. Therefore, on March 10, I wrote to Secretary Glickman \nand urged him to take immediate action to establish a price floor at \n$13.50/cwt on a temporary, emergency, interim basis until he completed \nhis action on delinking the National Cheese Exchange from the basic \nformula price.\n\n  This subject was aired during the course of a special hearing before \nthe appropriations subcommittee on March 13. At that time, Secretary \nGlickman said that the Department of Agriculture had ascertained the \nidentity of 118 people or entities who had cheese transactions that \ncould establish a different price of cheese. He told me that the \nDepartment had written to the 118 and were having problems getting \nresponses. I suggested it might be faster to telephone those people. \nSecretary Glickman provided my staff with the list of people, and we \ntelephoned them and found, after reaching approximately half of them, \nthat the price of cheese was, in fact, $.164 higher than was being \nreported on the Cheese Exchange. On March 19, I again wrote Secretary \nGlickman and informed him of the results of my staff's survey. This \nprice difference translates to a $1.64 per hundredweight addition to \nthe price of milk.\n  On April 17, I introduced two pieces of legislation to revise our \nlaws so that they better reflect current conditions and provide a fair \nmarket for our Nation's dedicated and hard-working farmers. The \nlegislation goes to two points. One is to amend the Agriculture Market \nTransition Act to require the Secretary to use the price of feed grains \nand other cash expenses in the dairy industry as factors that are used \nto determine the basic formula for the price of milk and other milk \nprices regulated by the Secretary. Simply stated, the Government should \nuse what it costs for production to establish the price of milk, so \nthat if farmers are caught with rising prices of feed and other rising \ncosts of production, they can have those rising costs reflected in the \ncost of milk.\n  The second piece of legislation would require the Secretary of \nAgriculture to collect and disseminate statistically reliable \ninformation from milk manufacturing plants on prices received for bulk \ncheese and require the Secretary to report back to Congress within 150 \ndays on the rate of voluntary compliance with the survey. This bill was \nsuccessfully attached to the 1997 supplemental appropriations bill \nwhich was signed into law on June 12, 1997.\n  On Tuesday, May 6, 1997, the Department of Agriculture announced that \nthey were replacing the National Cheese Exchange in Green Bay, WI, with \na survey of cheddar cheese manufacturers in the United States in order \nto determine the price of cheese for use in setting the basic formula \nprice. I am pleased to report that last Friday, the basic formula price \njumped to $12.07, an increase of $1.21 over last month, as a result of \nincreased cheese prices measured by this new cheese survey.\n  While we have made some progress in providing relief to farmers, \nthere is much more that needs to be done. This sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution will ensure that farmers receive the necessary support they \nneed to continue to produce milk. This resolution makes it clear that \nin emergency situations, the Secretary of Agriculture should set a \ntemporary minimum price for dairy that is equitable to all producers \nnationwide and that provides price relief to economically distressed \nmilk producers, I urge my colleagues to join with Senator Feingold and \nme as we work together to revise the current dairy laws so that they \nbetter reflect current conditions and provide a fair market for our \nNation's dedicated and hard-working farmers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/09/senate-section/article/S9020-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S9023]]\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 120--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE ON THE \n           OCCASION OF THE DEATH OF MOTHER TERESA OF CALCUTTA\n\n  Mr. NICKLES (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Lott, Mr. Mack, Mr. \nBrownback, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \nBumpers, Mr. Robb, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Biden, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. \nReid, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Kerrey, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \nMoynihan, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Kerry, Mr. \nLautenberg, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Kyl, Mr. \nMurkowski, Mr. Ashcroft, and Mr. Inhofe) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, as we send our children and \ngrandchildren back to school to begin another academic year, we as a \nnation focus on the vital role of education.\n  Florida is proud of its role in developing and nurturing colleges and \nuniversities of excellence that have educated generations of America's \nleaders. One of those institutions, Florida A University, has been \ncited as ``College of the Year'' by the editors of Time magazine and \nThe Princeton Review.\n  The editors cited the school's outstanding enrollment of National \nAchievement Scholars, its position as the only historically African-\nAmerican college to offer four Ph.D programs, and dramatic enrollment \ngrowth.\n  This well-deserved national recognition is a tribute to the students, \nalumni, and staff of Florida A University. It also reflects the \noutstanding leadership of President Frederick Humphries, who has led \nthe institution with vision and dedication since 1985.\n  When classes began this academic year, enrollment exceeded 10,000 \nstudents, up from 3,200 in the mid-eighties. Florida A University \nenrolled its largest freshman class ever this fall.\n  Further, the number of bachelors' degrees awarded since 1991 has more \nthan tripled, from 463 in 1991 to 1,524 last year, surpassing Howard \nUniversity as America's leading granter of undergraduate degrees to \nAfrican-American college graduates.\n  During this decade, Florida A University, along with Harvard, has \nbeen a leader in attracting National Achievement Scholars. Florida A \nUniversity led the Nation in 1992 and 1995; Harvard in 1993 and 1994.\n  While all this was occurring--enrollment growth, more degrees awarded \nand more scholars enrolled--overall admission standards increased. In \nthe past 10 years, Scholastic Aptitude Test scores of Florida A \nUniversity-bound students rose more than 200 points.\n  Mr. President, I have been honored to visit Florida A University on \nmany occasions. I have experienced the special spirit on campus, in the \nclassrooms, and among the greater Florida A University family of \nalumni, faculty, administrators, and students.\n  Our State and Nation are better because of Florida A University and \nits commitment to educational excellence. Congratulations, Rattlers.\n  Mr. President, I ask that an editorial published in the Tallahassee \nDemocrat newspaper on August 26, 1997, be printed in the Record.\n  The editorial follows:\n\n            Why FAMU's Top Achievements Rate National Press\n\n       Vestiges of a past when men and women were judged by the \n     color of their skin are still with us. And one of those \n     monuments of intolerance ranks as one of Tallahassee's \n     brighter stars, Florida A University.\n       In an age where segregation is illegal, the natural \n     question is, Why have two universities: one white, one black?\n       But the reason for FAMU's existence is as strong today as \n     it was when black people were driven from pillar to post and \n     denied higher education. Time Magazine and the Princeton \n     Review lauded FAMU as the premier producer of black graduates \n     and for its work in establishing doctorate programs.\n\n\n                  he recruited students, lined up jobs\n\n       Consider what wonders FAMU has performed with students in \n     need of opportunity. Since 1991, the school tripled the size \n     of its graduating classes. President Frederick Humphries' \n     peripatetic efforts landed those graduates hundreds of jobs \n     with major corporations, thus pumping into our mainstream new \n     generations of black achievers able to earn their own way.\n       His development of new doctoral programs opened new avenues \n     of academic success, and his linkages with the federal \n     government brought dollars and prestige to FAMU and to \n     Tallahassee.\n       We're still moving toward that day when we'll all be judged \n     by the content of our character, not solely by the color of \n     our skin. But until we get there, institutions such as FAMU \n     are an integral and necessary part of the journey.\n       In an age of voluntary segregation--when the rich and well-\n     to-do take their tax dollars, culture and opportunities \n     beyond the pale of our cities--hundreds of thousands of \n     blacks and poor whites are left to founder in the race for \n     jobs and college placement.\n       For those students, the nurturing influence of institutions \n     such as FAMU cannot be denied.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/09/senate-section/article/S9026-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO HONOR PETER WOLF TOTH\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \nhonor Peter Wolf Toth who has completed a project to present each State \nwith a handmade wooden totem pole that incorporates local and \nhistorical figures from all across the Nation. I commend his \noutstanding gift to our Nation.\n  Peter came to the United States through extraordinary circumstances. \nHe escaped with his mother from the Soviet takeover in Russian-occupied \nHungary. Traveling through Budapest, Yugoslavia, and Austria, Peter \neventually settled in Akron, OH. His interests led him to educate \nhimself in American history, specifically with a focus on native \nAmerican lore, tribal cultures, and contributions to our lifestyle \ntoday.\n  Peter recently completed a project where he carved out enormous totem \npoles by hand and presented one to each of the fifty States to show his \ngratitude to our country.\n  His totem pole to New Hampshire was presented in 1984 and it stands \nin Opechee Park in Laconia, NH. The dedication ceremony that September \ndrew a crowd of over 3,000 people.\n  Peter's immigration into this country, as well as his hard work, \nshould stand as an example for all Americans. It is no doubt that he is \nworthy of great recognition and praise for his devotion to the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, I want to pay great homage to Peter Wolf Toth for his \noutstanding commitment to the United States. We are indebted to his \namazing gifts and talents that he chose to share with all of \nus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/09/senate-section/article/S9026-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9026-S9027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JUDGE ALAN GOLD\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am honored to welcome Judge Alan \nGold to the Federal bench in the Southern District of Florida. For more \nthan 25 years, Alan Gold has served the State of Florida with honor and \ndistinction. I have no doubt that his outstanding service will continue \nin his new assignment. On September 15, Judge Gold will be sworn in, \nalong with Mr. Donald Middlebrooks, in ceremonies in Miami, FL.\n  Much of my confidence in Judge Alan Gold comes from his lifelong \ncommitment to the people of our State. He began his career more than 25 \nyears ago, when he represented Dade County in both State and Federal \ncourts.\n  In 1975, Alan Gold moved into private practice, where he developed \nwide recognition and respect as a leader in land use and environmental \nlaw.\n  In 1984, when I was Governor, I appointed Judge Gold to Florida's \nLand Management Study Committee, a vital post given our State's long \nperiod of rapid population growth. In addition, Judge Gold served \nFlorida for 6 years as general counsel to the Florida High Speed Rail \nTransportation Commission, an entity created by the State legislature \nin 1984 to develop a high-speed rail transportation and magnetic \nlevitation demonstration project.\n  Mr. President, in addition to his substantial professional \nexperience, Judge Gold will bring respected academic credentials to the \nFederal bench. In 1989, nearly 25 years after completing a masters in \nlaw at the University of Miami School of Law, Judge Gold was invited to \njoin his alma mater's faculty as an adjunct professor. It was a wise \ninvitation to an outstanding role model for future generations of legal \nprofessionals.\n  As a result of his distinguished efforts in the public interest and \nin private practice, Alan Gold was appointed\n\n[[Page S9027]]\n\nto Florida's Eleventh Judicial Circuit Court, where he has served with \nintegrity and competence. His peers and colleagues have overwhelmingly \nendorsed his abilities. In a 1994 survey of regional attorneys by the \nDade County Bar, 92.8 percent of respondents rated Judge Gold's \nperformance as qualified or exceptionally qualified.\n  As a circuit court judge, Alan Gold served both in the family and \ncriminal divisions, where he presided over felony jury cases. Despite \nthe demands of a heavy caseload, Judge Gold continued his efforts to \nimprove the legal system for Florida communities, families, and \nindividuals. He was appointed to the Florida Supreme Court's Family \nCourt Steering Committee and has recently chaired an effort to develop \na model family court.\n  During the confirmation process, Judge Gold's support transcended \npartisanship. In addition to the support from Senator Connie Mack and \nmyself, he earned strong endorsements from U.S. Representatives Lincoln \nDiaz-Balart of Miami and E. Clay Shaw of Fort Lauderdale.\n  Mr. President, Judge Alan Gold has long provided an example of \nacademic diligence, legal acumen, judicial excellence, and \ndetermination to serve Floridians. I am pleased that he will join the \nFederal bench, and extend my congratulations to him, his family, and \nthe Senate for its prompt review and confirmation of this worthy \nnominee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/09/senate-section/article/S9026-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MICHIGAN STATE CONFERENCE OF THE NAACP\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

This event will be held in \nSaginaw, MI, on September 12, 1997.\n  As race relations continue to be at the forefront of American life, \nthis convention provides an opportunity for delegates to openly discuss \nissues which confront not only their communities, but everyday lives. \nThe NAACP convention will focus on finding programmatic solutions to \nsuch issues as, education, violence, crime, homelessness, and drug \nabuse. It is through open dialog and the exchange of information that \nconcrete solutions to these issues will be found.

Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the May 27, 1997 \n31st anniversary of the independence of the Republic of Guyana. The \nword ``Guyana'' is an indigenous word that means land of many waters. \nBut Guyana is also a land of many peoples, with East Indians, Africans, \nChinese, Amer-Indians, and Europeans counted among its ancestors. \nGuyana is also a country that embraces freedom of religion, which \nallows Christians, Muslims, and Hindus to worship side by side.\n  My colleagues may be aware that Guyana achieved independence and \nobserved its first free and fair election in 1992, after more than \nthree centuries of British, French, and Dutch colonialism. Guyana's \nfirst constitution bore the influence of British legal traditions, and \nformer President Jimmy Carter supervised the team of international \nobservers to guarantee the fairness of the 1992 elections.\n  Guyana's three decades of unpopular and repressive rule slowed \neconomic progress, but Guyanese are working to overcome these hurdles. \nI hope that they will succeed.\n  Guyanese-Americans have much to be proud of. Their history is rich, \nand I hope the future of Guyana will be bright. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/09/senate-section/article/S9027-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO THE SHELBURNE MUSEUM\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nVermont's Shelburne Museum on the occasion of its 50th anniversary. The \nmuseum, sometimes referred to as New England's Smithsonian, will \ncelebrate its anniversary on September 27, 1997 with a myriad of \nactivities for people young and old.\n  The museum's founder, Electra Havemeyer Webb, was a pioneer collector \nof Americana and American folk art. Today, the museum collects, \npreserves, and studies art as well as history with an emphasis on the \nNew England area. Thirty-seven exhibit buildings spanning across 45 \nscenic acres include three galleries, 7 furnished historic homes and \nover 80,000 objects. The historic buildings and collections reflect our \ntransition from an agricultural to an industrial nation.\n  The Shelburne Museum has become an important cultural resource for \nVermont and the Nation. In a rapidly changing world its collections as \nwell as its programs provide the public and scholars alike with an \nopportunity to reflect on and explore the central themes of ingenuity, \ncraftsmanship and creativity.\n  The museum embodies a spirit of celebration which provides visitors \nfrom across the country and around the world with a unique perspective \ninto the region's history. As a learning tool, it plays a significant \nrole in reminding patrons that the past can often provide a key to the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, I wish the Shelburne Museum many more years of \ncontinued success in service to our community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/09/senate-section/article/S9027-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9027-S9028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        A MORE COMPLETE PICTURE\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, on September 3, during floor \ndeliberations the senior Senator from Washington presented a story of a \nmost tragic situation on the Yakama Indian Reservation in his call for \nsupport of an appropriations rider that would require tribal \ngovernments to relinquish their right to sovereign immunity in order to \nreceive Federal funding.\n  In 1994, a tragic accident involving a tribal police officer en route \nto the scene of an ensuing robbery resulted in the death of 18-year-old \nJered Gamache. Before I proceed, I want to express my deepest \nsympathies to the Gamache family for this devastating loss. As a mother \nof two, I find it almost unbearable to contemplate such a loss. It is \nalways painful to lose a loved one, but the loss of a child is \nsomething no parent should have to face.\n  The issues involved here are very controversial and everyone involved \nhas strong views. In the interest of airing views from all sides \nregarding section 120 of the Interior appropriations bill, I have \nagreed to submit a statement on behalf of the Yakama Indian Nation in \nresponse to the chairman's comments. I ask that the statement from the \nYakama Indian Nation be printed in the Record.\n  The statement follows:\n\n Yakama Indian Nation Astonished by Gorton Floor Statement Wherein He \n Made Analogy of Tribal Police Officer Acting Within Her Scope of Duty \n          and New York Cops Who Brutalized a Haitian Immigrant\n\n       Toppenish, Washington.--The Yakama Indian Nation today \n     responded with both amazement and sadness to statements made \n     Wednesday on the Senate floor by Senator Slade Gorton (R-\n     Wash.), wherein the Senator made an analogy of a 1994 \n     accidental vehicular death involving a Tribal police officer \n     responding to an emergency call (regarding an urgent armed \n     robbery in progress), to the intentional brutal beating and \n     sodomization recently inflicted by New York City policemen \n     against Haitian immigrant Abner Louima.\n       In what appears to be an attempt to justify a far-reaching \n     amendment he has inserted into an appropriations bill that \n     would eradicate tribal sovereign immunity, the senior Senator \n     from Washington has chosen to exploit the victimization of \n     Abner Louima and a tragic car accident that occurred on our \n     reservation.\n       The facts of the case cited by Gorton should be brought to \n     light as should the point that a close associate of the \n     Senator, Yakima County Prosecutor, Jeff Sullivan, declined to \n     pursue a criminal prosecution (for ``disregarding the safety \n     of others'') against the tribal police officer involved in \n     the accident.\n       On October 25, 1994, Tiffany Martin, a fully trained police \n     officer of the Yakama Indian Nation responded to an emergency \n     call for assistance from the Yakama County Sheriff's office. \n     There was a burglary in progress at a convenience store and \n     the closer police force in the city of Wapato had not \n     responded. Officer Martin proceeded in her police vehicle \n     northbound on Route 97 with both sirens and overhead flashers \n     on. During her response a second call came in indicating that \n     gun shots had been fired and the situation was clearly quite \n     urgent. As the officer approached a particular intersection, \n     where she initially had a green light, she slowed her vehicle \n     down (she estimates to between\n\n[[Page S9028]]\n\n     30 and 35 miles per hour), noticing a van stopped at the \n     intersection with its turn, signal on. Apparently next to the \n     van and hidden from the officer's line of sight was another \n     vehicle. Confirming that the stopped vehicle was aware of her \n     presence, she accelerated and went through the intersection \n     as the light turned yellow and then red. The van remained \n     stopped but the vehicle next it, being driven by 18 year old \n     Jered Gamache went forward and his vehicle and the police \n     care collided. Gamache died as a result of injuries suffered \n     in the collision. The tribal police force has expressed great \n     remorse to the Gamache family and the officer herself has \n     suffered tremendously and emotionally as a result of the \n     accident.\n       While we have the greatest sympathy for the family of Jered \n     Gamache and can understand their pain we can not understand \n     how a member of the United States Senate could suggest that \n     this accident is somehow analogous to the celebrated Louima \n     beating in New York. Senator Gorton has stated that since Mr. \n     Louima is going to be suing New York City for millions of \n     dollars so too should the Gamache family be able to sue the \n     Yakama Nation for a similar amount. With all due respect, \n     this is not an analogy worthy of a former state Attorney \n     General. The New York policemen who beat Louima broke the \n     law. Our tribal police officer was acting within her scope of \n     duty and following routine procedures. While it is tragic, \n     there are unfortunately a large number of innocent bystanders \n     all across this country who are accidentally hurt or killed \n     by law enforcement officers discharging their duties. The \n     fact remains that police officers and the governments they \n     work for are protected by a sovereign immunity provided they \n     have acted within the line of duty in a non-negligent manner. \n     Would the Senator characterize, as he did on the floor, that \n     a claim against, say, a King County, Washington policeman \n     involved in an accidental vehicular death as ``identical or \n     similar'' to the claim Mr. Louima will be pursuing against \n     New York?\n       Contrary to the Senator's assertions, the Gamache family \n     has not been denied legal recourse due to tribal sovereign \n     immunity. In fact, the Gamache family has a filed civil suit \n     which is currently pending in the Eastern District Federal \n     Court of Washington state, trial is set for December 8, 1997. \n     The Gamache family is pursuing this claim under the Federal \n     Tort Claims Act (28 USC 2671), which is the same statute \n     under which they would pursue a claim if any other federal \n     law enforcement official (FBI, National Park Service ranger, \n     etc.) has been involved in their son's death. The Federal \n     Tort Claims Act (FTCA) is the statute involved as the Yakama \n     Nation was operating its tribal police department under a \n     contract with the Interior Department pursuant to the Indian \n     Self-Determination Act and the tribal police officer was \n     acting as a federal agent. United States District Judge Fred \n     Van Sickle will determine whether the officer involved showed \n     contributory negligence which led to the accident and will \n     further determine whether she was properly acting within the \n     scope of her duty. The standards for these terms under FTCA \n     are the standards as they exist within Washington state law. \n     Not only are the Gamache's being given legal recourse, but it \n     is taking place in the ``neutral'' federal court which the \n     Senator wants to direct all cases coming from Indian \n     reservations.\n       Perhaps this is a good example of the dangers of making law \n     based on anecdotal situations, particularly when the facts \n     have not been properly brought to light.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/09/senate-section/article/S9027-4", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRESSMAN GEORGE CROCKETT, JR.\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about media \ncoverage in Bosnia and the importance of a fair, free, and independent \nmedia to the safety of United States and allied forces, the \nimplementation of the Dayton peace accords, and peace for the Bosnian \npeople.\n  Recent events in the Serb area of Bosnia have served to highlight the \ndisruptive role that the media, particularly television, can play as we \nhave witnessed what Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, \ncharacterized as ``organized disorder.''\n  It was the potential for television-incited violence that led me to \npropose in my floor speech of July 30 the deployment of the EC-130E \nCommando Solo aircraft to jam Bosnian Serb television and to broadcast \ntelevision and radio programming directly to the Bosnian people. I also \nmade that proposal in writing to National Security Adviser Sandy Berger \nand Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen. I understand that the deployment \nof Commando Solo is under serious consideration at the Pentagon at the \npresent time.\n  In making my proposal, I specifically cited a provision of the \nAgreement on the Military Aspects of the Dayton Peace Agreement that \ngives NATO's Stabilization Force Commander the authority to do all that \nhe deems necessary and proper to protect the SFOR and to carry out its \nresponsibilities.\n  I should note at this point that the High Representative, Mr. Carlos \nWestendorp, a position that was created by the Dayton peace accords to \noversee the implementation of the civilian aspects of the accords, has \nbeen invested with similar authority. The Peace Implementation Council, \nin its May 30, 1997 Sintra Declaration, declared as follows:\n\n       The authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Entities and \n     the common institutions will be expected to give every \n     possible form of practical assistance with respect to \n     licenses, frequencies, free access by the High Representative \n     to news media and the ability of the OBN (Open Broadcast \n     Network) and other independent media to broadcast.\n       The Steering Board is concerned that the media has not done \n     enough to promote freedom of expression and reconciliation. \n     It declared that the High Representative has the right to \n     curtail or suspend any media network or programme whose \n     output is in persistent and blatent contravention of either \n     the spirit or letter of the Peace Agreement.\n\n  So there is ample authority in both the senior military and civilian \nauthorities representing the international community in Bosnia to take \naction to address the misuse of Bosnian Serb television and other media \noutlets.\n  I was pleased to note that the North Atlantic Council, on August 30, \nacting pursuant to a request from the High Representative authorized \nSFOR ``to provide the necessary support to suspend or curtail any media \nnetwork or programme in Bosnia and Herzegovina whose output is in \npersistent and blatant contradiction of either the spirit or letter of \nthe Peace Agreement, in accordance with the Sintra Declaration.''\n  The North Atlantic Council further reaffirmed that ``SFOR will not \nhesitate to take the necessary measures including the use of force \nagainst media inciting attacks on SFOR or other international \norganizations.'' I ask unanimous consent that a North Atlantic Council \npress release that contains these decisions be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  Mr. President, there have been a number of media reports and \ncommentaries concerning the agreement that was reached on September 2 \nconcerning the release of the Udrigovo television tower northeast of \nTuzla. Several commentaries have criticized the agreement, under which \nthe tower was returned to Pale's control, as being a capitulation to \nKaradzic. I believe this is a misreading of the situation.\n\n  Under the agreement, SFOR turned over the Udrigovo tower in return \nfor four commitments from Pale. Those commitments are as follows:\n  First, all media will refrain from making inflammatory reporting \nagainst SFOR and international organizations supporting the execution \nof the Dayton accord. This includes television, radio, and the print \nmedia.\n  Second, television will regularly provide 1 hour of programming \nduring prime time each day without exception, during which our \npolitical views will be aired.\n  Third, television will provide Ambassador Westendorp, the new High \nRepresentative, one-half-hour programming during prime time in the next \nfew\n\n[[Page S9029]]\n\ndays to introduce himself and explain the events which took place in \nBrcko, Bijelina, and Banja Luka. Such time will be unedited and not \ncommented on in advance or after airing by TV commentators.\n  Fourth, Republika Srpska will participate in a full and consistent \nmanner in a Media Support Advisory Group conducted by the Office of the \nHigh Representative to discuss and regulate the work of the media in \naccordance with the spirit and the letter of the General Framework \nAgreement for Peace, the formal name of the Dayton accord.\n  I ask that a copy of the Memorandum of Agreement that contains these \nconditions be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  If fulfilled, these commitments should reduce the threat to United \nStates, allied forces, and the personnel of the various international \norganizations in Bosnia. They will also ensure that the views of \nKaradjic's opponents will be heard, which is very important, \nparticularly in the run-up to the municipal elections.\n   Mr. President, I am skeptical that Karadjic and his henchmen will \nlive up to the terms of this agreement. It is most important to note, \nhowever, that Pale has for the first time formally acknowledged its \nmedia obligations and cannot complain if NATO uses force if it doesn't \nmeet them. The ball is in Pale's court and I, for one, will strongly \nsupport decisive action by NATO, such as the use of Commando Solo, if \nPale continues to misuse the media.\n  The material follows:\n\n        Statement by the North Atlantic Council, 30 August 1997\n\n       The North Atlantic Council met today to continue its \n     consideration of the developing situation in the Republic \n     Srpska. It reaffirmed yesterday's statement by the Secretary \n     General condemning recent violence and confirming that SFOR \n     will continue to carry out its mission firmly but fairly and \n     will not tolerate the use of force or intimidation.\n       Council responded positively to a request by the High \n     Representative to authorize SFOR to provide the necessary \n     support to suspend or curtail any media network or programme \n     in Bosnia and Herzegovina whose output is in persistent and \n     blatant contradiction of either the spirit or the letter of \n     the Peace Agreement, in accordance with the Sintra \n     Declaration.\n       In addition, Council reaffirmed that SFOR will not hesitate \n     to take the necessary measures including the use of force \n     against media inciting attacks on SFOR or other international \n     organizations.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           Department of the Army,\n\n\n                           Headquarters 1st Infantry Division,\n\n                              Bosnia Herzegovina, 02 September 97.\n\n    memorandum of Agreement for Release of Udrigovo Tower (CQ334489)\n\n       As per coordination between Ambassador Klein and Mr. \n     Krajisnik, the turn over of the tower will occur with \n     agreement of the following points:\n       1. RS media, TV, radio, print media, refrain from making \n     inflammatory reporting against SFOR and international \n     organizations supporting the execution of the Dayton Accord.\n       2. RS TV will regularly provide one hour of programming \n     during prime time each day without exception, during which \n     other political views will be aired.\n       3. RS TV will provide Ambassador Westendorp \\1/2\\ hour \n     during prime time in the next few days to introduce himself \n     and explain the events which took place in Breko, Bijelina \n     and Banja Luka. Such time will be unedited and not commented \n     on in advance or after airing by RS TV commentators.\n       4. RS agrees to participate in a full and consistent manner \n     in a Media Support Advisory Group conducted by OHR to discuss \n     and regulate the work of the media in accordance with the \n     spirit and the letter of the GFAP.\n       The signing of this document by the signatures below will \n     release SFOR from the Udrigovo tower as soon as they can \n     safely depart the morning of 2 September. The crowds at the \n     tower will depart tonight, and 10 RS police and technicians \n     may remain.\n     David Grange.\n     Drago Vukovic.\n     Gen.

(BOB) HOPE\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 153, H.J. Res. \n75.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 75) to confer status as an \n     honorary veteran of the United States Armed Forces on Leslie \n     Townes (Bob) Hope.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the joint resolution.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is my privilege today to ask that the \nSenate approve legislation to confer the status of honorary veteran of \nthe U.S. Armed Forces to Leslie Townes (Bob) Hope. This resolution, \nHouse Joint Resolution 75, which was unanimously approved by the Senate \nCommittee on Veterans Affairs on June 12, 1997, is identical to a \ncompanion resolution, Senate Joint Resolution 36, which I, as chairman \nof the Committee on Veterans Affairs, was honored to introduce on July \n28, 1997. I am pleased to say that the ranking member of the committee, \nSenator John D. Rockefeller IV, and 47 other Members of the Senate \njoined me as cosponsors of this resolution when I introduced it.\n  Mr. President, the Members of this body, and the American people as a \nwhole, are acutely aware of the contributions Bob Hope has made to the \nNation. His service to country--and; most particularly, to its \nsoldiers, sailor, marines, and airmen over a period exceeding 50 \nyears--are legion. If any person in this country merits such an \nunprecedented honor--and Mr. President, it is my understanding that no \nperson has ever before been conferred the status of honorary veteran of \nthe U.S. Armed Forces--surely, it is Bob Hope.\n  As I have stated, Bob Hope's contributions to this Nation are well \nknown to all of our citizens. Less well known is the fact that Bob Hope \nis a naturalized American, having emigrated from his native England \nwhen he was just a boy. I am the son of a naturalized American--an \nimmigrant who walked across Europe with barely a ruble in his pocket so \nthat he could make his way to this country. So I know first hand that \nperson of humble origins can scale the heights of this country. Few, \nthough, have scaled the heights that Bob Hope has scaled.\n  When I say Bob Hope has scaled the heights, I am not referring to his \nsuccess as an actor, a comedian, or businessman--though his success in \nall three areas has been considerable. When I say Bob Hope as scaled \nheights, I am thinking of his place in the hearts of his adopted \ncountrymen.\n  Who in this country is more beloved by a broader spectrum of his \nfellow citizens than Bob Hope--people of all ages, races, religions, \nand beliefs? Perhaps none more than Bob Hope. For the past 50 years, \nthis country's fighting men and women could count on Bob Hope to lift \ntheir spirits and moral when they faced the prospect of making the \nultimate sacrifice. In World War II, in Korea, in Vietnam and, most \nrecently, in the Persian Gulf, Bob Hope and his troupe were there to \nremind our fighting men and women that they were not forgotten, that \ntheir suffering was appreciated. Bob Hope was always with the troops--\nespecially during the holidays--enduring hardship, and often \nsignificant physical danger, so that he might encourage those facing \ngreater hardship and danger. Three generations of veterans will never \nforget how much he cared.\n  Those three generations of veterans wonder how they might properly \nrecognize Bob Hope. He is already a recipient of the Nation's highest \ncivilian decorations, the Congressional Gold Medal and the Presidential \nMedal of Freedom. President Carter hosted a White House reception in \nhonor of his 75th Birthday. President Clinton bestowed upon him the \nMedal of the Arts. He has received more than 50 honorary doctorates, \nand innumerable awards from civic, social, and veterans organizations. \nBut Bob Hope cannot say that he is a veteran--in my mind, one of the \nmost honorable appellations one can carry. This legislation will remedy \nthat.\n  I ask that all of my colleagues join me in approving legislation \ndesignating Bob Hope an honorary veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces. And \nI thank the former Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps and the current \npresident of the USO, Gen. Carl Mundy, for spearheading this effort.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the joint \nresolution be considered read a third time and passed, the preamble be \nagreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that \nany statements relating to the resolution appear at this point in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The joint resolution (H.J. Res. 75) was considered read the third \ntime and passed.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/09/senate-section/article/S9030-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 1997\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

I further ask that on \nWednesday, immediately following the prayer, the routine requests \nthrough the morning hour be granted and the Senate immediately resume \nconsideration of the second-degree amendment of the Senator from \nAlabama, Senator Sessions, No. 1125, to the amendment of Senator \nDurbin, No. 1078, to S. 1061, the Labor-HHS appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Time \nagreements were able to be reached on a couple of the pending \namendments.\n  With that in mind, all Members' cooperation will be appreciated in \nscheduling time agreements and floor actions on the remaining \namendments. Therefore, Members can anticipate rollcall votes throughout \nthe Wednesday session of the Senate, as we attempt to complete action \non this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/09/senate-section/article/S9030-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
