Mr. President, today there will be a period for the \ntransaction of morning business until 1 p.m. Following morning \nbusiness, the Senate will consider the Labor-HHS appropriations \nconference report. The leader anticipates 90 minutes of debate and a \nrollcall vote on the adoption of the conference report. Therefore, the \nfirst vote today will occur at approximately 2:30 p.m.\n  Following that vote, the Senate may be asked to consider an \nappropriations matter to be offered by the chairman and ranking member \nshortly after the vote at 2:30. Therefore, additional votes can be \nexpected during Saturday's session of the Senate.\n  Since these are hopefully the last few days of the session for the \n1st session of the 105th Congress, many items are in the process of \nbeing cleared for consideration by the Senate. Some of those items \ninclude the FDA reform conference report, the adoption/foster care \nlegislation and Executive Calendar nominations. Therefore, the \ncooperation of all Senators would certainly be appreciated.\n  Mr. President, let me say briefly that the adoption/foster care \nlegislation, I understand, is now nearly cleared. It is an effort that \nI, along with Senator Chafee and Senator Rockefeller --and a good many \nothers--Senator Coats, Senator DeWine have worked\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   N O T I C E\n \n    Under the Rules for Publication of the Congressional Record, a final issue of the Congressional Record for\n the first session of the 105th Congress will be published on (the 31st day after adjournment), in order to\n permit Members to revise and extend their remarks.\n    All material for insertion must be signed by the Member and delivered to the respective offices of the\n Official Reporters of Debates (Room HT-60 or ST-41 of the Capitol), no later than 10 days following\n adjournment.

Mr. President, I want to take the time that we have \navailable this morning while we are waiting for these important closing \nactivities--I hope closing activities--to talk a little bit about an \nissue that I feel very strongly about and that I think most people do, \nand that is our national parks and our national parks plan.\n  I am chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks, and we have \nspent almost this entire year working on a program to help strengthen \nthe parks. Certainly, the National Park System is truly one of our \ntreasures.\n  The Park System is the custodian of some of America's most important \nnatural and cultural resources and provides, of course, a legacy for \nour children and our grandchildren.\n  The Park System today consists of about 374 units which are visited \nannually by millions of people. They stretch all the way from Acadia in \nMaine to American Samoa in the Pacific islands and provide a unique \nopportunity.\n  I, of course, am particularly selfishly interested in parks because I \ncome from Wyoming. We have the first national park which recently \ncelebrated its 125th anniversary--Yellowstone. We also of course have \nTeton Park. But the whole country has a park system that we are \nextremely proud of.\n  Unfortunately, that System is and has been under considerable stress. \nAt the time that we have showed unusual interest in it as Americans, \nand have increased our visitations, the park has had increasing \ndifficulties. We are believed to have somewhere near $8 billion in \nunfunded and unrealized infrastructure repairs of various kinds. That \nis a great deal of money.\n  We also have had some stress in terms of management in many of those \nthings. So we worked this year and intend, as a matter of fact, to have \nsome field hearings in November; particularly we have one set for \nDenver and one for San Francisco, and we hope then to have one later in \nFlorida near the Everglades, to try and bring in as much information as \nwe can get on the issues and how they affect people.\n  The issues are broken down, as you might imagine, into several \ncategories. One of them is finance. That is one of the basic ones, of \ncourse. As I mentioned, we have an overwhelming amount of unfunded \nprograms: $2.2 billion in road and bridge repair; $1.5 billion in \nbuildings and maintenance; $800 million in natural resource management \nkinds of things. They are the kinds of things that are very difficult \nto manage in an annual budget.\n  So we are looking for some ways to do this a little bit differently. \nWe are looking at a number of things. One would be to extend the \ntemporary program for fees, where fees have been raised in a number of \nthe parks, about 100 I think out of the 375 parks. They have been very \nlow. And it has been $10 a car at Yellowstone for a whole carload of \npeople for a week. I think it has now gone to $20. And, frankly, we \nfound very little resistance to that, particularly if people believe \nthe money they are spending going to that park will be used to make \nthat park a better place to visit.\n  In addition to fees, of course, it will be our responsibility, Mr. \nPresident, as Members of Congress, to keep the appropriations growing \nsome for that. We had an increase in appropriations this year. We need \nto continue to do that.\n  In addition to entrance fees, we are looking at ways for people to \ncontribute, private individuals to contribute to parks. Many want to do \nthat. There are park foundations in individual parks. We need to find \nsome ways for Americans who chose to, to be able to contribute more to \nthe maintenance of parks.\n  We are also looking at a way for corporate investment as well, \nwithout commercializing parks. We do not want ``Pepsi-Cola'' painted up \non the wall of Yosemite. But there isn't any reason why there cannot be \ncorporate donations made. For example, one of the corporations made a \ndonation to build the walkway around Old Faithful. It is a wonderful \naddition. And there is a very small and unobtrusive sign there that \nindicates the sponsors of that. I think that is a good idea. I think we \ncan continue to do that.\n  One of the things we are looking at is a way for bonding. \nInterestingly enough, the larger parks, like Yosemite, like Yellowstone \nare basically small cities. They have to have sewers, they have to have \nstreets, they have to have housing, the kinds of things that take long-\nterm investment. And it is very difficult to do it, as I mentioned a \nmoment ago, out of annual appropriations.\n  So we are trying to find a way that the park could do some bonding in \nthe private sector. I do not know whether these can be Government \nbonds, I do not know whether they can be tax-free bonds or taxable \nbonds. But in order to do that, we have a couple of problems I hope we \ncan overcome.\n  One is the scoring system here in the budget of the United States. As \nyou know, we do not have a capital budget. And so if you issue 300 \nmillion dollars' worth of bonds, that would all go into the annual \nbudget. That is a difficult thing. We will have to try and overcome \nthat. We hope that there are some ways to do it.\n  The other thing, of course, that is necessary to do bonding is to \nhave a dependable and steady stream of revenue to pay off the bonds. We \nthink we can do that. So those are a couple of the ways that we are \nseeking to do some things that would be good for parks.\n  In addition, many of the larger parks, as you know, the services--let \nme go back and say, I think most people would agree that the main \npurpose of a park is to maintain the resources, whether it be cultural \nor whether it be natural resources.\n  But the second and equally important part of it is to have a pleasant \nvisit for Americans, who own those parks. To do that, by and large, we \nhave had concessions that have been run by the private sector. I \ncertainly support that idea. I think that is the way to do it. We have, \nunfortunately, kind of gotten out of sync in terms of doing the sort of \ncontracting that is necessary.\n  We went through a while, a big debate a couple years ago as to \nwhether the Government ought to own the facilities. I think we have \novercome that and decided that is not what we want to do. So we need to \ngo back to longer term contracts for some very large facilities.\n\n[[Page S12075]]\n\n  I think there is about $700 million in gross revenue that comes from \nconcessions in the whole Park System, which is a very sizable amount.\n  On the other hand, parks are not all big-profit operations because \nGlacier Park, for example, in Montana is only opened a portion of the \nyear. And the season is rather shortened. So we have to deal with \nquestions like: How long should the contract be for sizable \ninvestments? Should there be the right of renewal? Should there be some \nsort of proprietary ownership in these facilities at the time the \ncontract exchange comes? So we are working with those things. I am \npositive that we can find some solutions.\n  I also want you to know that one of, I think, the key issues we are \ntalking about with concessions--I mentioned to you this is a large \ncommercial business. It is a commercial business. We think we ought to \ntake a look at the idea of contracting with an asset manager out of the \nprivate sector who is a professional at managing hospitality things to \ndo this. That is not really the role of a park ranger in terms of \ntraining and background.\n  As you know, Mr. President, I have been working as hard as I can to \nsee if we can't move these commercial functions of the Government over \ninto the private sector, at least give them an opportunity to bid on \nit. So that is one of the things that we are seeking to do.\n  I do not think that we are going to solve the financial problem out \nof the concessions by any means. But we ought to be able to do two \nthings. We ought to be able to have good facilities that are kept up; \nand we ought to be able to have a small stream of revenue come to the \nparks. We think that might be one of the possibilities for doing \nsomething with the bonding revenue.\n  We are looking at improved management. The Park Service, after all, \nis a large agency, I think, with some of the most dedicated employees \nof any agency in the country. The people you talk to that work for the \nPark Service are really, really dedicated to doing what they do. They \nlike to preserve the parks. They like to work in the parks. But they \ndid not always have the opportunity, for instance, to be trained.\n  We are going to look at some university exchanges where folks could \nget some additional training and help them do their jobs. But I think \nmore than anything it has become a large agency, and what we need is a \nstrategic plan.\n  Any business of that size, any operation of that size needs a \nstrategic plan that has some forward ideas as to how to solve problems. \nFrankly, that is kind of why we are where we are. There has not been \nany plans presented to the Congress. And the Congress has not taken the \ninitiative to prepare plans to accommodate these problems that we now \nhave, and problems of increased visitation. The highways, for example, \nin Yelowstone Park are way behind in preparation and care. So we need a \nstrategic plan in the agency.\n  Probably at least as important then is each park, and each park \nmanager, needs to have a strategic plan that contributes to the overall \nplan and one with measurable objectives and measurable goals so that \nyou do not just have a plan that everybody thinks is wonderful but you \nhave one that at the end of the year you can take a look at the plan \nand say you accomplished what you were going to or you did not. If you \ndid not, there ought to be a reason why you did not. So we think we can \ndo some good there.\n  Let me tell you that we are working very closely with the Park \nService. And a new park director is now in place, Bob Stanton. His \nbackground as a career park official has been that he was the head of \nthe parks here in this area. It was the first time, by the way, that \nthe park director has been approved by the Senate. That was just \nchanged so it is an appointment that has to be approved. So we are \nworking with him. The Secretary of the Interior has talked favorably \nabout some of the changes that need to be made.\n  Finally, one of the things we are doing is trying to take a look at \nthe criteria for new parks. I think it is fairly well defined in terms \nof setting aside things that are important either historically or \nculturally or from a natural resource standpoint.\n  But, unfortunately--I think unfortunately--we have continued to add \nmore parks that do not necessarily fit that criteria. They are often \nrecommended by Members of Congress who have an equivalent of a State or \na county park in their area that they would like to have the Federal \nGovernment pay for. So they move it into the Park Service when it could \njust as well be a State park. And we find ourselves short of money to \nhandle the 375 parks we have now, and continuing to increase with parks \nthat may or may not fit the criteria.\n  So we are not as concerned about the criteria. I believe it exists \nthere. But we are concerned and hopefully will change the process in \nwhich the criteria moves through the Congress so that there is an \nopportunity to do that.\n  So, Mr. President, these are the things that we are doing. We have \npurposely worked on it all this session. We did not intend to bring a \nbill this session, but we do intend to have one prepared for January. I \nthink it is one of the things that most Americans are supportive of. \nNot everybody is going to be supportive of every proposal we have to do \nit, but I think there is general support for strengthening parks. There \nneeds to be.\n  Certainly we have more and more people wanting to participate in \nthem. So you have to recognize that as caring. So we will be moving \nforward on that. I think it is something that Congress ought to \nundertake, and be very proud to undertake.\n  There is great controversy over many of the environmental issues that \ngo around. But there is not much controversy over this one. If we talk \nabout what are the needs, are we going to try and fulfill those needs, \nmost everybody says yes. Now, when you get to how you do it, obviously, \nthere will be differences of view and debate. That is why we are here.\n  But, Mr. President, I am excited about this opportunity. We call our \nplan ``Vision 2020,'' so that we can take a look at parks so that our \nkids, 20 years from now, and others, will be able to enjoy them with \nthe same intensity that we have been able to.\n  We look forward to having our proposition ready by January. I hope \nmany of the Members of the Senate will join with us in seeking to \nresolve this important question and problem.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the time and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN.

Mr. President, I rise today to take a few minutes to \ndiscuss the effort here in the Senate to eliminate the secrecy with \nwhich the Senate so often conducts business. Through a procedure that \ncertainly isn't known to most Americans, it is possible for one U.S. \nSenator to unilaterally block this Senate from considering a piece of \nlegislation or a nomination. This process is known as a hold. Certainly \nas we have seen in the last few days, a hold is an extraordinary power \nin the last few hours of a session in the U.S. Senate. In fact, it is \nfair to say in the last few hours of a session, a hold is essentially \nunbeatable.\n  Now, originally a hold was intended as a courtesy to a Senator. If \nthe Senator couldn't be present at a particular time--there was an \nillness in the family, this sort of thing--they could put a hold on a \nmeasure or nomination, and that way, as a courtesy, the Senate would \nmake sure it was brought up shortly thereafter when that Senator could \nbe there.\n  But what has happened over the years is that the hold has been \nabused. At one point here fairly recently there were more than 40 holds \non individuals, nominees, pieces of legislation, and it was all done in \nsecret--all of it. At a time when the American people are so skeptical \nof the way business is done in Washington, DC, and so often \nunderstandably skeptical, the secret hold, the unilateral power of one \nSenator to block a bill or nomination and do it all\n\n[[Page S12076]]\n\nin secret is something that is being abused, and abused especially at \nthe end of a session of the U.S. Senate.\n  Senator Grassley and I, on a bipartisan basis, have tried to \neliminate the secrecy that surrounds these holds. We have said we are \nnot quarreling with the proposition of a Member of the U.S. Senate to \nhave this extraordinary power. Members of the Senate, under all other \ncircumstances, are accountable to their constituents. But in this case \nthey aren't accountable because they can exercise this power in secret.\n  Senator Grassley and I offered what we don't think is exactly a \nradical idea, which is that when a Senator uses this power, it would be \npublicly disclosed. We said if a Senator uses this power, they should \nhave to disclose the use of that hold in the Congressional Record \nwithin 48 hours of exercising their hold. That way, the U.S. Senate \nwould know who is exercising this power, the American people would know \nwho is exercising this power. If a Member of the U.S. Senate is doing \nthe bidding of a powerful set of interests, it would be possible for \neverybody to know what exactly was taking place. So Senator Grassley \nand I were able in the last weeks of the session to attach an anti-\nSenate-secrecy amendment so that when the use of the hold is applied, \nthe American people would know who was blocking this body from \nconsidering a bill or nomination.\n  Now, as I understand it, there are discussions underway, in effect \nbehind closed doors, behind closed doors without public debate, there \nis discussion of dropping an effort to end Senate secrecy. I will tell \nyou, that doesn't pass the smell test. Killing a plan to end Senate \nsecrecy behind closed doors isn't the way this body ought to be doing \nbusiness. Certainly what we have seen in the last few weeks since \nSenator Grassley and I prevailed on our proposal here in the Senate to \nend secrecy, is that there has been an explosive proliferation of the \nuse of holds once again. There are countless bills and nominations that \ncertainly deserve consideration. You can argue whether they deserve \nmajority support, but they certainly deserve open debate, and they \ncan't be brought to this floor because one Senator has secretly said \nno. One Senator has secretly said, ``No, I will not allow discussion'' \nof that particular topic.\n  The irony of all of this, Mr. President, is that often even Senators \ndon't know when a hold has been placed in their name. I have had a \nnumber of Senators tell me since I've come to the Senate that they have \nbeen approached about holds. They were told they had a hold on a \nmeasure. It turned out the staff had put a hold on it without their \neven knowing about it. So it is one thing for an elected official, a \nMember of the U.S. Senate with an election certificate to exercise this \nextraordinary power; it is quite another to have those who are not \nelected exercise it. It highlights, again, how much this process has \nbeen abused of late.\n  I thought that the minority leader, Senator Daschle, captured the \nspirit of this situation the other day in his morning briefing with the \npress. Amid what reads on the transcript like pretty raucous laughter, \nthe minority leader walked reporters through the variety of holds that \nthere were on dozens of nominees at that time. In fact, he said, ``If \nyou don't have a hold, you ought to feel lonesome.'' The minority \nleader was pressed by reporters about who might be placing some of the \nholds, but the minority leader said he didn't know who was placing \nthese holds. Some have said eventually you can find out who is \nexercising the hold. But I can tell my colleagues here in the U.S. \nSenate that even the minority leader is on record as saying he doesn't \nknow who is placing these secret holds.\n  This secrecy, in my view, Mr. President, is not in keeping with the \nproud traditions of the U.S. Senate, and it is not in keeping with the \nfundamental spirit of openness and accountability that is at the heart \nof our democratic process. I sought to serve in the U.S. Senate because \nI wanted to be in a position to influence policy on issues that are \nimportant to Oregonians and the people of this country. I value the \nextraordinary opportunity that I have been given by my constituents to \nserve and to use the power that they have given me on behalf of them \nand the American people. But it is time to say that power must be \naccompanied by responsibility. That responsibility is to be straight \nwith the American people, to tell them about the actions and the \npolicies that they are taking. It certainly is not in line with the \nspirit of openness and accountability for the American people to allow \none Senator in secret to unilaterally block from this floor even the \nconsideration of a bill or nomination.\n  I am one who simply feels that public business ought to be done in \npublic. Some might think that is a little bit quaint at this time in \nAmerican history. But I think it is time to bring some sunshine to the \nprocess for debating these issues. I am very proud and very grateful \nthat Senator Grassley has joined me in this effort. I think it is very \nunfortunate that there appears now to be an effort behind closed doors \nto kill our proposal to end Senate secrecy. That will be unfortunate if \nit takes place. If it takes place, I want every Member of the U.S. \nSenate to know that Senator Grassley and I will be back on this floor \npressing the case again.\n  It's not going to threaten the deliberative approach that this body \nrightly takes to consideration of issues, to have openness and \naccountability in the way that the Senate does business. Senator \nGrassley and I aren't saying get rid of the hold; we are not saying the \nhold ought to be abolished and a power that a Senator now has be \ndiminished. We are simply saying that power should be accompanied by \nresponsibility. Rights should be accompanied by responsibility.\n  Now, I was very gratified when the proposal Senator Grassley and I \noffered in the U.S. Senate was approved by this body. I have been \nappreciative of the fact that the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, \nhas been willing to work with me on this matter and has indicated that \nhe certainly doesn't want to see Senate secrecy and see important \ndecisions made without accountability. And I felt that the Senate was \nmoving in the right direction when, initially, our proposal was voted \non, and favorably so, by the U.S. Senate.\n  But I am concerned that the bill that will come before the Senate, \nthe D.C. appropriations bill, will not contain the legislation that \nSenator Grassley and I offered to end Senate secrecy. I am concerned \nthat our proposal may just disappear behind closed doors, without any \npublic debate, without any explanation at all, and that our proposal \nmay be put aside with the very secrecy that we sought to end.\n  So I tell my colleagues, Mr. President, that this fight is not going \nto end today. The D.C. appropriations bill is an important part of the \nSenate's work and it needs to be completed. But this Senator wants to \nbe clear that we will be back, and we will be back, in my view, with \neven more support from the American people, given the fact that, in \nrecent weeks, there were more than 40 holds--40 holds--on nominees and \nindividual pieces of legislation, and even the Senate minority leader \ncould not tell the American people who was exercising those holds.\n  Mr. President, it's time for additional openness and accountability \nin the U.S. Senate. In my view, continuing these secret practices \ncheapens the currency of democracy. The Senate can maintain its proud \ntraditions with having openness and accountability, and each Member of \nthe U.S. Senate will still be able to fight for their constituents and \ndo the work they were sent here to do.\n  So I am still hopeful that the D.C. appropriations bill, when it \ncomes back, will contain the legislation that Senator Grassley and I \nauthored to end the secrecy in the way business is done in the Senate. \nBut if it's not, if our provision is not, I want to assure the Members \nof the U.S. Senate that we will be back, we will be back on a \nbipartisan basis. I don't believe it's possible for any Senator, at a \ntown hall meeting in their home State, to justify these secret holds. I \ndon't think it passes the smell test. I think it's wrong. If we don't \nprevail on it today, Mr. President, we will be back.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today's economic reality is that \ntrade is global. Whether we enter into new international trade \nagreements or not, we cannot turn back the clock on the pace of \nglobalization of our economy.\n  Nor should we want to. In open and free trade lies the potential of \nincreased trade, and with increased trade and constructive interaction \namong the peoples of the world, the prospect of job creation, and an \nimproved standard of living worldwide is created.\n  Americans, who have enjoyed the highest standard of living in the \nworld, need not fear our ability to compete and win in this new global \neconomy. To the contrary, we have every interest in preparing ourselves \nto meet and master the challenges of this new era.\n  Economic growth through trade can produce better jobs, increased \nprosperity, and a continuation of the high standard of living and \nopportunity that define the American dream. In the last 4 years, \nexports have accounted for one out of every three jobs created in the \nU.S. economy. Moreover, the strength of our economy is reflected in the \nfact that the United States is the No. 1 exporting nation in the world.\n  Our trade competitors, in recognition of the trends already evident \nin this new global economy, have formed regional trading alliances and \nrelations to meet U.S. competition in world markets. Europe is \nbeginning to trade as a European Community; an agreement among the \nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations, known as ASEAN, augments Asian \ncompetition; and the United States entered into the NAFTA, in order to \nbegin the formation of a regional trading arrangement in our \nhemisphere.\n  I believe that trade liberalization can have positive effects for our \nAmerican economy. I do not believe, however, that it is advisable at \nthis time to resort to the fast-track procedure to get there.\n  At the outset, I want to remind my colleagues and the public at large \nthat what is at issue with this debate is not whether we will embrace \ntrade liberalization, but how we will do so, and under what conditions. \nFor constitutional, policy, and practical reasons I cannot support S. \n1269, given the current lack of consensus in this Congress on trade \npolicy objectives. I believe that this legislative proposal, as \ncurrently constituted, leaves too many questions unanswered regarding \nthe balance that needs to be struck in the interest of American \nbusiness and the American people.\n  Section 8 of article 1 of the Constitution gives to Congress the \ncommercial power: ``Congress shall have the power to . . . regulate \ncommerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, . . . and \nto lay and collect duties, imports and excises'' The Framers of the \nConstitution very clearly made it our responsibility to make commercial \nagreements, to set tariff levels, and to pass the laws necessary to \nimplement legislation for trade agreements that are not self-executing. \nThis power was put into the hands of the Congress, after no small \namount of debate, as a check and balance on the President's authority \nto make treaties and to conduct foreign policy.\n  The concept of checks and balances lies at the heart of our \nconstitutional system of government. The separation of powers, and the \nchecks and balances it provides, was, and is, a defense against the \ntyranny that concentration of power invites. In fact, some of the \nFramers of the Constitution argued that the powers vested in one branch \nof the Government could only be exercised by that branch. In 1789, \nJames Madison proposed an amendment to our Constitution which \nexplicitly stated as much: ``the legislative, executive and judiciary \npowers vested by the Constitution in the respective branches of the \ngovernment of the United States shall be exercised according to the \ndistribution therein made, so that neither of said branches shall \nassume or exercise any of the powers peculiar to either of the other \nbranches.'' (The House adopted Madison's proposed amendment, while the \nSenate, for reasons lost to history, rejected it.)\n  While it is still a matter of scholarly debate to what extent the \nseparation of powers exists as a doctrine or as a concept within our \nConstitution, the fact that we are engaging in this debate at all is \nwitness to the fact that this bill calls upon the legislature to \ntransfer a good part of its constitutional authority, in regards to \ncommercial treaties, to the Executive.\n  That is not to suggest that the fast-track authority has been a \nfailure, or that the Executive should never be entrusted to assume such \nauthority as the Constitution makes our responsibility. An early \nSecretary of the Treasury, Albert Gallatin, speaking to those instances \nin which ``shared'' authority might be appropriate, noted that, ``it is \nevident that where the Constitution has lodged the power, there exists \nthe right of acting, and the right of direction''. . . . but he went on \nto address the accommodation that might be appropriate between the \nbranches of government in this regard: ``the opinion of the executive, \nand where he has a partial power, the application of that power to a \ncertain object will ever operate as a powerful motive upon our \ndeliberations. I wish it to have its full weight, but I feel averse to \na doctrine which would place us under the sole control of a single \nforce impelling us in a certain direction, to the exclusion of all the \nother motives of action which should also influence us.'' (Gallatin, 7 \nAnnals of Congress 1121-22 (1798))\n  The bill before us would effectively preclude the Congress from \ninforming the Executive of ``all the other motivations of action,'' and \neven limits the time for debate. No amendments to trade agreements \nnegotiated under the fast-track authority are permitted, and only 20 \nhours of debate are allowed. Given the momentous changes which are \ntaking place in this new and global economy, this restriction on \ncongressional input seems to me unwise and unnecessary, and should not \nbe allowed to become routine practice.\n  Part of the lingering bitterness over the NAFTA, I suspect, arises \nfrom the fact that it was presented to the Congress under the same kind \nof fast-track procedures as are at issue now. Now, it is true that the \nclaims on both sides of that debate, of a great ``sucking sound'' on \nthe one hand, or of unprecedented job creation, on the other, did not \nmaterialize. What we have seen, in fact, is a mix of results, some \nbetter than predicted, some very much worse, but none fully realized, \nor more importantly, shared with the American people.\n\n  My home State of Illinois, for example, is a great exporting State, \nthe fifth largest in our country; 425,000 Illinois jobs are directly \nrelated to exports, and Illinois manufacturing exports have grown by 53 \npercent since 1993. Illinois' agricultural sector has also benefited \nfrom increased exports of corn and soybeans.\n  On the other hand, the losses of manufacturing jobs have been \nsignificant enough to give more credence than I would have liked to the \ndire predictions of the debate over NAFTA. Other States have had \ndifferent experiences, and one need only reflect on the impact on wheat \nimports, for example, to conclude that we have yet to reach closure on \nthe long term effects that increased liberalization will create.\n  And yet, despite that history and despite the absence of a clear \ntrade policy architecture that can command broad support both in \nCongress and across our Nation generally, S. 1269 would again mute the \nvoice of the Congress concerning the architecture and objectives of our \ntrade policy. Without the ability to amend such agreements as may be \nreached in the future, or to even enjoy normal parliamentary rights, we \nare left to that ``sole control of a single force impelling us in a \ncertain direction,'' which Mr. Gallatin feared.\n  We need a trade policy framework that will represent the interests of \nall of the American people, and that will best advantage our business \nsector in its global competitive challenge. Unfortunately, despite the \nbest efforts of our President and his first rate economic and trade \nteam, we do not yet have such a framework.\n  I am particularly concerned about the issue of child labor. American \nbusiness cannot compete fairly with nations that allow labor costs to \nbe artificially depressed by the exploitation of children. In 1994, the \nU.S. Department of Labor issued a startling report\n\n[[Page S12078]]\n\nentitled ``By the Sweat and Toil of Children--the Use of Child Labor in \nU.S. Manufactured and Mined Imports.'' That report found that in \ntextiles manufacturing, food processing, furniture making, and a host \nof other export-directed activities, children are employed for long \nhours in abysmal conditions, and are paid very low wages. They have \nfew, if any legal rights, can be fired without recourse, and are often \nabused. They are hired by our foreign competitors to minimize labor \ncosts. The International Labor Organization reports that 25 million \nchildren, world wide, are so engaged.\n  In the Philippines, for example, the Labor Department Report stated \nthat in the wood and rattan furniture industry, children working in \nfactories received 15 to 25 pesos per day--approximately 61 cents to \n$1. About 29 percent of the children were unpaid or compensated with \nfree food; the rest were paid on a piece rate basis. About 48 percent \nof the children work between 15 to 25 hours a week, while another 13 \npercent work more than 50 hours for less than minimum wage.\n  The report stated that children who work in the garment industry in \nThailand work 12-hour days in shops where they earn as little as five \ncents for sewing 100 buttons. Furthermore, they reported that in Cairo \nin Egypt's small family-operated textile factories, 25 percent of the \nworkers were under the age of 15. Seventy-three percent of the children \nworked in excess of 12 hours per day and earned an average of $8 per \nmonth.\n  These are just a few examples of countries that employ children. \nClearly, it is in the interest of every modern business and every \nindustrialized nation to develop new international standards to help \nend child labor. Lower wages and extremely poor working conditions can \nlower manufacturers' costs in the short term, but they create long-term \neconomic and geopolitical problems, not just for the country that \nexploits its children, but for the United States, as well.\n  When foreign industries artificially depress their labor costs by \nexploiting children, how can a U.S. worker compete? We must level the \nplaying field for American workers. And more importantly, we must put \nour Nation on record that child labor must end. The United States must \nrealize that it is an enlightened business policy to eliminate abusive \nchild labor. Free-trade agreements should contain clear provisions \nagainst the use of abusive child labor.\n  Child labor should be designated an unfair trade practice, but S. \n1269 does not make it so. Without such minimal ground rules with \nrespect to child labor, our trade policy will be at cross purposes with \nour trade and larger foreign policy and national security objectives. \nWe will have created a two-tier system in which U.S. companies will be \nprohibited from exploiting children here at home, while foreign firms, \nand U.S. companies, which leave to take advantage of the lower labor \ncosts on foreign soil, will be permitted to exploit children so they \ncan gain competitive advantage over those who play by our domestic \nrules. Such a system does nothing to benefit American business, creates \nincentives for the loss of U.S. jobs, and leaves us all with the shame \nof complicity in child abuse.\n  Finally, it is important to note that the Executive has the ability \nand the authority to negotiate trade agreements even in the absence of \nthe fast-track procedure. It is my understanding that some 200 trade \nagreements have been concluded without it. Fast-track has only been \nused five times since 1974, for the GATT Tokyo round in 1979, the \nUnited States-Israel Free-Trade Area Agreement in 1985, the United \nStates-Canada Free-Trade Agreement in 1988, NAFTA in 1992, and the \nUruguay round of the GATT in 1994.\n  Instead of closing off debate about the proper purposes and \narchitecture of free trade, we ought to encourage open and full debate \nwith the American people about it. Trade is inevitably a more and more \nimportant aspect of our economic landscape, and indeed, as American \nbusiness achieves the kind of market access in the world community that \nits capacity will allow, more and more U.S. workers will see the \nbenefits of liberalization. Even today, those businesses which have \nbenefited from the increased access accorded by NAFTA and GATT are \nenthusiastic about the prospects for real economic growth from this \nsector. We should be optimistic about our prospects overall, because \nAmerican goods and services are seen by the rest of the world as \nproviding the excellence they want. But we will see only fractiousness \nand retreat, if we fail to achieve consensus about the rules of our \nforay into this global economic competition.\n  I have a sense that trade, and its impacts, not only on our economy, \nbut on our foreign policy as well, will come more and more to dominate \nthe debate in our country about our future course and direction. If we \nare to be mindful of the ancient warning that ``all wars start with \ntrade'' then we should redouble our resolve to make certain that our \npolicy is based on consensus among our people regarding its direction, \nits objectives, its ground rules. We do not have such consensus yet. We \nshould not shut off the debate which is the only way to get that \nconsensus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12077-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12078]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY ACT REPEAL\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to state my strong support for \nS. 621, and express my disappointment that a few Senators have \nprevented this body from considering the bill this year. A bipartisan \nmajority of Senators supports PUHCA repeal, and I will bring it to the \nfloor for consideration and passage early next year.\n  Both Chairmen D'Amato and Murkowski, along with Senators Dodd and \nSarbanes, deserve great credit for helping to move this legislation \nforward. It is unfortunate that their efforts on both sides of the \naisle were unsuccessful this session. They know--as do the other 20 \ncosponsors of S. 621--that repealing PUHCA would remove an outdated \nregulatory burden that restricts the operations of a handful of \nelectric and gas utilities.\n  Mr. President, PUHCA was enacted in 1935 to eliminate holding company \nabuses of that time, and it was quite successful. In the last six \ndecades, however, Congress and the States have enacted a whole spectrum \nof securities, antitrust and utility regulatory statutes that make it \nimpossible for those abuses to occur again. Even the Securities and \nExchange Commission, the agency tasked to enforce PUHCA, has said that \nPUHCA is no longer needed and should be repealed.\n  Now, long past its usefulness, PUHCA stands in the way of \ncompetition. While some argue that PUHCA should only be repealed as a \npart of comprehensive restructuring legislation, I believe that \nincremental steps toward competition are responsible and realistic \naccomplishments for the 105th Congress. Repealing PUHCA should be the \nfirst incremental step.\n  Mr. President, crafting comprehensive restructuring legislation \nrequires Congress to consider a whole host of difficult issues--\nstranded cost recovery, State versus Federal authority, renewable \nresources, public power subsidies, environmental impacts. The list goes \non and on. There is no consensus among Senators on these issues, but \nthere is an overwhelming amount of support for PUHCA repeal.\n  Instead of searching for the perfect total package, let's focus on \nthe incremental steps toward competition that we can agree on. PUHCA is \nthe biggest single Federal obstacle to the advancement of retail \ncompetition, and it should be repealed now. Several States have already \nadopted or are in the process of adopting retail competition plans \nwithout comprehensive utility restructuring legislation. We can't allow \nthe Federal Government to block progress in the States. Without PUHCA \nrepeal, retail competition in the States simply cannot flourish.\n  Mr. President, now is the time for PUHCA repeal. Although the few \nopponents of S. 621 have prevented the Senate from considering the bill \nthis year, I will bring it to the floor early next year. I hope that my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in repealing this \noutdated and burdensome Federal obstacle to competition in the utility \nindustry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12078-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12078-S12080]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         KEEP HIGH TECHNOLOGY FREE FROM WASHINGTON INTERFERENCE\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to join me \nin\n\n[[Page S12079]]\n\nfighting to ensure that our high technology industries, and the \nInternet in particular, remain as free as possible from Government \nregulation and taxation.\n  America's high-technology, information age industries embody \nAmerica's entrepreneurial spirit. In this sphere, initiative and \ninventiveness are joined as thousands of people work to create new ways \nof generating and transferring technology, information and commerce. \nThe high technology sector is crucial to our economy, crucial to our \nworkers and crucial to our way of life. It must remain as free as \npossible so that it may continue to grow, employing ever more Americans \nin good jobs, generating commerce and employment throughout our Nation \nand constantly reviving our spirit of independence and innovation.\n  Mr. President, we first must keep in mind, in my view, that the hi-\ntech, information age industry is crucial to our economy. This industry \nis growing very quickly. A 1997 study by the Business Software Industry \nfound that the American software industry has grown two and a half \ntimes faster than the overall economy from 1990 to 1996, and that \nsoftware industry employment will grow 5.8 percent per year between now \nand 2005. In 1982, according to the Federal Trade Commission [FTC], \ncomputer products were found on the desks of only 5 percent of American \nworkers; only 4 percent of American households contained personal \ncomputers. By 1992 the figures surged to 45 percent and 31 percent, \nrespectively. Currently, 40 percent of American homes contain PCs. \nBetween 1972 and 1992, research intensive industries grew an average of \ntwice the rate of overall GDP growth, with computers, semiconductors \nand software leading the group.\n  Hi-tech industries are serving as engines of economic expansion, \ncreating many spin-off jobs. Economist Larry Kudlow reports that the \nhardware and software industries combined account for about one third \nof real economic growth. Overall, electronic commerce is expected to \ngrow to $80 billion by the year 2000. The FTC reports that, from 1985 \nto 1995, the worldwide number of hardware vendors increased from 120 to \n350, and the number of service providers--programmers, consultants, \nmaintenance and systems operators--increased from 1,715 to 30,000. Not \nonly hi-tech, but supporting hi-tech has become booming business.\n  To judge the dynamism of this sector of our economy, and of the \nInternet in particular, we should consider the fact that the Internet \ngrew from four linked sites in 1969 to become the first ubiquitous, \ninteractive advanced communications network. 15 million households are \nnow connected to the Internet, with 43 million expected by the year \n2000.\n  Mr. President, we all have benefited from this tremendous growth, and \nwe will continue to benefit from the hi-tech industry, so long as we \ncontinue to allow it to expand and innovate. Affordable world-wide \ncommunications and information transfer have changed our world for the \nbetter. Consumers now have far more choices, and benefit from greater \ncompetition among sellers. Workers have seen their opportunities \nincrease as well in our expanding economy. Perhaps most benefited has \nbeen American small business. During a time in which it is increasingly \ndifficult to deal with Government bureaucracies, regulations and so \nforth, in one sector of our economy an individual can still work nights \nand weekends in his garage and end up running his own company. This \nsector offers minimal barriers to entry and a convenient, cost-\neffective distribution. That sector is, of course, that of high \ntechnology.\n  Increased opportunity--to shop, to work, to start one's own \nbusiness--has been supplemented by an overall increase in freedom \nthanks to the open availability of information on the Internet and the \nfreeing up of new opportunities, for example through tele-commuting, to \nenrich our lives without sacrificing our careers.\n  All of this is possible, Mr. President, because we have a vital, \ngrowing and free hi-tech industry in America. And our hi-tech industry \nhas succeeded because in it Americans are able to respond quickly and \nefficiently to technical and marketing challenges, unencumbered by any \npreconceptions imposed by regulation relating to its development or \nfrom inappropriate Government charges on its business.\n  We are a freer, more prosperous and more open country because of our \nfree high technology industry. To the greatest extent possible, we \nshould keep that industry free from Washington rules, regulations and \ntaxes for the sake of our consumers, our small businesses and our \nworkers.\n  Mr. President, a number of issues have found their way before \nCongress that might severely affect our high technology sector. For \nexample, Local Exchange Carriers [LECs] have contended that increasing \nInternet traffic could soon exceed the current phone system's capacity. \nTo fund new infrastructure, the LECs have argued that a user fee should \nbe paid by companies that provide Internet access. But this user fee \ncould make consumers reluctant to use the Internet, particularly if it \nis not used to fund product improvements. What is more, access charges \nwould only suppress Internet development, leaving us all with \ninadequate infrastructure.\n  In response to this situation I joined with Senator Leahy to propose \nSenate Resolution 86, a nonbinding sense of the Senate resolution \nurging cooperation between Internet providers and the local phone \ncompanies. That resolution also calls for a rejection of access fees as \na means of solving the dispute.\n  Encryption also has been the subject of significant debate. More and \nmore, Mr. President, businesses are encrypting electronic mail messages \nsent interoffice and intraoffice. These businesses seek to protect \nthemselves against industrial espionage or recreational hackers. In \naddition, on-line commercial transactions, such as wiring money or \npurchasing and selling products, require encryption to ensure security.\n  Currently, there are no limits on the strength of encryption products \nfor domestic purposes. The same is true for importation. However, \nexportation of encryption is tightly controlled.\n  Many in the law enforcement community are concerned about the \nproliferation of strong encryption products, particularly should they \nfall into the hands of criminals. But this technology already exists, \nMr. President. We will not make ourselves safer by exposing businesses \nto industrial espionage, sabotage and the loss of commerce. That is why \nI supported Senator Burns' bill to maintain business' right to develop \nand use strong encryption.\n  As important as restrictions on development, Mr. President, have been \nproposals to tax commerce on the Internet. Over the last 2 years, \nseveral States and localities have passed or interpreted laws to permit \ntaxation of Internet sales and use.\n  The result, Mr. President, would be double taxation of Internet \ncommerce and a stifling of Internet use. S. 442, recently voted out of \nthe Commerce Committee, will stop this trend by imposing a 6-year \nmoratorium on subnational taxes on communications or transactions that \noccur through the Internet or online service, and access or use of the \nInternet or online services.\n  This moratorium would apply to all Internet and interactive computer \nservices, but not to property, income or business license taxes. In \nessence, it prohibits sales and use taxes unless the retailer has a \nphysical presence in the taxing State. It would keep Government from \npiling on taxes that will strangle the infant Internet commerce \nindustry in its cradle. It also will allow the States to come up with a \nrational system by which to tax Internet commerce.\n  Another area in which governmental action has threatened our hi-tech, \ninformation age industry has been immigration. I am proud that we \npushed back efforts during the last Congress to radically reduce the \nnumbers of immigrants coming legally into this country. I firmly \nbelieve that immigration is the American way, and because I know that \nlegal immigration is crucial to our hi-tech industry.\n  For example, 40 percent of Cypress Semiconductor's top-level \nmanagement is foreign-born. Chief Financial Officer Manny Hernandez is \nfrom the Philippines, vice president of research and development Tony \nAlvarez is from Cuba. And this immigrant-driven company employs 1,800 \npeople in the United States.\n\n[[Page S12080]]\n\n  Immigrants give America an entrepreneurial edge. In 1995 12 percent \nof the ``Inc.'' 500--a compilation of the fastest growing corporations \nin America--were started by immigrants. They also give us an edge in \ninnovation. Immigrants make up nearly a third of all Ph.D.'s involved \nwith research and development in science and engineering--the basis for \ninnovation and economic growth.\n  Immigrants also fill needed roles, particularly in the engineering \nfield. The CATO Institute reports that over 40 percent of our \nengineering Ph.D.'s are foreign-born, yet the unemployment rate in that \nfield is only 1.7 percent. Clearly there is a gap in engineering in \nAmerica that is being filled by immigrants.\n  I am pleased, then, Mr. President, that we did not close the door on \nimmigrants seeking to come to this country to make a contribution and \nseek a better life. And I hope we will continue to keep the door open, \nso that we may live up to our heritage as a nation of immigrants, and \nso that we may continue to prosper.\n  Finally, Mr. President, abusive class action lawsuits have caused \nsignificant harm to high technology companies, as they have to much of \nthe American economy. Some suits, alleging malfeasance on the part of \ncompany directors, have been brought within hours after a drop in a \ncompany's stock price.\n  Not long ago, this body successfully overrode the President's veto of \nlegislation to reform securities litigation in this country. That bill \nwill provide that discovery be stayed whenever a motion to dismiss is \npending in a securities action. Discovery costs have been estimated to \naccount for 80 percent of the costs of defending a lawsuit in this kind \nof action, and that is too much, particularly when the suit may be \ndismissed as without merit.\n  The bill also would create a modified system of proportionate \nliability, such that each codefendant in a securities action is \ngenerally responsible for only the share of damages that defendant \ncaused. This should prevent companies from being joined to a lawsuit \nsolely because of their deep pockets.\n  In addition, under this legislation, plaintiffs now must state facts \nwith particularly, and state facts that give rise to a strong inference \nof intent on the part of the defendant. This should end the too-common \npractice of filing cases on the basis of few or no hard, relevant \nfacts.\n  Finally, the bill contains a safe harbor provision protecting \nforward-looking predictive statements from liability.\n  Mr. President, we must go further, particularly in the area of legal \nreform, to protect our hi-tech industry from unwarranted interference. \nS. 1260, which I have cosponsored, would limit the conduct of \nsecurities class actions under State law. But even this is not enough.\n  Hi-tech and other companies are hit with all sorts of abusive \nlawsuits, not just securities litigation. That is why I am working for \nbroader litigation reforms. I offered an amendment last Congress that \nwould have expanded the joint and several liability provision of the \nproduct liability bill to cover all civil lawsuits. I also have \nintroduced my own bill to protect small businesses from frivolous \nlawsuits. And I am working with Senator McConnell to provide needed \nreforms to our civil justice system. It is my belief that we can make \nsubstantial progress in this area in the near future.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would just like to note that, while \nantitrust laws must apply to new industries as they have to the old, we \nshould not allow antitrust laws to become an excuse for excessive \nregulation. Hi-tech is a dynamic sphere of economic activity. Over-\nzealous Government regulation from Washington, by whatever means, will \nonly hurt consumers, producers and workers. I think most hi-tech CEOs \nwould agree that producers and consumers in the free market economy--\nnot bureaucrats and politicians in Washington--should determine winners \nand losers in the high tech industry.\n  Frivolous lawsuits, unnecessary regulation and onerous taxation. Mr. \nPresident, all these actions threaten our high technology, information \nage industry. It is my hope that we can work together to lessen the \nchance that they will be imposed on an industry that is central to our \neconomic well-being.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wanted to give a report to my colleagues on \nthe status of the Medicare Beneficiary Freedom To Contract Act, the so-\ncalled Medicare private contracting issue, which has been before both \nthe Senate and House for several weeks now following the adoption of \nthe Balanced Budget Act, which contained in it a provision which makes \nit much more difficult for physicians to serve patients who want to \ncontract outside of Medicare.\n  Let me briefly tell you what the problem is, the legislative status, \nand the resolution--at least as of now--that we have been able to \naccomplish.\n  The issue is whether or not physicians can serve both Medicare \npatients and people under private contracts who are 65 years of age. \nOnce a person turns 65, of course, they are eligible for Medicare, and \nmost of the services they can obtain are paid for by Medicare. But \noccasionally, either there is a service that is not covered by \nMedicare, or even sometimes services that are covered by Medicare that \na patient would prefer to obtain from a physician outside of the \nMedicare Program.\n  For example, a constituent of mine had a condition that required the \naid of a specialist in her small community. There were none available, \nexcept one person who was no longer taking Medicare patients. By the \nway, Mr. President, this is a common situation, because Medicare, \nespecially for specialists, does not reimburse even up to their level \nof costs. So while many physicians don't want to dump their existing \nMedicare patient load and they want to continue to serve those patients \nthey have been serving for a long time, they are not anxious to take on \nnew Medicare patients. In this case, she went to the physician. He said \nhe would be happy to take care of her, but he wasn't taking anymore \nMedicare patients. Her response was, ``Well, I will just pay you \ndirectly. You bill me, and I will pay you. That way Medicare will save \nsome money, and I will get the treatment I need, and you won't have to \ntake new Medicare patients.'' He found that the Federal Government \nwould have deemed that to be a violation of law and, therefore, he \nwould have been precluded from providing the services.\n\n  It was in response to that kind of a problem that we created a piece \nof legislation that would allow patients who are 65 years of age to \nhave the right to go to the physician of their choice and to be treated \noutside of the Medicare Program, if that is their choice. We passed \nthat legislation here in the Senate. It became part of the Balanced \nBudget Act. And, before the act was finalized, the President indicated \nhis desire to veto that legislation if that provision were retained. As \na result, some changes were made, the most important of which was to \nadd a provision to the act which makes it virtually impossible for \npatients to actually have the benefit of that freedom of choice. The \nprovision was that a physician providing such services had to opt out \nof all Medicare treatment 2 years in advance.\n  In other words, patients still had the right to go to a physician. \nBut any physician that provided those services could not provide any \nMedicare services for a period of 2 years. That meant that it was \nvirtually impossible then for physicians to serve these particular \npatients.\n\n[[Page S12081]]\n\n  In an effort to try to resolve that, we introduced the Medicare \nBeneficiary Freedom of Contract Act. It has almost 50 cosponsors in the \nSenate, well over 100 cosponsors in the House version sponsored by the \nchairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Bill Archer. We hoped \nthat we would have the opportunity to get that passed before the end of \nthis legislative session this year. It was not to be. People in the \nHouse of Representatives did not feel that they wanted to go forward \nwith it under the constraints of time. There were some other issues. As \na result, we did not push it as an amendment to one of the \nappropriations bills or other vehicles by which we could have done that \nhere in the Senate.\n  Instead, I sought to proceed in a way that would enable us to ensure \nthat we would make progress early next year on getting this issue \nresolved. Yesterday, I met with the President's nominee to head HCFA, \nNancy-Ann Minn Deparle. She gave me a series of assurances of ways that \nthey want to continue to work on this problem. I also received a phone \ncall from Secretary Shalala providing the same assurances that we will \nbe able to sit down and work with the administration to try to resolve \nthis issue so that early next year we will be able to pass legislation \nthat will solve this problem of Medicare-private contracting.\n  In addition to that, I received some assurances from Nancy-Ann Minn \nDeparle that the law that goes into effect on January 1 would not \naffect the provision of services not covered by Medicare. It would not \naffect the provision of service only partially covered by Medicare--on \nMedicare, for example, a second mammography beyond the annual \nmammography covered by Medicare. It would not affect the provision of \ncare under the Medicare Plus Choice Plan, the Medical Savings Account \noption, and it would not affect the ability of other physicians in a \ngroup practice to treat Medicare beneficiaries when a patient makes a \nprivate contract with one of the group practitioners.\n  We worked on some of the other problems relating to this in addition \nto try to develop legislation next year that will be approved by the \nHouse and Senate and the administration. I will report more on the \nprogress of this after a while.\n  I would like to introduce into the Record two items that came to my \nattention this morning. One, a copy of three letters that were \npublished.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, if my colleague will yield, I inquire: \nHow much time does the Senator intend to use?\n  Mr. KYL. I am finishing right now.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the text of \nthree letters carried in the New York Times on Friday, November 7, and \na copy of an editorial in the San Francisco Chronicle, and the date is \nNovember 6, 1997.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 7, 1997]\n\n             Health Care Is Too Important for Partisanship\n\n     To the Editor:\n       ``Move Under Way to Try to Block Health Care Bills'' (front \n     page, Nov. 4) points up that health care reform is again \n     being treated as a partisan issue rather than the bipartisan \n     issue it should be. The health care system is in critical \n     condition.\n       Costs are rising at twice the rate of inflation and will \n     double in the next 10 years. The number of uninsured--\n     estimated to be between 41 million and 44 million--is \n     increasing by a million a year, and the quality of care \n     continues to erode.\n       Competition and managed care have been promoted as \n     solutions, yet the marketplace has done little to stem long-\n     term cost, quality and coverage problems, which show no sign \n     of abating.\n       Opponents of reform being considered in Congress contend \n     that the proposals would increase costs even more and drive \n     more people out of health coverage.\n       Yet without change in the way we deliver and pay for health \n     care, costs will rise more rapidly and the number of \n     uninsured will grow larger.\n       Partisan posturing only aggravates the problems for all \n     Americans.\n                                           Henry E.

It was the heavy hand of the Health Care Financing \n     Administration that articulated the draconian regulations \n     forbidding outside contracting. A 1992 court decision \n     (Stewart v. Sullivan) was moot on the subject of outside \n     contracting, effectively allowing it.\n       Consequently, we have already had Medicare outside \n     contracting without all of the hazards you predict: illegal \n     double billing of both the patient and Medicare, a two-tier \n     system of care and unequal bargaining between physician and \n     patient. You propose to fix the functional status quo with \n     one that decrees loss of individual freedom of choice at a \n     moment when life and death decisions may be crucial.\n     Robert L.

There are 65-year-\n     olds more than able to negotiate on their own behalf and who \n     feel demeaned when the Government robs them of the right. Why \n     deny them the same rights that they had the year before they \n     turned 65?\n       The low regard for the integrity of physicians your \n     editorial expresses is offensive. In spite of all the chaos \n     in the health care sector, the primary reward of the \n     physicians I speak with comes from helping patients.\n       Do you really think the typical physician is bent on \n     defrauding people?\n\n                                       Herbert S. Gross, M.D.,\n\n                                 Clinical Professor of Psychiatry,\n     University of Maryland.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the San Francisco Chronicle, Nov. 6, 1997]\n\n                   Freedom of Choice On Medical Care\n\n       The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 was supposed to give \n     elderly patients greater freedom of choice on medical care. \n     But it stopped short of offering genuine choice. Here's the \n     situation.\n       Under current rules, doctors are prohibited--criminally \n     prohibited--from charging Medicare patients more than the \n     amounts permitted by the government, even if the patients are \n     willing to pay the money out of their own pocket. These \n     restrictions have kept Medicare patients from being able to \n     use their own money to see doctors--even specialists--as they \n     choose.\n       This restriction is all the more onerous for patients \n     because so many doctors have become disenchanted with \n     Medicare, which reimburses at about 70 percent of the rate of \n     private insurers. As a result, some senior citizens have \n     trouble finding a doctor willing to take them.\n       Recognizing the problems with the restrictions, Congress \n     recently voted to allow Medicare beneficiaries the option to \n     privately contract with doctors for any service at any \n     price--with one caveat.\n       And that caveat, insisted upon by the Clinton \n     administration, is a whopper that effectively undermines the \n     patient's freedom of choice. The Clinton-pushed amendment to \n     the bill provides that any physician who enters into such a \n     private contract cannot receive any Medicare reimbursement \n     for two years. Those new rules go into effect January 1.\n       Senator Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., has introduced legislation (S. \n     1194) that would get rid of the two-year restriction on \n     doctors who enter into the private contracts. His plan to \n     open up choices for Medicare patients has encountered intense \n     opposition from powerful groups, notably the American \n     Association of Retired Persons.\n       Defenders of the status quo argue that Medicare patients \n     have no shortage of choices. ``The idea that doctors don't \n     take Medicare patients is fallacious,'' said Representative \n     Pete Stark, D-Hayward, a longtime advocate of universal \n     health care. Stark maintains that a private-payment option \n     would create a two-tiered system--``boutique health care'' \n     for the wealthy, while Medicare would be left to tend to the \n     poorest and the sickest.\n       There is a little problem with the all-is-well premise of \n     those who oppose the Kyl bill. If Medicare really did offer \n     satisfactory choice and service for beneficiaries, then none \n     of them would want or need to dig any deeper into their \n     pockets for medical care.\n       This issue also involves a matter of privacy--which is why \n     the American Psychiatric Association strongly supports the \n     Kyl bill. Medicare covers 50 percent of the cost of \n     psychotherapy, but some patients would rather pay the full \n     freight in order to avoid the government's ability to review \n     their claims, said the APA's Jay Butler.\n       Medicare patients deserve a chance to decide for themselves \n     what kind of care they want, and whether they are willing to \n     pay for it.\n\n  Mr. KYL. With that, Mr. President, I will complete this at another \ntime since I know Senator Specter wants to move forward.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nArizona.

Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the conference report to accompany H.R. 2264.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2264), have agreed to recommend and do recommend to their \n     respective Houses this report, signed by majority of the \n     conferees.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of November 7, 1997.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. I ask for \nconfirmation from the Chair that we are now on the conference report \nhaving begun at 1:05 with the 90-minute time limit so that we will vote \nno later than 2:35.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, it is with great pleasure for me personally that I \naddress the Senate on the conference report on the appropriations bill \nfor the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education.\n  It has been a long, tortuous road to come to this position where if \nthe Senate acts favorably on this conference report, it may then be \npresented to the President with the expectation that it will be signed \ninto law.\n  There are 13 appropriations bills which run the U.S. Government, and \nthe appropriations bill on these three departments is the largest one \nin the Federal Government, downsizing of some $277 billion, and it is \nnow larger even than the appropriations bill for the Department of \nDefense.\n  This bill has had a very, very difficult process in coming through \nconference with a tremendous number of obstacles and difficulties \nconfronting the legislative process at every step of the way.\n  The process that this conference report has come to the floor with \nwould perhaps constitute a textbook on legislative process except that \nit has been so extraordinary. That has been occasioned by the fact that \nthere are so many so-called riders or legislative provisions on the \nappropriations bill which have enormously complicated the work of the \nconferees in trying to work out an enormous number of complicated \nproblems.\n  The most vexing of all of the issues--and it had a lot of \ncompetition--was the issue on so-called testing. There has been a \ngeneralized agreement that it would be desirable to test fourth graders \non reading and eighth graders on mathematics but a great deal of \ndisagreement as to how that testing ought to be carried out. There has \nbeen widespread sentiment expressed that the Federal Government ought \nnot to be intrusive in the educational process. Then the problem arises \nas to just how this test would be worked out.\n  When the bill came to the floor of the Senate, the excellent work was \ndone by Senator Coats of Indiana, Senator Gregg of New Hampshire, with \nthe assistance of former Secretary of Education Bill Bennett. In the \nhands of those three individuals, with the established record in the \neducation field, great knowledge on testing, and all being very zealous \nto keep out Federal intrusion but to limit any testing approach to \nabsolute necessity and to State control, it was the expectation of this \nbody that when Senator Coats, Senator Gregg, and former Secretary \nBennett agreed on a process, that it would satisfy even those most \ndiligent in objecting to Federal testing. The Senate passed that \namendment by a vote of 87 to 13, which is a very, very strong show of \nsupport in this body.\n  The House of Representatives enacted a provision that there should be \nno funds on testing. When we came to the issue of conference a week ago \nWednesday, a meeting occurred attended by the top leadership of the \nRepublican Party of the House and the Senate, attended by the Speaker; \nby the House majority leader; by the No. 3 in rank in the House of \nRepresentatives, Mr. DeLay; the chairman of the House Appropriations \nCommittee, Mr. Livingston; and the chairman of the House Appropriations \nSubcommittee, my counterpart, Congressman John Porter. And on the \nSenate side, we had our own majority leader. We had the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee. And I was present.\n  We agreed on a number of items. One of the foremost of those items on \nwhich there was agreement was the issue of testing. There was one party \npresent who disagreed. That was the chairman of the authorizing \ncommittee in the House, my colleague from Pennsylvania, Congressman \nGoodling. But aside from Congressman Goodling's dissent, there was \nagreement at that meeting.\n\n  A week ago Thursday the conferees met and hammered out quite a number \nof other complicated issues and came to agreement on a conference \nreport. That night the agreement was repudiated, and we were back to \nsquare one with respect to the testing issue, which held up this bill \nuntil further negotiations were undertaken by the President and by \nCongressman Goodling. The testing issue has finally been resolved. A \nkey part of the agreement on testing is that the matter will be \nsubmitted to the House-Senate authorizers early next year.\n  This is one illustration as to what ought to be done by the \nauthorizing committees so that the matters are not put on \nappropriations bills and bog down the appropriators.\n  There was plenty of time during 1997 to have this issue of testing \ntaken up by the authorizers. It really is a matter for the authorizers \nto make the congressional determination about what testing ought to be \ninstead of tacking it onto an appropriations bill where it really does \nnot belong. It is grafted onto the appropriations bill with this \nlanguage, ``No funds shall be expended for testing.'' That is the way \nmany, many substantive matters were grafted onto the appropriations \nbill. ``No funds shall be expended for'' purpose A, B, or C.\n  When it became apparent to me that this issue was going to be one in \nthe appropriations process after this bill was on the floor for initial \nconsideration by the Senate, I scheduled a hearing. At the hearing, we \nheard both sides of the issue. The Secretary of Education came forward \nto articulate the administration's position on why there should be \ntesting. We invited Congressman Goodling to present his views about why \nthere should be no testing. After having had the benefit of that \ninformation, we then were in the position to proceed as best we could \non that limited record to make the judgment on testing.\n  We had in the conference many other complex issues that we finally \nworked out. We had the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator \nfrom Washington, Senator Murray, on the issue of not restricting \nwelfare benefits to women who had been victims of domestic violence. \nThat is a substantive matter that would be better considered by the \nauthorizers. But it passed in the U.S. Senate by a vote of 98 to 1. At \nleast, in my judgment, and the judgment of 97 other Senators, it had a \nvery important public policy purpose, to give special consideration on \nwelfare benefits and other matters for women who had been victims of \ndomestic violence. Senator Murray was gracious to not press her \namendment in conference, on an arrangement where the House of \nRepresentatives authorizing subcommittee made a commitment to take up \nthe issue early next year. I was delighted to join Senator Murray as a \ncosponsor on that matter.\n  That is one illustration of how we moved ahead to focus on money \nmatters without that kind of a substantive provision.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. President, at this time I ask unanimous consent that Mr. Jim \nSourwine and Ellen Murray, detailees to the committee, be granted floor \nprivileges during the consideration of\n\n[[Page S12083]]\n\nthe conference report accompanying H.R. 2264.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. President, the conference agreement accompanying the Labor, \nHealth and Human Services, and Education bill for fiscal year 1998 that \nis before the Senate today totals $80.4 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority. Mandatory spending totals $196.4 billion, a decrease of $16 \nbillion from the fiscal 1997 levels, for a net decrease in the bill of \n$10.3 billion.\n  The conference agreement both keeps faith with the budget agreement \nand addresses the health and education priorities of the Senate. The \nprotected programs in the budget deal account for nearly half of the \ntotal increases in the bill, and $3.3 billion of the increase is for \neducation.\n  I want to take this opportunity to thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Iowa, Senator Harkin, for his hard work and support in bringing \nthis bill through the conference and to the floor. I also want to thank \nCongressman John Porter, the distinguished chair of the House \nSubcommittee, Congressman David Obey, ranking minority member, and \nCongressman Bob Livingston, chair of the House full committee for \ndedicating their time and energy in getting this bill to this stage. \nThis has not been an easy process. We confronted many difficult \ndecisions, choices, and tradeoffs, National testing was one of them, \nbut finally through hard work, persistence, and a great deal of give \nand take, we were able to work out this agreement.\n  The programs funded within the subcommittee's jurisdiction provide \nresources to improve the public health, strengthen medical research, \nassure a quality education for America's children, and offer \nopportunities for individuals seeking to improve job skills. I'd like \nto mention several important accomplishments of this bill.\n\n\n                            medical research\n\n  Few things are more important than a persons health and few things \nare feared more than cancer, heart disease, Alzheimer's or some other \nserious physical disorder. Medical research into understanding, \npreventing, and treating the disorders that afflict men and women in \nour society is the best means we have for protecting our health and \ncombating disease. The conference agreement contains nearly $13.7 \nbillion for the National Institutes of Health to support medical \nresearch that is being conducted at institutions throughout the \ncountry. This is an increase of $907 million above the fiscal year 1997 \nlevel and is consistent with the commitment I made earlier this year to \nincrease funding for NIH by 7.1 percent and with the overwhelming \nendorsement of medical research by the Senate during consideration of \nthe budget resolution. These funds will be critical in catalyzing \nscientific discoveries that will lead to new treatments and cures for a \nwhole host of diseases.\n\n\n                            family planning\n\n  For the family planning program, the bill recommends $203.4 million \nto support primary health cares services at more than 4,000 clinics \nnationwide. This amount represents an increase of $5 million over the \n1997 appropriation. Over 85 percent of family planning clients are \nwomen at or below 150 percent of the poverty level and these additional \nfunds will help to ensure that these low-income women have access to \nquality health services.\n\n\n                         adolescent family life\n\n  The bill recommends $19.2 million, an increase of $5 million more \nthan appropriated in fiscal year 1997 for the only Federal program \nfocused directly on the issue of adolescent sexuality, pregnancy, and \nparenting.\n\n\n                                  aids\n\n  This bill contains an estimated $3.380 billion for research, \neducation, prevention, and services to confront the AIDS epidemic, \nincluding an $154 million increase for Ryan White CARE Act programs. \nThe bill also provides $285.5 million for state AIDS drug assistance \nprograms, an increase of $118.5 million over the President's request \nand the 1997 appropriation. Finally, within this amount, and estimated \n$1.596 billion is provided for AIDS research supported by the National \nInstitutes of Health. The bill provides that these funds will continue \nto be distributed and coordinated by the director of the NIH Office of \nAIDS Research [OAR].\n\n\n                            substance abuse\n\n  Substance abuse continues to plague our society with recent \nstatistics showing many teenagers reporting regular use of marijuana \nand alcohol. The conference agreement includes over $2.395 billion to \nsupport the research, prevention, and treatment programs of the \nDepartments of Health and Human Services and Education. This is an \nincrease of $72.1 million over the 1997 appropriated levels for these \nprograms.\n\n\n                       juvenile crime initiatives\n\n  The conference agreement includes $30 million for new programs to \nassist communities in preventing juvenile crime. Funds include: $12.5 \nmillion for youth offender demonstration training grants supported by \nthe Department of Labor; $12 million for youth offender education \ngrants supported by the Department of Education; and $6 million for at-\nrisk youth substance abuse prevention grants supported by the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services.\n\n\n                               head start\n\n  To enable all children to develop and function at their highest \npotential, the agreement includes $4.355 billion for the Head Start \nProgram, an increase of $374.4 million over last years appropriation. \nThis increase will provide services to an additional 36,000 children \nbringing the total amount of kids served in fiscal year 1998 to \n836,000. This brings us closer to the goal of enrolling 1 million \nchildren in Head Start by the year 2002. Within the total, $279 million \nis targeted for Early Head Start, which provides Head Start services to \ninfants and toddlers ages 0 to 3. This is an increase of $70 million \nover 1997.\n\n\n                         violence against women\n\n  The bill includes $154 million to support the programs authorized by \nthe Violence Against Women Act. This is an increase of $31 million for \nprograms to provide assistance to women who have been victims of abuse \nand to initiate and expand prevention programs, to begin to reduce the \nnumber of women who are forced to confront the horrors of abuse. \nIncluded is: $86.8 million for battered women's shelters; $45 million \nfor rape prevention; $15 million for runaway youth prevention; $6 \nmillion for domestic violence community demonstrations; and $1.2 \nmillion for the domestic violence hotline.\n\n\n                                 liheap\n\n  The bill maintains the $1 billion appropriated in last year's bill \nfor the upcoming winter's Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program \n[LIHEAP]. In addition, the recommendation provides an advance \nappropriation of $1.1 billion for the 1998-1999 LIHEAP winter program, \nan increase of $100 million over this year's level. The bill also \nprovides additional emergency appropriations of $300 million. LIHEAP is \na key program for low-income families in Pennsylvania and other cold \nweather States in the Northeast. Funding supports grants to States to \ndeliver critical assistance to low-income households to help meet \nhigher energy costs.\n\n\n                             aging programs\n\n  For programs serving the elderly, the bill before the Senate \nrecommends $1.988 billion, an increase of $65.5 million over the fiscal \nyear 1997 appropriation. Included is: $440.2 million for the community \nservice employment program which will provide more part-time employment \nopportunities for the low-income elderly; $9 million more for \nsupportive services and senior centers; $17 million more for congregate \nand home-delivered nutrition services; and $18.4 million more for the \nnational senior volunteer corps. Also the bill provides a 7.2 percent \nincrease for research into the causes and cures of diseases such as \nAlzheimer's disease and other aging related disorders, funds to \ncontinue geriatric education centers, and the Medicare insurance \ncounseling program.\n\n\n                             school to work\n\n  The agreement includes $400 million for school to work programs \nwithin the Departments of Labor and Education. These important programs \nhelp improve the transition from school to work for those students who \ndo not plan to attend 4-year institutions.\n\n\n                               education\n\n  To enhance this Nation's investment in education, the conference \nreport before the Senate contains $29.74 billion in discretionary \neducation funds, an increase of $3.25 billion over last year's funding \nlevel. Specifically, education\n\n[[Page S12084]]\n\nreform programs have been funded at $1.275 billion, an increase of $279 \nmillion over the previous year's funding level, including $491 million \nfor Goals 2000, $541 million for the technology literacy challenge fund \nand technology innovative challenge grants.\n  For programs to educate disadvantaged children, the bill recommends \nnearly $8 billion, $201 million more than the amount appropriated in \nfiscal year 1997. These funds will provide services to approximately 7 \nmillion schoolchildren. The bill also includes $124 million for the \nEven Start Program, an increase of $22 million over the 1997 \nappropriation. Even Start provides educational services to low-income \nchildren and their families.\n  For impact aid programs, the bill includes $808 million, an increase \nof $78 million over the 1997 appropriation. Included in the \nrecommendation is: $50 million for payments for children with \ndisabilities, an increase of $10 million over last year's funding \nlevel; $623.5 million for basic support payments, an increase of $8 \nmillion; and $24 million for payments for Federal property, an increase \nof $6.5 million.\n  Consistent with the budget agreement the bill provides $354 million \nto assist in the education of immigrant and limited-English proficient \nstudents. This recommendation is an increase of $92.3 million over the \n1997 appropriation and will provide instructional services to \napproximately 60,000 children. Within the funds provided, $25 million \nhas been included for professional development to improve teacher \ntraining programs.\n  One of the largest increases recommended in this bill is the \nadditional $746 million for special education programs to help local \neducation agencies meet the requirement that all children with \ndisabilities have access to a free, appropriate public education, and \nall infants and toddlers with disabilities have access to early \nintervention services. The $4.8 billion for special education programs \nwill serve an estimated 4.95 million children at a cost of $662 per \nchild.\n  To improve post-secondary education opportunities for low-income \nfirst-generation college students, the committee recommendation \nprovides $530 million for the TRIO program, a $30 million increase over \nthe 1997 appropriation. These additional funds will assist in more \nintensive outreach services for low income youth.\n  For student aid programs, the bill provides $8.97 billion, an \nincrease of $1.418 million over the 1997 appropriation. Pell grants, \nthe cornerstone of student financial aid, have been increased by $300 \nfor a maximum grant of $3,000. The supplemental educational opportunity \ngrants program has also been increased by $31 million, and the work \nstudy and Perkins loans programs have been maintained at their 1997 \nlevel.\n  In keeping with the budget agreement, the bill also provides $295 \nmillion for child literacy initiatives. The committee has provided $85 \nmillion of this amount to enhance literacy activities in existing \nprograms in fiscal year 1998. The balance, $210 million, is available \non an advanced funded basis. This will give the authorizing committee's \nadequate time to work out the specifics of this new program.\n\n\n                              job training\n\n  In this Nation, Mr. President, we know all too well that unemployment \nwastes valuable human talent and potential, and ultimately weakens our \neconomy. The bill before us today provides $5.23 billion for job \ntraining programs, $518 million over the 1997 level. Increases include: \n$92 million more for the Job Corps; $60 million more for adult \ntraining; and $64 million more for retraining dislocated workers. These \nfunds will help improve job skills and readjustment services for \ndisadvantaged youth and adults. The bill also reserves $250 million for \nopportunity areas for out of school youth grants if this new program \nproposed in the budget is authorized by July 1, 1998.\n\n\n                            workplace safety\n\n  The bill provides $1.070 billion for worker safety programs, an \nincrease of $45 million above 1997. While progress has been made in \nthis area, there are still far too many work-related injuries and \nillnesses. The funds provided will continue the programs that inspect \nbusiness and industry, assist employers in weeding out occupational \nhazards and protect workers' pay and pensions.\n\n\n                                closing\n\n  There are many other notable accomplishments in this conference \nagreement, but for the sake of time, I mentioned just several of the \nkey highlights, so that the Nation may grasp the scope and importance \nof this bill.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I again want to thank Senator Harkin and \nhis staff and the other Senators on the subcommittee for their \ncooperation in a very tough year.\n  In summary, Mr. President, this bill is one of enormous importance \nfor America, for many reasons, and I shall detail only a few. My own \npersonal opinion is that there is no priority higher in America today \nthan health care and education. There are matters of tremendous \nconcern--the crime problem, something that I spent a good part of my \nprofessional life on as a prosecuting attorney, the problem of \nenvironmental protection, the issue of economic development and our \ninfrastructure of highways, grave difficulties of foreign policy around \nthe world: In the Mideast, Bosnia, NATO, China, Africa and Latin \nAmerica, and the fast track issue--but no issues rank higher than the \nhealth of Americans or the education of Americans.\n  The National Institutes of Health is the crown jewel of the Federal \nGovernment, with NIH having made miraculous advances in combating \nAlzheimer's disease, breast cancer, cervical cancer, prostate cancer, \nheart disease, mental illness, you name it, the men and women at NIH \nare on the firing line doing extraordinary work. We have been able to \nadd to the NIH budget some $907 million this year, which is a 7.1 \npercent increase, bringing the total for the National Institutes of \nHealth to $13.647 billion, almost $13.65 billion.\n  Senator Harkin, my distinguished ranking member, and I have worked on \na bipartisan basis in the subcommittee. My experience in Congress has \ndemonstrated to me that the only way to get anything meaningful done in \nWashington is to work on a bipartisan basis. With the help of our \nstaffs, Senator Harkin and I on this subcommittee have consolidated or \neliminated some 134 programs to save $1.5 billion, which we have \nallocated to the health issues and to education issues.\n  I had a talk with Dr. Varmus earlier this week on the occasion of the \ndedication of a building at NIH to our former colleague, the \ndistinguished Senator from Oregon, Mr. Hatfield, who did such \noutstanding work for NIH on so many matters in his capacity as chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee. On Tuesday I again asked Dr. Varmus, \nas I have asked him and others at NIH, ``How much would you be able to \nappropriately use on medical research?'' I asked him this question \nbecause, in a Federal budget of $1.7 trillion, we could assess our \npriorities in a way to appropriate more for the National Institutes of \nHealth. Yes, $13.65 billion is a lot of money, but it is not a lot of \nmoney in the context of a Federal budget of $1.7 trillion. Dr. Varmus \ntold me that they would like to grant about a third of the \napplications, that they now grant something in the high twenties, and \nin addition to that there are other items they need in the way of \nequipment. I said, ``You ought to make a list and tell us what it is \nyou need.'' He said, ``We have made a list, but we haven't told you \nwhat it is because we can't.''\n  That is a reference to the Office of Management and Budget, which \nintercepts these estimates by the NIH and does not present them to \nCongress so the administration can maintain control over requests which \nare made by the various departments.\n  In our appropriations process next year, I intend to do my best to \nget that list and find out what Dr. Varmus and the National Institutes \nof Health would really like to have. It might be an interesting \noccasion for a subpoena. Our subcommittee never ever issues subpoenas. \nI know that takes our Committee staff by surprise to think of our doing \nthat. But I think Congress would be prepared to make appropriation \nallocations for what could be effectively used by the National \nInstitutes of Health.\n  Mr. President, in addition, we have some almost $30 billion for \nprograms in the Department of Education, which is an increase of $3.3 \nbillion above 1997.\n\n[[Page S12085]]\n\nOn this subject, I compliment President Clinton for his leadership on \neducation. His last State of the Union speech highlighted education, \nand there was a real advocacy and leadership by the President on \neducation when this matter came up. From time to time the President is \nsubject to a critical comment or two, and I think it appropriate to \nnote his leadership and his important work in getting this increase in \neducation.\n  The bill also includes $1.1 billion in advance funds for LIHEAP, low-\nincome home energy assistance, largely for senior citizens, Americans \nwho, without this assistance, may have to make a choice between heating \nand eating. We have $1.15 billion for the Ryan White care program on a \ndrugs issue, $861 million for programs for senior citizens under the \nOlder Americans Act, $826 million for community health centers, $145 \nmillion for the breast and cervical cancer screening program for the \nCenters for Disease Control, $5.2 billion for employment and training \nprograms of the Department of Labor, including $871 million for summer \nyouth job programs, $1.24 billion for the Job Corps, and $1.35 billion \nfor dislocated worker assistance.\n  I might add a special note to the success by Governor Ridge of \nPennsylvania and Mayor Rendell of Philadelphia, along with my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Santorum, and the Pennsylvania \ndelegation in reopening the Philadelphia Navy Yard for shipbuilding on \na very good arrangement where we will have retraining funds.\n  Mr. President, there is a great deal more I could say on the subject, \nbut I note my distinguished colleague, Senator Harkin, has some \nimportant comments to make, so I yield to him at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and my good friend, \nSenator Specter, for yielding this time.\n  I especially wish to thank Senator Specter, our chairman, and his \nstaff for the skill they have demonstrated and the cooperation which \nthey have given us in putting this bill together and working out the \nmany compromises that were necessary to come up with this very \nbipartisan conference agreement. It took a lot of staff meetings, a lot \nof give and take, but the result is one that merits the support of all \nSenators.\n  This conference report, I believe, is the most important bill we will \npass this year after the balanced budget agreement. It includes a \nnumber of very important advances.\n  First, the agreement significantly expands our Nation's commitment to \nquality education for our children. We have provided the largest \nincrease for special education in our history. I repeat that. We have \nprovided the largest increase for special education in our history. We \nhave made college more affordable by increasing the maximum Pell grant \nto $3,000, the highest ever. We have expanded support to make sure \nschoolchildren have access to computers and other technology and for \ntraining teachers on how to use this technology. Computers in the \nclassroom are of little value if the teachers do not know how to use \nthem.\n  I am especially pleased that the conference committee agreed to my \nproposals to place greater emphasis on making sure that every American \nchild enters school ready to learn. The agreement before us increases \nHead Start funding by $374 million. That is $50 million more than the \nPresident requested, and, more significantly, I believe this bill \ndoubles the Early Head Start Program, that is, the birth-to-2-year-old \nprogram, at $279 million, so we have doubled the early intervention \nprogram for Early Head Start.\n  The conference agreement also provides an 11-percent increase in \nfunding to $350 million for the early intervention program for infants \nand toddlers with disabilities under part H of IDEA, the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act. That is an 11 percent increase for \nthat part H.\n  Finally, the conference report includes an additional $50 million for \nthe child care and development block grant to increase the quality of \nchild care for infants. We all know that these are front-end \ninvestments that will pay dividends for us in the future.\n  Mr. President, as most of my colleagues know, our subcommittee has \nworked for many years to combat fraud, waste and abuse in the Medicare \nProgram. A recent audit by the HHS inspector general found that \nsomewhere in the neighborhood of $23 billion was lost last year alone \njust to this problem of fraud, waste and abuse. I am pleased to say \nthat the agreement before us significantly expands our efforts to stop \nthis Medicare waste. Coupled with mandatory increases, our bill \nprovides a full 25-percent increase in support for audits and other \nfraud-fighting activities, from $440 million to $550 million.\n\n  In addition, we have included bill language that provides Medicare \ngreater resources to more aggressively target problem providers who are \nbilking the system. We need to do even more, including, at long last, \nto get to competitive bidding in Medicare just like they have gotten in \nthe Veterans Administration. But the reforms in this will save Medicare \nand the taxpayers billions of dollars.\n  One major concern I have about this bill is our inability to \nadequately address our health services and training needs and \nsimultaneously provide generous increases for health research. I am \npleased that we have included nearly $1 billion additional for NIH, a \ntotal of over $13.5 billion, for medical research. But I am concerned \nthat most health services programs received small or no funding \nincreases. We just cannot continue to have this battle between the \nchallenge to adequately fund biomedical research, which we have to \nmeet, and the lack of increased funding for health services programs \nand training.\n  Now, I will not go into it at length here--I have given many speeches \non the floor about this--but I feel strongly that the money we provide \nfor biomedical research must come from outside of the discretionary pot \nof money we have.\n  Mr. President, during this session of the Congress, the Senate went \non record 99 to nothing to double the funding for NIH over the next 5 \nyears--99 to nothing. In other words, 99 Senators stood up and voted \nand said, yes, we should double funding for NIH in the next 5 years.\n  Now, if we did that within the constraints of the balanced budget \nagreement, with the pot of money that our committee has, at the end of \nthis 5-year period of time there wouldn't be one penny for any other \ndiscretionary health program. In other words, the Senate has said 99 to \nnothing we want to double NIH funding. OK, if we do it through our \nAppropriations Committee, through the discretionary money that we have, \nthere will not be anything left for any other health program. There \nwould be no Centers for Disease Control, no Ryan White funding, no \nhealth training funding, nothing. That would all have to be zeroed out, \nand we still would not have enough money to double NIH funding.\n  So if we are really serious, and I hope we are, about doubling NIH \nfunding over the next 5 years, then we have to find some source of \nfunding that is outside of the normal appropriations process.\n  I am also concerned that our agreement does not adequately assure \nthat the rerun of the Teamsters election will be supervised. I think \nthat is vitally important. This bill does not adequately assure that. I \nam hopeful that is eventually what will happen. It is a commitment that \nwe cannot back away from. I am hopeful that we can take some steps, \nwhen the Congress comes back in January and February, to make sure that \nthe next Teamster election is in fact supervised.\n\n  But overall, as I have said, this is a very good agreement. It is a \nbipartisan agreement that deserves our support.\n  I again compliment Senator Specter and his staff and mine for a job \nwell done. I want to specifically thank Craig Higgins, Betilou Taylor, \nJim Sourwine, Dale Cabaniss, and Jack Chow of the majority staff and \nMarsha Simon and Ellen Murray of my staff. In addition, I want to thank \nBev Schroeder, Laura Hessburg, and Peter Reinecke of my personal staff \nfor their contributions.\n  Mr. President, I urge all Senators give wholehearted support to this \nconference agreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n[[Page S12086]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I know the Senator from North Carolina was \nwishing to speak.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I was hoping Senator Specter would yield time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will yield you time for Senator Specter. How much time \ndoes the Senator want?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. About 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I thank the Senator for his work on this bill. He has \neliminated funding for national testing as well as funds for Teamsters \nelections. He has preserved my amendment that would require the \nEducation Secretary to certify that 90 percent of the funds from \neducation go to students and teachers.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Faircloth pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1458 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, will the Senator from Pennsylvania yield \nme 5 or 6 minutes?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will be delighted to yield to my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Gorton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am going to vote enthusiastically for \nthis bill, the result of countless hundreds of hours of work on the \npart of the chairman and the ranking minority member, other members, \nand their staffs. It does make many, many decisions that are important \nfor the future of our country.\n  I am, however, deeply disappointed that one element in the bill that \npassed the Senate of the United States is not included in this bill, an \nelement that was vitally important and provided a vitally necessary \nreform for our schools. For decades now, Washington, DC, has assumed \nincreasing control over our local schools. Washington, DC has not, \nhowever, put its money where its mouth is. With Congress appropriating \nabout 7 percent of the money spent on education, we have allowed our \nbureaucrats to impose half or more than half of the rules and \nregulations that so often frustrate innovation and success in our \nschools. During the past few years, on the other hand, I have listened \nto countless parents, teachers and principals who almost universally \nagree that it is time for Congress and the President to restore the \nauthority that our teachers, parents, and local school boards once had \nto make decisions for our schools.\n  In September, I proposed a sweeping reform to improve education for \nkids in schools everywhere in America. That reform would have given \nFederal education dollars directly to local school districts so that \nparents, teachers and principals would have the money and authority to \nmake the best decisions for their children. They would have been \nempowered to determine their children's needs and to use their Federal \ndollars in a manner that is best for kids: For new schools, for lower \nclass sizes by hiring more teachers, to purchase computers, or whatever \nelse citizens in communities all across the United States decided that \ntheir schools needed. And they could have done it all without \nWashington, DC, having told them how to do it.\n  That sweeping reform is based on the simple philosophy that \nWashington, DC, does not know best. I believe that all of the laws \npassed by Congress and all of the regulations adopted by the Federal \nDepartment of Education have failed to reach their goals. I believe \nteachers in the classroom, principals in our buildings, and local \nschool boards and parents, will make better educational decisions and \ndo more to improve their own schools than will Congress or the Federal \nDepartment of Education.\n  For most of this century, Washington, DC, has been dominated by \npeople who believe that centralized decisions and centralized control \nexercised by Washington, DC, is the best way to solve problems, \nincluding those in the classrooms. Unfortunately, the approach has not \nworked. As Washington, DC, has taken power and authority from local \nschool districts, our schools have not improved. Sadly, old habits die \nhard. That belief in centralized power is still very much alive. When I \nproposed my amendment, every single Democrat in the Senate opposed it \nand the President vociferously criticized the approach of returning \nmoney and authority directly to our school districts. I suspect that, \nhad a vote been taken in the House, the result would have been almost \nthe same.\n  Recently, I attended a Senate Budget Committee education task force \nhearing, at which Carlotta Joyner from the General Accounting Office \ntestified that in 1997, $73 billion was distributed through literally \nhundreds of programs and more than 30 Federal agencies to support \neducation in this country. For a great number of those programs, there \nis no record of whether they have succeeded or failed, and in some \ncases no way of measuring that progress or lack of progress. The \nDepartment of Education did not even account for half of that total \ndollar figure. This complex web of education programs only serves to \nfrustrate the efforts of those who know best how to educate children in \nthis country--parents, teachers, principals, superintendents and school \nboard members.\n\n  Over the coming months, I know that many of my colleagues will give \nspeeches in their home States and will almost certainly be required to \ncover education. I remind my colleagues that when they speak eloquently \nabout local control of schools, they have all had an opportunity in \nthis body to vote for or against that proposition. The conference \ncommittee on this bill voted against it.\n  Finally, I want to let all of my colleagues know that the fight for \nrestoring the traditional role that parents, teachers and principals \nplay in education is not over. I intend to keep forcing tough votes on \nmy colleagues, tough votes that I believe will eventually lead to \nletting our school districts do what is best for our children--without \nbeing told by Washington, DC, how to do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The distinguished Senator from Minnesota, Senator Grams, \nwishes some time.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator controls 21 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. SPECTER. How much on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have 31 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I yield 5 minutes to Senator Grams.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I ask unanimous consent to be able to speak for the 5 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, will that be charged to the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, it will not.\n  Mr. SPECTER. In that event, would the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota speak on the bill and then ask unanimous consent to include \nit as in morning business? The Parliamentarian would like it charged to \nthe bill.\n  So we will vote at 2:30?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SPECTER. We would not want to hold up so many airplanes, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I just had a couple of statements I wanted \nto put into the Record for today, dealing with the action here on \nLabor, Health and Human Services, and also on another unrelated item \ndealing with the dairy decision in Minnesota earlier this week.\n  Later today, as noted, the Senate will complete action on the Labor \nHealth and Human Services appropriations bill which was passed by the \nHouse last night. I wanted to express my appreciation to Senator \nSpecter, chairman of the Labor, HHS Appropriations Subcommittee for \nincluding a 1-year correction of Minnesota's disproportionate share \nallotment, otherwise known as DSH. I also want to thank the conferees \nfor accepting this correction as well. Without this correction, \nMinnesota's hospitals stood to lose millions of dollars in DSH \npayments, due to an error on the form that the State filed with the \nHealth Care Financing Administration. While that error was corrected \nwhen the State\n\n[[Page S12087]]\n\nfiled an amended form with HCFA, the Balanced Budget Act did not allow \nHCFA to consider amended forms in determining each State's DSH \nallotment.\n  Again, I would like to express my thanks to our chairman, Mr. \nSpecter, and also Chairman Stevens for their assistance and guidance in \nfinding a temporary fix to this problem.\n  Mr. President, the Labor, Health and Human Services appropriations \nbill will buy some time for Minnesota hospitals and allow Congress the \nopportunity to permanently correct this unfortunate error.\n  Although Minnesota hospitals have received a 1-year reprieve, it is \nimportant that we permanently correct the DSH allotment error. It is my \nunderstanding that Minnesota was not the only State with DSH allotment \nconcerns, and those States will also need a permanent solution.\n  I look forward to next year when these problems might be addressed in \nthe form of a technical corrections measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12082-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12087]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            U.S. DISTRICT COURT CLASS I DIFFERENTIALS RULING\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, on an unrelated matter, I also want to take \na moment this afternoon to rise in support of the U.S. district court \ndecision that prohibits the U.S. Department of Agriculture from \nenforcing class I differentials when it comes to dairy and the Nation's \nmilk marketing order system.\n  The ruling states that the class I price structure provided under \nUSDA's Federal milk marketing order is unlawful. This ruling was made \nafter providing the Department three opportunities to justify this \nantiquated regulation which has, again, been found to be arbitrary and \ncapricious.\n  I strongly urge the Secretary to forgo any further litigation on this \nmatter.\n  Judge Doty's decision has confirmed what we have known all along, and \nthat is that the current class I price structure is unfair and that it \nmakes no economic sense.\n  The 1996 farm bill requires the Secretary to provide price structure \nand Federal milk market order reform. This process is currently moving \nforward, and there should be no legislative maneuvers to restore the \nrejected state of affairs. I will be guarding against legislative \ninitiatives put forth by regional interests which would attempt to \nrestore the inequities of the former system.\n  USDA and Members of Congress must move forward and cease to be \nhamstrung by arcane economic models. Traditional economic models are \nnot sufficient in constructing a dairy policy for the next century. The \nimposition of the 1937 dairy legislation on 1997 dairy economics is \nludicrous.\n  Today, we have heard from our colleagues from Vermont that without \nthe current system, the rest of the country would be at the mercy of \nthe Midwest for a fresh supply of milk. We are not asking for a \nmonopoly, only that the heel of Government be removed from our dairy \nfarmer's throats so that they be allowed to compete fairly.\n  There is no room for regional politics in Federal dairy policy. We \nshould not encourage inefficiency.\n  The United States district court has rendered its decision, and now \nit is in Secretary Glickman's hands to institute long-term and \nsignificant dairy reform which will restore equity to U.S. dairy \npolicy.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.

Mr. President, I thank my friend from the State of Iowa, \nSenator Harkin. I also thank the Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator \nSpecter.\n  This is a good bill. It is not an easy bill to write. Having been a \nmember of the Appropriations Committee in the other body, I know some \nbills are tougher than others. This is the toughest.\n  The committee empowered with writing this legislation entertains \nliterally hundreds of witnesses who ask for help in this bill. Some are \nthe most touching and amazing stories, as people come before this \ncommittee with a variety of different medical problems and ask for help \nin funding research at the National Institutes of Health. I am really \nencouraged that this piece of legislation increases spending on Federal \nmedical research projects by 7 percent. I wish it were a lot more, and \nI bet the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Pennsylvania agrees. \nNot too many years ago, we found that the NIH was only approving a \nfraction of those good research projects which should have been funded. \nThere just wasn't enough money there.\n  Anyone in this body, any member of our family, anyone listening to \nthis statement, either in the galleries or by television, understands \nhow vulnerable we all are to medical illness. There are times in each \nof our lives when we pray that someplace at sometime someone is \ninvesting enough money to make sure that the cures for these illnesses \nare found. This is the bill that invests the money.\n  People say, what do these people do in Washington that has any impact \non my life? We invest money in the National Institutes of Health to try \nto find ways to cure cancer, heart disease and a variety of diseases \nthat are not as well known. I commend my colleagues who work hard on \nthis committee to make it happen.\n  Another contentious issue in this bill is the whole issue of \neducation testing. I don't particularly like this bill's provision on \neducation testing. I see it a lot differently. I understand at some \npoint the debate has to end, and we have to move forward to pass the \nlegislation.\n  I believe in local control of education, but I think it is naive for \nus to believe that we should live in a nation where 50 different States \nset 50 different standards for scientific educational achievement. For \nexample, the kids graduating in Illinois may go to work in Iowa. The \nkids graduating in Iowa may end up going to Nebraska. The kids in \nNebraska may end up going to California.\n  The education standards we are espousing and the ones we are trying \nto make certain we achieve should be nationwide goals. Understanding \nthe achievement levels of our schools is the first step toward \nappreciating the good schools and improving those that aren't as good.\n  The city of Chicago is going through a dramatic change in reforming \nits public education system. The city of Chicago voluntarily signs up \nfor national testing to make certain that the kids coming out of those \nschools can make it wherever they happen to live. As a result of that \ntesting, the public school system of the city of Chicago virtually \nclosed down seven high schools within the last few months and said \nthose high schools just aren't meeting the basic requirements for the \nkids. They demanded that the teachers in those schools basically step \naside and only those who were competent were rehired. Others were told \nthey had to do something else with their lives. That is what testing \ncan give you, some objective standard to make a tough decision.\n\n[[Page S12088]]\n\n  The final point I will make in conclusion, I especially thank the \nconferees for including a provision that I added to the Senate version \nof the bill. Section 608 of this conference committee report includes \nthe provision which I added on the floor of the Senate which basically \nnullified the $50 billion setoff that was given to tobacco companies in \na tax bill that was passed a little before our August recess. It turned \nout the vast majority of my colleagues agreed with me that this was a \nbad provision, and we eliminated it. The conference committee has \nhonored that and kept it in the bill.\n  Let me say in closing that I hope as part of the tobacco settlement \nagreement, with the leadership of Senator Harkin and so many others, \nthat we cannot only do the right thing in reducing kids smoking, but \ncome up with the revenues to put it into things that are critically \nimportant, such as medical research, so that maybe next year when this \nappropriations bill comes to the floor, we won't be talking about a 7-\npercent increase in medical research but a dramatically larger increase \npaid for by the tobacco settlement agreement.\n  I thank the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from Pennsylvania for \ntheir fine work on this bill.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about our Nation's \ncelebration of Veterans Day next Tuesday. In doing so, I would like to \ntake a few minutes to tell a short story; a story that I think needs \nretelling from time to time lest we forget some of the history that \nmakes our heritage so special. Please forgive my use of a little \nartistic license for the sake of narration.\n  My story begins in the fall of 1947 in Birmingham, AL. Close to the \ndrug store where this story begins is a memorial honoring the \nConfederate Army's 10th Alabama Regiment. The men of this incredibly \nfine unit made a now famous charge up the slope of Little Round Top at \nGettysburg on a hot day in July 1864. Imagine, if you will, these brave \nsouls charging, without hesitation, bravely up that wooded slope toward \nthe Union's 20th and Maine, a unit known to many and commanded by Col. \nJoshua Lawrence Chamberlain. For many dressed in Blue and Gray, the \nlast steps they would ever take were made that fateful day.\n  This is not an unfamiliar story in war; men going away from their \nhome and their families to place their lives on the line for their \ncountry; taking each breath in combat and wondering if it would be \ntheir last. Mr. Raymond Weeks, one of the heroes of this story, knew \nthe horrors of war. He had just returned home from the Pacific theater. \nHe knew as well the trials and tribulations of fighting in a war and he \nknew too of wearing the title of ``veteran.'' His circumstance, Mr. \nPresident, was similar to that of my father, now deceased, who had \nlikewise just returned from the Pacific, to open a general store with a \ngristmill in the small community of Hybart, AL.\n  On that fall day in 1947, Raymond had stopped in his local drug store \nwhere he bumped into some of his buddies who had also returned home \nfrom overseas. Talk at the drug store turned to the upcoming \ncelebration of Armistice Day, started nationally just nine years before \nin 1938. You see, Mr. President, many Americans still remember when, on \nNovember 11 of each year, America and the world celebrated the signing \nof the Treaty of Versailles, the treaty commemorating the armistice \nthat ended the First World War on the 11th hour, of the 11th day, of \nthe 11th month of the year in 1918. Thus ended ``the war to end all \nwars.''\n  Yet, years later, World War II also stole the youth of many nations \nand many of Raymond's and my father's friends as well. Raymond Weeks \nsuggested that the group should ``do something'' in town to honor the \nmemory of those comrades who had fallen in battle. With that, this \nsmall group of men began planning a local celebration to honor not just \nthe veterans of World War I and the Versailles Armistice, but of World \nWar II, and American veterans of all wars.\n\n  On Armistice Day, 1947 the very first Veterans Day parade was held in \nBirmingham, AL. The parade drew such a great turnout that it became a \nyearly event, even though there was no official national recognition of \nVeterans Day at that point.\n  Over time Raymond Weeks formed a small committee and eventually \ntraveled to Washington, DC, to approach then Army Chief of Staff, Gen. \nDwight D. Eisenhower with their idea for a national holiday. History \nrecords that General Eisenhower expressed immediate approval and \nreferred the idea to Congressman Edward Rees of Kansas. Subsequently, \nH.R. 7786 became Public Law 380, a law which changed the name of \nArmistice Day to Veterans Day. Passed by Congress, the bill was signed \ninto law, ironically, by President Eisenhower on June 1, 1954.\n  What Raymond Weeks did was remarkable; even extraordinary. The \nVeterans Day Raymond Weeks helped to create does more, Mr. President, \nthan just honor those who served in America's Armed Forces. Veterans \nDay, as hosted by Bill Voight and the National Veterans Day Committee \nand still celebrated annually in Birmingham, AL, extends its boundaries \nbeyond those who fought in Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, and Desert \nStorm, it extends its reach to those who serve today in the ships \nconducting NEO operations off the coast of Africa, in the tanks manning \noutposts in Bosnia, to the sandy slopes of the Sinai, and to the cold \nridges of the DMZ in Korea. There should be no doubt that Veterans Day \nis a special day that pays annual homage to the ongoing sacrifices of \nour men and women in uniform.\n  While we were home, safe, these veterans were spread around the globe \nprotecting our liberty and freedom and our security. To them a great \ndebt is owed.\n  Veterans Day, Mr. President, acknowledges the responsibilities and \nthe special burden's that our Nation's men and women shouldered in the \npast. It acknowledges too the responsibilities and burdens of those in \nuniform today. And it calls on each of us to honor the legacy of \nveterans past and the dedication of today's military personnel, by \nrenewing our responsibility to ensure that our Nation remains the \nstrongest on earth, fully able to defend its just national interests \nwhereever and whenever they are challenged.\n  To all those great Alabamians and Americans who paid the ultimate \nsacrifice, to all those who survived, and to those who serve today, it \nis fitting that we pause with a humble and grateful heart and say thank \nyou for their sacrifices which have kept us free.\n  God bless the United States of America and may we be worthy of His \nblessing.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to comment \non the agreement that has been entered into on national tests. Do I \nneed to have time yielded?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, you would.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n[[Page S12089]]\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I appreciate the time very much.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                       Voluntary National Testing\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just comment on the agreement \nthat has been reached on the issue of national tests and is part of the \nconference report that we are getting ready to vote on.\n  After weeks of delay, and essentially a campaign of misinformation \nwaged against voluntary national tests, we now have an agreement that \nwill allow parents to know how their children are really doing in \nschool. And they will be able to know that as soon as the 1999-2000 \nschool year.\n  As my colleagues know, people who paid attention on this issue, I \nhave long advocated developing voluntary national education tests. And \ndespite the firestorm of controversy that has erupted here on Capitol \nHill in the last week or two, the vast majority of Americans have \nalways thought that this was a good idea. Why should we continue to \nfumble around in the dark trying to guess what is wrong with our \neducational system when we can simply turn on the light and see for \nourselves?\n  For these reasons, I worked with others here in the Senate to \nnegotiate the initial Senate compromise that we approved here by a vote \nof 87 to 13. I worked with my colleagues to ensure that the Labor-HHS \nconferees knew how important it was to have new tests that States could \nuse if they chose to as soon as possible. Here on the floor I have done \nmy best to describe the myths and the realities of what national \ntesting is all about.\n  As a result, I am glad to report that an agreement on moving forward \nwith developing new tests has been finalized.\n  In essence, this new agreement does four things.\n  First, it transfers control over development and administration of \nvoluntary national tests to the National Assessment Governing Board. \nThat was part of what we discussed and proposed here in the Senate \nversion of the legislation. And I think that was a very good proposal. \nSo I am very glad to see that in this final bill.\n  Second, it calls on the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a \nstudy about whether it is feasible to link State and commercial tests \nto the rigorous National Assessment of Educational Progress.\n  Third, it allows for development of new national test items aligned \nwith the National Assessment in the areas of 4th grade reading and 8th \ngrade math.\n  And, fourth, it eliminates any prohibition against future \nimplementation of the new tests without prior congressional \nauthorization.\n  In my view, there are two main benefits to this agreement.\n  First, transferring control to this National Assessment Governing \nBoard, NAGB, takes the same approach as the Senate compromise. This \nensures that the tests are controlled by an independent and bipartisan \nagency with a proven record of administering national assessments.\n  The second benefit of this agreement is that it removes any explicit \nrequirement for future congressional authorization before \nimplementation of testing. Making sure that the tests are available to \nbe used is one of the most important objectives here. There is no point \nin having shiny new tests ready and on the shelf if States and \ndistricts and parents who want to use those are prohibited from doing \nso. This agreement puts the burden of blocking any implementation of \nnational tests on those who would oppose States and school districts \nand parents from using them when they want to.\n  In my view, these provisions are all reasonable steps to take. They \nallow the process to go forward. They establish a level playing field \nfor authorizers and appropriators during any future disputes about the \nimplementation of national tests next year. And they provide \nreassurances against inventing a wheel that we have already invented \nbefore.\n  Let me make a few additional statements though about the agreement.\n  First, I want to clarify that, in fact, the agreement does allow the \ndevelopment of national testing to go forward this year. The \ndevelopment of fourth grade reading and eighth grade math exams based \non the National Assessment of Educational Progress will go forward \nduring the upcoming school year. Starting in the next fiscal year, this \nNational Assessment Governing Board can begin piloting and field \ntesting these items, which are necessary steps for implementing the \ntests in the spring of 2000.\n\n  Second, I would like to lower people's expectations about the \nproposed study of the feasibility of linking State and commercial tests \nto this National Assessment. That is because the current hodgepodge of \nState and commercial tests cannot replace a uniform national test and \nare almost certainly not comparably vigorous to the National Assessment \nof Educational Progress.\n  Few of the current State tests require more than 10th grade learning \nlevels. The percentage of students who score proficiently in the \nNational Assessment of Education Progress on any given subject is \nusually much lower than the percentage of students who pass a State \nexam or a commercial exam.\n  A series of studies and reports over the past two decades, have shown \nthat linking State or commercial tests is a costly and an uncertain \nundertaking. In the end, the National Academy of Sciences study will \nmost likely reiterate the need for a voluntary national test.\n  Third, I would like to say that it is unfortunate that the opponents \nof voluntary national testing did not allow the agreement to include as \nmany protections against discriminatory uses of the tests or bias or \nother safeguards for poor and minority students as were in the Senate \nversion of the test proposal that we negotiated here. Coming from a \nState with many poor and minority students, I am committed to ensuring \nthat any new tests are fair to all who take them.\n  Overall, I would have to say that this agreement brings us closer to \nthe day when we will have a national yardstick to measure students' \nacademic progress and gauge how well our education system is doing, and \nnot just the system overall, but be able to gauge how the system is \ndoing on a State by State basis or a district by district basis.\n  I know that there are those who oppose this effort who still fear \nthat voluntary national tests will undercut local control. I myself \nwould have preferred to move faster than this bill will move us. But I \nam glad that the commonsense potential of developing these measures now \nseems clear to all and that we can finally move forward.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senator Specter and Senator \nHarkin for giving education the high priority it deserves in the fiscal \nyear 1998 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education \nappropriations conference report, and I give it my strong support.\n  We all know the serious challenges we face in improving public \neducation and increasing access to college. Enrollments in elementary \nand secondary schools have reached an all-time high of 52 million \nchildren this year, and will continue to rise in the years ahead. Forty \npercent of fourth graders score below the basic level in reading, and \nfewer than 30 percent score in the advanced category. Yet our modern \neconomy and the country's future depend more and more heavily on well-\ntrained people.\n  This bill increases funding for Federal education programs by $3.4 \nbillion over last year to help provide young children with a good \neducation and help more qualified students go to college.\n  The bill provides a $1.5 billion increase in Pell grants to help an \nadditional 210,000 young people attend college, and increases the \nmaximum Pell grant from $2,700 to $3,000.\n  The bill increases funding for title I by $200 million to help \ndisadvantaged students get the extra help they need to improve their \nmath and reading skills.\n  The Education Technology Literacy Challenge Fund is more than \ndoubled, from $200 million to $425 million. The technology innovation \nchallenge grants receive $106 million, an increase of $49 million, to \nhelp teachers learn to use technology effectively and help \nschoolchildren prepare for the 21st century. The highly successful Star \nSchools Program will receive $34 million to continue to provide \neducational services to remote and underserved areas.\n\n[[Page S12090]]\n\n  The bill also increases Head Start funding by $375 million, including \n$279 million for the Early Head Start Program, to help more preschool \nchildren reach school ready to learn.\n  Special education receives $775 million more than last year to help \nmore children with disabilities get a good, appropriate education.\n  The bill also contains a compromise on the issue of testing. Despite \nthe efforts of many parents, schools, and communities to improve \neducation, too many schools in communities across the country are \neducating in the dark. They have no way to compare the performance of \ntheir students with students in other schools in other communities in \nother parts of the country. We know that by every current indicator, \nthe performance of American elementary and secondary school students \nfalls far short of the performance of students in many other countries. \nWe have to do better, and knowing where schools and students now stand \nis an essential part of helping them do better.\n  This bill addresses these issues by including a fair compromise on \nPresident Clinton's proposal for voluntary national tests based on \nwidely recognized national standards, so that parents, communities, and \nschools will have a better guide for improving local education. The \nvoluntary national tests will be designed to test fourth grade reading \nand eighth grade math--two basic subjects at two critical times in \nstudents' academic development.\n\n  Parents want to know how well their children are doing and how well \ntheir schools are doing, compared to other students and schools across \nthe Nation.\n  Voluntary national tests are an effective way to support local school \nreform, and I commend the conferees for their decision to move forward \non these tests.\n  This bill takes another step forward in higher education, too, by \ncreating the Emergency Student Loan Consolidation Act. I commend \nSenator Jeffords for his leadership in continuing to make paying for \ncollege easier for more students.\n  The Emergency Student Loan Consolidation Act reflects Congress's \nconcern for students who have been unable to consolidate their loans in \nthe direct loan program due to problems with the Department of \nEducation's contractor. The act responds by opening up consolidation \nunder the bank loan program to students who have direct loans. It does \nso without undermining the Department of Education's ability to pay for \nthe administration of the loan programs.\n  The act contains important nondiscrimination provisions that will \nhelp prevent lenders from choosing to allow consolidation of loans only \nfor the most profitable borrowers. We will have an opportunity to do \nmore on nondiscrimination during the reauthorization of the Higher \nEducation Act, but this bill is a good step toward making loans truly \navailable to all students.\n  The act also makes an important adjustment in the needs analysis \ncalculation, so that needy students will benefit more effectively from \nthe President's new education tax credits. Students who benefit from \nthe HOPE tax credit and the life-long learning tax credit should not be \npenalized in their eligibility for future Federal financial aid. This \nchange will help approximately 70,000 needy students, and it is an \nimportant part of this act.\n  In addition to these advances in education, I also commend Senators \nSpecter and Harkin for including increased funding for important \nhealth, energy, and biomedical research programs.\n  This year's spending bill provides more funds for the Ryan White AIDS \nProgram and the Community and Migrant Health Program.\n  It provides $1.1 billion in fiscal year 1999 for LIHEAP, which will \nenable this program to serve thousands of additional senior citizens, \nthe disabled, and working families by providing them with heating and \ncooling assistance.\n  And it provides an increase of $907 million over last year for the \nNational Institutes of Health. These investments in biomedical research \nhold great promise for the Nation to cure or prevent illnesses, and can \nalso be an important factor in finding a long-term solution to the \nfiscal problems facing Medicare.\n  One of the few major problems with the conference report is that it \nretains the ban on using any Labor Department funds in the bill to \noversee the forthcoming Teamsters election. That election is a rerun of \nthe 1996 election conducted under government supervision as part of the \nimportant ongoing effort to free the Teamsters from domination by \norganized crime. The 1996 election was cancelled because of fundraising \nimproprieties by both sides driving the election campaign. A Federal \ncourt has ordered a rerun of the election, and Labor Department funds \nshould be available to supervise it.\n  The conference report is also disappointing in its funding of the \nNational Labor Relations Board, which is frozen at last year's level. \nThis result will require the agency to lay off 50 employees, and will \nhamper its ability to process its pending cases. There is no \njustification for Congress to disrupt the Nation's industrial relations \nin this way.\n  There are many worthwhile provisions in this bill, and I intend to \nsupport it. But I hope that in action early next year, we can \nreconsider these unwise provisions and achieve a more satisfactory \nresolution.\n\n\n                                DIABETES\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to engage the distinguished chairman of \nthe Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, \nand Education, Senator Specter, in a discussion about certain details \nof the fiscal year 1998 funding for the Centers for Disease Control \n[CDC] and Indian Health Service [IHS] regarding American Indians and \ndiabetes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would be happy to respond to the Senator from New \nMexico about the intentions of my committee with regard to funding \ndiabetes programs for American Indians through the CDC. I am also \ninterested in his ideas about coordinating efforts between the CDC and \nthe IHS.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Earlier this year, I wrote to you about my interest in \nestablishing a national diabetes prevention research center in Gallup, \nNM.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes, Senator Domenici, I recall your letter of June 26, \n1997.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. In that letter, I requested $8 million for CDC to \nestablish a national diabetes prevention research center. It is my \nprimary intention to see this center begin a serious and vigorous \neffort to control the diabetes epidemic among American Indians through \ngreatly improved, culturally relevant diagnosis and prevention, with \npreliminary attention to the Navajo Tribe and the Zuni Pueblo near \nGallup, New Mexico. I believe CDC is the best agency in our Government \nto lead this very specialized task. I also hope to find better \nprevention strategies that will benefit the large Hispanic population \nof the city of Gallup, the States of New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, and \nCalifornia, and minority communities nationwide. I am also hopeful that \nthe prevention research conducted in Gallup would be a major benefit \nfor the large population of African-Americans who have this disease.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I certainly agree that prevention research is a very \nspecialized field that must prove itself to be culturally relevant and \nattractive, or it will be meaningless. It is also my understanding that \ndiabetes is rampant among American Indians and getting worse. The rate \nis almost three times as high among Indians as it is among all \nAmericans. The national rates of diabetes among Hispanics, Blacks, and \nAsians are also among the highest in the Nation, and are about double \nthe rate among Americans as a whole.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. When I held a hearing about the seriousness of diabetes \namong Navajo and Zuni Indians, and Hispanics in the Gallup area, I was \npleased to learn that there are relatively inexpensive ways--such as \nthe monofilament device for testing circulation in the feet--to detect \ndiabetes at an a early stage. We want to incorporate early detection \ninto our prevention activities, so that the Indian populations most \nsusceptible to this disease will have better diagnostic information as \nearly as possible.\n  Among the Navajo Indians, we are told that 40 percent of all Navajo \nIndians are diagnosed as diabetic, and this high rate is among known \ncases. The sad truth is that testing is very sparse in the remote areas \nof the Navajo Nation. Some experts fear that the rate could actually be \nnearly twice as high,\n\n[[Page S12091]]\n\nif better outreach were performed. I view the Gallup center as the \nnational center for finding better ways to improve outreach and \ndiagnosis among native Americans. The earlier a person knows about the \nonset of diabetes, the more can be done to prevent it.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I concur with the Senator's observations.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like my colleagues to know that I met with \nHealth and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala in my office about \nthe seriousness of this epidemic among American Indians. The Secretary \noffered her own plan to establish this diabetes prevention research \ncenter in Gallup, NM. She recommended ``a single $8 million per year, \nmultiyear award for a large-scale, coordinated primary, secondary, and \ntertiary prevention effort among the Navajo, who have a large \npopulation with a high incidence of diabetes and risk factors for \ndiabetes.''\n  Her support for the Gallup research center came as welcome news. In \nworking with the CDC, we have obtained an estimate of at least $2 \nmillion for the first year startup costs for this center. The \nSenate committee report on this bill specifically mentions the Gallup \nprevention research center. Would the chairman agree that the conferees \nintended to target at least this amount for the first year costs of \nestablishing to Gallup center?\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes, I would agree that the increase in funding for CDC \nfor fiscal year 1998, includes sufficient funds for this purpose, and \nthe House has concurred with the Senate's intention to do so. The \nconferees intend to increase both prevention and treatment activities \namong native Americans. The final bill also contains at least $2 \nmillion for CDC programs among native Americans. In addition to this \ngeneral Indian funding, I believe the Senate report clarifies our \nintention to fund the Gallup prevention research center in the first \nyear from fiscal year 1998 funds. This program would then continue as \nenvisioned by Secretary Shalala on a multiyear basis.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I Thank the chairman for these important clarifications \nof congressional intent in this final Labor-HHS-Education \nAppropriations bill for fiscal year 1998. I would like to add one final \ncomment about the Balanced Budget Act of 1998. In that act, signed by \nthe President, we included $30 million annually for the prevention and \ntreatment of diabetes among American Indians for the next 5 years.\n  As most American Indians with serious diabetes problems live on or \nnear the reservations, we have allocated $30 million per year for \nenhancing the prevention and treatment of diabetes through the Indian \nHealth Service of the Public Health Service in the U.S. Department of \nHealth and Human Services.\n  I have written to Secretary Shalala asking her support for partial \nfunding of the Gallup center from this Balanced Budget Act allotment. \nWhile I have not received a definitive answer yet, I remain optimistic \nthat the Secretary will see the value of directing the IHS to \ncoordinate its prevention efforts with the CDC through the Gallup \ncenter. Does the chairman concur with this strategy?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I commend the Senator from New Mexico for his thoughtful \nand coordinated approach to the problems of diabetes for minorities, \nespecially American Indians. I concur that CDC and IHS would be an \ninvaluable combination at the Gallup prevention research center.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chairman for his thoughts on this vital \ncoordination issue. I am convinced that the IHS could improve the \neffectiveness of its outreach and prevention efforts, funded in the \nBalanced Budget Act, by using the most current information and \nprevention strategies developed at the national diabetes prevention \nresearch center in Gallup, New Mexico.\n  Mr. SPECTER. As the Senator from New Mexico has suggested, I would \nhope that IHS would invite the CDC to participate in developing \nmeaningful prevention strategies at the Gallup research center with \nfunds from the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. I would add that the \nresources of the National Institutes of Health [NIH] and the National \nCenter for Genome Research would be other valuable resources for both \nthe CDC and the IHS to incorporate into their efforts.\n  I thank the Senator from new Mexico for his coordinated efforts to \nbring immediate assistance to American Indians, especially the Navajo \nand Zuni Indians in the Gallup area. I believe this diabetes prevention \nresearch effort in Gallup will benefit the Pueblo Indians, Apaches, and \nother Indian tribes nationwide.\n  I fully support Senator Domenici's efforts to start and maintain \nfunding for the national diabetes prevention research center in Gallup, \nNM, funded by both CDC and IHS resources as we have discussed.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the distinguished Chairman, and I look forward \nto working with him again next year to continue our progress in funding \nvital programs for controlling the epidemic of diabetes among American \nIndians and other minorities.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would like to engage the distinguished chairman of \nthe subcommittee in a colloquy regarding the statement of the managers \non fiscal year 1998 Labor Department appropriations. During the debate \non S. 1061, I brought to the attention of the chairman an important \nproject that is making a difference in the lives of poor people in two \ncities in my State and in many other cities across the country. The \nCommunity Employment Alliance [CEA], sponsored by the Enterprise \nFoundation, is working with community development corporations, State \nand local governments and the private sector to provide a range of \nemployment and training and job creation service to welfare recipients. \nI appreciated the support of the chairman in urging the Department of \nLabor to give full consideration for application by the Enterprise \nFoundation to provide funding for the Community Employment Alliance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I want to thank the Senator from Texas for all her \nefforts to gain the support of the conference committee for this \nimportant project and for the work the Community Employment Alliance \nand the Enterprise Foundation are doing in welfare to work. I am \npleased to inform the Senator that the statement of the managers \naccompanying the conference report includes a reference to the \nCommunity Employment Alliance and urges the Department of Labor to give \ncareful consideration to a proposal for funding.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference \nreport to accompany the fiscal year 1998 Labor, HHS, and Education \nappropriations bills, but I am also sadly disappointed in the actions \nof the other body concerning my amendment to clarify the family \nviolence option.\n  The conference report before us today in the result of a bipartisan \neffort that focused on the priorities important to American families; \neducation, a safe work place, biomedical research and disease \nprevention, child care, Headstart, and low-income energy assistance. I \nwas proud to work with my colleagues in producing this conference \nreport. I want to thank Chairman Specter and Senator Harkin for their \nwillingness to work with all of us in negotiating a final bill with the \nother body. I also want to thank both of them for including many of my \npriorities in this final legislation.\n  I am pleased that we were able to increase our commitment to the \nOlder Americans Act programs, breast and cervical cancer research, \nheart disease prevention, literacy, child care, Headstart, and maintain \na strong Federal role in education. I know that in a balanced budget \nframework meeting these priorities was a difficult task and am grateful \nfor the leadership shown by Senators Specter and Harkin.\n  While I worked to ensure the enactment of important increases in our \ninvestment in our future, I am sadly disappointed that this final \nconference report does not include my amendment to protect victims of \ndomestic violence and abuse from the harsh punitive requirements called \nfor in welfare reform. Despite a 98 to 1 vote in the Senate, \nRepublicans on the conference committee from the other body, refused to \nhelp victims of family violence from continued abuse. This is a big \nloss that will come back and haunt us as the States begin full \nimplementation of their welfare reform plans.\n  The Republicans in the other body seemed more concerned about grossly \nincorrect statements made by the\n\n[[Page S12092]]\n\nchairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Human Resources. It was interesting to see that the \nchairman of the Human Resources Subcommittee felt it necessary to \nattend the final conference meeting to ensure that there was no further \neffort to give States the flexibility that they need to truly help \nthose victims of domestic violence.\n  In a letter to the conferees, the chairman of the House Ways and \nMeans Committee concluded that the way to break the cycle of violence \nwas to improve the self esteem of moms; this could only be accomplished \nthrough work. This statement in itself explains the difficulty I have \nhad in getting this amendment enacted into law. There appear to be some \nMembers of Congress who firmly believe that domestic violence is the \nfault of the woman.\n  I will ask that this letter be printed in the Record so that the \nAmerican public can see how some Members of Congress view family \nviolence and abuse.\n  While I am disappointed in the lack of consensus on my amendment, I \nam pleased to report that as a result of the courage shown by the \nSenate and the public debate conducted on my amendment, the chairman of \nthe Human Resources Subcommittee in the other body has pledged his \nsupport for hearings on this important initiative. I am also inserting \na copy of his letter to me stating his intention to hold these \nhearings. I intend to hold him to this commitment and am hopeful that \nhearings will be held early in 1998. Depending upon the status of these \nhearings, I intend on maintaining my strategy of offering this \namendment to each and every appropriate legislative vehicle. I will not \ngive up until this amendment is adopted. The stakes are simply too \nhigh. The lives of too many women and children are at stake.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Committee on Ways and Means,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 26, 1997.\n     Hon. John Edward Porter,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, \n         and Education, Washington, DC.\n       Dear John: We want to draw your attention to a provision \n     added to the Labor, HHS, and Education appropriations bill in \n     the Senate that we strongly oppose. Senator Murray and \n     several others offered a floor amendment concerning domestic \n     violence that received nearly unanimous support. \n     Unfortunately, this amendment does not, as claimed \n     ``clarify'' a provision of last year's historic welfare \n     reform bill but instead would have the effect of gutting the \n     reform.\n       As nearly as we can tell, every Member of Congress and \n     virtually every American citizen abhors domestic violence. \n     Every level of government already has strong laws, including \n     criminal laws, designed to deal with the perpetrators of \n     domestic violence. Moreover, in the last decade or so, the \n     nation has made significant progress both in increasing \n     awareness of this serious problem and inventing both civic \n     and governmental responses to the problem.\n       But fighting domestic violence by adopting a national \n     policy of exempting welfare mothers, who may have been \n     abused, from the work requirements and time limits of welfare \n     reform is not a wise policy. First, we cannot understand how \n     keeping mothers dependent on welfare can help them achieve \n     independence from an abusive partner. There may be some \n     exceptions to the rule, but in the vast majority of cases \n     women who can support themselves and their children have a \n     much better chance of escaping an abusive relationship. In \n     recent years, Congress has enacted generous non-welfare \n     benefits including tax credits, expanded health coverage; and \n     more day care, all of which are designed to help women with \n     children become self-supporting. The domestic violence trap \n     can only be broken when mothers improve their self-esteem \n     through work. Thus, exempting these mothers from the work \n     requirements and time limits seems to be precisely the wrong \n     thing to do.\n       Second, states already can exempt 75 percent of their \n     caseload from the work requirement in the first year. Even \n     when the work requirement is fully implemented in 2002, \n     states will still be able to exempt half of their caseload. \n     If in some special circumstances a mother involved in an \n     abusive relationship would be helped by being temporarily \n     exempted from the work requirement, states have plenty of \n     room under existing law to provide the exemption. Similarly, \n     the 5-year limitation on benefits is drafted so that states \n     can exempt up to 20 percent of their caseload from the \n     requirement.\n       Thus, under current law, states already enjoy a great deal \n     of flexibility that can be used to address the needs of \n     individual mothers. To allow states to ignore all cases in \n     which abuse is involved is to invite them to destroy both the \n     work requirement and the time limit. We have seen numerous \n     claims that the original welfare reform bill intended to \n     allow states to exempt these cases without counting them \n     against the ceiling on work and time limit exemptions. As the \n     authors of the original bill and the bill finally enacted by \n     Congress and signed by the President, we want to clear up \n     this myth. Such exemptions were never intended. Indeed, every \n     time they have been proposed, we have fought them. Given the \n     widespread and widely recognized success of the welfare \n     reform bill, we believe a change of this magnitude would be \n     exceptionally destructive--especially when the justification \n     for making the change is so weak.\n       Finally, House and Senate rules prohibit legislating \n     appropriation bills. We all know that when there is \n     bipartisan agreement and the committee of jurisdiction agrees \n     with an authorization provision, we tend to overlook these \n     rules. But we are informing you in the most direct terms that \n     we strongly oppose this Senate action. If there is any doubt \n     about whether this provision will be removed from the \n     conference report, we would like to be informed at the \n     earliest moment so we can take this issue to the House and \n     Senate Leadership.\n       Thanks for your personal help and the help of your staff on \n     this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     E. Clay Shaw, Jr.,\n       Chairman, Subcommittee on Human Resources.\n     Bill Archer,\n       Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means.\n                                  ____\n\n         House of Representatives, Committee on Ways and Means, \n           Subcommittee on Human Resources\n                                 Washington, DC, October 29, 1997.\n     Hon. Patty Murray,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Murray and Specter: I am writing to you about \n     the Murray/Wellstone amendment concerning domestic violence \n     to the FY 1998 Labor, HHS and Education appropriations bill.\n       As nearly as I can tell, every Member of Congress and \n     virtually every American citizen abhors domestic violence. \n     Every level of government already has strong laws, including \n     criminal laws, designed to deal with the perpetrators of \n     domestic violence. Moreover, in the last decade or so, the \n     nation has made significant progress both in increasing \n     awareness of this serious problem and inventing both civic \n     and governmental responses to the problem.\n       The Murray/Wellstone amendment continues this tradition of \n     both drawing attention to the issue of domestic violence and \n     creating special conditions for those who have been abused. \n     Nonetheless, there are several procedural and substantive \n     reasons why this proposal should not be included in the \n     Labor, HHS appropriations bill. First, the provision violates \n     House rules against legislating on an appropriations bill. \n     Second, it is against regular order to make such significant \n     changes without committee input. Finally, the Ways and Means \n     Committee has never had a hearing on the Murray/Wellstone \n     amendment, so it is unclear whether this change is needed or \n     what its unanticipated consequences might be.\n       It is also important to note that, while the Murray/\n     Wellstone amendment would allow states to exempt an unlimited \n     number of victims of domestic violence from the welfare \n     reform law's time limits and work requirements, current law \n     already exempts 70 percent of the caseload from work \n     requirements and 20 percent from the 5-year time limit. \n     States already have the discretion to include any or all \n     victims of domestic violence under these exemptions.\n       Each of these factors argues against including the Murray/\n     Wellstone amendment in the bill currently before the \n     conference committee. However, as Chairman of the \n     Subcommittee on Human Resources of the Committee on Ways and \n     Means, I am offering to convene a subcommittee hearing on \n     this topic early in the next session, provided that the \n     Murray/Wellstone amendment is withdrawn from consideration by \n     the Labor, HHS conference committee. I would expect and look \n     forward to your appearing as the first witnesses at this \n     hearing.\n       I appreciate your consideration of this offer, and look \n     forward to your response.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     E. Clay Shaw,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to address a matter in the Labor-\nHHS Appropriations Conference Report that is of great interest to me. \nWould the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, Mr. Specter, be \nwilling to clarify a matter contained in the conference report?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would be happy to respond to an inquiry from my friend \nfrom Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, an amendment offered by Senator Kennedy \nand myself providing the Department of Education with $1.1 million to\n\n[[Page S12093]]\n\nbegin planning efforts for Nation's celebration of the millennium was \nadopted by the Senate during consideration of the Labor-HHS \nappropriations bill. These funds were requested by the Department of \nEducation and were to be offset within the Department. However, it is \nmy understanding that this language was deleted without prejudice \nduring conference.\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is correct. However, $1 million in funding was \nincluded in the Department of Education's program administration budget \nto be utilized for national millennium activities.\n  Mr. WARNER. Then it would be correct to say that while the Warner-\nKennedy language was deleted in conference, $1 million in funds will be \navailable for activities associated with the millennium through the \nDepartment of Education's program administration budget?\n  Mr. SPECTER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Chairman for his clarification \nof this matter.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \nhighlight language in the Senate's committee report on the fiscal year \n1998 Labor-HHS bill under the National Institute of Health's [NIH] \nNational Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases [NIAID]. This \nlanguage notes the significant research on emerging infectious diseases \nbeing conducted at the Public Health Research Institute [PHRI]. I would \nlike to clarify that PHRI is a component of a scientific research and \ncollaborative venture in New Jersey known as the International Center \nfor Public Health, located at University Heights Science Park in \nNewark. Furthermore, I would like to clarify that the intent of the \nSenate's report language is to encourage NIAID to give appropriate \nconsideration to proposals received from the International Center for \nPublic Health, one component of which is PHRI.\n  I would like to ask my colleagues Senators Specter and Harkin if they \nagree with this interpretation of the intent of the Senate language? \nFurthermore, I would like to ask my colleagues if they agree that the \nInternational Center for Public Health's efforts to create a world \nclass research and treatment complex to address infectious diseases are \nconsistent with the committee's objectives for the Department of Health \nand Human Services, specifically the NIH's NIAID?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am aware of this language and agree with this \ninterpretation. I appreciate my colleague's leadership role in working \nwith this important International Center, and I hope the NIH will give \nevery appropriate consideration to the Center's proposals.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I, too, appreciate the leadership of my colleague from \nNew Jersey on this issue, and concur with the Chairman that the NIH \nshould give appropriate consideration to proposals from the \nInternational Center for Public Health.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor key provisions of the fiscal year 1998 Labor, Health and Human \nServices and Education appropriations bill.\n  This bill is the product of a long, often difficult, process and, \nlike many of our legislative efforts, it is in no way perfect. However, \nI am particularly pleased with the $3.3 billion increase included for \neducation.\n  With this legislation, students, parents and schools across the \ncountry will see broad increases in Federal spending in key areas. \nFunding for education technology will double. Special education funding \nwill increase by $800 million to a historic high of nearly $5 billion. \nThe title I program, which provides disadvantaged students with \nremedial tutoring in math and science, will receive $7.4 billion. This \nbill also provides for the continued development of voluntary national \ntests in fourth grade reading and eighth grade math. While there was a \ngreat deal of negotiation, discussion, and compromise on this last \nissue, I am pleased that the final legislation does not set up any \nroadblocks that will block full implementation of this important \naccountability initiative in schools across the country.\n  This bill also includes new funding for young children. Head Start \nfunding will grow by $300 million, putting it on the path to serving \n1,000,000 3- and 4-year-olds by the year 2000. The Child Care and \nDevelopment Block Grant will also grow by $50 million to reach $1 \nbillion and provide working families with additional assistance in \nmeeting their child care needs.\n  On the other end of education funding, college students and their \nparents will receive substantial new assistance through this bill. \nFirst and most importantly, the Pell grant program will receive an \nincrease of $1.5 billion. These funds will increase the Pell grant \nmaximum to $3,000--the highest level in history--and will expand the \nPell grant program to assist an additional 210,000 students.\n  This last step is particularly crucial in my view. Earlier this year, \nI introduced legislation to better assist students by modifying the \ntreatment of dependent student income to ensure that needy students are \nnot penalized for working. This appropriations bill includes this \ninitiative and consequently will reach thousands of new students who \nwork. This appropriations bill does not fully accomplish the goals set \nby my legislation, but it takes the first vital steps, which we can \nhopefully build upon during next year's reauthorization of the Higher \nEducation Act.\n  This bill also includes legislation approved by the Labor and Human \nResources Committee last month to assist students in better managing \ntheir Federal student loans. This bill, the Emergency Student Loan \nConsolidation Act, responds to the recent shutdown of the Federal \ndirect loan consolidation programs by providing all student borrowers \nwith the option of consolidating their student loans into the \nguaranteed loan program. There had been some concern that this bill, as \nit passed the Labor Committee, did not have an appropriate offset; \nhowever, additional clarifying language is included today which will \nallow the administration to manage this offset appropriately. We also \ninclude another emergency provision which ensures that families who \nreceive a HOPE Scholarship will not be penalized for this scholarship \nin the determination of families' need for Federal student aid. It is \nvery important to America's families and college students that these \ntwo initiatives pass this year and I am pleased that their inclusion in \nthis bill today will make that possible.\n  Thus far, Mr. President, I have focused on what is in this bill in \nterms of education. However, I am pleased that one education provision \nadopted by the Senate was dropped in this final bill--the Gorton \namendment. This very destructive amendment, which I have strenuously \nopposed since it was first introduced, would have eliminated Federal \nfunding for school safety, character education, vocational \nrehabilitation services, Indian education, teacher training and \neducation technology. The conferees recognized that this policy was not \nfully considered by the Senate, as well as the appropriate committees, \nand took us in the wrong direction on education policy.\n  For all that is good in this bill, it is clearly the product of \nconsiderable compromise and is not the bill I would have written. I am \nparticularly disturbed by the inclusion of language expanding the reach \nof the Hyde amendment which will further limit the rights of Federal \nemployees in this important, personal area. However, on the whole, I \nbelieve this is a good bill for the families and children of America \nand will join my colleagues in supporting its passage.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry. Does Senator Specter have time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Specter has 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What time are we going to vote under the order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At 2:35.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself the remaining time that Senator Specter \nhas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S12094]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wish to applaud the subcommittee chairman, Senator \nSpecter, and other members of the Appropriations subcommittee for \nreceiving a consensus on this bill, and at the same time adhering to \nthe important provisions of the bipartisan budget agreement.\n  First, let me say this bill has a very exceptional provision in it \nwhich was not part of the budget agreement but, rather, was in the \nRepublican budget resolution, and that was to add $5 billion for \nspecial education for the next 5 years that was for educating children \nwith disabilities. The appropriations bill includes an additional $775 \nmillion for this program, the biggest increase in the history of the \nprogram. This is the program that many States were critical of our \nGovernment for because we started it and committed a share of the \npayment and we never lived up to our commitment in the shared expenses \nof the program but insisted that our rules and regulations be followed \nby the States.\n  Now we are beginning to catch up. Senator Judd Gregg was the leader \nof this from the State of New Hampshire, and certainly he will take a \ngreat deal of pride as this bill works its way to the President for \nsignature--$5 billion over the next 5 years for educating children with \ndisabilities.\n  Now, Mr. President, this bill has a lot of different provisions in it \nfor different parts of the U.S. Government, but the education funding \nfor the United States is almost all found in this bill. While we are \nnot a big contributor nationally to education--that is, the National \nGovernment--there are some programs that are noteworthy that we agreed \nin our 22-page agreement, the historic agreement of the President and \nthe Congress, to give high priority to, and I might say on all of these \non education, with our bipartisan agreement, this committee lived up to \nthose and funded them in every single instance, even though it meant \nmuch of their allocation of resources was being predetermined by this \nprevious agreement.\n  Let me give a few examples. Regarding Head Start, the budget \nagreement called for an additional $2.75 billion over the next 5 years; \nthe appropriations bill provides an additional $274 million for this \nprogram. For both these programs I have just discussed, the bill \nprovides more funding than the President's original 1998 budget \nrequest.\n  Now, looking at Pell grants, which many think are very helpful in \ngetting our young people through college--another very important \nbipartisan effort--the budget agreement called for an additional $8.6 \nbillion over the next 5 years and to raise the maximum Pell grant to \nstudents from $2,700 to $3,000. True to the other measures that I have \ndiscussed, the appropriations bill provides an additional $1.4 billion \nfor Pell grants and increased maximum grant awards from $2,700 to \n$3,000.\n  Finally, in the area of bilingual and immigrant education, \nparticularly difficult for our States, the budget agreement called for \n$446 million over the next 5 years, and the appropriations bill \nprovided $92 million of that increase in this bill.\n  Now, I realize many constraints were on this committee, and I want to \nagain offer my words of thanks and congratulations for their fine work \nand especially for their serious effort to uphold the bipartisan budget \nagreement. I believe we can all be proud of these particular increases \nwhich have such broad bipartisan support. From the standpoint of the \nRepublicans who were part of the bipartisan agreement with the \nPresident, I think today on education we are seeing some very positive \nresults from that effort.\n  Mr. President, I have changes to the budget resolution aggregates and \nAppropriations Committee allocation which are in order, and I ask \nunanimous consent they be printed in the Record.\n  There being no obligation, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12088-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12094-S12095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SUBMITTING CHANGES TO THE BUDGET RESOLUTION AGGREGATES AND \n                  APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ALLOCATION\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed immediately H.R. 2676, the IRS Restructuring Act of 1997, just \nreceived from the House 2 days ago, that the bill be read a third time \nand passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid on the table.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, may we have order in the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is not in order. The Senator from \nNebraska has the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, this piece of legislation passed the House \n426 to 4.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the Senate is still not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senate is not in \norder.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  This piece of legislation will do what I think everybody in the \ncountry wants us to do; that is, to change the law, and give the newly \nconfirmed Commissioner of the IRS the authority to run the agency.\n  There are lots of other changes in this piece of legislation. It \npassed 426 to 4 in the House. It has the support of the administration.\n  It should be taken up as long as we are in session. It was passed, I \nbelieve, almost unanimously once Members started to look at what is in \nthe bill.\n  It would enable the Commissioner to run the IRS, put together his \nteam, to hire and fire, to provide positive incentives to reimburse \nemployees, and establish a public board. It provides new accountability \non the legislative side. It provides a basis to evaluate complexity, \nand provide incentives to move to electronic filing.\n  Almost none of the things that I have mentioned, once people look at \nthe legislation, are regarded as controversial today. In fact, when I \npoint it out to people at home, they say, ``My gosh, I am surprised \nthey aren't already law.''\n  We have heard and continue to hear complaints from our citizens about \nthe way the IRS is run. It is time for us to give the Commissioner of \nthe IRS the authority to manage the agency and do the things that the \nAmerican people are asking us to do.\n  As long as we are in session, I hope again that Members on the other \nside will look at this bill. And I will say again: I hope they will \nresist. I understand the Speaker is going to still try, in spite of the \nnegative publicity, to get somewhere between $30 and $80 million to \nhave the IRS conduct a 14-question opinion poll about how the IRS is \nbeing operated. Our restructuring commission spent $20,000, and asked \nmost of these questions. If the IRS was doing this on their own, if \nsomebody discovered that they were going to take $30 to $80 million \ninstead of doing customer service, and instead of working with \ntaxpayers, conducting a poll asking a question, ``Do you think your \ntaxes are fair or unfair?'' and then have the questionnaires mailed \nback to GAO--Mr. President, again the Speaker of the House has \nindicated that he considers a priority issue the need to appropriate \nsomewhere between $30 and $80 million to have the IRS conduct a 14-\nquestion poll. That is considered a high priority.\n  I believe that if it was discovered that was in the bill, or that the \nIRS was doing this own their own, there would be 100 votes in this \nchamber against it--14 questions, $30 to $80 million. It is going to be \nmailed to every--\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, could we have order in the Senate? \nEverybody is talking all over the place. I can't hear the Senator, and \nhe is only a few feet away.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order. Will the \nSenator from Nebraska yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield for a brief question?\n  Mr. KERREY. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Senator Daschle and I would like to be able to go over what \nwe expect to be happening here the rest of the day, and tomorrow. I \nknow that Senator Roth wants to respond. Can we get some idea of how \nmuch time the Senator from Nebraska is going to have involved in this \ndiscussion?\n  Mr. KERREY. I would be pleased to agree to a UC to yield to the \ndistinguished majority and Democratic leader, and then give the floor \nback to me. I would be pleased to do that, if you want to do a UC for \nthat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12095-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

I know there are Senators waiting to get \nsome information on that. If the Senator would agree to that, then we \nwill return to his discussion to be followed by Senator Roth.\n  That would be my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERREY. The UC would do what again?\n  Mr. LOTT. That we interrupt at this point for us to have a colloquy \nhere about what the schedule be as best we can tell, and then after \nthat we return to the Senator's discussion uninterrupted with our \nremarks after his remarks to be followed by Senator Roth's response to \nthat.\n  Mr. KERREY. I have no objection.\n  Mr. LOTT. And morning business. We would turn to morning business at \nthat point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, is the Senator now \nsuggesting in his unanimous-consent request that we return to morning \nbusiness immediately following the discussion by Senator Roth and \nSenator Kerrey?\n  Mr. LOTT. That is what I am suggesting.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Then let me say, reserving the right to object, it is my \nintention to inquire about when the majority leader intends to allow us \nto debate and perhaps get some votes on amendments on fast track. We \ndidn't object to going to morning business yesterday. I guess we have a \nnumber of people who want to offer amendments on fast track. That has \nbeen put off and put off. In fact, the regular order would be an \namendment that I have pending on fast track. So if the Senator would \nsimply exclude the morning business request and then proceed with the \ndiscussion, I would like to try to have some understanding about when \nwe might entertain amendments on fast track.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me withdraw the last part of my \nunanimous-consent request so we would just be asking we would do what \nwe are going to do on the schedule and go back to this discussion and \nwe will talk further about that. I think the information we will give \nSenators will answer some of the Senator's questions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

For the information of all Senators, there is a move to \ncombine the three remaining appropriations bills into one bill and to \nsend that document to the House. The Appropriations Committee intends \nto meet on this immediately following these announcements. Those bills \nare the D.C.,\n\n[[Page S12096]]\n\nthe foreign ops and the State-Justice-Commerce bills.\n  It is the hope of the leadership that we could clear this bill for \npassage without a rollcall vote. Senator Daschle and I will be working \non both sides of the aisle to make sure Members understand what is \nhappening here, what is involved, and it may take some time for us to \ndetermine that. That could be as much as an hour or so. If we could get \nit cleared, then that would be the way we would intend to proceed on \nthese combined appropriations bills. Senators will be notified when the \nnext vote would occur, if one should be necessary on this.\n  Now, Senator Daschle and I were just talking. We think we should pass \nthis by voice vote, and we will encourage Senators to allow this to \nhappen. But if we can't get it cleared, one option we would have would \nbe to have this vote occur, and I would need to consult with Chairman \nStevens further before we do it, but one option, if we can't get it \ncleared in a reasonable period of time, would be to perhaps have a vote \non that issue tomorrow around 1:30 or so. At this point we just can't \ntell you with absolute certainty how we are going to proceed on that \nbill. Again, we will pursue the voice vote, and if we can't get that \ndone, then we will notify you when the actual vote would occur.\n  Would the Senator like to respond to that before we go to these other \nissues?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I concur completely with what the majority leader has \njust indicated. I think it is our intent to see if we might be able to \nproceed with an expectation that any additional rollcall votes would \noccur tomorrow. We can't give that assurance completely yet today. I \nwant to work with the majority leader. If additional rollcalls are \nrequired, we will give plenty of notice to all Senators. But our hope \nis that we can accommodate Senators who have schedules.\n  Mr. LOTT. One option, if the Senator will yield back so that I can \ncomment, Senator Stevens even suggested we might want to have another \nvote later on this afternoon or later on at 5, 6 or 7 o'clock. But we \nwill try to avoid that, and when we can give you some further \nconfirmation on when the next recorded vote will occur, we will let you \nknow--hopefully within an hour.\n  Now, I might also note that I am being told that an agreement has \nbeen reached on the FDA reform conference report, that papers are being \ndone now, and hopefully Senator Jeffords is working with all the \ninterested parties on that. Within an hour or so, we hope we could get \nthose papers ready and get that done on a voice vote.\n\n  The Senator is now saying we may have to have a recorded vote. If we \ndo, then we might have to look at doing that later on or maybe even \ntomorrow. So we will have to consult on that.\n  One other one we may try to do is adoption and foster care. We \nunderstand perhaps there has been agreement on that legislation in a \nbipartisan way. We are trying to clear that.\n  So that answers part of Senator Dorgan's inquiry. We have a couple of \nissues that we may have ready to go here pretty quickly. That is why we \nwould like to have the option to discuss with the Senator and others \nmoving one or the other of these bills or the conference report.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. LOTT. Other possible items for consideration are the Eximbank \nconference report, and Senator Daschle and I are working on the \nExecutive Calendar nominations.\n  I congratulate everybody for their cooperation on the Labor-HHS-\nEducation appropriations bill that just passed. The conference report \nthat we have been working on for weeks and weeks and weeks passed 91 to \n4. It just shows what can happen when we finally get around to taking a \nstand and getting a vote.\n  I would be glad to yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank the Senator.\n  With regard to the majority leader's request for rolling all the \nremaining appropriations bills into one vehicle, as the majority leader \nmay be aware, I had not wanted to object, but I reserve my right to \nobject with regard to the immigration issue pertaining to Haitians. The \nD.C. appropriations bill provides for special status or relief for \nGuatemalans, Nicaraguans, Salvadorans and Cubans and leaves out the \nHaitians.\n  Certainly, I cannot imagine that is a result we would want to see, \nand I urge the majority leader and other negotiators to see that that \nreal injustice is corrected as they discuss the final package for that \nlegislation.\n  Again, I, just like everyone else in this Chamber, would love to have \nthis go out on a unanimous rollcall vote or unanimous voice vote, but \nat the same time the gravity of the injustice in that situation is just \nso profound I would have to lodge an objection if that does not get \ndone.\n  Mr. LOTT. I appreciate the Senator's comments. She has been \ndiscussing it with Senators on both sides of the aisle. I just saw her \ntalking with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee at lunch. So \nI know she is going to find a way to address this issue in a way that \nshe would be comfortable with, and we will continue to work with her on \nthat.\n  Does the minority leader wish to say anything more?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it would be my intent at this time to put in \na request for morning business until the hour of 4 p.m. so that we can \ntalk about these various issues and see where we may go.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I could just suggest, the majority \nleader has noted that Senator Kerrey would like to speak. If a \nunanimous consent request is propounded for morning business, I would \nlike it--I do know Senator Dorgan has noted his desire to offer \namendments, but if morning business were to occur, I would suggest \nperhaps it occur after Senator Kerrey's remarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12095-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12096-S12097]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe we already had an agreement by unanimous consent \nwe would go back to Senator Kerrey, followed by Senator Roth. Others \nmay want to comment, but I would like to ask now there be a period of \nmorning business until the hour of 4 o'clock and Senators be limited to \nspeak for 10 minutes each.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, let me \nagain inquire as to when the majority leader expects we might be able \nto entertain some amendments that we might have finally considered. I \nknow that I was able to offer an amendment. I also know that Senator \nInhofe offered an amendment to the fast track bill. He may have other \namendments; I do not know. I know I have amendments and Senator \nHollings and some others have amendments they want to have considered. \nI have not objected to moving other business that is important to the \nSenate. I think it is important to get this business done. I have not \nobjected to that. But to put us into morning business is simply a \nsuggestion that we don't want to go to regular order, and the regular \norder is fast track. We have amendments, one pending, others wanting to \nbe offered.\n\n  So the majority leader, I assume, brought fast track to the floor of \nthe Senate because he wanted us to move and proceed to consider it. \nWhen he did that, I had hoped we would be able to offer amendments. If \nwe keep allowing the majority leader simply to put us into morning \nbusiness with intervals of other business he decides he wants to \npursue, we will never get to dispose of amendments on fast track. I \ndon't think that is an appropriate way to deal with fast track.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond to the Senator, I would \nlike him to allow us to get this time now and give us an opportunity to \ntalk with him and others. I should note that when we go back, of \ncourse, to this issue, I believe the pending amendment is the Inhofe \namendment. I presume there would be other amendments in relation to \nthat issue, maybe a second-degree amendment. I think maybe the Senator \nwould want to talk to his leadership and give me a chance to talk to \nSenator Inhofe as to how we would proceed on that, and we could use \nthis next 50 minutes to do that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, I would say the regular order would be my \namendment, and I won't object to this request, but I will at some point \nin the future if the Senator wants to continue to do this, because what \nthis will mean is the majority leader will bring in the body of work he \nwants to have done here.\n\n[[Page S12097]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Is that the commission amendment?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe the Senator is right, that is the pending \nbusiness, and perhaps we could do that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Perhaps the majority leader would accept that. I don't \nexpect that will be very controversial. At least we could accept one \namendment and then proceed to have another amendment laid down. I will \nnot object at this moment, but I say that, if we continue to do this, \nthe next time we want to go to morning business I am suggesting there \nbe an objection and we go to regular order and deal with the fast-track \nbill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Maybe we can have morning business until we do it all in \none final voice vote, everything left.\n  No, Mr. President, if the Senator would not object at this point, we \ncould have the pending debate, and we will talk with the Senator during \nthe interim.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will not object, and to the extent that all of the \nthings I mentioned are involved in the voice vote the Senator will \npropound later, I would be happy to accommodate that.\n  Mr. FORD. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, what is the \nunanimous-consent request before the Chair?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, could we have order?\n  Mr. LOTT. I don't know if I have the floor, but I yield the floor, \nMr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The order of business is that the Senator from \nNebraska be recognized, followed by the Senator from Delaware. Then we \nmove to a period of morning business until 4 o'clock.\n  Mr. FORD. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12096-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12097-S12103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IRS RESTRUCTURING ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Nebraska yield for a question?\n  Mr. KERREY. Sure.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator restate the unanimous-consent request he \nhad that was objected to?\n  Mr. KERREY. I asked the Senate to grant unanimous consent to proceed \nimmediately to H.R. 2676, which is the IRS Restructuring Act of 1997 \nthat was received from the House on Wednesday, that the bill be read a \nthird time and passed and the motion to reconsider be laid on the \ntable.\n  Mr. REID. I ask my friend, is that the same bill that passed the \nHouse of Representatives by a vote of 424 to 4?\n  Mr. KERREY. That is correct. Actually, I believe it is 426 to 4.\n  Mr. REID. Yes, 426 to 4. I ask my friend from Nebraska, is that the \nbill that created a new citizens oversight board?\n  Mr. KERREY. That is correct. It creates a public board that would for \nthe first time have oversight of the IRS, have the power to develop a \nstrategic plan, and make budget recommendations to the Secretary of the \nTreasury.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. REID. I ask my friend, is this the same bill that when the IRS is \nproven to have done something wrong, the person who is wronged can \ncollect attorney's fees from the Internal Revenue Service?\n  Mr. KERREY. That is correct. A taxpayer under this legislation, under \nthis new law, would have the power to collect attorney's fees and to \ncollect up to $100,000 if the IRS was held to be negligent.\n  Mr. REID. Is it true that this also creates a toll-free number for \npeople to register complaints against the IRS?\n  Mr. KERREY. That is correct. It does create a toll-free number and \npowerful new incentives to move to electronic filing.\n  Mr. REID. I ask my friend, is this the same bill that creates a \ntaxpayers' advocate office?\n  Mr. KERREY. That is correct. A new public board, in fact, would make \nthe hiring decision and create an independent taxpayer advocate. The \ncurrent advocate, as you know, is an employee of the IRS and, as a \nconsequence, although he has done a good job, in many ways has a \nconflict of interest because his performance is being judged by IRS \nmanagers.\n  Mr. REID. I also ask my friend, is it also true in tax cases that the \nburden of proof shifts? As I understand--and I am asking this question \nof my friend from Nebraska--it is my impression now that the burden of \nproof to prove yourself, in effect, innocent is upon the taxpayer. Is \nthat the way the law is now?\n  Mr. KERREY. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Would this law change that?\n  Mr. KERREY. This law would change it when it reached the tax court. \nIn those cases where the taxpayer reached the tax court, the \npresumption would not be on the taxpayers to prove that they are \ninnocent.\n  Mr. REID. I ask my friend also, during the time that the Finance \nCommittee held their hearing and during the time that the commission \nmet, is it true that there was evidence which came up to show that the \nIRS did have quotas for advancing people in the IRS hierarchy? And is \nit true that was against the law? It is against the law.\n  Mr. KERREY. That is true. In fact, the 3 days of hearings that the \nSenate Finance Committee held under the leadership of Chairman Roth \nclearly exposed incidents out there in violation of the law where \naudits are done, where collection efforts are made based on quotas, \nbased upon goals to try to go out and get individuals, regardless of \nwhether or not there was additional tax actually being owed. In \naddition, I would say to my friend from Nevada, the current law allows \nthe IRS to keep confidential and private all audit criteria.\n  Citizens may be surprised to know this, but if you ask the IRS today, \n``What are your audit criteria? On what basis do you evaluate the \ntaxpayers of Iowa or Delaware or Nebraska or Vermont or Mississippi? \nHow do you evaluate your audits? How do you decide on what basis you \nare going to proceed on an audit?'' the IRS will say to you, ``You \ndon't have a right to know. We won't disclose that information.'' The \nonly available information has been obtained through a woman at the \nUniversity of Syracuse through a Freedom of Information Act request for \nthat information. If you look at audit data she has collected, you see \nbroad variations, broad variations from State to State. In one State \nthere will be very high percentages of audits; in another, very low \npercentages of audits. It is very inconsistent and subjective. Under \nthis law, the audit standards and the criteria for audit would have to \nbe made public. It would, as well, create a mechanism for expedited \nanswers of Freedom of Information Act requests.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, if we do not pass this legislation, \nnow, early in November, until we come back late in January, it is my \nunderstanding there will be about 1.5 million Americans who will have \ndealings with the Internal Revenue Service where they are being \nquestioned as to whether or not their tax burden is appropriate. Could \nwe avoid that for at least a significant number of these people if we \npassed this legislation?\n  Mr. KERREY. The answer is absolutely yes. Indeed, I said the House \npassed this bill 426 to 4 on Wednesday. I came to the floor and asked \nunanimous consent to take it up on Thursday, did so again on Friday, \nand did so again on Saturday. I say to those who are wondering what is \nthe impact of this, what is the impact of delay, the Senator is exactly \nright. The Senator is exactly right. There are 135,000 notices every \nsingle day. Every single day, 135,000 notices are sent to the taxpayers \nof the United States of America. What do those notices say? They say: \nYou owe us more money.\n  Talk to somebody--I urge my colleagues, particularly on the other \nside of the aisle--talk to taxpayers who get one of these notices. Ask \nthem how much power they have. Ask them how they feel when they receive \none these letters. Ask them what kind of access they have to the IRS \nunder the current law. And they will tell you it's a terrifying moment \nwhen you receive that letter. You either pay it or you know you are \ngoing to spend an awful lot of money and an awful lot of time to \ndispute the dollar amount that the IRS says that you owe.\n  In addition, every single day, 250,000 Americans call the IRS. A \nquarter of them can't even get through. And of the ones that get \nthrough, 25 percent get the wrong answer. It is one of the reasons, \nwhen we did our poll----\n\n[[Page S12098]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. May we have order in the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will be in order.\n  Mr. KERREY. Unlike this remarkable poll, and I have to say I hope my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle will object if Speaker \nGingrich tries to allocate somewhere between $30 and $100 million of \ntaxpayer money for a 14-question poll, among which questions are: Do \nyou think taxes are fair or unfair?\n  Whatever you think about this piece of legislation--do it next year \nor do it now, on behalf of the taxpayers--I will guarantee if the IRS \nwas spending $100 million which could go to taxpayer service, which \ncould go to lots of other things, to do a 14-question poll mailed out \nto 80 million taxpayers, made available in every single post office, \nmailed out to every single provider, and then, guess what, then you \nmail it back, the taxpayer does, to the General Accounting Office to be \ncompiled--you are not going to have 250,000 phone calls every single \nday. You are going to have another 100,000 phone calls from taxpayers \nwho are going to say, ``What the heck does this mean?'' They are going \nto call their service centers.\n  So, while we are all sitting here saying we want the IRS to operate \nbetter, we have under consideration a poll that is going to make it \nmore difficult for the IRS to do their job because you are going to \nhave another 100,000 phone calls or so coming into the IRS office by \nconfused taxpayers wondering what this is all about.\n\n  Between the time that this piece of legislation was passed by the \nHouse--and it is right down here at desk. All we have to do is ask \nunanimous consent to take this up. All the Republicans have to do is \nnot object, allow the bill to be taken up. There have been 270,000 \ncitizens between the time it got to that desk and right now--270,000 \ncitizens got notices in the mail that they owe taxes. And another half \na million who have called the IRS, trying to get a question answered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask another question to my friend. Isn't it true that the \nemployees of the Internal Revenue Service, these people who work very \nhard every day--not the bosses, but the employees of the Internal \nRevenue Service--favor this legislation?\n  Mr. KERREY. Yes. In fact, not only does the National Federation of \nIndependent Businessmen support this legislation, not only do most of \nthe providers organizations that help taxpayers fill out their forms, \nbut the head of the National Treasury Employees Union supports this \nlegislation and has indicated that he wants to get it passed in a \nhurry.\n  Former Secretary of Treasury Baker and Brady and current Secretary of \nTreasury Rubin support this legislation. The previous IRS Commissioner, \nPeggy Richardson, supports this legislation, as does previous \nCommissioner Fred Goldberg, who is a member of the Commission.\n  You are absolutely right. The employees themselves are saying give \nthe Commissioner the authority. When Mr. Rossotti came before the \nFinance Committee, everybody was very impressed that the President \nwould send up an individual who had experience in the private sector. \nMr. Rossotti said, ``I am going to manage this agency.''\n  I said to him, ``You know, Mr. Rossotti, you are going to get over \nthere and you will have a lot of responsibility but you don't have any \nauthority. You can't even bring on the senior management, you can't \nprovide the private-sector incentives you are describing out there. You \nhave six legislative committees, three in the House and three in the \nSenate, with jurisdiction over you. You get through this next filing \nseason with no problems and life is going to be good for you, but just \nhave a little glitch between now and then and you are going to find out \npeople are going to call you up in a hurry and blame you for all the \nthings that you have no authority to do.''\n  So I hope my colleagues on the other side will look at this \nlegislation. The chairman has indicated he has objections, he would \nlike to add some additional things. Most of the things he wants to add \nI support. I would like to get it done. He wants to hold hearings next \nyear and do it. But these changes, for gosh shakes--if you look at the \nlaw as passed by the House, right down here at the desk, you scratch \nyour head and say: For gosh sakes, that's common sense. We ought to \nalready allow it.\n  So, on behalf of the taxpayers who get notices and will be calling \nthe IRS every single day between now and the next year, I hope, between \nnow and the next days, we can pass it. We could conference this thing \nin record time.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that everyone on this side of the \naisle, all Democrats, support this legislation moving forward \nimmediately; is that true?\n  Mr. KERREY. Not only is that true but my guess is, if it were to be \ntaken up, if no objection were placed against this unanimous-consent \nrequest, my guess is on final passage you would get 100 votes.\n  Mr. REID. So it's fair to say that virtually everybody in this \nChamber, Democrats and Republicans, support this legislation?\n  Mr. KERREY. I think it is fair to say that. There are some who will \nsay I want the board to have more authority, a few odds and ends done, \nbut I don't think anybody in the Chamber would object to changing the \nlaw to give the Commissioner the authority to manage this agency or do \nall the other things the distinguished Senator from Nevada has \nidentified on behalf of taxpayers, like providing a public statement of \nthe basis of audits--I don't think anybody could object to doing that. \nAnd anybody looking at it, I think, would say, ``Gee, that is not going \nto make things worse. That's going to make things an awful lot better \nfor those taxpayers getting notices and those taxpayers calling the \nIRS.''\n\n  Mr. REID. I finally say to my friend from Nebraska that this \nlegislation is good legislation. I am happy to be an original cosponsor \nof it. It is something the American people want and this Senate should \ndeliver it. The House has already passed this legislation. Would the \nSenator agree?\n  Mr. KERREY. I completely agree with the distinguished Senator from \nNevada on that point. Again, as long as we are in session, I intend to \ncontinue to come to the floor and ask unanimous consent to take this \nlegislation up. Not because I think it is controversial, but because I \nthink it is not controversial. We are hammering out in back-rooms all \nover this Capitol all kinds of deals to try to get fast track, to try \nto get things that are extremely controversial. This one is not. It has \nextremely broad support, a large margin of victory when it passed: 426 \nto 4 in the House. It is going to conference very easily. I have been \ndown here three times. I will continue to come down here and ask \nunanimous consent to proceed immediately to consideration of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Will the Senator yield for a couple of comments and then \na question?\n  Mr. KERREY. I will be happy to.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. First of all, when I was Governor of my State, one of \nthe first orders I issued was that any employee of the Arkansas Revenue \nDepartment would be summarily fired if it was found that that employee, \nwithout provocation, was rude to a taxpayer. And within 3 weeks we \nfired one employee, and it had an unbelievable impact on the conduct of \neverybody else. We had very little trouble out of the revenue \ndepartment during my 4 years as Governor.\n  No. 2, insofar as the Speaker's proposal to spend a minimum of $30 \nmillion doing a survey, sending out a questionnaire to the taxpayers of \nthis country asking how do you feel about your taxes and how do you \nfeel about the IRS, I can save him that $30 million. I already know the \nanswer. Every Member of this body knows the answer to that question. \nPeople think they are overtaxed and they think the IRS is filled with a \nbunch of arrogant bureaucrats whose whole purpose in life is to make \npeople miserable.\n  Finally, my question concerns this matter of attorney fees. Could you \ntell us what the criteria is in tax court? Let me walk through a case.\n  Let's say the IRS sends you a notice and says we have determined in \nlooking over your tax return that you owe us an additional $5,000, and \nhere is why. And you write back and say I disagree. At that point, the \nburden is on you to prove that you don't owe $5,000, and under this \nbill the burden will remain on you to prove that you don't owe $5,000.\n  If the IRS feels that they have won the argument, that you in fact do \nowe\n\n[[Page S12099]]\n\n$5,000, and they refuse to relent, the normal method for you to \nchallenge that is for you to pay the $5,000 and then go to tax court to \nrecover it. Is that a fair statement?\n  Mr. KERREY. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. That's true.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. My question is, if you do recover the $5,000 in tax \ncourt, are you automatically entitled to attorney's fees under this \nbill?\n  Mr. KERREY. You would be entitled to attorney's fees under this bill, \nyes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Let me ask you this question. Let's say we have a \ncriminal case where the IRS charges you with tax evasion, that is, \ndeliberately defrauding the Federal Government by evading or cheating \non your income tax return. Then the U.S. attorney's office will indict \nyou and haul you into court for a criminal trial.\n  At that point the IRS, of course, does have to sustain the burden, is \nthat not correct?\n\n  Mr. KERREY. That is correct.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Now, assuming that the IRS does not get a conviction in \nthat case, then is the taxpayer entitled to attorney fees?\n  Mr. KERREY. I actually do not have an answer to your question, as to \nwhether or not that is the case.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I don't know the answer either. I think under existing \nlaw, and certainly under the Hyde amendment, you would be entitled to \nattorney fees if you were--I forget the exact language, something to \nthe effect that if you have been frivolously or vexatiously charged and \ntried, you are entitled to attorney fees. But there is an existing \nstatute which provides attorney fees if the court decides that this \ncase should never have been brought, and several other criteria.\n  But I just wondered if this bill changed any of that regarding \ncriminal trials.\n  Mr. KERREY. I don't have an answer, specifically, to your question. I \ncan say that one of the things that we have done with this legislation \nis to make the taxpayer advocate more independent. Very often that is \nwhat is missing. Let's say that you are one of the 135,000, or you are \none of the 270,000 since we have asked for this bill to be taken up, \nwho get a notice and you disagree with that notice. There is a dispute \nresolution officer who works for the taxpayer advocate that you can \ncall up. You can say, ``Look, I have a dispute here. I think it is \nunfair. I would like to come in and talk to you.'' There is a mechanism \nunder the Taxpayer Bill of Rights II to do that. And what we do is make \nthat taxpayer advocate even more independent.\n  Very often what happens is the law requires the revenue agent to \ncollect, even though the revenue agents say this doesn't make any \nsense. There is no mechanism that enables the revenue agent to be \noverruled. What we do is, by giving that taxpayer advocate more \nindependence and more power and more authority to overrule, I think we \nare going to reduce substantially the number of cases where a person \nlooks at it and says, ``My gosh, why would you spend a quarter of a \nmillion dollars to collect 100 bucks, or something like that?'' These \nare cases that come all the time into our offices, and under the \ncurrent law we are simply not able to do anything.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Senator, if I could just make one last comment. This is \nnot in defense of the IRS, just simply an observation. The truth of the \nmatter is a lot of people resent the taxes they have to pay. That is a \ngiven. My salary is paid by the taxpayers, but every April 15 I get a \nlittle vexed, just like every other taxpayer does, about what I have to \npay. But having said that, I think it would be remiss if we didn't \npoint out that we lose $100 billion a year in taxes to the Federal \nTreasury by people who defraud the system, the underground economy.\n  Consider the fact that 1997, this year, the people of this country \nwill pay about $650 billion in personal income tax.\n  The corporate tax, as you know, yields much less than that. But just \ntake the personal income tax. If we are losing $100 billion from people \nwho absolutely refuse to live by the law--and that is who IRS ought to \nbe after, of course--that is one of the reasons the rest of us have to \npay more, because a lot of people don't.\n  I just wanted to make that point and to say I think the IRS generally \ntries its best to collect the appropriate amount of taxes. The thing \nthat gets all of us in more trouble than anything else is when honest, \nhard-working people are pilloried by a bureaucratic agent or auditor \nfrom the IRS. The agent may be right. It is usually not so much a \nquestion of whether the agent is right or not; it is their conduct that \nis offensive to people, and that is one of the reasons their public \nrelations is so poor.\n  Mr. KERREY. I appreciate both the Senators' questions and statements. \nAs a former Governor, I have commented right from the beginning that he \ncould fire anybody who was a discourteous employee.\n  Let me say again, for the record, we have a remarkable system of tax \ncollection in the United States that is largely voluntary. One of the \ndisturbing things about the current trend is we have gone from 93 \npercent voluntary compliance down to 83 percent in the last 30 years. \nThat means 83 percent of our taxpayers voluntarily comply, and they are \npaying higher taxes as a result of the 17 percent who don't.\n  There is a need to make certain there is a sufficient amount of law \nenforcement out there. The dilemma, though, is the current law, and I \nunderscore this because we are a nation of laws, after all. The IRS is \nnot a corporation. It is created by law, and it operates under law. \nNobody doubts if their workload went up as a result of the balanced \nbudget agreement we just passed. There is significant new complexity in \nthere of, what, four or five different rates you are paying for capital \ngains.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I think an additional 800 pages in the code.\n  Mr. KERREY. An additional 800 pages in the code. Lord knows, this is \ngood news to them compared to some years we don't pass a tax bill until \nabout now, until they are almost always into their filing season.\n  What we have to understand, what citizens need to understand is the \nIRS is managed according to law. So title I of this bill that is \nsitting down here at this desk passed 421 to 4 in the House. Title I of \nthis bill deals with management and accountability. Who could possibly \nobject to passing a piece of legislation that would give the \nCommissioner of the IRS the management authority to do what you just \ndescribed?\n  If the President of the United States calls up the Tax Commissioner, \nwho he just appointed and we just confirmed, and says, ``I just heard \nSenator Bumpers on the floor say something really pretty smart, \nunusual. He said that when he was Governor of Arkansas, he told his \nrevenue commissioner that anybody who is discourteous is going to be \nfired. I want you to do that.''\n  Do you know what Mr. Rossotti would say? ``That is a great idea, Mr. \nPresident, but the law doesn't give me that authority. I can't even \nhire my senior people. I can't manage this agency.'' The law doesn't \ngive him that authority. It is not a corporation, it is a creature of \nlaw, and we have written this law so as to confine and make it \ndifficult for the Commissioner to do the job.\n  You would think the question the Senator from Nevada asked earlier, \nif he is going to have this new authority to hire and fire, certainly \nthe employees must be against that. Absolutely not. The Treasury \nEmployees Union supports this legislation. Why? They know the \nCommissioner can't manage the agency. They know the new provisions not \nonly to manage the agency but to provide accountability and oversight, \nboth with a new public board and with a restructured legislative \noversight process, is necessary, is needed, in order to get shared \nconsensus on what the strategic plan is going to be.\n  That is what has been failing over the years. That is what has been \nmissing over the years. By the way, I have only been here 8 years, but \nI have never heard a Commissioner get up during the middle of a tax \ndebate and say, ``Gee, Mr. President, that's a great tax idea you \nhave,'' or ``Senator'' whoever, ``that's a great tax idea you have, but \nthis is what it is going to cost the taxpayer to comply.''\n  The taxpayers already spend $200 billion a year--$200 billion a \nyear--just to fill out the forms. You say everybody in this body ought \nto be for simplification. I think the tax bill passed 90-some to 8. I \nknow I voted for it. I think the\n\n[[Page S12100]]\n\ndistinguished Senator from Arkansas did not, so he can reclaim the \nfloor and tell me what a fool I was, talking about simplification out \nof one side of my mouth and out of the other side of my mouth I voted \nfor something that creates complexity.\n  For the first time, we give the Commissioner the authority to be at \nthe table when tax law is written for the taxpayer and say, ``This is \nwhat it is going to cost the taxpayer, this is what they are going to \nhave to do to comply, Mr. President, or Mr. Chairman, of whatever.''\n  We would give under this law the Commissioner not just the authority \nto manage, not just a restructured public board that would give the \ncitizens a view of what is going on inside this agency and \nrestructuring Congress so there is more consistent oversight.\n  The wonderful hearings the Finance Committee had, I was shocked to \nfind out that was the first time in 20 years where the full committee \nhad hearings of that kind. Some people criticize us saying we bash the \nIRS. I guess once every 20 years is all we are supposed to do.\n  The law is what dictates what the IRS can and cannot do. The law \ndoes. We can't bash the employees, the managers of the IRS on the one \nhand while on the other hand we refuse to take up a piece of \nlegislation that would give the Commissioner the authority to do \neverything that we say we want the Commissioner to do.\n  So, as I said, it has been since Wednesday that the bill got down \nthere. I have done this now three times on 3 straight days, and in that \ntime, a quarter of a million taxpayers have received notices in the \nmail: ``Dear Mr. and Mrs. Smith, you owe us X amount of dollars.'' \nAnother half a million people have called up their IRS service center \nor their IRS office and tried to get a question answered and haven't \nbeen able to do so.\n  Again, I underscore, I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nunderstand that the Speaker may be successful in getting $30 million, \nup to $100 million of taxpayer money allocated to do a 14-question \npoll. If you look at these questions, you would say, ``My gosh, we can \nanswer those questions without spending $30 to $80 million of \ntaxpayers' money to get answers that are so obvious it is embarrassing \nto even ask them, even if it were for free.''\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield without losing his right to floor?\n  Mr. KERREY. I will be pleased to yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, is the Senator aware that you can do a \nnationwide poll within 3 to 4 percentage points for under $50,000? Is \nthat not correct?\n  Mr. KERREY. Indeed, the restructuring commission did a poll for \n$20,000.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator is aware that we \nseem to go off on things that are not very urgent, whereas we don't \ntake time for things that are urgent.\n  For example, the nomination of Bill Lann Lee. All the members of the \nJudiciary Committee on this side of the aisle have asked the chairman \nfor another hearing on Bill Lann Lee, because it is obvious from the \ndebate we had on Thursday in the committee that misstatements of facts \nhave been used, distortion of his record have been used. We find that \npeople supposedly opposing Bill Lann Lee, in fact, support him. We find \nthe cases in which he was involved were misconstrued.\n  So I just mention this, if we want to do something worthwhile, then I \nhope the Judiciary Committee and the chairman will stop refusing to \nhave another hearing and will listen to all of us who have asked for \nanother hearing out of fairness to a man who has been much maligned.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from Nebraska and yield back to him \nto answer the question.\n  Mr. KERREY. What was the question again?\n  Mr. President, I hope that in the next day or two, while we are \ndeliberating in this world's greatest deliberative body, resolving all \nthe terrible conflicts we have on a variety of things, I hope we are \nable to get consideration of this legislation. I believe it will pass \nalmost unanimously, if not unanimously, in the Senate. I believe it \ncould be conferenced very, very quickly with the House and be on to the \nPresident.\n  I think all of us, once it is passed and signed by the President, \nwill feel glad that we changed the law to give the Commissioner the \nkind of authority that the Commissioner is going to need to manage this \nrather difficult and troubled agency.\n  I thank, again, my very patient chairman for waiting for this \nopportunity to respond. I appreciate, again, his leadership in \nconducting 3 days of public hearings, piercing the 6103 veil to be able \nto see inside this agency even further than what the restructuring \ncommission did. I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this is the third day in a row that the \nSenator from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey, has asked for a unanimous-\nconsent agreement to pass the House IRS restructuring bill. And for the \nthird day in a row, I have, again, objected.\n  Moving this bill today by unanimous consent is the politically \nexpedient thing to do. It is the easy thing to do, and if we approve \nthis legislation now, we could all go home and try to convince our \nconstituents that we solved all the problems with the IRS and they \nwouldn't have to worry again.\n  But this would not be true. This bill, while it is a good start, does \nnot address the very egregious problems that the Senate Finance \nCommittee exposed in our September hearings. The most significant \nreform in this bill is the creation of an oversight board. But, Mr. \nPresident, the board does not have the power to look at audit and \ncollection issues where the most help is needed for the taxpayer. It \nfalls short on many accountability issues that were raised at our \nhearings, basic issues such as requiring employees to sign \ncorrespondence to taxpayers. It does not alter the power that agents \nhave to abusively slap liens and levies on taxpayers. It does not \nensure taxpayers their due-process rights.\n\n  Those are only a few of the missing links. The restructuring \ncommission and the Ways and Means Committee did good work, but what \nthey have done is only a beginning. We need to go further.\n  Some have said let's pass this now and then come back and do more \nnext year. Well, Mr. President, we know where that will lead. If we \npass this reform legislation, legislation that even Senator Kerrey \nadmits has important omissions, those who are not anxious to pass it \nwill rise up and cry that we have already passed reform legislation. \nWhen we attempt to strengthen it, they will say that we need no further \nreform or that we must give this effort a few years to see that it \nworks. The truth is, we will basically get only one real chance to \nreform the IRS, and for the taxpayer, we must get it right. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. KERREY. I want to respond, and then I will get out of here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, again, I want to praise the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee for the hearings and the chance given to this. I \nrespectfully disagree. I don't think we will just get one bite of the \napple. I believe Majority Leader Lott and the Speaker are committed to \ngoing further. Both of them have talked especially about the need to \nsimplify the Tax Code. I would be surprised if either one of them would \nobject to some of the additional things that Chairman Roth has \nindicated that he wants to address.\n  I just say very respectfully on behalf of the taxpayers who are not \ngoing to have an agency that is managed well, this is not just a public \nboard. Title I does change the way that oversight occurs, both on the \nlegislative and on the executive side. There is no question that that \nchange is important. But I believe that the most important piece of \nthis legislation is giving the Commissioner the authority under the law \nto manage the agency. That is the most important thing that is missing \ntoday.\n  Second, I think it is not a small item to say that for the first \ntime, the American people will have an agency that will be required \nunder the law to provide them the audit standards. Why\n\n[[Page S12101]]\n\ndo you audit a certain way in Nebraska, a certain way in Iowa and a \ncertain way in all the other States?\n  What is the basis of the audits?\n  Today, the IRS, under the law--they don't withhold it because they \nare being ornery or don't withhold it because they just don't want to \ngive it to us. The law says: Do not give it. The law says: Do not \nprovide it publicly.\n  It is not a small item to provide to the taxpayers public \ninformation, to give them a window on why audits are done, and what is \nthe standard to which audits occur. It is not a small item to shift to \nthe taxpayer additional power and give the taxpayer advocate the kind \nof independence that the taxpayers themselves have asked for over and \nover and over.\n  We had 12 days of public hearings. The congressionally mandated \nrestructuring commission that Congressman Portman and I chaired, during \nthat we heard over and over and over that the No. 1 problem is the \nlaw--the law in regards to complexity, the law in regards to power, the \nlaw in regards to oversight, the law in regards to management.\n  This process started clear back in 1995 when we discovered that \nthrough a GAO audit that nearly $3.5 billion of the taxpayer money had \nbeen wasted on a taxpayer modernization system. Why? Because the IRS \nand the Congress don't have a mechanism where they can reach consensus \non a strategic plan. And without a strategic plan, no matter what you \ndid with technology, you are apt to spend money incorrectly.\n  So this process began over 2 years ago and has deliberated that \nentire time. And I have to say, I am not going to go home--if this \npiece of legislation were to be enacted--and I intend to come down \nagain and ask unanimous consent so that it can be taken up. It is lying \nright there at the table. It is not one of these controversial things \nthat we are debating, trying to get done, so we can get out of here. \nThis one is going to pass with a big margin.\n  I don't have to go home and say it solves every problem. I don't have \ngo home and say we have solved every education problem because we just \npassed Labor-HHS. We know there is still work to be done next year. We \nknow there is still work to be done in the defense authorization bill. \nWe didn't hold it up because we said, ``Gosh, we've got to solve every \nproblem before we enact this legislation.'' We understand--I hope we \nunderstand that our best course is to try to make incremental progress, \ndo those things where Republicans and Democrats know that change in the \nlaw will improve the operation of some agency of Government.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KERREY. I will be pleased to.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Is the Senator aware of any voices in opposition \nor people who are not anxious to pass this bill? It passed \noverwhelmingly in the House. And it is my understanding and impression \nfrom this Chamber that just about everybody wants to have an \nopportunity to pass this legislation or to vote on IRS reform sooner \nrather than later.\n  Is the Senator aware of any group or organizations or individuals who \nhave reached out and said, ``No, no, we don't want to reform the IRS''?\n  Mr. KERREY. No. Indeed, it is endorsed by almost every organization \noutside of the Government that has contact with the IRS. The National \nFederation of Independent Businessmen supports this legislation, as \nwell as the National Treasury Employees Union supports this \nlegislation. The accountants support the legislation. The enrolled \nagents support the legislation. I mean, groups that deal daily with the \nIRS are asking the Congress to change the law.\n  There have been objections raised that it doesn't do something in \naddition; but, again, we can do all of that. We do not have to get \nevery single thing done in order to change the law if we know that the \nchange in the law will improve the operational efficiency of some \nagency of Government, especially one that sends out 135,000 notices \nevery single day to taxpayers that they owe additional money.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Am I correct in my impression that even the \nTreasury Department has endorsed or embraced the recommendations of the \nCommission that are represented in this IRS restructuring bill?\n  Mr. KERREY. The Treasury Department and the administration support \nthe bill that is lying right down there, that if there was no objection \nwe would take up immediately here and pass in the Senate as well. Not \nonly does the Treasury support it, but former Treasury Secretary Brady, \nformer Treasury Secretary Baker, former Commissioner Richardson, and \nformer Commissioner Goldberg.\n  I mean, everybody that has looked at the law, they can say it could \ngo further, do additional things, but nobody has lodged an argument \nthat says the changes in this law would not stand a very good chance of \nimproving the operational efficiency experienced by taxpayers who \nreceive notices every day and by taxpayers who have questions and call \nup the IRS and try to get those questions answered.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. We have on average in my State of Illinois, 33,457 \ntax returns that will be audited in the next year. I know there are \n30,000 such audits pending in my home State. And it just seems to me \nthat to the extent that this legislation provides some relief to \ntaxpayers, and justice to taxpayers, that the delay that is being \nsuggested here in passing the legislation denies them that justice. And \nthat expression ``justice delayed is justice denied''--that we really \ndo put in jeopardy the rights that we, I think, all recognize that \npeople ought to have as citizens of this great country.\n  Mr. KERREY. Right.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. In relation to what is supposed to be a service \nfor Internal Revenue, that justice that is due those taxpayers may well \nbe denied by virtue of the delay in calling up this legislation.\n  Mr. KERREY. I could not agree with you more. There are actually \n800,000 notices every single year of audits--excuse me, every month \nthat goes out to----\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. That is 800,000?\n  Mr. KERREY. Yes, 800,000 a month of contacts to the IRS or audits or \nmatters that are almost as serious as an audit that goes out to some \ntaxpayers. There is no question, if we take this bill up that is lying \nright down there now that passed 421-4--probably pass here 100-0--there \nis no question that all of those taxpayers would have more power.\n  They may still not like the outcome. They may have to pay more taxes, \nand not like it, but they would have a lot more power, a much more \nefficient agency, and a much more happy ending as a consequence.\n  There are things that the IRS does that they ought not be required \nunder the law to do, that nobody says they ought to be doing. Though I \nsay again, the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth of \nDelaware, has quite accurately said, there are additional things we \ncould do. But, for gosh sakes, given the burden the taxpayers have, \ngiven the difficulty they have, and given the broad support, after 12 \npublic hearings, and after thousands of meetings with IRS employees and \nprovider groups in the private sector, private sector companies that \nare offering competitive services, other nations' governments that have \nhad similar problems that have gone through the similar process of \ntrying to improve the operation of their tax collection agency--this is \nnot something that was put together in a couple weeks' time in response \nto a problem identified.\n  This has been something that has been debated well over a year and \nhas broad bipartisan support and would unquestionably, for every \ntaxpayer out there that might receive an audit or might receive a \ncollection notice or might have to call the IRS and get a question \nanswered--every single one of them would benefit if we could just pass \nthis law.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I serve, along with the Senator from Nebraska and \nthe Senator from Florida, on the Finance Committee. I was just \ndelighted that the chairman convened the hearings on the IRS abuses. We \nheard any number of horror stories in those hearings. It is my \nunderstanding that under this legislation a taxpayer who had gone \nthrough an audit or set of investigations or prosecutions, that came \nout on the other end of the process absolved of any error of even \nwrongdoing, that that taxpayer would be able to, at least, recoup not \nall but\n\n[[Page S12102]]\n\nsome of the expenses associated with defending the integrity of their \nvoluntary compliance with the Tax Code.\n\n  Mr. KERREY. That is correct. They would get their attorney fees paid \nup; and if there was negligence, up to $100,000. And we establish \nassistance centers out there for the first time for taxpayers who are \nstruggling to get questions answered.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. For those taxpayers where it might be just a \nmistake--their Social Security number got mixed up or the name was not \nright, whatever--those assistance centers would then provide them with \nan opportunity again to have a better relationship with the service \nthat the IRS is supposed to provide.\n  Mr. KERREY. That is correct. One of the things that this law does in \ntitle II is deal with a new trend that all of us understand, which is \nelectronic commerce. We see a lot of electronic commerce developing out \nthere in the private sector. The IRS has been struggling to get \nelectronic filing up and online.\n  The significance of it is that when you file electronically, the \nerror rate is less than 1 percent. Error is real money. You make a \nmistake on the Government side with a tax claim, and it could end up in \ncourt for years and years and years and cost the taxpayer and the \nGovernment tremendous amounts of money. So errors are real money. In \nthe paper world, the rate of error is 25 percent.\n  So we provide both incentives and resources to get to a much higher \nnumber of electronic filings which I think for taxpayers who pay to run \nthe IRS, as well as taxpayers who are sending their money, is a \ntremendously important change in the law.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Is it the Senator's impression that, along with \nputting some real teeth into taxpayer rights, that this legislation \nprovides--and, again, we could do more in other legislation--but this \nlegislation puts real teeth in taxpayer rights, and that it might also \nhave a beneficial effect in terms of the culture or the climate of the \nIRS?\n  For example, we heard in the hearings that they had quotas. They were \nnot official quotas but unofficial quotas. That this might affect the \nculture in the way that the IRS viewed its mission and viewed its \nresponsibility to taxpayers. Is it the Senator's impression that this \nlegislation will help move that culture in the direction of a service \nthat is more understanding of its obligations and responsibilities to \nthe American people?\n  Mr. KERREY. No question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 10 minutes have expired. The Senator from \nIllinois had 10 minutes, and it has expired. We are in morning \nbusiness.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I did not ask for time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was a request.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. For me?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In morning business.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. No, sir. I am in the process of questioning the \nSenator who has--I asked the Senator to yield for questions. I asked my \nlast question. If he would answer it. I was not speaking in morning \nbusiness under the 10-minute rule.\n  Mr. KERREY. The Senator is right. You are absolutely right. The \nculture, though, is not going to change at the IRS until we give the \nIRS Commissioner the management authority the manager needs to be able \nto run the agency with performance that is based upon something other \nthan these quotas that have been set up. Although it has been a \nrelatively small number of instances where we identified them, it \nstill--relatively small--it is one too many.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I stand before you today in support \nof Senator Bob Kerrey's request to pass IRS reform legislation before \nCongress begins recess.\n  I along with all of the Senate Democrats have signed onto a letter \nurging Senator Lott to bring up legislation to reform the IRS this \nyear. I support IRS reform and believe that there should be no further \ndelay in beginning the process of change. I am a cosponsor of S. 1096, \nthe IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1997, and believe that the \nSenate should act on the House-passed version H.R. 2676. There are 35 \nMembers of the Senate that are cosponsors of this bill and of those, 14 \nMembers are on the Senate Finance Committee.\n  The House of Representatives has already acted on November 5, 1997, \nby a vote of 425 to 4 to overwhelmingly pass H.R. 2676, the legislation \nthat would overhaul the way the IRS operates. We should too.\n  It has been 40 years since Congress and the President have considered \nsignificant reforms to the Internal Revenue Service. With this bill, \nthere is a historic opportunity to overhaul the IRS and transform it \ninto an efficient, modern, and responsive agency. The IRS interacts \nwith more citizens than any other Government agency or private sector \nbusiness in America and collects 95 percent of the revenue needed to \nfund the Federal Government. Congress and the President owe it to the \nAmerican public to seize this opportunity and pass this legislation as \nsoon as possible.\n  S. 1096 was introduced in the Senate on July 31, 1997, by Senator \nKerrey and Senator Grassley. The Senate Finance Committee has had 4 \nmonths to take up this legislation and did not. Why?\n  Congress created the National Commission on Restructuring the \nInternal Revenue Service on September 30, 1996, which studied the IRS \nfor a year. Seventeen Commission members and professional staff: Five \nappointed by the President, four appointed by the majority leader of \nthe Senate, two appointed by the minority leader of the Senate, four \nmembers appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and \ntwo members appointed by the minority leader of the House of \nRepresentatives, examined and thoroughly developed a comprehensive \nreport on changes needed to overhaul the IRS.\n  The Commission received extensive input from American taxpayers and \nexperts on the IRS and tax system, holding 12 days of public hearings \nand spending hundreds of hours in private sessions with public and \nprivate sector experts, academics, and citizen's groups to review the \nIRS operations and services. In addition to holding three field \nhearings in Cincinnati, Omaha, and Des Moines, the Commission met \nprivately with over 500 individuals, including senior-level and \nfrontline IRS employees across the country.\n  All of the members of the Commission examined and analyzed the \nproblems with the IRS and drafted a report called ``A Vision for a New \nIRS.'' This report provides recommendations that will help restore the \npublic's faith in the American Tax system.\n  H.R. 2676 and S. 1096 implements the recommendations of the year-long \nbipartisan National Commission on Restructuring the IRS. It provides \nbetter management and new protections and rights to taxpayers along \nwith the following list of significant changes:\n  This legislation establishes an Internal Revenue Service Oversight \nBoard that has 11 members including 8 people from the private sector, \nthe Secretary, the Commissioner, and a Treasury union member.\n  In this bill, the IRS Commissioner will be appointed by the President \nwith recommendations from the Board. Only the President will be able to \nremove the IRS Commissioner however, the Board can make a \nrecommendation to the President for the Commissioner's removal.\n  This bill shifts the burden of proof from the taxpayer to the IRS.\n  It creates a taxpayer complaint and information audit system.\n  And, it brings outside expertise into the agency, so that \nmismanagement will end and taxpayers will not have to deal with \nbureaucratic redtape.\n  It provides significant expansion of innocent spouse relief--\nEliminates requirements to limit an innocent spouse from liability for \na tax delinquency of their responsible spouse. Allows a court to give \nproportional relief to an innocent spouse based upon a spouse's limited \nknowledge and responsibility.\n  Extends the attorney client privilege to accountants.\n  Expands the court's authority to award costs and fees. This \nlegislation will change the date a taxpayer can begin to be compensated \nfor administrative costs to the date they received their first letter \nof proposed deficiency from the IRS. This allows the taxpayer to \nreceive reimbursements for the costs of defending the audit as well as \nthe court proceedings.\n\n[[Page S12103]]\n\n  No single recommendation in the bill will totally fix the IRS, but \ntaken as a whole, this package sets the stage for an IRS that is fair, \nefficient, and friendly.\n  Despite the extraordinary agreement in the House of Representatives \non H.R. 2676 and agreement from President Clinton that he would sign \nthe bill. Senator Roth, the Chairman of the Finance Committee believes \nhe must spend more time and build on the House bill and act on \nlegislation next year. This is not prudent. Americans want action now. \nThe new Commissioner of the IRS Charles Rossotti will be sworn in next \nweek and we should start him on the right track with a new vision for \nthe IRS. Why put off until tomorrow, what we can do today. Senator Bob \nKerrey of Nebraska has requested unanimous consent that the House IRS \nrestructuring bill, H.R. 2676, be approved by the full Senate. I agree \nand believe we should act now to stop the IRS abuses today.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12097-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HOLDS ON LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to express my disappointment at \nthe fact that during conference negotiations on the District of \nColumbia appropriations bill, there have been efforts to drop a \nprovision offered by Senator Wyden and myself, and which was accepted \nby the Senate. This provision was the antisecret holds provision which \nwould have put an end to the practice of putting holds on legislation \nor nomination in secret.\n  My colleagues are all aware of the practice of placing holds on a \nvariety of measures. Any Member of the Senate who objects to a measure \ncan place a hold to prevent further action from taking place until that \nSenator's objections can be resolved.\n  I want to be clear about one thing. This provision would not have \nprevented Senators from placing holds. But it would have required them \nto be open and acknowledge when they have placed holds. Our provision \nwould have simply required Senators to either announce on the floor or \nplace notice in the Congressional Record within 2 working days that \nthey have placed a hold. It is very disappointing that the D.C. approps \nconferees sought not to allow this provision to remain in the \nconference report. More, not less, openness is needed in this \ninstitution. It is regrettable that conferees seek to maintain the \nstatus quo.\n  However, I want my colleagues to know that, should this provision not \nbe included in the final conference report, Senator Wyden and I will \nnot consider this matter closed.\n  We have had to work long and persistently before to achieve \nlegislative goals and we are prepared to do so again. We will continue \nto pursue this matter until we achieve the openness that is necessary \nto regain the public trust in Congress that it once had. I know that is \na goal that we all want to reach.\n  Senators should remember that simply because the provision is not in \nthe conference report, does not mean that Senators cannot take the \ninitiative on their own and declare their desire, to place a hold on \nlegislative activity. I call on all Senators to declare their action \nwhen they place a hold on legislation. Senator Wyden and I have already \npledged to be open about any such actions we take.\n  I firmly believe that shedding more light on the work that we do here \ncan only help make Congress more effective and accountable. It will \ninspire greater confidence by our constituents, without which we cannot \neffectively do our jobs. There has to be a fundamental trust among our \nconstituents that we will strive to represent their interests and \nviews. I know I've never had a constituent tell me that Congress needs \nto be less open, less straightforward or less honest about what we do. \nThat's why I want my colleagues to know this is not the last they have \nheard of this issue. They can be in step with the American people's \nwishes by making their actions public and by making the holds process \nmore open. I appeal to my colleagues to not allow this provision to be \nkilled in the secrecy that we need to eliminate.\n  I also want to thank my friend, Senator Wyden, for his hard work on \nthis matter. It has been a pleasure to work with him on this matter and \nI look forward to our continued efforts together.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I don't know whether the Senator wants to extend \nmorning business. I think we are out of morning business. I just wanted \nto ask a 2-minute extension of morning business.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If the Senator is going to ask unanimous consent for that \nextension, I ask for a further extension of 10 minutes immediately \nfollowing his extension for the purpose of introducing legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I shall not object, but might I inquire of the Presiding \nOfficer, would the regular order be to go back to the fast track \nlegislation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It is my expectation when this morning business is \ncompleted that that will be the business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That request would have to be made from the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized following the \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ROTH. I object for the moment. I would like to discuss the matter \nwith the leader before we proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me withdraw my objection. I certainly don't want to \nbe discourteous to my two colleagues. The 12 minutes they have asked \nfor is not something I object to. I will not object to these two \nrequests.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized to \nspeak for 2 minutes in morning business.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici pertaining to the introduction of Senate \nResolution 148 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on \nIntroduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized to \nspeak for 10 minutes in morning business.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Graham pertaining to the introduction of S. 1471 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERREY.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss the situation in Iraq \nregarding the U.N. inspection regime and the refusal of the Iraqi \nGovernment to accept American inspectors and thus delay the \ninspections. The Iraqi purpose is clear: to attack the unity and will \nof the world community, and especially the members of the Security \nCouncil, concerning sanctions to Iraq; to weaken the authority of the \nUnited Nations by dictating terms of compliance to U.N. Security \nCouncil resolutions; and most important, to conceal and retain and \nbuild up the chemical and biological weapons programs of the Iraqi \nmilitary.\n  Once again we are in a crisis with Iraq; not of our making but of \ntheirs. The question being debated here and in the United Nations is: \nWhat should we do?\n  The crisis began a week ago on October 29, 1997 when Saddam Hussein \nsought to evict from Iraq Americans who are assigned to international \ninspection teams sent by the United Nations to enforce a cease fire \nagreement signed by Iraq on April 6, 1991, following the January 17 to \nFebruary 28 war to liberate Kuwait known as Desert\n\n[[Page S12104]]\n\nStorm. In the agreement Iraq promised to pay Kuwait for war damages, to \ndestroy all its nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons capacity, and \nto allow inspectors into their country to verify compliance. On April \n11, 1991, the U.N. Security Council officially declared an end to the \nwar and to continuing the sanctions originally imposed on August 6, \n1990.\n  The Security Council created the Special Commission, also known as \nUNSCOM, to carry out the inspection of Iraqi installations in order to \nverify the destruction of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons \ncapacity. UNSCOM--originally expected to be in operation for several \nmonths--has been in business for 6 years. During these past 6 years the \nUNSCOM inspectors have met with success. They reduced the Iraqi \nstockpile of weapons of mass destruction more than the war itself. Iraq \nhas considerably less capability than it had when Desert Storm ended. \nThat is the goods news. The bad news is that they retain sufficient \ncapacity to pose a real and serious threat to the people of the United \nStates.\n  The nature of this residual threat can be seen in a letter sent to \nthe United Nations on Wednesday by Richard Butler, an arms control \nexpert who heads the UNSCOM. According to Mr. Butler the Iraqis could \neasily adapt laboratory or industrial equipment to resume making \nprohibited materials. In his letter he says: ``For example, it would \ntake only a matter of hours to adapt fermenters to produce seed stocks \nof biological warfare agents. Furthermore, it appears that cameras may \nhave been intentionally tampered with, lenses covered and lighting \nturned off in the facilities under monitoring.''\n  The idea of biological weapons in the hands of Iraq's Saddam Hussein \nshould strike fear in the hearts of every American. This man is \ndangerous to his own people, his neighbors, and to us.\n  He is also clever. His latest ploy has produced more benefits for him \nthan losses. Again, Mr. Butler is our guide. In his letter he says \nthat, while we attempt to negotiate a right that was guaranteed under \nthe peace agreement they signed, Iraq has been able to hide evidence \nand disable surveillance equipment. He specifically notes that we \ncannot monitor machinery that can balance missile guidance systems or \nequipment that could grow seed stocks of biological agents in a matter \nof hours.\n  Mr. Butler calls our attention to two actions Iraq has taken during \nthe week when inspectors were absent. First, significant pieces of \nequipment that had been under the view of video monitoring system have \nbeen moved out of range of cameras. Second, monitoring equipment has \nbeen tampered with in other areas.\n  Even if inspections start again, Saddam Hussein has succeeded in \nmaking our work more difficult. We must reset and re-aim surveillance \ncameras. We must recheck the machinery or stocks of materials these \ncameras watch. And we should not be certain whether prohibited arms or \ncomponents had been produced in crash programs and carried away to be \nhid.\n  So, while we sit and wonder what we should do, Saddam Hussein sits \nand counts the ways he has benefited. A U.N. team sent by Secretary \nGeneral Kofi Amnan has just returned with nothing to show for their \nefforts. The team leader, Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi of Algeria was quoted as \nsaying the Iraqis were very nice. Well, why not be nice? After \nsucceeding 2 weeks ago in defeating United States efforts to impose \nmore intense sanctions at the Security Council, Iraq has now gotten the \nU.N. to send a special negotiating team to ask politely if Iraq will do \nwhat it promised to do 6 years ago when it was suing for peace.\n  Mr. President, we cannot allow the situation in Iraq to continue to \nhead in its current direction. Too much is at stake. American security \nand the security of our allies and interests hangs in the balance of \nour decision.\n  For my part I have reached the conclusion that our policy of \ncontainment cannot succeed. We need an objective which will ensure our \nsecurity. We need a goal which will guarantee the stability we seek for \nthe region.\n  As has always been the case, an outrageous act by Saddam Hussein has \nprovoked a strong reaction in this country. Military responses are \nbroadly discussed. Editorial pages talk of making sure our military \nresponse if a head shot at Saddam himself, as though assassination were \na legal option for U.S. forces. At some point we may turn to a military \nresponse appropriate in scope and direction to achieve immediate and \nlonger terms goals. A measured action, complete with the certainty of \nfurther response if necessary, may be what is called for in this \nsituation. But I believe we need to ensure that our military actions, \nas well as our diplomatic and economic efforts, are part of an overall \nstrategy toward Iraq which will attain a goal consistent with American \nideals and interests.\n  Today, the United States and the international community are \nconsidering whether the proper response to Saddam's actions is a \nlimited military action targeting suspected facilities or continued \ntalks aimed at a more diplomatic end to this impasse. These are \ntactical options which will enable the United States and the \ninternational community to continue to muddle through its current \nstrategy of containment toward Iraq. While the containment of Saddam \nhas brought limited success in disarming his military, this strategy \nhas been ineffective in changing the behavior of the Iraqi Government \nand is in danger of becoming more ineffective with the passage of time.\n  Some commentators state that the cohesion of the Persian Gulf \ncoalition has naturally grown more tenuous as other nations rediscover \nthe promise of Iraqi petrodollars. They believe that our former \ncoalition partners will inevitably find Iraq's oil wealth so tempting \nas to overlook the risks involved in the reemergence of a military \npowerful Saddam. I believe this need not be the case, if United States \ncan formulate a strategy with clear policy objectives instead of \ncontinuing with a strategy of simply reacting to the Iraqi dictator's \nlatest violation. We need to change our goals, our strategy, and our \ntactics.\n  I believe our policy toward Iraq should be open and direct--The \nUnited States seeks to remove the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein in \nIraq and to replace it with a democratic government. Nothing more, \nnothing less.\n  Our frustration with Saddam is understandable. Six years ago we \nthought we had him. He failed utterly, ruined his country and two \nneighboring countries, caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of \npeople, and by our political lights he should be gone. But by his \npolitics, the politics of a terror rivaled in this century only by \nStalin's, Saddam keeps his job and we are rightly frustrated.\n  While Saddam rules, Iraq poses a threat to its neighbors and, by \nextension, to us. He still has SCUD missiles which could carry his \nchemical and biological agents to Israel, to Saudi Arabia, and to other \nnations in the region whose security is a vital American interest. He \nhas ground forces which could invade Kuwait again or embroil any of his \nother contiguous neighbors in war. Those same forces threaten or \noppress Iraq's Kurdish and Shiite minorities every day.\n  If Saddam retains power and escapes from sanctions, the threat he \nwill pose in a decade will be far greater. He will have intermediate \nrange or even long range missiles to carry his deadly payloads, he may \nhave developed a nuclear weapon, and he will again have many billions \nof dollars in oil income to modernize his Armed Forces. He will be a \nmajor threat to his country and in fact to the entire world. We simply \ncannot let it happen, and I am confident we will not.\n  In considering how to respond to Saddam's latest outrage, President \nClinton and the Congress need to take the long view, looking past the \nincident of the moment to determine the long-range outcome we want. \nBecause we are the United States, and because we have already expended \nlives and treasure because of Iraq, I think our long-range goal should \nbe ambitious.\n  We know from Iraqi history that Iraq is predisposed to dictatorship. \nWe also know the dictatorships from this unbalanced state will \ninevitably threaten their neighbors. So getting rid of Saddam is not \ngood enough. We need to get rid of Iraqi dictatorship. Our long-range \ngoal should be a democratic Iraq. Other countries may be tempted to do \nbusiness deals with the Iraqi dictator\n\n[[Page S12105]]\n\nand tactfully glance away from his abuse of his people. We Americans \nshould settle for nothing less than democracy.\n  An impossible, naive dream? I think not. The Iraqi people, despite \nthe lobotomy Saddam has tried to give them, are a well-educated, \nskilled people. They know the horrors of dictatorship better than \nanyone else on Earth. When Iraqis tell me their heartfelt commitment to \na democratic future for their country, I believe them.\n  How do we turn this yearning for democracy into the reality of a free \nIraq? Let me lay out a road map. First, we should maintain sanctions on \nIraq and return to the inspection system which existed until October \n29, when Saddam excluded American inspectors from the teams. If we have \nto use military force to get Iraqi compliance, fine. We should strive \nto have our coalition partners join us in this use because the power of \nthe world community to bring an outlaw to heel is at issue here. If \nIraq can thumb its nose at the Security Council today, some other rogue \nstate will do the same tomorrow, and the system we and our allies have \ncarefully built over 52 years will collapse. But even if some of our \ncoalition partners don't join us, we should act militarily if Iraq \nwon't back down.\n  Second, we must convince our core European and Asian allies that \ndemocracy, not just the compliance of a dictator, is the right long-\nterm goal for Iraq. We must show our allies the far greater benefits \nand reduced risks that will accrue to them as well as to us from a \ndemocratic Iraq. We must sign up our allies for the long term.\n  Third, we must make the people of Iraq our allies, too. We must go \nbeyond merely stating our support for democracy and instead put \nconcrete encouragements on the table, solid indicators of Western \ncommitment to Iraqi democracy. We should announce we will forgive Iraqi \ndebt if a democratic regime takes power there and we should encourage \nour allies to do the same. We should state clearly the loan and foreign \nassistance preferences which a democratic Iraq would receive from \nUnited States and multinational institutions. We should discuss our \npreparations to supply immediate food and medical assistance to Iraq at \nthe moment of Saddam's replacement by a regime which states its \nintention to hold free elections. And we should make sure, by means of \nVoice of America and commercial media, that every Iraqi knows about \nthese encouragements to be democratic. Even before change comes, these \nsteps will restore hope in Iraqi hearts.\n  Fourth, we should openly and consistently state our goal of a free, \ndemocratic Iraq. To accept less and to say less is simply unworthy of \nour heritage. Let democracy, respect for human rights, and a free \neconomy be our consistent mantra for Iraq, as it ought to be for every \ncountry, and some day, not far off, when Saddmam's prisons and \ngraveyards and secret weapons sites are opened and the Iraqi people can \ntell the story of their suffering, we will be proud that we set a lofty \ngoal.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the amendment pending on fast-track \nlegislation, is the amendment I offered 2 days ago. It is an amendment \ncalled the End the Trade Deficit Act. It is S. 465, a piece of \nlegislation that I previously introduced in the Senate that I now offer \nas an amendment.\n  Let me describe why I bring this amendment to the floor of the \nSenate, especially when we are dealing with the fast-track legislation.\n  Mr. President, this Congress has spent a great deal of time dealing \nwith the fiscal policy budget deficit, and with some success. I might \nadd that actions by the Congress and a healthy growing economy have \nsubstantially reduced the budget deficit. But there has been very \nlittle discussion about the other deficit. And that is the trade \ndeficit.\n  This country's trade deficit is the largest in history, and growing. \nFor those who don't know much about the trade deficit, let me explain. \nUnderstandably you do not hear much about it. All we do is crow about \nour exports. We talk about how much we exported. Nobody talks about how \nmuch we have imported. It is like a business talking only about their \nreceipts and refusing to talk about their expenditures.\n  Here is the merchandise trade deficit. It is 21 years old. For 36 of \nthe last 38 years we have had an overall trade deficit. For the last 21 \nyears in a row we have had this merchandise trade deficit. This trade \ndeficit represented here in red is getting worse--not better. The last \n3 years in a row have seen record merchandise trade deficits. And this \nyear it is expected to reach a record merchandise trade deficit.\n  Some say the trade deficits are really quite good for this country. \nThey must be ecstatic because these trade deficits are expected, \naccording to some econometric forecasters, to go from $191 billion in \nthe last fiscal year to $356 billion by the year 2005. Some will make \nthe case, I am sure, that it depends on the kind of trade deficits you \nhave; what the trade circumstances are; what the economic circumstances \nare of the various regions of the world. I understand all of that.\n  But I say this: A trade deficit that is persistent and growing a \ntrade deficit that represents a chronic 21-year uninterrupted set of \ntrade deficits is not good for this country.\n  I propose a piece of legislation, now offered as an amendment, to \nestablish a commission the members of which would hold hearings and \nmake recommendations to Congress on how this country can eliminate the \ntrade deficit by the year 2007.\n  We are having a discussion about fast track. It is a strategy that \ndescribes a procedure here in the Congress with respect to how we \nhandle trade agreements. Most of us understand how trade agreements are \nnegotiated. They are negotiated by trade negotiators sent overseas \nsomewhere, in most cases. They close the door, have sessions, and come \nup with an agreement. They bring it back to the Congress, and they say, \n``Here is the agreement. Take it or leave it; up or down; no \namendment.''\n  But I want to also underscore why I feel so strongly about this \nissue, even as I discuss this amendment. I want to once again describe \nfor my colleagues the dilemma we face with, for example, one free-trade \nagreement. This is the one with Canada. It is undoubtedly\n\n[[Page S12106]]\n\ntrue that there are benefits to the free-trade agreement with Canada. I \nam sure that there are sectors in this country that can point to \nsubstantial success.\n  I would say this with some certainty. Those who negotiated that \nUnited States-Canada trade agreement essentially traded away the \ninterests of family farmers in our part of the country. And the result \nhas been that in the post-Canada free trade agreement an avalanche of \nunfairly subsidized Canadian grain coming into our country sent here by \na state-controlled enterprise called the Wheat Board--which would be \nillegal in this country--sent here with secret prices that they failed \nto disclose to anyone undercutting the market for our farmers \nespecially in the area of Durum wheat, and we can't do anything about \nit.\n  Oh, we can shout about it, and we can complain about it. We can send \npeople to Canada, and make some noise about it. But the fact is that it \ndoes not get solved. It could have been solved. We could have tacked an \namendment on the trade negotiation instrument that we negotiated with \nCanada when it came to the Congress. But fast track prevented any \namendments. It predicted that we were going to have this problem, and \nit predicted that we weren't going to be able to do a thing about it--\n$220 million a year out of North Dakotans' pockets as a result of this \nunfair trade every year and it is growing worse--not better.\n  Do we think fast track makes sense? Absolutely not. We have seen the \nresult of bad trade agreements, and we have seen the result of trade \nagreements that do not give us the remedies that deal with patently \nunfair trade.\n  Aside from the issue dealing with United States-Canada, I could spend \na lot of time talking about our trade problems with Japan and China. I \nwill not do it at this point. I have done it previously on the floor.\n  But I want to say that the chronic, persistent trade deficits that go \non year after year every year in this country are a problem. We need to \naddress it. To the extent this continues and gets worse, clearly this \ntrade deficit will be repaid with a lower standard of living in this \ncountry. Now, it is time for us and the Congress to address that issue.\n  What causes the trade deficit, and what can we do to address the \ntrade deficit?\n  That is the reason I propose the establishment of a commission that \nwould seriously and thoughtfully address this issue.\n  Mr. President, in the interest of time I will cut short my comments \nat this point. We have two on the other side of the aisle who wish to \naddress it, following which I would like to make a couple of additional \ncomments.\n\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment of the \nSenator from North Dakota, and I do so for two principal reasons. But \nbefore I discuss those reasons, I would like to point out that in my \njudgment the truth is that trade policy has very little to do with our \ntrade deficit. My esteemed colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, \nhas made that point himself. Our trade deficit is a function of simple \narithmetic. We consume more than we produce and save, and the \ndifference is basically our trade deficit.\n  It is also true that when we are growing as rapidly as we are, and \nour trading partners are not, we are likely to import more and export \nless. Because they prefer to hold dollars as a hedge or as an \ninvestment, our trading partners are essentially financing our ability \nto live beyond our means.\n  Now, I do not mean to underestimate the need to get our economic \nhouse in order. Getting our budget deficit under control is a \nsignificant step in that direction.\n  What I have said does not mean that we should not do everything we \ncan to ensure that our trade policy does not contribute to our trade \ndeficit. We should and must insist that our trading partners open their \nmarkets to our goods. The defeat of fast track would do nothing but \nhinder that effort. It would offer our trading partners an excuse not \nto negotiate with us. It would offer them an excuse to maintain their \nbarriers to trade and exacerbate whatever impact our trading policies \nmay in fact have on our trade deficit. We should instead be looking for \nevery weapon in our arsenal to ensure that we open markets and keep \nthem open. Fast track is one of those weapons. I do not see the point \nof unilaterally disarming if you are seriously concerned about doing \nsomething about the trade deficit.\n  Now, Mr. President, as I said, I do oppose the amendment by the \nSenator from North Dakota, and I do so for two principal reasons. \nFirst, we face many challenges on the international economic front. The \ntrade deficit is one of them but certainly not the only one, nor even \nnecessarily the most significant in my view.\n  To me, the broader question, and, frankly, the one that is most \nlikely to affect our economic future, is how we come to grips with the \nincreasing globalization of the world economy. The world economy is \nundergoing fundamental changes that have deep importance for our \neconomic future, and we must decide whether we embrace that challenge \nor try to hide from it.\n  While I do not disagree that it would be useful to look at the \nunderlying causes of the trade deficit in that context, there certainly \nare many other issues of greater significance that have been raised in \nthis debate alone that would deserve similar attention by such a high-\npowered group as that described in the Senator's amendment.\n  Second, we should also understand that the amendment will require a \nhard look at whether we have our own economic house in order. Since the \nroot cause of the deficit includes our domestic economic policies, we \nwill be asking the commission to delve deeply into our fiscal and \nmonetary policies. My point is that there already are a number of \ngovernmental institutions that are involved in these processes where \nthere is expertise on these matters such as the Treasury, the Commerce \nDepartment, the Federal Reserve, as well as our congressional \ncommittees. I wonder whether the commission is needed given the \nresources we already have available.\n  Third, I am always concerned when we raise a proposal for a \ncommission or another advisory board that we not use them as a reason \nto avoid the responsibilities we have in Congress for addressing these \nissues. Plainly, we have the resources here in Congress to examine \nthese questions in depth, and I am certain we would want to explore \nthose possibilities before establishing yet another blue ribbon \ncommission. If the question is how do we eliminate the trade deficit \nand our trade policy is part of the answer, then the first step we \nshould take is to pass this legislation. This bill is, after all, about \nbreaking down trade barriers abroad, and that is undeniably a step in \nthe right direction in eliminating trade deficits.\n\n  As a consequence, while the concept may have merit in some sense, I \noppose the amendment as offered and will ask my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me begin by outlining the points I want \nto make, and I will try to be brief about it so that we can get on with \nother business of the Senate.\n  First of all, I want to talk about why I oppose this amendment. I \nwant to talk about the two principal problems it has. I want to outline \nchanges that could be made that would make it possible for us to \nsupport the amendment and to see us proceed on a bipartisan basis. And \nthen, without getting into a long oration or, as a critic would say, a \nlecture on international economics, I want to talk a little bit about \ntrade deficits, about the sources of America's trade deficit, and talk \na little bit about the history of the trade deficit in our country, and \nI intend to do all of this while trying to deviate from my background \nas an old schoolteacher and be brief.\n  First of all, there are two problems with the amendment. No. 1, we \nare not going to adopt a proposal to create any commission that is \ngoing to be stacked on a partisan basis. There is no way we are going \nto adopt a commission that has three more Democrat members than \nRepublicans when we have a Republican majority in both Houses of \nCongress. So I think the first thing we are going to have to do, if we \nare going to have a commission, is to have the same number of \nRepublicans as Democrats.\n  I think it would be a good idea to try to set some parameters on the \nkinds of\n\n[[Page S12107]]\n\npeople that should participate on this commission. If we do not want \nthis to turn into a political commission with a bunch of political \nhacks on it, it would be helpful to have people who are genuine \nfinancial, economic, and international trade experts, and ones who \ncould bring with their expertise a high degree of objectivity. I think \nthe degree to which we could set some parameters as to who would be on \nthe commission would probably be helpful. I do not think we achieve \nanything by appointing a partisan commission with a bunch of political \nhacks on it who have an ax to grind and are simply looking for a forum \nto try to promote their own political interest, their special interest, \nor their individual agenda.\n  Second, I cannot see how we could adopt a commission that was given a \nmandate that without regard to any other policy, our goal should be \nsimply to eliminate the trade deficit by the year 2007. I believe there \nare things we could do and should do that would be beneficial to the \nelimination of the trade deficit. And I will talk about them. But the \nidea that without doing those things we should simply set out to build \nwalls around America, drive up costs to consumers, drive down living \nstandards, disrupt economic growth, is something I think we have to be \nvery careful about.\n  So I think we could have an agreement here if we have a genuine \nbipartisan commission. I think we could have an agreement if we could \ntry to focus the membership of the commission so that we are seeking \nadvice from people who actually know something about the subject rather \nthan a bunch of politicians who are simply going to express their \nspecial interest. And I think we need a little bit broader objective \nthan simply to say that we should eliminate the trade deficit by the \nyear 2007.\n  To listen to those who oppose fast track and who are talking about \ngloom and doom on the trade deficit, you would not realize that \nyesterday the unemployment rate was announced and it is 4.7 percent, \nwhich is the lowest unemployment rate we have had since the early \n1970s. In other words, today, with the largest trade deficit in \nAmerican history, we have the lowest unemployment rate we have had in \nalmost a quarter of a century.\n  Let me say a little bit about trade deficits. Trade deficits in and \nof themselves are not good or bad. They are simply an indication of a \nlot of other things that could be good or could be bad. Let me give you \nan example. From the moment that the first settler stepped on the North \nAmerican continent at Jamestown, VA, until the end of World War I, for \nall practical purposes colonial America and the United States of \nAmerica ran a trade deficit nearly every single day--every single day. \nAnd yet we had the most sustained period of economic growth in the \nhistory of mankind.\n  Why were we running a trade deficit from the time the first American \nstepped off the boat at Jamestown until the end of World War I? We were \nrunning a huge trade deficit because with this vast continent, with its \nboundless natural resources, with its fertile land and limitless \nforests, with its harbors and rivers, and with people who had more \nfreedom than any people had ever had in the history of mankind, people \nfrom all over the world wanted to send their money here to invest in \nour economy. So the British sent the money to build our railroads. \nInvestors from all over the world not only sent their money but their \nchildren to come and participate in the American miracle, and so as a \nresult we had a trade deficit practically every single day from 1607 to \nroughly 1920. And to listen to our colleague from North Dakota, with \nall due respect, it should have been a bleak, dark, doomed place, this \nAmerica. But the plain truth was we had more growth, more opportunity, \nmore freedom and more prosperity than any place in the history of the \nworld, then to now.\n  Deficits are like debt. They can be a path to prosperity or they can \nbe a path to disaster. And it all depends on what you use it for, why \nit comes about. Borrowing money can make you rich, if you invest the \nmoney and earn a rate of return bigger than what you have to pay to \nborrow the money. It can also make you poor if you invest the money \npoorly or simply go out and spend it until you have to pay the money \nback.\n  Now, let me try, as briefly as I can be brief, to explain why we have \na deficit. We need to understand that the exchange rate between the \ndollar and other currencies is set every day on an international \nexchange market where there are literally hundreds of billions of \ndollars of transactions every single day.\n  Now, on this market people are buying and selling dollars, sometimes \nby the billions of dollars per transaction. Why do people buy dollars? \nPeople buy dollars to buy American goods. They buy dollars to invest in \nAmerica or to repatriate earnings to America from American investment \nabroad. They buy dollars to hold as an international currency. In fact, \nthe dollar has become the international currency of the world, and, \nremarkable as it sounds, we have printed hundreds of billions of \ndollars and people all over the world hold them to use them in their \nown economies. And we have been a huge beneficiary of that.\n  Now, why do Americans buy other currencies? We buy other currencies \nwith dollars because we want to buy foreign goods, because we want to \ninvest abroad, because we want to repatriate earnings abroad, but by \nand large we do not use other currencies as an international exchange, \nnot nearly as much as the dollar is used. Now, what this means is every \nday on the market for international currency, the value of the dollar \nrelative to the yen, the value of the dollar relative to the pound, is \nset exactly at that point where the dollars that are being demanded to \nbuy American goods and to invest in America are exactly equal to the \ndollars that we are supplying to try to buy that currency, to buy its \ngoods, or to invest in that country.\n\n  If that isn't so, then the exchange rate moves. Why is that \nsignificant? It is significant because what it really says, for all \npractical purposes, is that anytime you have a trade deficit you have \neither a capital surplus and/or people overseas are, for some reason, \nholding our currency. This last factor is not nearly as relevant for \nany other country in the world, but because our economy is the \nstrongest in the world, because our dollar is the soundest in the \nworld, people want to hold American dollars. As long as people want to \ninvest in America--and today we are having a huge level of investment \nin America from all over the world--we are going to have a trade \ndeficit because we have a capital inflow. Those who would like to see \nit otherwise are trying to repeal double-entry bookkeeping, because \nbasically what we are seeing here with the trade deficit is accounting \nmore than it is economics.\n  We are seeing the accounting of the fact that we have high real \ninterest rates because our Government is still a big net borrower--\nbecause we as a nation don't save very much money. We have the lowest \nsavings rate of any industrial country in the world, largely because we \nhave a Social Security system that is pay-as-you-go and discourages \npersonal savings for retirement. It doesn't have a real trust fund. \nSocial Security contributions are taxes, not savings. And, so, we have \ncollectivized retirement and retirement medical care and converted them \nfrom savings for the future into taxes for consumption today. We are \nnot building up assets to pay for our future obligations. So, as a \nresult, we are overspending. This is to say that while at the same time \nwe have the strongest economic performing economy in the world on one \nhand, that people want to invest in, we have the lowest savings rate on \nthe other. So all over the world people are trying to buy dollars to \ninvest here because of high equity returns and relatively high real \ninterest rates.\n  Now, if we want to do something about that we certainly don't want to \ndo anything about the high equity returns. We don't want to prevent \nAmerican businesses from growing and providing jobs. We certainly don't \nwant to pass a law that says to people all over the world, ``Don't send \nyour capital to America to put it to work.'' One of the principal \nreasons we have the lowest unemployment rate we have had in 24 years is \nthat literally tens of billions of dollars of foreign capital flow into \nAmerica every year. And our foreign investors are, in the process, \nhelping to put our people to work.\n  But, if we really are concerned about the trade deficit, we ought to \ndeal with the deficit in our budget, not just the\n\n[[Page S12108]]\n\non-budget deficit but all the money we are borrowing for off-budget \naccounts. We ought to restructure Medicare and Social Security and have \nan investment-based system where real capital is being built up so we \ncan have real savings to match our growing future liabilities. We can \nlower interest rates by encouraging people to save more. The chairman \nof the Finance Committee, with his Roth IRA--and, by the way, Mr. \nChairman, I heard a radio commercial yesterday morning from some \nsecurities firm advertising Roth IRA's. Those are ways that we can \nencourage people to save, bringing about lower interest rates, and \nreducing our reliance upon foreign sources of capital to America. And \nmaybe that is something that this commission ought to look at.\n  What we are looking at here with this amendment, to try to sum up and \nbe brief, is we are looking at a symptom and not a cause. We have a big \ntrade deficit because we have the strongest economy in the world and \npeople want to invest here. We don't want to do anything about that. We \nhave a trade deficit because we have very high real interest rates, and \nwith very high real interest rates people want to come here to get \nthose returns on their savings. We could do something about that if we \nencouraged people to save more, and if we did something about the \nunderlying deficit, including the real, unfunded long-term deficits in \nSocial Security and Medicare.\n\n  So, to the extent that this commission could look at these underlying \nproblems, then I think we could begin to try to do something about the \ntrade deficit. But I go back and reiterate the point that I made \nearlier. Trade deficits in and of themselves do not give you any kind \nof effective measure of the strength of the underlying economy. We had \ntrade deficits from the colonial period to World War I, when we had the \nstrongest economy in the world. We have had trade deficits in trying to \nrebuild Europe and Japan, when we had very, very strong economies. We \nhave had trade deficits and trade surpluses with countries all over the \nworld. Some of the countries with the poorest economies have had trade \nsurpluses. I don't know what the trade surplus or deficit is for North \nKorea. It would be a perfect model for many, in the sense that they \ndon't import many goods, they protect their jobs, but the problem is \nthey don't have good jobs because they are poor because they don't \ntrade.\n  So, what we would like to do, to try to get on with fast track and \nhopefully pass it, if the House does, is see if we can work out an \nagreement to do three things. First, have a true bipartisan commission \nand, if possible, in that bipartisan commission, let's try to put real \nexperts on the commission--not politicians--who could bring some \nexpertise to the problem and help us have some constructive ideas as to \nwhat to do about it.\n  Second, let's look at the underlying causes of the trade deficit. \nLet's look at protectionism, both here and around the world. Let's look \nat our deficit in the Federal budget. Let's look at our long-term \nstructural deficit in our two big programs, Medicare and Social \nSecurity. Let's look at what we can do to encourage Americans to save, \nand in the process reduce real interest rates, reduce our reliance on \nforeign capital, and in the process lower the trade deficit.\n  So, I think there is room here for a compromise. I hope we can reach \nit. But in terms of the way the amendment is now drafted, we are \nopposed to it. But if we could refocus it, if we could make it truly \nbipartisan, if we could look at the bigger picture, then I think that \nwe could have the ability to reach a compromise. I think we could adopt \nthis--either as an amendment or as a freestanding bill, depending on \nwhat happens in the House on fast track--and I think that in the \nprocess we could go a long way toward completing the business of the \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from Texas whetted my appetite once again on \neconomic theory. I studied economics, taught economics in college \nbriefly, and was most interested to hear the Senator from Texas.\n  Because I did teach economics very briefly, I have heard all of the \nstories about economists, as the Senator from Texas has, and all the \ndefinitions.\n  The one about, you know: An economist is one who can describe with \nall great details the workings of the world but can't remember his \nphone number.\n  An economist is someone who looks at something that works in practice \nand wonders whether it can really work in theory.\n  Let me, for a moment, respond to a couple of the points made by the \nSenator from Texas. First of all, I am happy to see if we can reach \nsome agreement on some of these provisions. This does not propose to \nestablish a commission with a bunch of political hacks, to use the \nwords of the Senator from Texas. I have no interest in establishing a \ncommission with political hacks. I am interested in establishing a \ncommission that might address a real problem and make recommendations \nabout how to respond to that problem.\n  A couple of points first. The Senator from Texas mentioned Social \nSecurity several times. I just want to clear up a point. It really \ndoesn't have very much to do with this. The Senator from Texas was \nmentioning Social Security in the context of domestic deficits, as \nsomething that is out of control. This year, Social Security will take \nin nearly $70 billion more than it will expend. Social Security is not \nrunning a deficit, it is running a surplus, and a very significant \nsurplus at that. Why? Because it is one of the few sober things we have \ndone in the last two decades. We finally required a forced pool of \nnational savings in Social Security to meet the time when the baby \nboomers retire.\n  So this year, the Social Security system will run about a $70 billion \nsurplus, and that annual surplus will continue year after year after \nyear until about the year 2018. So I don't want that reference to pass \nunnoticed and allow someone to think, gee, there is a huge deficit in \nthe Social Security account.\n  I have a couple of other points. We are told from time to time that \nwe have a trade deficit because we have a budget deficit, and if we get \nrid of the budget deficit, gee, the trade deficit will be no problem at \nall. The trade deficit will disappear.\n  The budget deficit is going down, down, down, way down, and yet the \ntrade deficit is growing. So I ask those who tell us that the trade \ndeficit is simply a function of the budget deficit, why does your \ntheory now seem to be wrong? You said that if the budget deficit \ndecreases, the trade deficit will vanish. Why, when the budget deficit \nnot only decreases but nearly goes away, do our merchandise trade \ndeficits reach the largest level in the history of this country? Is it \nperhaps that the theories are all wet?\n  Then some say, ``Well, we know we talked about the budget deficit \nrelated to the trade deficit. If that's not the case, then its the \nstrong dollar. The strong dollar is our problem?'' That is what causes \nthis sea of red ink of merchandise trade deficits that are getting \nworse? It is the largest in history and setting new records every day \nand getting worse.\n  When the dollar is strong, we have a trade deficit. When the dollar \nis weak, we have trade deficits. What do you say about that? Is maybe \nthe theory is all wet there as well?\n  Might it be, at least in part, something no one is willing to discuss \nmuch. That is that we have a free-trade system in which our markets are \nwide open and we have expectations of trading partners who open their \nmarkets but they don't open their markets. Their markets are not open \nto American goods. Might it be that our markets are open, but the \nJapanese markets are not wide open to American goods, the Chinese \nmarkets are not wide open to American goods? Might that not be the \ncase? Could that conceivably be the reason for part of this or a \nsignificant part of this trade deficit? I think it is.\n  The Senator also discussed what happened at the turn of the century \nand the prior century about trade deficits. Comparing the economic \ncircumstances of the prior century and its trade deficits to today is \nlike comparing a teaspoonful of water to a bathtubful of water. These \ntrade deficits are serious, alarming, and growing. Let me take this \nfrom theory to practice.\n\n[[Page S12109]]\n\n  At least a part of this red ink is because we are seeing American \njobs leave this country and move elsewhere, and those jobs then are \nused to produce the same products to ship back into this country, and \nthat contributes to this trade deficit.\n  Bob Bramer worked for 31 years at Sandvik Hard Metals in Michigan. He \nsaw his plant close down, saw the equipment put on a truck and hauled \nto Mexico. His and 26 other jobs went south. He didn't lose his job in \ntheory. He lost his job, and his family lost his income. He lost his \ncareer. His job was put on a truck and moved to Mexico.\n  Nancy Dewent, 47 years old, worked at a plant for 19 years in Queens, \nNY. They were making Swingline brand staplers; 408 jobs. Now they are \nmoving to Mexico. Nancy was 47 years old making $11.58 an hour. Those \nstaplers will now be produced in Mexico at 50 cents an hour, and that \nwill help, of course, increase this trade deficit. Nancy didn't lose \nher job in theory, she lost her real job. This isn't economic theory, \nit is what our current trade strategy is producing.\n  Fruit of the Loom was scheduled to close plants in Kentucky, \nMississippi, Louisiana, and Texas last month; 5,100 workers, workers \ngetting up to $10.50 an hour; moving plants and jobs to other countries \nfor 5 years in a row.\n  There is Borg-Warner, Muncie, IN, where 800 workers are losing jobs \nwhich pay $17.50 an hour; moving to Mexico. This isn't theory, these \nare families, people who have lost their jobs, and it shows up here in \nred.\n  We can give lectures about economic theory forever. But the central \nquestion is, do you think that 21 straight years of trade deficits \nproduced by this trade policy is troublesome for this country, or do \nyou think, conceivably, they are good for this country? Do you think \nmore red ink might be good for this country? Some argue that. They must \nbe ecstatic if that is the case, because this red ink is growing. They \nmust be the ones walking around with the widest smiles in town.\n  But there are those of us who think that trade deficits are \ntroublesome. We are concerned that markets are closed to this country \nwhen we open our markets to others. We think that we ought to be a \ncountry that cares a little about its manufacturing base and keeping \ngood manufacturing jobs in this country by requiring that other markets \nbe open to our products. We should be requiring that others who produce \nand ship here be required to respond to the same kind of issues we are \nrequired to respond to such as that you can't hire kids, you can't hire \n12 years old, work them 12 hours a day and pay them 12 cents an hour. \nThat's not fair. We shouldn't be expected to compete with that.\n  Is it reasonable for us to at least require some important provisions \ndealing with labor and the environment and other issues in these trade \nagreements? The fact is that we don't. What we say is, ``It doesn't \nmatter what you do. It doesn't matter how you produce, and ship it \nhere, we will buy it. By the way, it doesn't matter so much that you \nwon't let your markets be open to us. We will accept that. Anyone that \nstands up and says that is troublesome for the country, we will tell \nthem they don't know what they are talking about, because it is \nconceivable these trade deficits are good for our country.'' Now that's \nwhat they say.\n  You talk about economic gibberish. This is not good for our country. \nThis is the other deficit that is the worst it has been in the history \nof this country and getting worse every year and one we ought to do \nsomething about. You can name family after family after family in this \ncountry who are already victims as a result of this deficit or whose \nlost jobs helped cause this deficit. It is because those jobs used to \nbe here and now they are there. They used to be in this country, now \nthey are gone.\n  Why? Because in the name of profits, the multinational companies in \nthis country and around the world constructed an economic system \ndefining production to be available to them in the lowest-cost \nproduction areas in the world. They circle the globe and find out where \ncan you produce, where at the same time you can hire kids, pay them \npennies, and dump the pollution in the water and ship the product to \nFargo, Los Angeles and other places. They simply look to where can they \nproduce in those circumstances in order to maximize your profit. It \ndoesn't matter to them what happens to this country's deficit. It \ndoesn't matter so much to them what happens to this country's jobs.\n  That is why I am concerned about all this. That is why I asked in \nthis limited circumstance for a commission to consider ways that we can \naddress the trade deficit, ways this country can begin to end this \nhemorrhaging of red ink.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I ask the Senator from North Dakota, in fact, what has \nhappened to the U.S. trade balance is a marked deterioration in our \nposition in the post-World War II period. In other words, beginning \nafter World War II, we ran a modest trade surplus year in and year out, \nand beginning in the mid-1970s and continuing thereafter, as the \nSenator indicates on his chart and indicated on this chart, we have \nbeen running these very large negative trade balances, sometimes as \nmuch as $150 billion, $180 billion in a single year. The consequence of \nrunning these trade balances year in and year out cumulatively is about \n$1.5 trillion. The result of that is a deterioration in the U.S. \nposition from being a creditor nation to now we are a debtor nation.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Is it not the case that we are the largest debtor nation \nin the world?\n  Mr. SARBANES. The United States is the largest debtor nation in the \nworld. People say, look, if we were a developing country just setting \nout on the process of development, there is an argument that can be \nmade that you run a trade imbalance. And if you are smart in your trade \nimbalance, you bring in investment to develop your economy for the \nfuture. That is what the United States did in the 19th century.\n  But the United States now is supposedly the most developed country in \nthe world. The most developed country in the world, supposedly the \nworld's leader, ought not to be a debtor nation and ought not to be \nrunning these large trade imbalances.\n  I say to the Senator from North Dakota, here is what happens. You \nknow, people say, ``Well, people are losing jobs.'' And they say, \n``Well, they're losing jobs, but other people are gaining jobs from the \nexports, and, as a consequence, we're strengthening ourselves as a \nnation.'' We are not strengthening ourselves as a nation. We are \nrunning these very large trade deficits year in and year out.\n  This represents a marked deterioration in the American position. We \ndid not do this between the end of World War II and into the 1970's. It \nis only over the last 20 years that we started running, year in and \nyear out, these very large trade deficits.\n  As the Senator from North Dakota points out, the reason for them, I \nthink, is fairly simple. Our market is very open for other countries to \nsend goods into the United States. And many of those markets are \nrelatively closed to us. We export $12 billion a year to China, to the \nPRC, and take from the PRC $52 billion a year; $12 billion goes that \nway and $52 billion comes this way, for a net imbalance of $40 billion. \nAnd it is growing year to year to year. Every year it keeps going up.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me ask the Senator to respond to this.\n  China, the People's Republic of China, dealing with American movies, \nallows 10 movies a year in China, no more, just 10. They cut it off at \n10.\n  China does not allow nearly enough American pork. In fact, we send \nvery little pork into China. The Chinese consume one-half of the \nworld's pork, but we send very little pork into China. We used to be \nthe world's largest wheat supplier to China. Now we are displaced as \nthe largest wheat supplier to China even as they ship increasing \nquantities of Chinese goods to this country.\n  In addition, the Chinese have ratchetted up this huge surplus with \nus--or we a deficit with them--to very significant levels. What they \nneed are airplanes. They only produce--as I understand it, they produce \none airplane that I think holds 50 or 60 passengers. They need \nairplanes. In fact, they need a couple thousand airplanes that they are \ngoing to need in the years ahead.\n  Guess what China says? China says, ``Well, what we'd like to do is \nwe'd like\n\n[[Page S12110]]\n\nto consider buying your airplanes, but you must manufacture your \nairplanes in China.'' This is at a time when we are already running a \nhuge trade deficit with China.\n  My feeling is: China sends its goods to this country to our \nmarketplace, and American consumers buy them. We make something China \nneeds. China has a responsibility to buy from us wheat, pork, and \nairplanes.\n  But that is not the way the world currently works, because this \ncountry does not have the nerve, the will, or the courage to stand up \nto trading partners--China, Japan, Mexico, Canada, and others--and say, \n``Here's what's fair for the American economy. Here's what's fair for \nAmerican workers.'' If we don't have the nerve to stand up for this \ncountry's economic interests and demand fair trade, then we are going \nto continue to see this sort of hemorrhaging year after year as far as \nthe eye can see.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator is absolutely right. The question is not \nwhether you are going to trade; it is the terms on which you will \ntrade. What are the rules going to be? Of course, China's trade surplus \nwith the United States finances China's trade imbalance with the rest \nof the world. So, in effect, we make it possible for China to purchase \nfrom other developed countries, the European countries, for example, \nwho are very careful to keep their trade relationship with China in \nmuch more of an even balance.\n\n  So, year after year, we run these large trade deficits, and everyone \nsays, ``Well, it doesn't matter.'' It does matter. It does matter. It \naffects the standing of the United States as a world power. You cannot \nlong be a world power if you are the world's largest debtor country.\n  This chart makes a difference. The United States for decades was a \ncreditor nation--others owed us. Now we have deteriorated to where we \nare now the largest debtor nation in the world to the tune of $1 \ntrillion--a $1 trillion debtor nation.\n  People get up on the floor of the Senate, and they make these \nexpansive speeches about what a great power we are, and so forth and so \non, and yet our economic status continues to deteriorate year after \nyear.\n  This is the issue that needs to be addressed. This is exactly what \nthis commission would try to do. The fact of the matter is that in this \ntrade debate there is an effort to frame it as though the people that \nare losing their jobs are screaming, which they well should be, but \nthen it is argued, well, this has to happen when you have trade \ndevelopment and, you know, there are people who get jobs in the export \nindustry.\n  The fact of the matter is, we are losing far more jobs on the import \nside than we are gaining on the export side. I mean, if the trade was \nroughly in balance, then you'd have a different set of circumstances. \nBut we have been running, as the Senator has pointed out, these very \nlarge trade deficits, year after year after year.\n  That is a deterioration in the American position. I defy anyone to \ntry to make the case that it is a good thing for the United States in \npresent circumstances to be running these large trade deficits, that it \nis a good thing for the United States, supposedly the world's most \nhighly developed economy, to go from being a creditor nation to being a \ndebtor nation. It is obviously not a good thing. We need to address \nthis issue. This commission would be one way of trying to do that.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might reclaim my time.\n  The Senator from Maryland is an extraordinarily effective advocate \nfor that point of view. And it is one that I share. He, along with \nSenator Byrd from West Virginia, is a cosponsor of this amendment and \nthe legislation that mirrors it that we had introduced earlier in this \nCongress.\n  I must leave the floor, and I don't know whether the Senator from \nMaryland has other thoughts to continue with, but I know that under the \nspirit of the unanimous-consent request, upon disposition of my \namendment, Senator Reed from Rhode Island would be recognized to offer \nan amendment. My understanding is that he would not require that it be \nvoted on today, but he does want to offer it and have some discussion \nabout it.\n  The disposition of my amendment would be this. What I would like to \ndo is engage the staff of the Senator from Delaware and the Senator \nfrom Texas, who spoke earlier, to see if there are ways to deal with \nthe questions they raised about the commission.\n  As I understand, the Senator from Texas indicated that he would not \nnecessarily object to the establishment of a commission if we could \nreach some compromises on the conditions of such a commission or the \nmakeup of the commission.\n  Would that be the understanding of the Senator from Delaware with \nrespect to Senator Reed?\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I would like to see if it is possible for us \nto reach agreement on your amendment. I think in general principle we \ncan work with you. But I do think there are some significant changes \nthat have to be made, including the makeup of the commission itself. So \nit would be my understanding that tonight, at the staff level, we could \nprobably work and see if we cannot reach agreement and try to do that \nso we can complete it at the earliest possible time.\n  But my understanding is that the distinguished junior Senator from \nRhode Island would seek to introduce his amendment, but it would be \nwith the understanding that there would be no votes on that amendment \ntonight but merely to introduce it.\n  Mr. REED. That is correct.\n  Mr. ROTH. With that understanding, that is satisfactory to me. So we \nwill lay your amendment aside.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent my amendment be \nlaid aside in order that the Senator from Rhode Island may offer his \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1613\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1613.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Amend section 2(b) after section 2(b)(15) to add the \n     following new paragraph:\n       (16) The principal negotiating objective of the United \n     States regarding the environment is to promote adherence to \n     internationally recognized environmental standards.\n       Amend section 10 at the end, to add the following new \n     definition:\n       (7) Internationally Recognized Environmental Standards--The \n     term ``internationally recognized environmental standards'' \n     includes--\n       (A) mitigation of global climate change;\n       (B) reduction in the consumption and production of ozone-\n     depleting substances;\n       (C) reduction in ship pollution of the oceans from such \n     sources as oil, noxious bulk liquids, hazardous freight, \n     sewage, and garbage;\n       (D) a ban on international ocean dumping of high-level \n     radioactive waste, chemical warfare agents, and hazardous \n     substances;\n       (E) government control of the transboundary movement of \n     hazardous waste materials and their disposal for the purpose \n     of reducing global pollution on account of such materials;\n       (F) preservation of endangered species;\n       (G) conservation of biological diversity;\n       (H) promotion of biodiversity; and\n       (I) preparation of oil-spill contingency plans.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, my amendment would, within the context of \nfast track, direct the President to undertake as a principal \nnegotiating objective to promote the adherence of internationally \nrecognized environmental standards.\n  Essentially, what we have to do to improve the legislation before the \nSenate is to recognize that environmental quality is an important \nissue. It is an important issue for us, all of us who breathe the air, \nswim the waters, eat the bounty of our land, but it is also a very \nimportant issue in terms of economic competition because in many \nrespects what we are seeing in countries that are trading with us is a \nconscious and at times very committed and deliberate attempt to use \nenvironmental quality and the lack of environmental quality to gain \nadvantage over American workers.\n\n[[Page S12111]]\n\n  The underlying legislation circumscribes the ability of the President \nto deal effectively and forcefully with the issues in environmental \nquality within our potential trading partners. That, I think, is \nessential. Indeed, the experience of NAFTA should convince us very \npersuasively that we have to deal with the environment in order to set \nup a reasonable, fair, balanced trading regime between one country and \nanother. The experience of NAFTA has shown us that there are trading \npartners who are using the environment, environmental laws, \npreferential environmental treatment of their companies, to attract and \nto lure American businesses to their country.\n  For example, the Canadian Province of Alberta, which was one of the \nonly two Canadian Provinces to sign the side agreement with respect to \nthe environment in NAFTA, adopted legislation in May 1996, prohibiting \ncitizens from suing environmental officials to enforce environmental \nlaws. In effect, limiting the authority, the enforcement capability of \ntheir own environmental laws. As a result, Alberta has since been \nadvertising its lax regulatory climate as ``the Alberta advantage.'' \nNow, that might be an advantage for Alberta but it is definitely a \ndetriment to the men and women of America who have to follow \nenvironmental laws which we pass in this body.\n  In October 1995, Mexico indicated that they would no longer require \nenvironmental impact assessment for investments in highly polluting \nsectors such as petrochemicals, refining, fertilizer, steel. Now, we \nall recognize and realize that any company in the United States that \nwas investing or proposing to invest in one of these facilities would \nhave to go through a very rigorous environmental impact assessment \nprocess. So when you have a multinational company making a decision of \nwhether to go and respect and follow the law of the United States or go \nto a country that has announced they don't do environmental \nassessments, I think it is very difficult to see why some of these \ncountries stay in the United States.\n  At the heart of our fast-track efforts should be a strong commitment \nto the environment, not just because it is the right thing to do but \nbecause it is the most consistent way that we can make our companies as \ncompetitive as we can with companies around the world.\n  There is another example in Mexico. After NAFTA, a series of \nmultinational companies built a technology center in Ciudad Industrial. \nNow, these are state-of-the-art factories, state-of-the-art facilities, \nbut what they are doing is taking all their waste and dumping it right \ninto the sewers without any treatment or hardly any treatment at all, \nsomething we could not do in the United States, something you couldn't \ndo in Europe, but something that is done every day there. Again, an \nadvantage to these companies in terms of costs they must pay for \nenvironmental quality and inducements for companies like that to leave \ncountries like the United States and other countries that have high \nenvironmental quality standards and go overseas to these particular \nareas.\n  We have to take strong, purposeful steps to ensure that environmental \nquality is at the heart of our trade policy. Again, it is not just \naltruism or idealism. It is cold, hard, economic facts that we have to \nrecognize. You don't have to go very far to find examples of how \nmultinational companies are taking advantage of lax enforcement around \nthe world in environmental quality. In today's New York Times on the \nfront page there was a story about the Nike corporation. In January of \nthis year, Ernst & Young, the auditing company, prepared a report to \nNike about one of the factories in Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam. It \nfound that the workers there were exposed to carcinogens that exceeded \nlocal legal standards by 177 times. That is, 77 percent of the \nemployees suffer from respiratory problems. Moreover, when they looked \nfurther into the plight of these employees, it found that they were \nworking 65 hours a week for a grand total of $10. That is 15 cents an \nhour. If you look at those low wages, together with lax environmental \nstandards, that is a very potent combination that makes it very \ndifficult for our manufacturing companies in the United States to be \ncompetitive at all.\n  Now, some proponents of free trade say that is one of the \nconsequences of free trade, that lower wages will attract investment. \nBut the benefit to the people in America is low-cost goods. Nike \nsneakers are about $125 a pair or $150 a pair. These are not exactly \nlow-cost goods. Last year, Nike made $800 million on total sales of \n$9.2 billion.\n\n  The workers in Vietnam certainly are not benefiting from this great, \ntremendous, volume of sales, and in fact, American consumers are not \nbenefiting from low-cost sneakers. They are very high-priced, prestige \nsneakers. What has happened is that our footwear manufacturing industry \nhas been decimated. Growing up in Rhode Island, I was quite familiar \nwith surrounding communities, particularly Brookline, MA, where most of \nthe shoes in the world at one time were made. Those factories are empty \nand idle and those workers have gone off to do other things, but not to \ncompete in the footwear industry.\n  It is absolutely critical to recognize the reality of international \ntrade where environmental quality--I should say the lack of it--is a \nstrong competitive inducement to move capital into these countries. The \nresult in some cases is very frightening, not only in terms of the \nimpact on our workers but certainly the impact on the workers who are \nworking in these facilities.\n  Let me summarize the Ernst & Young report as reported in the New York \nTimes. They painted a dismal picture of thousands of young women, \nmostly under age 25, laboring 10\\1/2\\ hours a day, 6 days a week, in \nexcessive heat and noise and in foul air, for slightly more than $10 a \nweek. The report also found that workers with skin or breathing \nproblems had not been transferred to permanent chemical-free areas, and \nhalf of the workers that dealt with dangerous chemicals did not wear \nprotective masks or gloves. We could say well, gee, I feel sympathetic \nto the worker and as a humanitarian and as a kind, decent person that \nshouldn't happen, but that is their country. That is their culture. \nThose are their decisions.\n  But it is hard when, as I do, you go into a Rhode Island jewelry \nfactory, for example, and look at individual entrepreneurs whose \nfamilies have built a business over two generations, who invested their \nsweat and their time and their fortune to try to build a big company, \ngood company, and you find out that they have to pay a minimum wage, \nthey have to ensure that their workers, if they are exposed to \nchemicals follow rigid procedures, they have to ensure that their waste \nis pretreated, and you ask those business men and business women how \nthey are doing, and they say poorly because of international \ncompetition. Then you know that reports like this are not merely \nacademic journalistic humanitarian conclusions. They strike at the very \nheart of whether small business men and women in this country can \ncontinue to compete.\n  They are not asking for protective tariffs. They are not asking for \nus to withdraw from the world trade as some of the proponents of this \nlegislation might suggest. But what they are saying is, give us a \nchance to be competitive on an even basis. When you negotiate treaties, \nraise the standards, the environmental standards and the working \nconditions so that we can try to use our talents, our ingenuity, our \nskill, and our resources to be competitive.\n  If you don't do that, not only are you doing a disservice to these \npeople who are trapped in these 10-hour days, in poor health-\nthreatening environments, you are striking at the very competitiveness, \nthe very survivability of so many small businesses around this country, \nparticularly in my part of the world.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REED. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Isn't it a fact that if you can't bring in the \nenvironmental standards and the working conditions, you are not going \nto be able to compete on a level field? Either one of two things will \nhappen. You will remain at a competitive disadvantage, as the Senator \nhas noted, I think, very perceptively; or there is going to be a \ntremendous downward pressure to lower environmental standards because \npeople will say, well, we are at a competitive disadvantage, we can't \nhave these environmental standards.\n\n[[Page S12112]]\n\n  Now, we have been through the whole debate about the environmental \nstandards, and they are clearly necessary if we are not going to befoul \nthe very world in which we live.\n  This legislation doesn't make the environmental concerns a legitimate \nobjective. The Senator made a very thoughtful speech the other evening \nabout the difficulty with this legislation, about, as I recall, setting \nout what our negotiating goals ought to be. It seems to me that this is \na clear example of such failure, because the legislation does not \npermit environmental considerations to be a central negotiating goal, \nas I understand it; is that correct?\n  Mr. REED. The Senator's understanding is correct. My reading of the \nlegislation would allow certain discussions about environmental \nstandards, along with other standards, if they directly related to \ntrade. But they would not provide the President with the instructions, \nthe support, and the direction to go out there and make environmental \nquality in these foreign countries a centerpiece, an important part of \nour negotiations.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield further, my further \nunderstanding is that, to the extent this legislation deals with \nenvironmental standards, it simply says the countries cannot lower \ntheir current environmental standards in order to gain a trade \nadvantage; is that correct?\n  Mr. REED. I think that's right. Again, I think it's probably not even \nthat clear in terms of what they can do because, essentially, as I read \nthe restrictive language directly related to trade, it could be read to \nsimply say that we have a product, for example, that we are sending in \nwith a label on it, and if the country objects to it or wants more \nlabeling, then we can say, well, that is impermissible. But as far as \nwhether they have pretreatment of their waste, as far as whether the \nrespirators in their factories, as far as whether they have \nenvironmental standards--air quality and water quality--that seems to \nbe totally off the table. But that is what impacts on the quality of \nthe workplace. Also, it is an inducement for capital to go from our \ncountry into these countries because, essentially, they are avoiding \ncosts.\n  The Senator probably was contacted, like I was, by individuals \nconcerned about the proposed ambient air quality regulations in the \nUnited States. Some representatives of major companies have bluntly \ntold me, ``If these pass, we are going to Mexico. They don't have these \nambient air quality standards, and we will avoid millions of dollars in \ncosts. We will just move out.''\n  Now, that might simply be a bluffing tactic, a negotiating ploy to \ntry to stop these regulations. But at some point, if we continue to try \nto have a clean and healthy and safe environment, these costs add up \nand companies can avoid them by going elsewhere.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator is absolutely right. Of course, the reason \nwe put in the environmental standards is we went through a long debate \nthat indicated we were paying a very heavy health cost because we \ndidn't have clean air and clean water. So we made the effort to get \nclean air and clean water, which I very strongly support. But now if \nyou are going to go into international trade and your competitors are \nfree of having to meet any of those standards, then they are, as you \nsay, at a competitive advantage in dealing with you. That is one of the \nthings we are facing. I can't, for the life of me, understand why it is \nunreasonable or impermissible to bring the environmental concerns into \nthe middle of the trade negotiations as well.\n  Mr. REED. The Senator is exactly right, in my view. Let me add \nanother point that I think is very important. We have talked about the \ninducements for capital investment because of low environmental quality \naround the world. We have talked about the effects on working men and \nwomen who are there in those factories in Ho Chi Minh City, Malaysia, \nthroughout the East, and in Mexico. I suggest that this has a real \nimpact in our own home communities, such as Baltimore, MD, and \nProvidence, RI, where small business men and women are struggling to \napply the environmental quality standards that we all passed and they \nagree with. We all see the benefits to our society and culture, but it \nis detrimental to their economic viability versus these countries \nacross the sea.\n\n  There is another factor, too. Just a few weeks ago, Senator Hagel and \nSenator Byrd came before this Senate with a resolution, Senate \nResolution 98. It essentially said that we are not going to tolerate an \nenvironmental regime internationally that puts the burden of \nremediation and cleanup on the United States to the detriment of our \neconomy. We are going to demand that developing countries also stand up \nand share the burden of cleaning up the environment. It passed with \noverwhelming support.\n  It seems just common sense that, of course, we are not going to \nprejudice ourselves in an international regime by saying we will add \nfurther burdens to us, as the developing world keeps spewing out bad \nair, polluting the waters, et cetera.\n  But in trade agreements, which are the focal point of most of our \nstrong, bilateral and multinational relationships, we have completely \nignored that point. So, on one hand, we are saying we have to get tough \nwith these countries down there and make them start cleaning up their \nenvironment. But when it comes to the point where the rubber meets the \nroad, where we are negotiating, we have leverage, and we want them to \nchange behavior, we say it is not important. We are talking out of both \nsides of our mouth.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator further yield?\n  Mr. REED. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Actually, at the very point when we have something we \ncan use as leverage to get the higher standard, which is access into \nthe American market, we are refusing to do it in order to achieve \ngreater equalization of these environmental standards. I can't, for the \nlife of me, understand why we are leaving the environmental matters out \nof the trade negotiations. I understand that it will not be the only \nthing in the trade negotiation; there will be other considerations as \nwell. But why it should be, as it were, excluded outside of that \nparameter, I can't, for the life of me, understand.\n  Mr. REED. I am equally amazed--if I may reclaim my time --by leaving \nthis out. Certainly the jewelry manufacturers in Rhode Island would \nsay, ``Put it in because I want them to clean their waste like I have \nto.'' Working men and women who have seen jobs lost because companies \nmoved out of their communities would say, put it in. But my suspicion \nis that many people who are promoting this legislation are supportive \nof those multinational corporations who say: Listen, we want to avoid \nenvironmental policy because we want to get our production out of the \nUnited States and get into these countries, and we don't want them to \nhave tough environmental standards.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield further on that point?\n  Mr. REED. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That leads to this: Many people have said these are not \nreally trade agreements that are being negotiated, or the impetus for \nthem is not trade; it is investment. These are investment agreements. \nAmong other things, a result of these agreements is extended protection \nfor American investment in other countries; in other words, as the \nSenator said, for the multinationals to be able to establish their \nproduction abroad rather than in this country. Well, of course, if they \nare going to do that, then they don't want the higher environmental or \nworking-condition standards.\n  Mr. REED. Again, I indicate that the Senator, I think, is absolutely \nright. Let me give an example within the text of the agreement. Part of \nthe negotiating objectives is to develop internationally agreed rules, \nincluding settlement procedures, which are consistent with the \ncommercial policies of the United States. So when it comes to \ncommercial law, dispute resolution, we want our American laws down \nthere because they are balanced, fair, they work, are effective, and \nare comfortable to the investors going to these countries.\n  I daresay, if we tried to substitute our ideas consistent with the \nenvironmental policy of the United States, we would draw the unalloyed \nopposition of the proponents of the fast-track procedure. In our view, \nI believe environmental quality is one important factor in terms of \neconomic competition between our country and other countries. So, in \neffect, I think you are right. I think that the thrust of this \nagreement\n\n[[Page S12113]]\n\nis that it is unbalanced. You and I--I will speak for myself--we \nbelieve that we have to have sensible rules about investment.\n  We have certain guarantees that our investors are protected. We have \nto have protection for intellectual property. We have to have \nprotections for dispute settlement. We certainly don't want to have a \nsituation where American companies go into a foreign land, make \ninvestments, and then can't repatriate their profits or, in fact, go to \ncourt and solve commercial disputes. That is fine. But we have to take \nthe next step. We also have to negotiate with those countries so that \ntheir environmental policies are not inconsistent with ours and at \nleast move toward an international standard.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield, I agree with the Senator \ncompletely. I think all of the items that he mentioned in terms of \nresolving commercial disputes, repatriation of earnings, and so forth \nobviously have to be part of a negotiating effort. But the \nenvironmental considerations should also be a part of the negotiating \neffort.\n  I think that is all the Senator's amendment seeks to do. It doesn't \nseek to displace those other goals or objectives. It simply seeks to \nadd to them so that it becomes a part of the negotiating focus and so \nthat environmental concerns will also be on the agenda instead of left \noff the agenda and not have so-called side agreements. We have been \nthrough those side agreements. We know full well--we did the same thing \non environment and on worker conditions--we know full well that in both \ninstances the side agreements don't amount to anything. Other things \nwhich are put right into the trade agreement become enforceable and \nhave to be adhered to. If they are not adhered to, they are contrary to \nthe trade agreement; the remedies that are provided for in the trade \nagreement go into effect. But they are not putting the environment and \nthe working conditions on the same status, the same level.\n  Mr. REED. The Senator from Maryland is absolutely correct. Recognize \nthat the major international environmental issues which we face--not \nalone, but collectively as a world community--are significant: global \nclimate change, which we were talking about recently; ozone depleting \nsubstances, which have affected all of us around the world; reduction \nin ship pollution of the ocean; international ocean dumping; \ntransboundary movement of hazardous waste materials and disposal. What \nhappens to all of this waste in countries where it is being produced? \nHow does it move from one country to another?\n  All of these are critical issues. Yet, within a context and scope of \nthis fast track agreement, they would be relegated, as the Senator from \nMaryland said, to side agreements at best. Our experience has been such \nthat these side agreements are ineffectual in most cases, if not all \ncases. If we put them in the center of our concerns as a negotiating \nobjective, not only will we make progress on these issues, but we will \nsend a strong signal to all of our potential trading partners that they \nhave to be prepared to come to the table and talk turkey about the \nenvironment and about how they will improve their environmental \nquality. That will result not only in a cleaner environment, which is \nan extremely noble objective and one that has very practical \nramifications, but it will also help level that competitive playing \nfield between those small businesspeople up in Rhode Island and \nBaltimore who are doing it already. All they ask us is to ensure, as we \nenter the world of international trade, that we try our best to bring \nup the standards of their competitors because they are their \ncompetitors. If we do that, then we leave it to them, their ingenuity, \ntheir imagination, and their skill to win the trade battle.\n  But essentially what we are doing today by taking those off the table \nis we are effectively dooming thousands of small businesses across this \ncountry to extinction.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield further, I think the Senator \nmade a very important point when he spoke about the contradiction in \nour approach. On the one hand, as he pointed out on the global warming \nissue and on the other environmental matters that he talked about, we \nare often engaged in negotiating with other countries to try to arrive \nat international environmental standards. Everyone says, ``Well, we \nhave to do that.'' On the other hand, when we come to trade agreements \nwhere we have an enhanced ability, since the entry into the American \nmarket is a very important objective that is sought abroad, we take the \nenvironmental matters out of that context altogether.\n  So the very place where we are most likely to be able to gain \nadvances on environmental standards and at the same time, as the \nSenator points out, avoid placing our own producers in a \ndisadvantageous position, we forswear dealing with those environmental \nquestions.\n  It just boggles the mind that this approach is being taken in this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. REED. I again agree wholeheartedly with the Senator. It is a \nsituation in which, when we go to table, we have direct one-on-one \nnegotiations, when we have as our leverage more liberal entry into our \nmarket, the largest market in the world, when we in fact have all of \nthe force and the power behind these types of negotiations, we simply \nsay we are not interested in the environment. Yet, when we go to \ninternational conferences, we say how not only must we all collectively \nclean up the environment, this Senate weeks ago said, by the way, the \ndeveloping world, the world which will be the parties to the bilateral \nagreements, they must do their share because we can't do it alone.\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Of course, when we go into the international \nenvironmental conferences, they say, ``You are the biggest offender,'' \nbecause we are the most highly developed country and, therefore, we are \nput on the defensive in trying to get an agreement on the environmental \nstandards. We are the most highly developed country, which is why in \nthe trade negotiations they are so anxious to come into the American \nmarket, but we leave out of the trade negotiations the environmental \nissues. It just doesn't make sense. It is diminishing our ability, it \nseems to me, to negotiate comprehensive, fair trading arrangements that \ndo not place our own producers at a significant disadvantage and do not \ncreate a downward pressure and downward movement with respect to \nprotecting and enhancing the environment.\n  Mr. REED. I agree with the Senator. I also would suggest that these \ngoals of better environmental quality, both here in the United States \nand worldwide, and increased international trade are not mutually \nexclusive.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The Senator made that point in the opening debate on \nthis issue where the Senator spoke about, I thought in a very \nperceptive way, what was important. What are your goals? What are your \nobjectives that are going to be focused upon in the trade negotiations? \nWe all want to arrive at these trade agreements if we can do so. The \nquestion then becomes, What are the goals? What are the objectives? The \nSenator pointed out that the goals were too narrowly focused. This is a \ndramatic example of that narrow focus.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator for that kind word. We have an \nopportunity to provide balance in this agreement. No one is objecting \nto the need for better support for investment overseas. No one is \nobjecting to the adoption of commercial laws and agricultural policies \nthat are better, and, in fact, according to this legislation, mirror \nU.S. policy.\n  But what we are saying is, if you simply create an environment for \ninvestment that leads to the opportunity for poor environmental \nquality--and I also add the environment--in which workers are hardly \npaid anything for hours of work--15 cents an hour is hardly something \nthat is going to compete with American workers and never should be \nsomething that we would see as a goal. We should raise those. But if we \ndo not do that, you have a one-sided agreement. You have an agreement \nwhich is a green light for capital to leave the United States and, as a \nresult, move jobs and production to those other countries. This is \ndetrimental to our small businesses, particularly some of our older \nindustries.\n  I don't believe it is inevitable that our old industries, like the \njewelry industry, the footwear industry, just inherently can't compete. \nThey can't\n\n[[Page S12114]]\n\ncompete if we allow countries of the world to pay 15 cents an hour, \nwith no real environmental enforcement, turning the other way when \nthere are regulatory problems, et cetera. But if we sought today to \ninsist in our trade agreements that environmental quality is raised, \nthat respect for workers and adequate wages are the order of the day, \nthen I think you would be surprised at the ability of our industry to \ncompete.\n  That is what I believe we are trying to do here today, is put some \nbalance in this legislation, recognize that unless we can enter into \nnegotiations on all the critical issues that affect goods coming to the \nUnited States, we will never solve all of the issues that the Senator \ntalked about.\n  Frankly, you can look at so many industries. The footwear industry is \na classic example. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, growing up \nnear Brockton, MA, that was the home of footwear manufacture for the \nwhole world. There is nothing left there. It is not because the workers \nweren't good workers. It wasn't because the managers didn't understand \nmanagerial techniques.\n  We allowed countries to ship into our country goods that were \nproduced at 10 cents an hour in conditions which we would not tolerate \nhere in the United States of America. And unless we recognize that we \nwill never get a handle on this issue of the trade deficit, the trade \nbalances that the Senator talked about with Senator Dorgan.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. REED. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Of course, the assertion used to be made, well, if we \nlost jobs in certain industries because our technology was always \nadvancing, we would be out doing the more complex, complicated \nproduction techniques and therefore we would gain jobs in those \nindustries. And if you think about it, there is something to that \ntheory.\n  But what has happened, in my perception, that undercuts that theory \nand why we are running these large trade deficits as a consequence is, \nfirst of all, as capital moves freely, capital moves into these \nundeveloped countries where there are no environmental standards and \nthere are no real working conditions. So then you have people who are \nworking 11, 12 hours a day for 15 cents an hour but the machines they \nare working on, because the capital has come in, are the same machines \nthat people would be working on in this country.\n  And so the ability of capital to move that way makes it even more \nimperative that these environmental and working condition issues be \nincluded within the trade negotiations.\n  Furthermore, even if the capital does not move, as it were, \nvoluntarily, some of these countries are demanding that it move as a \ncondition for having any trade. China has made it very clear that \ncompanies have to bring in their top-line technology and investment so \nthat they will then be the producers at the next economic turn.\n  So in order to get a contract, our people get a short-term contract, \nthey agree as part of selling the goods that they are also going to \nmove in the technology and the investment which then makes it possible \nfor them to produce the goods the next economic go-round. So no longer \nwill we not be able to sell to them, but it is my prediction they will \nthen become our competitors in other markets as well. So we are being, \nas it were, coerced into, in effect, providing technology, and yet we \nare told, well, we can't have as part of the trade negotiation evening \nup the environmental and the worker landscape, economic landscape.\n  Mr. REED. Again, the Senator is absolutely perceptive about these \nparticular issues. I noted before the article in today's New York Times \nabout Nike and Vietnam and one of the officers of Nike indicated that \nthe factory that was inspected was ``among the most modern in the \nworld,'' in fact directly competitive, ``but there are a lot of things \nthey could get better,'' according to the spokesman. But the point the \nSenator makes is well taken. This is not some old rattrap that was \nbuilt in the 1930's and has some ad hoc machines there. This is a \nmodern facility. It is a modern facility, the best technology to \nproduce footwear, but it is obvious from this report no thought or \nconcern was there to protect the workers to do the things we insist \nmust be done in our factories.\n  So the Senator is absolutely right. So far as the new machines to \nmake the product cheaper, better, faster, of higher quality, they are \nthere, but all of the other concerns that go to the bottom line of any \ncompany, environmental quality being a major one, they can be avoided, \nand that is what we are facing.\n  I believe that unless we elevate environmental considerations to a \nmajor negotiating objective, not only will we see the further \ndeterioration of the world's environment, not only will we be in a \nsituation where we go to international conferences with the rest of \nworld asking us to do more and more and more to raise our standards, \nmaking us less competitive, we are going to see the impact in our trade \nbalance dramatically and directly. This is not about altruism alone. \nThis is not about ecopolitics. This is not about sensitivity to the \nenvironment alone. It is all of those things, but it is something else. \nIt is something about having a system of trade laws which recognizes \nthe important bottom line impact of environmental quality here and with \nrespect to our trading partners.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Warner pertaining to the introduction of S. 1486 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, let me start out by saying that I am a \nstrong supporter of the environmental laws. Frankly, I would be willing \nto put my record as such up against any other Member of the U.S. \nSenate. And, as a supporter of environmental laws, I am, of course, \nanxious to see other countries, especially the developing countries, \nadopt similar policies to protect and strengthen the environment. But, \nhaving said that, I must say that I am forced to oppose the amendment \noffered by our distinguished junior Senator from Rhode Island.\n  His proposal would include authority, under fast track, to negotiate \nenvironmental standards and enforce those standards through trade \nsanctions. Fast track was never intended as a means to rewrite \nfundamental aspects of our domestic laws, such as the environmental \nlaws. I would point out that the basic rule of international trade is, \nof course, one of nondiscrimination. Where our laws fail to meet that \ntest, and do not otherwise benefit from an exception to a trade \nagreement, we are obliged to eliminate the discriminatory aspects of \nour law. That does not mean we have to weaken our laws. It does not \nmean that we have to lower our standards. It simply means that our laws \nhave to treat imported goods and services as they do competing U.S. \nproducts, in terms of the applicable taxes, the regulatory standards, \nand the other conditions of sale.\n  Fast track was designed solely for the purpose of allowing, when \nneeded, the conforming of our laws to our trade agreement obligations \nand the basic rule of nondiscrimination. The purpose of fast track is \nnot to craft legislation or regulatory standards from whole cloth, and \nthen run them through the legislative process under the guise of a \ntrade agreement.\n  I would have thought that all sides in the debate over trade and the \nenvironment could agree on that much. This bill would not allow the \nPresident to negotiate trade agreements that either raise or lower our \nenvironmental standards.\n  I would, of course, point out that the President does have that \ngeneral authority. And of course any agreement reached by his \nnegotiation is subject to the normal process of the Congress.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point? Is the normal \nprocess that we would be able to amend it?\n  Mr. ROTH. That is correct. The normal process would be that it would \nbe subject to amendment.\n  Mr. SARBANES. So what we are doing here with the fast track is \ndenying the normal process?\n  Mr. ROTH. Let me point out to the distinguished Senator from Maryland \nthat since 1974 it has been the practice and policy of the Congress to \ngive the\n\n[[Page S12115]]\n\nPresident authority to negotiate agreements with the assurance that \nwhatever he negotiates, so long as it meets the goals, the objectives \nof the legislation, can be brought to the Congress to be acted upon \nwithout amendment. So it is a special exception that has been used for \npurposes of trade negotiation.\n  And there is a very good reason for that. The good reason for that \nis, if we go way back, I think it was in 1974, it became obvious that \nif we were going to continue to lower barriers to open the opportunity \nto trade, that some device had to be made to make certain that what the \nPresident negotiated would be considered by the Congress and that there \nwould be a vote upon it. And that is exactly what has been done, down \nthrough the years since 1974. It has been the practice to give the \nPresident authority to negotiate, setting forth the goals and \nobjectives of those negotiations and with the assurance that he could \ntell the other countries that that agreement would come to the Congress \nand be voted.\n  So, yes, it is an exception, a special process to meet the \nconditions. I would point out that it seems to me, with all the \nproblems we have, our economy is doing extraordinarily well today, and \nhas been for the last 7 years. We have the lowest unemployment. \nInflation is down. I think something like 30 percent of our growth is \ndependent upon exports. So I think it has been a worthwhile policy and \none that ought to be continued.\n  In the past, Democratic Congresses have given it to Republican \nPresidents and I propose that this Republican Congress give a \nDemocratic President the same authority.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield just further for 1 minute, it \nis since 1975 that our trade balance has deteriorated in this \nextraordinary fashion. I understand the point. Everyone says we have \nbeen doing this. The consequence of doing this is--contrary to the \nwhole period prior to then, when we ran modest surpluses--we have now \nbeen running these very deep deficits. And the consequence of doing \nthat is that we are now a debtor nation. I defy anyone to say that this \nis a welcome trend, in terms of the U.S. economic position worldwide. \nWe have gone from being the largest creditor nation in the world to now \nwe are the largest debtor nation, and at the end of this year we will \nbe a debtor nation to the tune of $1 trillion.\n  Mr. ROTH. I would just say to my distinguished colleague, that our \neconomy has been doing extremely well and has been for the last 7 \nyears. So we must be doing something right.\n  Yes, the deficit joint account has risen in amount. But at the same \ntime, we are enjoying a growth, a prosperity without inflation, with \nvery low unemployment. So I think we are doing something right and I \nthink it is important to ensure that the economy continues to grow and \nprosper. I think that means it is important that we give this \nPresident, as we have past Presidents, the necessary authority for fast \ntrack.\n\n  Let me point out once again that fast track was designed solely for \nthe purpose of allowing us, when needed, to conform our laws to our \ntrade agreement obligations and the basic rules of nondiscrimination.\n  The purpose of fast track is not to craft legislation or regulatory \nstandards from whole cloth and then run them through the legislative \nprocess under the guise of a trade agreement. As I said earlier, I \nwould have thought that all sides in the debate over trade and \nenvironment could, indeed, agree on that much. This bill would not \nallow the President to negotiate trade agreements that either raise or \nlower our environmental standards. I believe that ensures that fast \ntrack will only be used for the purpose for which it was originally \nintended, implementing trade agreements, and not authorizing a \ndeparture from the ordinary course of Senate deliberations that is \nabsolutely necessary to achieve that end.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REED addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, if I may briefly comment upon the amendment. \nFirst, I recognize certainly the strong commitment of the Senator from \nDelaware to environmental quality in the United States. Indeed, because \nof his commitment and the commitment of many of my colleagues, we have \nenvironmental laws which are significant, which provide for high \nquality in our country. But the problem is that our foreign competitors \ndo not have anything close to these laws in many, many countries, \nparticularly countries with which we are endeavoring to establish \nbilateral trade relationships.\n  I agree with the Senator that the purpose of the fast-track procedure \nis to conform our laws to the negotiated results that the President \nachieves with our trading partners. I also believe and concur with the \nSenator that there is no attempt to lower or diminish our environmental \nlaws.\n  Simply stated, what my amendment would do is ask the President to go \nout and try to bring up, as best he can, foreign environmental laws to \nour laws. So, in effect, we would be asking him to go out and take what \nwe have done in the United States and try to apply it to another \ncountry, not simply because of its decency, its correctness in an \nintellectual way, but because of its profound impact in the pattern of \ntrade between our country and other countries of the world.\n  It is interesting in other areas of this underlying legislation, we \nare quite specific in directing the President to do just that: go out \nand bring up the laws of our potential trading partners to our level. \nFor example, in the section with respect to trade in services, we quite \nspecifically direct the President to ``develop internationally agreed \nrules, including dispute settlement procedures, which are consistent \nwith the commercial policies of the United States.''\n  I would be very happy if we had language like this that would say \nbring it up to the environmental policies of the United States. That is \nthe point that I am trying to make. I would be very happy if we changed \nnot one environmental law of the United States pursuant to fast track, \nthat we did not try to diminish or decrease any of our environmental \nlaws, but we simply ask the President to try to bring up their \nstandards somewhere near to our standards.\n  Not only would I be happy but, again, returning to the very strong, \nin my mind, analogy to my home State, I would be very happy if I could \ngo back to my jewelry manufacturers--these are small companies; many of \nthem have family connections over long, long periods of time where \nfathers and mothers have passed it on to sons and daughters--I would be \nvery happy if I could tell them our fast-track agreement has resulted \nin increased environmental standards so that they are not exactly like \nthe United States, but no longer will you have to provide pretreatment \nof your wastewater and then see competitors around the world simply \ndumping raw solvents into municipal wastewater systems. Not only would \nyou have to provide ventilation for your workers, but other \nentrepreneurs will have to try to do the same thing.\n  If we do that, I don't think it is violative of the spirit or the \nletter of fast track, but it will produce a much more even, competitive \nplaying field for our manufacturers versus our potential trading \npartners.\n  So I, again, urge that the Senate adopt this amendment that would \nmove environmental quality to the center of negotiations as a principal \nnegotiating objective, not because it is an altruistic noble goal \nalone, but because it impacts dramatically on the bottom line of \nAmerican companies and foreign companies and, in that sense, should be \npart of our trading policy, should be a key goal which our President is \nseeking to achieve in any negotiations. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, let me start out by saying that any \nagreement that raises environmental standards in a foreign country does \nnot, of course, need fast-track authority because it does not need any \nauthority. To make environmental standards subject to fast track, \ntherefore, means that changes to United States environmental laws would \nbe subject to an up-or-down vote with no amendments. Frankly, I am too \nmuch of a supporter of our standards to allow them to be changed in \nthis manner.\n\n[[Page S12116]]\n\n  Let me point out that, in any event, as I did make some mention, the \nPresident does have authority now to negotiate whatever he chooses in \nthe area of environmental laws. Of course, under the Constitution, he \nis responsible for negotiating international agreements, or he could \nnegotiate agreements that raise standards abroad or at home, or lower, \nsuch as he chooses.\n  But once he reaches an agreement with another country or countries, \nif it affects domestic law he, of course, has to bring it to Congress \nfor action. Of course, under the ordinary process, that legislation can \nbe amended. It does seem to me that, as a general rule, whether it is \nenvironmental, health, safety or whatever, we do want to have the \nprocess be the normal process where a matter comes up in both Houses \nand can be amended according to the rules of either House.\n\n  I point out that if someone wants to have fast track in a particular \narea beyond trade, that can be done. We had, as a matter of fact, given \nwhat is, in effect, fast track to base closing, because it was decided \nthat it was important in order to close any bases that the executive \nbranch propose what bases would close and Congress could vote it up or \ndown but not amend. So we made another exception in that case.\n  It can also be pointed out that somewhat the same was done in respect \nto the Budget Committee. The budget has to be acted upon within a \ncertain number of hours. There can be some amendments, but it is very \nlimited compared with what normally is the process in the U.S. Senate.\n  Mr. REED. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes.\n  Mr. REED. I understand the Senator's point--it is very well taken--\nabout the procedures. In a sense, it might prove too much. The idea \nthat we can do things outside of fast track raises or begs the question \nwhy we do certain things within fast track. Why, for example, are we \nsaying let's make foreign laws with respect to commercial practices \nconsistent with our laws, when, in fact, when it comes to the \nenvironment, we are saying, ``Oh, no, don't include environment in this \nsame context''?\n  I think perhaps the logic might be that some people either feel the \nenvironment is not important to international trade--and I think our \ndiscussions tonight should have indicated it is very important, indeed \ncrucial--or others are simply saying we want a trade agreement, an \narrangement with a foreign country which will allow us all the benefits \nof commercial practice in the United States, all the protection of \nintellectual property laws, all the protections for capital investment \nbut none of the burdens, if you will, of high-quality environmental \nlaws.\n  Again, I just can't understand, with respect, why we can't include \nenvironmental conditions as we have otherwise.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee desires to be recognized at this time.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to make a statement \nconcerning the bill that has been approved by--really an amendment \napproved by the Appropriations Committee. This afternoon we met, and \nthe Appropriations Committee has authorized me--and Senator Byrd--to \npresent an amendment to the District of Columbia appropriations bill. \nIt is before the Senate. And this will be an amendment in the nature of \na substitute.\n  We had hoped to be able to proceed at this time and get an agreement \nwith regard to that. I have asked the distinguished Democratic leader \nto join me. And I have discussed the matter with our leader.\n  The difficulty is that several Members still want to read over \nportions of that proposed amendment before we seek to proceed on it. \nAfter discussing it with the distinguished Democratic leader, I think \nthat is the better part of valor.\n  I had previously made the announcement that we would offer it tonight \nand hope to have debate tonight and vote tomorrow. We have a continuing \nresolution that expires tomorrow evening. But if the Democratic leader \nagrees, I think we will just hold off, and it would be the intention of \nthe leadership to try and move to bring this matter before the Senate \ntomorrow, as I understand it, sometime around 1 or 1:30 tomorrow \nafternoon.\n  If that meets with the Democratic leader's approval, we will just not \nproceed tonight.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, first of all, let me commend the \ndistinguished chairman for the work that they have put into this \neffort. I must say, this has moved us farther than I would have thought \nwe could have gone in the time that we have had.\n  These are very difficult issues, very controversial in some respects. \nI think the chairman and the ranking member have done a very good job. \nI intend to support the work product at the appointed time. But it is \nmultihundred-pages long, and we have, I think, a need to look through \nit, not necessarily as much for the issue content as it is the \ngrammatical content. And we are doing that now.\n  I think we will be ready to have a vote on it one way or the other in \nearly afternoon. Senator Lott and I have consulted with the \ndistinguished chairman. I personally would be prepared to go to a vote \nearly afternoon. I think we can accommodate that schedule. So I think \nthe distinguished chairman's recommendation is a good one. I hope we \ncan work in good faith in the remaining hours tonight to be able to be \nready to have that vote early tomorrow afternoon.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Democratic \nleader. Because of the expiration of the continuing resolution tomorrow \nnight, and the desire of Members not to be here next week on matters \nthat would require votes, I hope that we will be able to get to it \ntomorrow, and get it to the House in time for the House to consider it \nand dispose of it. We may face this bill coming back to us with an \namendment from the House before we are through tomorrow. So it would \nhave been my wish that we could have done it tonight, but under the \ncircumstances we will defer until tomorrow.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today is not simply he end of the 1st \nsession of the 105th Congress. For me, this day is one that brings both \nnew opportunities and old memories. Today marks the end of John Lundy's \n7 years of service to me, first as my administrative assistant and \nlater as my chief of staff. He has also served the great State of \nMississippi.\n  To truly understand John and his impact on others, we must go back to \nhis roots. John was raised on a farm in the small, rural town of \nLeland, MS. This upbringing taught him the meaning of community and the \nimportance of family. He is a proud Mississippian, and still refers to \nthe Delta as ``God's Country.'' John graduated from Mississippi State \nUniversity with a degree in agriculture--I guess he couldn't get into \nOle Miss.\n  He then moved to Washington shortly thereafter and found a job on the \nstaff of the Mississippi delegation in the House of Representatives. He \nwas single, young and full of ambition. Who would have guessed that he \nwould be returning to Mississippi 7 years later with a wife, a new baby \ngirl and a truck full of furniture?\n  When I asked John to join my staff, I knew he would be a quick study. \nHe\n\n[[Page S12117]]\n\nwas. He quickly jumped into the legislative fires with both feet.\n  John also quickly became involved in the demands of Washington's \npolitical world, but he never lost his Mississippi style. Or his \nMississippi perspective.\n  Mississippians have told me for years how much they enjoy coming to \nWashington to see John. He makes everyone feel comfortable--no \nformalities, no pretenses. John can comfortably sit next to a farmer \nfrom the Delta or a banker from the coast and listen to his or her \nconcerns. Visitors from the State are delighted to have one of their \nown paying attention to their needs, knowing that the message is not \ngoing to fade away the moment they leave. Mississippians knew that John \nwas an able steward of their concerns, that telling John was as good as \ntelling me.\n  There isn't a farmer in the State of Mississippi that doesn't know \nJohn Lundy, either personally or by reputation. John's knowledge of our \nState's many agriculture communities is unmatched in Washington. He is \nrespected for his understanding of the issues and his dedication to \nfinding a fair and equitable solution for all.\n  Mississippi's agriculture community was indeed fortunate to have John \nLundy in Washington during the 1996 farm bill debate. I found that, \nalthough John was my staff member, other Senators had adopted him as \ntheir key advisor on this bill. His tireless work on this very \ndifficult and complex legislation brought him the respect of both the \nState and national agriculture community.\n  Most importantly, John has always put Mississippi first. No matter \nwhat the situation or how high the stakes, the needs of the State came \nfirst. We all know how easy it is to get caught up in both the glitter \nand the rat race of Washington, DC, but John's focus has always been \nhundreds of miles south of the beltway.\n  Mississippians brought him problems, and he found them solutions. \nMany years have gone by since John joined my staff, but my admiration \nfor him has grown with each passing day.\n  Now the time has come for him to return to Mississippi, to take his \nyoung family back home. This past summer, he and his beautiful wife \nHayley was blessed with a baby girl, Eliza, who John says ``was born to \nbe in Mississippi.''\n  As the Lundy family makes their way back to Mississippi, I would like \nto thank them for being such an important part of my life. I cannot \nthank John enough for his many years of hard work and dedication. He \ncertainly leaves big shoes to fill. His quiet humility and generous \nspirit will be missed by my entire staff. I will miss his guidance and \nfriendship.\n  John, I wish you nothing but the best of luck in the future, May you \nand your family be richly blessed in the coming years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12116-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    NOMINATION OF RAYMOND C.FISHER TO BE ASSOCIATE ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

There has been no \nexplanation of justification for this delay and lack of action.\n  I recall when the Senate Republican leadership delayed the vote on \nthe nomination of Eric Holder to the Deputy Attorney General position \nthat we were told there were Senators with problems. I also remember \nthat when I insisted on a rollcall vote on that nomination, after it \nhad been stalled on the Senate Calendar for more than 3 weeks, the \nproblems had all been resolved and the Senate confirmed Mr. Holder \nunanimously. One hundred Senators voted for that nomination.\n  I urge the Republican leadership to allow the Senate to confirm Ray \nFisher to be Associate Attorney General of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12117-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nwithdrawals and nominations which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12117-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         enrolled bills signed\n\n  At 2:15 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following bill:\n\n       S. 858.

A bill to amend the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United \nStates to extend to certain fine jewelry certain trade benefits of \ninsular possessions of the United States; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            HARMONIZED TARIFF SCHEDULE AMENDMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce a \nbill to amend the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States to \nextend certain trade benefits to fine jewelry produced in the U.S. \nVirgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa.\n  Under current law, additional U.S. Note 5 to Chapter 91 of the \nHarmonized Tariff Schedule provides limited duty-free treatment and \nduty refunds to certain watches and watch movements produced in the \nU.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa. The bill I am \nintroducing today would also make certain articles of fine jewelry \nproduced in these insular possessions, eligible for certain note 5 \nbenefits, thereby significantly expanding economic opportunities for \ninsular possession manufacturers and their workers. At the same time, \nthis bill expressly provides that the extension of note 5 benefits to \njewelry may not result in any increase in the authorized amount of \nbenefits established by note 5.\n  This legislation will promote needed employment and economic \ndevelopment in the U.S. insular possessions, particularly the U.S. \nVirgin Islands, by providing insular possession manufacturers with \ngreater flexibility in the use of certain existing trade benefits.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire text of the \nbill be placed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1457\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled, That the \n     additional U.S. notes to chapter 71 of the Harmonized Tariff \n     Schedule of the United States are amended by adding at the \n     end the following new note:\n       ``3.(a) Notwithstanding any other provision in additional \n     U.S. note 5 to chapter 91, any article of jewelry provided \n     for in heading 7113 which is the product of the Virgin \n     Islands, Guam, or American Samoa (including any such article \n     which contains any foreign component) shall be eligible for \n     the benefits provided in paragraph (h) of additional U.S. \n     note 5 to chapter 91, subject to the provisions and \n     limitations of that note and of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) \n     of this note.\n       ``(b) Nothing provided for in this note shall result in an \n     increase or a decrease in the aggregate amount referred to in \n     paragraph (h)(iii) of, or quantitative limitation otherwise \n     established pursuant to the requirements of, additional U.S. \n     note 5 to chapter 91.\n       ``(c) Nothing provided for in this note shall be construed \n     to permit a reduction in the amount available to watch \n     producers under paragraph (h)(iv) of additional U.S. note 5 \n     to chapter 91.\n       ``(d) The Secretary of Commerce and the Secretary of the \n     Interior shall issue such regulations, not inconsistent with \n     the provisions of this note and additional U.S. note 5 to \n     chapter 91, as they determine necessary to carry out their \n     respective duties under this note. Such regulations shall not \n     be inconsistent with substantial transformation requirements \n     established by the United States Customs Service but may \n     define the circumstances under which articles of jewelry \n     shall be deemed to be `units' for purposes of the benefits, \n     provisions, and limitations of additional U.S. note 5 to \n     chapter 91.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. \n        Conrad, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Kerrey, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Boxer, and \n        Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 1459. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na 5-year extension of the credit for producing electricity from wind \nand closed-loop biomass; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 wind production tax credit legislation\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce important tax \nlegislation for myself, Senator Jeffords, Senator Murkowski, Senator \nConrad, Senator Kerrey, Senator Harkin, Senator Feinstein, Senator \nBoxer, and Senator Johnson.\n  Our legislation extends the production tax credit for energy produced \nfrom wind. This legislation is similar to that which passed the Senate \nas part of the Senate's tax bill attached to the balanced budget \nreconciliation bill this summer. Unfortunately, it was dropped in \nconference between the House and the Senate, and did not become part of \nthe Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.\n  Since the Senate has acted favorably on this wind energy production \ntax credit legislation in the past, I would like to ask Senators to \nconsider it again next year. I am introducing it this year because I \nwant to make sure that it gets an opportunity for cosponsorship.\n  As we all know, our Nation's energy supply is both limited and \ncontroversial. However, energy produced from\n\n[[Page S12120]]\n\nwind is clean, renewable and homegrown. There is nothing limited or \ncontroversial about this source of energy, the wind. Americans need \nonly to make the necessary investments in order to capture it for \npower.\n  Our legislation extends the production tax credit and the focus on \nenergy produced from wind through the month of June, 2004. Scientists \nblame excessive carbon dioxide for global warming. The chief sources of \nenvironmentally dangerous carbon dioxide are emissions from the burning \nof fossil fuels. Obviously, we need other safer sources. Wind energy is \nclean, abundant, and a U.S. resource that produces electricity with \nvirtually no carbon dioxide emissions.\n  Every 10,000 megawatts of wind energy can reduce carbon dioxide \nemissions by 33 million metric tons. Today, our Nation produces only \n1,700 megawatts of wind energy. However, the American Wind Energy \nAssociation estimates that U.S. wind capacity can reach 30,000 \nmegawatts by the year 2010. This is enough electricity to meet the \nneeds of 10 million homes, while reducing pollution in every State in \nthe Nation.\n  Americans naturally find abundant wind in every State in the Union. \nWind is a homegrown energy. No foreign powers can control our source of \nwind energy. No American soldiers or sailors will ever need to fight in \nforeign wars to protect our supply of wind energy, as they must in the \ncase of oil. For example, consider the Persian Gulf war. No \nsupertankers will ever crack up in the sea and pollute our beaches \nbecause of energy produced from wind.\n  In short, wind energy is a good investment in the present and the \nfuture. Our legislation extends the successful wind energy production \ntax credit. It is a very successful way of promoting this source of \nenergy. It is a cheap investment with high returns for ourselves, our \nchildren, our grandchildren and their grandchildren. The Senate needs \nto again pass this important legislation to ensure the wind energy \nproduction tax credit into the next century. I encourage all of my \ncolleagues to cosponsor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1459\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. 5-YEAR EXTENSION OF CREDIT FOR PRODUCING \n                   ELECTRICITY FROM WIND AND BIOMASS.\n\n       Paragraph (3) of section 45(c) of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 (defining qualified facility) is amended by striking \n     ``1999'' and inserting ``2004''.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I enthusiastically join my colleagues \nin offering legislation that would allow wind and biomass energy to \ncontinue to advance as commercially viable renewable energy sources. \nThis legislation will allow wind and biomass energy to play a \ncompetitive role in the growing domestic energy market.\n  Through the Energy Policy Act of 1992, Congress established a \nmechanism to increase investments in new or emerging energy \ntechnologies. In 2 years, this credit will expire. Companies developing \nwind energy, who require a 2-3 year lead time for installing new wind \nmachines, were not able to take advantage of the available credit \nbefore it expired. Congress should extend the credit program to allow \ncontinued efforts to increase production of electricity from wind and \nbiomass.\n  To date, significant progress has been made in the development of \nwind energy, and this industry is poised to further increase its \nproduction capacity. With support from Congress through research and \ndevelopment funding and tax credits wind energy has become more \ncompetitive and the technology has improved in designs and operation. \nGeneration costs from wind have dropped from 25 cents per kilowatt hour \nin 1980 to a low of 7 cents per kilowatt hour today for wind power. \nInvestments in new technological improvements will further reduce the \ncost of this energy source and will enable the industry to play a key \nrole in the new competitive electric utility environment.\n  Likewise, biomass energy technologies, which are derived from any \nplant material and some forms of animal waste, are continuously \nimproving in performance and cost.\n  Madam President, I want to emphasize the importance of using \nrenewable energy to meet our growing demand for energy. Renewable \nenergy is important for several reasons: First, it does not produce \nharmful, life-threatening pollution; second, it is capable of providing \nample energy to meet the huge amount of demand that is forecasted; \nthird, it increases our energy and economic security; and fourth, since \nmore than 2 billion people in the world live without electricity, it \ncreates jobs in the United States.\n  I thank my colleagues for working with me to extend the credit \nprogram for producing energy from wind and biomass.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senators Grassley and \nJeffords as a proud cosponsor of legislation to extend the wind energy \nproduction tax credit. I want to commend the primary sponsors of this \nlegislation for their leadership in developing this bill. The bill we \nare introducing today takes an important next step in encouraging the \ndevelopment of this very important source of renewable energy. Wind \nenergy offers great promise for putting America on the road to greater \nenergy independence and economic prosperity.\n  I have been a long-time supporter of developing additional sources of \nrenewable energy, particularly energy from wind and crops. In 1993, \nSenator Grassley and I introduced S. 1180, the Wind Energy Incentives \nAct of 1993, to provide additional incentives for developing our wind \nenergy resources. My home State of North Dakota has abundant wind \nenergy resources, more than any other State. I have often referred to \nNorth Dakota as the ``Saudi Arabia of wind energy.''\n  I strongly support encouraging development of additional sources of \nenergy because I am extremely concerned that the United States \ncontinues to face a serious energy problem. While we do not see the \nlong gas lines of the 1970's, today we import more than half the oil we \nuse, up from about 30 percent in 1974. While we no longer depend on \njust a few sources for that oil, it remains a dangerous dependence, and \nmakes up a significant portion of our trade deficit.\n  In 1992, Congress passed and the President signed the Energy Policy \nAct, which took a number of important steps toward developing our own \nenergy resources here at home. One provision was the production tax \ncredit of 1.5 cents per kilowatt hour for wind energy. This credit is \nmeant to reduce the cost of these renewable energy sources to make them \ncompetitive with conventional energy sources. It is also meant to \nencourage the development of these new resources to the point where \neconomies of scale enable them to compete in their own right.\n  The wind production tax credit established by the 1992 Energy Policy \nAct is set to expire in just 2 years. However, the financing and \npermitting required for a typical new wind facility requires 2- to 3-\nyears of lead time. Because the wind production tax credit will expire \nin 2 years without the extension we are introducing today, investment \nfunds to develop new wind projects are drying up, unnecessarily halting \nfuture project planning. Additionally, the cost of wind energy \nproduction has dropped significantly from its earlier days, and as the \ntechnology matures the cost will continue to drop.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in taking this step toward energy \nindependence by cosponsoring this legislation.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to cosponsor \nlegislation introduced by my colleagues Senator Grassley and Senator \nJeffords to extend the production tax credit, a tax incentive to \nencourage wind-generated energy.\n  Today, California's Tehachapi-Mojave area is the world's largest \nproducer of wind-generated electricity. The New York Times has \ndescribed the area's 5,000 electricity producing wind turbines as a \nvision of the future. Wind generation energy provides a renewable, \nclean, environmentally sound source of energy in California. I am \npleased to lend my support to the Grassley-Jeffords legislation.\n  The production tax credit provides a 1.5 cent tax credit for each \nkilowatt of\n\n[[Page S12121]]\n\nelectricity produced in the United States during the first ten years a \nnew wind energy production facility is in service. The legislation is \nan inexpensive way to encourage clean, efficient and sustainable energy \nfuture for our children and grandchildren.\n  Under current law, the production tax credit is scheduled to expire \nin 1999, complicating the planning and development of new wind energy \ngeneration facilities. New wind energy facilities, like any major \nconstruction project, take several years to move from planning to \noperation. Without the certainty of the credit after 1999, investors \nwill be reluctant to commit funds for the development of new wind \nenergy facilities. Industry officials have already noticed a decline in \ninvestment, which can be attributed to the credit's uncertainty.\n  Wind energy is the world's fastest growing energy technology. The \namount of wind-generated power has increased by 25 percent each year \nduring the last 5 years, growth which is expected to accelerate through \n2010. Wind-generated energy is expected to become a $400 billion \nindustry worldwide by 2020. However, most of the growth is occurring in \nEurope, rather than here in the United States. No new wind power \ngeneration development has occurred in the United States since 1991.\n  I am pleased that California companies, including those in south and \ncentral California, are among the world's leading manufacturers and \ndevelopers of wind energy facilities. If domestic firms are able to \ncapture even one-fourth of the jobs associated with serving the growing \nmarket, the growth would support approximately 150,000 jobs. These are \nhigh-technology engineering jobs, traditional areas of strength for \nCalifornia, providing a solid economic foundation.\n  The Grassley-Jeffords legislation will have important environmental \nconsequences as well. The President's initiative against global warming \nincludes $5 billion program of tax incentives, which could include the \nextension of the production tax credit. Coal is currently the Nation's \nlargest source of power, providing 55 percent of the Nation's energy \nneeds. However, coal has the highest level of carbon dioxide, when \ncompared with the amount of electricity produced. Wind production \nenergy is a significantly cleaner alternative, helping to decrease \ncarbon dioxide emissions. Wind energy could supply 30,000 megawatts of \nenergy by 2010, rather than current 1,700 megawatts today, reducing \ncarbon dioxide emissions by 18%. These are cost-effective steps for our \nenergy future.\n  I am pleased to join Senator Grassley, who has demonstrated his long-\nstanding commitment to this important issue, and cosponsor the \nGrassley-Jeffords legislation. Without an extension, I am concerned \nwind energy production will not be able to develop, undermining \neconomic, environmental and clean air goals. Wind generation energy \nprovides a renewable, clean, environmentally sound source of energy for \nCalifornia's future. I am pleased to lend my support to the \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FAIRCLOTH:\n  S. 1458. A bill to restrict the use of the exchange stabilization \nfund; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n       THE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR INTERNATIONAL BAILOUTS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, last week, the Treasury Department \nannounced that it planned to use $3 billion from the exchange \nstabilization fund for a bailout of Indonesia. This fund was \nestablished in the 1930's to protect the U.S. dollar. It was not \ndesigned to be the personal piggy bank of the Secretary of the Treasury \nto bail out other countries whenever he desires.\n  The legislation I am introducing would require that, when this fund \nis used to be part of an international bailout in excess of $250 \nmillion, such use would require congressional approval.\n  Using this fund for Indonesia is the same procedure that was used to \nbypass the Congress for the bailout of Mexico. At the time we were told \nthat the emergency bailout of Mexico was needed because they were our \nneighbor, friend, and that economic instability would spill thousands \nof immigrants into the United States.\n  I find no such rationale for Indonesia. In fact, what is occurring is \nthat we are seeing a tidal wave of bailouts coming our way from Asia.\n  Apparently, the need for the bailouts is greater than the resources \nof the IMF. This is the reason the United States has had to resort to \ntaking money from our own reserves to bail out Indonesia.\n  In fact, the tidal wave has already started. The Philippines in July \nfor $1 billion. Thailand for $16 billion in September. Now comes \nIndonesia for $23 billion in November. The price tag keeps getting \nbigger and we don't know where it is going to stop. The Treasury \nSecretary tried to keep us out of the first two bailouts--but the price \ntag is getting too big--now direct United States dollars are being \ncalled upon for the Asian bailouts.\n  This week Business Week is suggesting the price tag is as high as \n$100 billion. Who is next? South Korea, Malaysia? Perhaps China and \nJapan--whose banks are holding billions in bad loans?\n  What is really outrageous about this situation is that these are the \nvery same countries that we have been running massive trade deficits \nfor years.\n  With Thailand we have a $4.6 billion trade deficit. Indonesia a $4 \nbillion deficit. Philippines a $2 billion deficit. South Korea a $1 \nbillion trade deficit--and China and Japan are off the charts.\n  These are the same countries that have kept out U.S. imports with \nphony trade rules and insider deals. These are the same countries that \nhave closed banking systems.\n  Indonesia, in particular, was so flush with cash apparently, that \nthey could afford to funnel millions in campaign contributions to \ninfluence U.S. elections--and here we are, the United States, bailing \nthem out. Is it any wonder that the average American worker has no \nfaith that the Federal Government in Washington cares about him or her.\n  We have got people living paycheck to paycheck in this country. We \ndon't need to bail out foreign ministers, foreign banks and securities \nfirms, and rich Wall Street bankers that lent too much money to \ndeveloping nations.\n  The average American has to tell half his life story just to get a \nmortgage loan--and yet Wall Street is loaning billions to these Asian \ncountries on the nod of some foreign finance minister.\n  Now the bill for the bailout is being handed to the U.S. taxpayer. I \nfind it deplorable. The auto plant worker, the secretary, the small \ntown banker--all are being asked to turn over their tax dollars so we \ncan ship them to Asia.\n  I think President Clinton and Robert Rubin need to realize that Wall \nStreet and Indonesia did not elect them--the people of the United \nStates did, and that is who they own their loyalties to. They need to \nremember that.\n  Mr. President, I can promise you that in the next session of \nCongress--this will not continue. I plan to subject every foreign \nbailout dollar to congressional approval. This legislation is the first \nstep in that process.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG:\n\n  S. 1460. A bill for the relief of Alexandre Malofienko, Olga Matsko, \nand their son Vladimir Malofienko; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                       Private Relief Legislation\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nprovide permanent residency in the United States for 13-year-old Vova \nMalofienko and his family, residents of Short Hills, NJ. An identical \nbill is being introduced in the House of Represenatives today by \nCongressman Steve Rothman and Congressman Bob Franks. Vova Malofienko \nhas leukemia from his having lived 30 miles from the Chornobyl nuclear \nreactor in Ukraine during and after the infamous disaster. His leukemia \nis in remission only because of the emergency medical treatment he's \nreceived in the United States.\n  Were Vova forced to return to Ukraine, the United States would be \nplacing an innocent child near the front of the line on death row. Vova \nwas one of eight children of Chornobyl who came to the United States in \n1990--and when the seven others later returned to Ukraine, they died \none by one because of inadequate cancer treatment. Not a child \nsurvived.\n  On behalf of the Malofienkos, I ask my colleagues for their \ninvaluable support for this legislation. We are a compassionate nation \nthat should open its\n\n[[Page S12122]]\n\nheart to Vova and his family, who came in dire medical need.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to tell my \ncolleagues a bit more about Vova and his family. Vladimir ``Vova'' \nMalofienko was born on 6/29/84 in Chernigov, Ukraine. His mother, Olga \nMatsko, was born on 9/29/59 in Piratin, Ukraine, and his father, \nAlexander Malofienko, was born on 12/25/57 in Chernigov, Ukraine.\n  Vova was only 2 when the Chornobyl reactor exploded in 1986 and \nexposed him to radiation. He was diagnosed with leukemia in June 1990 \nat age 6. Vova and his mother came to the United States later in 1990 \non a B-1 visitor's visa so that Vova could attend a cancer treatment \ncamp for children, sponsored by the Children of Chornobyl Relief Fund. \nVova was invited to stay in the United States to receive more extensive \ntreatment and chemotherapy. In November of 1992, Vova's cancer went \ninto remission. Vova's father, Alexander Malofienko joined the family \nin 1992, also on a B-1 visa.\n  The Malofienko family is currently in the United States with extended \nvoluntary departure through March of 1998. Alexander Malofienko's \nsecond application for labor certification is pending before the New \nJersey Department of Labor. The first application for Labor \ncertification was denied.\n  Vova and his family desire to remain in the United States because of \nthe extraordinary health concerns facing Vova. Regrettably, as I \nmentioned earlier, Vova is the only survivor from a group of eight \nchildren of Chornobyl who came to the United States together in 1990. \nThe seven other children returned to Ukraine and have since died. Now \nthat Vova is in remission, it would indeed be tragic to return him to \nan environment which would once again endanger his life. The air, food, \nand water in Ukraine are contaminated with radiation that people \nresiding there for several years have grown accustomed to, but which \ncould be perilous to Vova's weakened immune system.\n  Furthermore, treatment available in Ukraine is not as sophisticated \nand up to date as treatment available in the United States. Before Vova \ncame to the United States, no aggressive treatment for his leukemia had \nbeen provided. Although Vova completed his chemotherapy in 1992, he \ncontinues to need medical follow-up on a consistent basis, including \nphysical examinations, lab work and radiological examinations to assure \nearly detection and prompt and appropriate therapy in the unfortunate \nevent the leukemia recurs.\n  According to Dr. Peri Kamalakar, Director of the Valerie Fund \nChildren's Center at Newark Beth Israel hospital, where Vova has \nreceived care, Vova's cancer is considered high risk with a threat of \nrelapse. He is also at risk to develop significant late complications \nsecondary to the intensive chemotherapy he received, including heart \nproblems and secondary cancers. Another significant risk is relapse in \nthe bone marrow, testis, or central nervous system. Dr. Kamalakar has \nconcluded that Vova's chance for a permanent cure is considerably \nbetter if he stays in the United States.\n  Every one of the risks to Vova's health would be magnified by what is \nonly the recent emergence of the full effects of Chornobyl. Birth \ndefects in the Chornobyl area have doubled. Thyroid cancer has \nincreased 80 times--a rate too horrifying to comprehend. And the total \nnumber of children whose health will be at risk for the rest of their \nlives is over a million.\n  Vova Malofienko has been embraced by all those who know him for his \ngrace, dignity, and courage. He has also gained national attention by \nassisting with the philanthropic efforts of the Children of Chornobyl \nRelief Fund. It would be extremely disruptive to him and his family, in \naddition to causing great financial and emotional hardship, if they are \nnot allowed to remain together in the United States in order to protect \nVova's health. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nincluded in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1460\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Frank Lautenberg said yesterday that he will introduce \n     legislation expressly to grant Vova Malofienko of Millburn \n     and his family permanent residency.\n       Lautenberg plans to introduce the ``emergency relief bill'' \n     during the week of Oct. 20, following the Columbus Day \n     recess. In the spring, the senator pressured the Immigration \n     and Naturalization Service to grant the Malofienkos a one-\n     year emergency extension to stay in America.\n       Vova, whose cancer is in remission, could suffer a relapse \n     if he returns to Ukraine because he is not used to the \n     radiation-contaminated air, food and water, according to his \n     physician, Dr. Peri Kamalakar of the Newark Beth Israel \n     Medical Center. ``My concern is, God forbid, he gets a \n     relapse back in Ukraine. I do not think they have the \n     facilities to give him the proper treatment to save his \n     life,'' the doctor said.\n       Vova also received chemotherapy to treat his cancer, which \n     puts him at a greater risk for leukemia or another malady if \n     he is exposed to radiation, Kamalakar noted. ``I feel it is \n     very important for Vova's life to remain in this country.''\n       Lautenberg yesterday expressed hope that the legislation \n     will pass before the family's emergency visa runs out in \n     April.\n       ``I am introducing this bill not only to keep my promise to \n     Vova and his family, but also to keep the promise to \n     America,'' the senator said. ``We are a compassionate nation \n     that has to open our hearts and borders to all those like \n     Vova who came here legally and in dire medical need.''\n       Vova came to America in 1990 with seven other Ukrainian \n     children, all sick from radiation exposure. Their trip to \n     actor Paul Newman's camp in Connecticut was sponsored by the \n     Children of Chernobyl Relief Fund of Short Hills, which \n     airlifts medical treatment and supplies to children afflicted \n     by the 1986 disaster.\n       The seven other children in the group all returned to \n     Ukraine and have since died.\n       ``They basically got a death sentence,'' Lautenberg said. \n     ``And I will never, ever let that happen to Vova.''\n       Lautenberg said he is introducing the legislation now, six \n     months before the family is forced to return to Ukraine, ``to \n     avoid the kind of last-minute life or death situation that \n     the bureaucracy put the Malofienkos through before.''\n       Vova yesterday said he is very happy the senator is \n     introducing special legislation on his behalf and is ``very \n     grateful to him,'' but the serious 13-year-old said, ``I do \n     not know if it will be approved or not,'' so he did not want \n     to get his hopes up.\n       ``At first it was like a dream,'' said Vova's mother Olga \n     Matsko, who received a phone call from Lautenberg's office \n     yesterday afternoon. ``How grateful I am to what the senator \n     has done for our family.''\n       Matsko, who uses her maiden name, said she only hopes that \n     the bill passes in Congress. ``I cannot believe that our hard \n     fight is probably over.''\n       Vova's family has been struggling to remain in America with \n     both parents working full-time jobs and sharing a \n     superintendent's job at their Millburn apartment building. \n     Matsko works as an accountant during the day, and the father \n     works as a mechanic for Lea & Perrins Inc. of Fair Lawn at \n     night.\n       Alexander Malofienko, Vova's father, lost his job at Tetley \n     Tea of Morris Plains last spring. He then had to find not \n     only a job, but a company to sponsor him for his labor \n     certificate so the family could remain in the United States.\n       He found a company to sponsor him, but his application got \n     stuck in ``gridlock'' at the state Labor Department in \n     Trenton, where there is a 30 percent increase in alien labor \n     certificate applications, Lautenberg said. The department is \n     one year behind in processing these applications, not enough \n     time for the Malofienkos.\n       The labor certificate, once approved by the state, is then \n     forwarded to the U.S. Department of Labor in New York for its \n     review.\n\n[[Page S12123]]\n\n       Joshua Rosenblum, a spokesman for the state Labor \n     Department, was not aware of Vova's plight or the father's \n     application. He said his office was searching for the \n     application and had not located it by late yesterday \n     afternoon.\n       Lautenberg also sent a letter to Gov. Christie Whitman \n     appealing to her ``to do everything possible to assure that \n     the Malofienko family does not face deportation due to \n     administrative inertia and bureaucratic entanglements.''\n       A spokesman for Whitman, Gene Herman, said the Governor's \n     Office would investigate. He said delays in the state's \n     processing of the application may have been caused by cuts in \n     federal funds.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the Star-Ledger, Newark, NJ, March 14, 1997]\n\n  Chernobyl Victim Gets Extended Stay in U.S.; Senator Helps Youth in \n                          Life-or-Death Fight\n\n                          (By Allison Freeman)\n\n       ``Today we saw what can be done when a compassionate \n     America opens its heart.''\n       A 12-year-old boy, in remission from leukemia he contracted \n     from exposure to the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine, \n     will get to remain in the United States for at least another \n     year, thanks to the help of Senator Frank Lautenberg.\n       Vova Malofienko and his parents, who were scheduled to be \n     deported April 10, will get another year to obtain permanent \n     residency in this country.\n       For Vova, it could be the difference between life and \n     death. ``My heart fills with joy for the work everybody has \n     done,'' the boy said last night. ``I want to stay in this \n     country.''\n       The articulate young man, an honors student in Millburn \n     Middle School, said he is thankful to Lautenberg and everyone \n     else who has helped him.\n       ``This is a great day,'' the New Jersey Democrat said as he \n     smiled at the boy during a press conference in the Senator's \n     Newark office. ``Today we saw what can be done when a \n     compassionate America opens its heart.''\n       Vova's parents need green cards to work in the United \n     States. Getting them is almost impossible due to recent \n     federal legislation that requires people to remain in this \n     country for 10 years before they can apply, yet makes it \n     difficult to remain in the country that long.\n       Lautenberg attributed the tougher immigration laws to the \n     ``U.S. turning more and more inward'' and tightening the \n     rules so there is not enough room for everyone who wants to \n     say.\n       The Senator credited Monica Slater of his staff for working \n     with Immigration and Naturalization Service officials to help \n     extend the Malofienkos's stay in the country. ``Our work has \n     paid off,'' Lautenberg said.\n       Vova, a mature sixth-grader, came to America in 1990 at the \n     age of 5 with a group of seven other Ukrainian children, all \n     sick from radiation exposure.

A bill to establish a youth mentoring program; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                       the jump ahead act of 1997\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, millions of young people cry out for \nhelp. It would be irresponsible to turn our backs and do nothing when a \nsolution is not only at hand--but has already proven a helping hand. \nThe problem is ``at-risk'' youth. The solution is mentoring.\n  Mr. President, let me give you some idea of the scope of the problem. \nLast month the census released a report that said half of America's 16 \nand 17 year olds are at-risk children. Half. That's 3.7 million \nchildren at just those two ages. Other estimates run as high as 15 \nmillion for children of all ages.\n  Among the factors putting these children at risk are poverty and \nbeing raised in a single-parent family. Twenty-one percent of our \nchildren live in poverty--a six point increase since 1970. Twenty-eight \npercent live in one-parent households--a 16-percent increase since \n1970. These ``at-risk'' children are more likely to drop out of school \nand be unable to find work. And that, Mr. President, is the path to \ndrugs and crime. Mentoring is a proven way to reach out to these kids \nand provide them with caring role models who can help turn their lives \naround.\n  Earlier this month, Attorney General Janet Reno reported that violent \ncrime by teenagers had dropped for the second straight year. Among the \nreasons for the drop, General Reno cited the community mentoring \nprograms that we created with the original Juvenile Mentoring Program, \nor JUMP, in 1992.\n  Since its enactment, JUMP has funded 93 separate mentoring programs \nin more than half the states. The competition for JUMP awards is great: \nOver 479 communities submitted applications for the recent round of \ngrants.\n  JUMP grantees use a variety of program designs. Mentors include law \nenforcement and fire department personnel, college students, senior \ncitizens, Federal employees, business people, professionals, and other \ndiverse volunteers.\n  The children are of all races. They come from urban, suburban, and \nrural communities, ranging in age from 5 to 20. In its first year, JUMP \nhelped to keep thousands of at-risk young people in 25 States in school \nand off the streets through one-to-one mentoring.\n  Mr. President, this program has proved popular and effective and that \nis why today Senator Coats and I are introducing the JUMP Ahead Act of \n1997. I want to thank Senator Coats for his commitment and I am pleased \nthat he is an original cosponsor of this bill.\n  General Reno was not speaking idly when she touted the benefits of \nmentoring. A 1995 scientific study of the Big Brothers/Big Sisters \nPrograms bears this out.\n  The study tracked 959 children in eight cities. Of the children \nstudied, 40 percent came from broken homes, 27 percent had been abused, \n28 percent came from homes where the spouse was abused, and 15 percent \nhad suffered the death of a parent. This was a classic pool of at-risk \nchildren.\n  The results after just 1 year were startling. Compared to children \nwho were on a waiting list to enter the program, the children in the \nstudy abused alcohol 27 percent less, were 32 percent less likely to \nengage in violent behavior, and missed 52 percent fewer school days.\n  These dramatic results were achieved at a cost of just $1,000 a \nmatch. Compare that to the $24,000 a year we're willing to spend to put \nsomeone in jail once they've dropped out of school and turned to crime \nor drugs. You are going to hear a lot of statistics today. But too \noften we lose sight of the human aspect of these numbers. So let me \ntell you the story of a single child.\n  Recently, I hosted a conference on mentoring in my home State of New \nJersey. There I met 11-year-old Kenneth Jackson. Once Kenneth had been \na troubled student who was considered likely to drop out. Now, thanks \nto his mentor, Kenneth reads and does arithmetic at two grades above \nhis actual sixth grade level. And the best news--Kenneth told me that \nnow he thinks school is cool and that he never thinks about dropping \nout. It's hard to argue with success like that.\n  Sadly, Kenneth's mentor--Dwight Giles--is no longer with us. He \nrecently\n\n[[Page S12124]]\n\ndied of a heart attack. Dwight was a good friend and I mourn his \npassing. And I would like to dedicate this bill to his memory.\n  Mr. President, we need to take this successful program to the next \nlevel. The JUMP Ahead Act reforms the basic successful structure of \nJUMP and increases funding to $50 million per year for four years and \nincreases awards to up to $200,000.\n  This initiative will not only vastly increase the number of mentoring \nprograms able to receive grants, but will also create a new category of \ngrants to enable experienced national organizations to provide \ntechnical assistance to emerging mentoring programs nationwide. The \nlegislation also requires the Justice Department to rigorously evaluate \nthe programs and document what is effective, and what is not.\n  Finally, Mr. President, we like to talk a lot about pulling yourself \nup by your boot straps. But that doesn't mean much for a child unless \nyou also provide a solid path to walk on. I grew up poor in Paterson, \nNJ. But I had rich role models in both my hard-working parents. Too \nmany children today don't have that same blessing.\n  Mentoring tells our at-risk kids that we as a nation care about \nthem--that their lives are precious to us. Mentoring tells them that if \nthey are willing to pull on those boots and try to walk away from a \ndead end life, they will not have to walk alone.\n  Mr. President, I have told you the scope of the problem. And in \nAmerica, when we have a problem we don't just wring our hands and say \nnothing can be done. We roll up our sleeves and get to work.\n  Mr. President, with this bill we get to work for our children. I hope \nmy colleagues will support the bill, and ask unanimous consent that a \ncopy of the legislation be printed in the Record and a summary of the \nstudy by the Big Brothers/Big Sisters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1461\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) millions of young people in America live in areas in \n     which drug use and violent and property crimes are pervasive;\n       (2) unfortunately, many of these same young people come \n     from single parent homes, or from environments in which there \n     is no responsible, caring adult supervision;\n       (3) all children and adolescents need caring adults in \n     their lives, and mentoring is an effective way to fill this \n     special need for at-risk children. The special bond of \n     commitment fostered by the mutual respect inherent in \n     effective mentoring can be the tie that binds a young person \n     to a better future;\n       (4) through a mentoring relationship, adult volunteers and \n     participating youth make a significant commitment of time and \n     energy to develop relationships devoted to personal, \n     academic, or career development and social, artistic, or \n     athletic growth;\n       (5) rigorous independent studies have confirmed that \n     effective mentoring programs can significantly reduce and \n     prevent the use of alcohol and drugs by young people, improve \n     school attendance and performance, improve peer and family \n     and peer relationships, and reduce violent behavior;\n       (6) since the inception of the Federal JUMP program, dozens \n     of innovative, effective mentoring programs have received \n     funding grants;\n       (7) unfortunately, despite the recent growth in public and \n     private mentoring initiatives, it is reported that between \n     5,000,000 and 15,000,000 additional children in the United \n     States could benefit from being matched with a mentor; and\n       (8) although great strides have been made in reaching at-\n     risk youth since the inception of the JUMP program, millions \n     of vulnerable American children are not being reached, and \n     without an increased commitment to connect these young people \n     to responsible adult role models, our country risks losing an \n     entire generation to drugs, crime, and unproductive lives.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Garry)\n\n       In the past decade, mentoring programs for disadvantaged \n     children and adolescents have received serious attention as a \n     promising approach to enriching children's lives, addressing \n     their need for positive adult contact, and providing one-on-\n     one support and advocacy for those who need it. Mentoring is \n     also recognized as an excellent way to use volunteers to \n     address the problems created by poverty (Freedman, 1992).\n       Through a mentoring relationship, adult volunteers and \n     participating youth make a significant commitment of time and \n     energy to develop relationships devoted to personal, \n     academic, or career development and social, athletic, or \n     artistic growth (Becker, 1994). Programs historically have \n     been based in churches, colleges, communities, courts, or \n     schools and have focused on careers or hobbies.\n       The child mentoring movement had its roots in the late 19th \n     century with ``friendly visitors'' who would serve as role \n     models for children of the poor. In 1904 Ernest K. Coulter \n     founded a new movement that used ``big brothers'' to reach \n     out to children who were in need of socialization, firm \n     guidance, and connection with positive adult role models. The \n     resulting program, Big Brothers/Big Sisters (BB/BS) of \n     America, continues to operate today as the largest mentoring \n     organization of its kind.\n       BB/BS programs across the Nation provide screening and \n     training to volunteer mentors and carefully match the mentors \n     with ``little brothers'' and ``little sisters'' in need of \n     guidance. Public/Private Ventures (P/PV) performed an 18-\n     month experimental evaluation of eight BB/BS mentoring \n     programs that considered social activities, academic \n     performance, attitudes and behaviors, relationships with \n     family and friends, self-concept, and social and cultural \n     enrichment. The study found that mentored youth were less \n     likely to engage in drug or alcohol use, resort to violence, \n     or skip school. In addition, mentored youth were more likely \n     to improve their grades and their relationships with family \n     and friends.\n\n\n                         from the administrator\n\n       All children need caring adults in their lives, and \n     mentoring is one way to fill this need for at-risk children. \n     The special bond of commitment fostered by the mutual respect \n     inherent in effective mentoring can be the tie that binds a \n     young person to a better future.\n       OJJDP's Juvenile Mentoring Program (JUMP) is designed to \n     reduce delinquency and improve school attendance for at-risk \n     youth. Mentoring is also one component of our SafeFutures \n     initiative, which assists communities to combat delinquency \n     by developing a full range of coordinated services. In \n     addition to JUMP and SafeFutures, OJJDP supports mentoring \n     efforts in individual States through our Formula Grants \n     Program funding.\n       With nearly a century of experience, Big Brothers/Big \n     Sisters of America is probably the best known mentoring \n     program in the United States. The extensive evaluation of \n     this pioneer program by Public/Private Ventures (P/PV), \n     described in this Bulletin, provides new insights that merit \n     our attention.\n       The P/PV evaluation and OJJDP's 2-year experience with JUMP \n     suggest that strengthening the role of mentoring as a \n     component of youth programming may pay handsome dividends in \n     improved school performance and reduced antisocial behavior, \n     including alcohol and other drug abuse.\n                                                     Shay Bilchik,\n                                                    Administrator.\n\n\n                            the federal role\n\n       The Juvenile Mentoring Program (JUMP) is a Federal program \n     administered by the Office of Juvenile Justice and \n     Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP). As supported by JUMP, \n     mentoring is a one-on-one relationship between a pair of \n     unrelated individuals, one adult and one juvenile, which \n     takes place on a regular basis over an extended period of \n     time. It is almost always characterized by a ``special bond \n     of mutual commitment'' and ``an emotional character of \n     respect, loyalty, and identification'' (Hamilton, 1990). \n     Although mentoring also is a popular concept for success in \n     the corporate world, this Bulletin focuses on the mentoring \n     of children by adults.\n       JUMP is designed to reduce juvenile delinquency and gang \n     participation, improve academic performance, and reduce \n     school dropout rates. To achieve these purposes, JUMP brings \n     together caring, responsible adults and at-risk young people \n     in need of positive role models.\n       In the 1992 Reauthorization of the Juvenile Justice and \n     Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, Congress added Part G--\n     Mentoring. This was done in recognition of mentoring's \n     potential as a tool for addressing two critical concerns in \n     regard to America's children--poor school performance and \n     delinquent activity. Senator Frank Lautenberg and Congressman \n     William Goodling were the primary sponsors of this new \n     provision. In Part G, Congress also recognized the importance \n     of school collaboration in mentoring programs, whether as a \n     primary source or as a partner with other public or private \n     nonprofit entities.\n       To date Congress has made $19 million available to fund \n     JUMP: $4 million each year in fiscal years (FY's) 1994, 1995, \n     and 1996 and $7 million in FY 1997. OJJDP funded 41 separate \n     mentoring programs under the JUMP unbrella with FY 1994 and \n     1995 funding. JUMP awards for FY 1996 and FY 1997 will be \n     announced in spring 1997.\n       While adhering to the basic requirements of JUMP, the \n     grantees are using a variety of program designs. Mentors are \n     law enforcement and fire department personnel, college \n     students, senior citizens, Federal employees, businessmen, \n     and other private citizens. The young people are of all races \n     and range in age from 5 to 20. Some are incracerated or on \n     probation, some are in school, and some are dropouts. Some \n     programs emphasize tutoring and academic assistance, while \n     others stress vocational counseling and training. In its \n     first year (July 1995 to July 1996). JUMP was involved in \n     attempting to keep more than 2,000 at-risk young people in 25 \n     States in school and off the streets through one-to-one \n     mentoring.\n       Additional FY 1995 funding for mentoring was provided \n     through OJJDP's SafeFutures initiative, which operates in six \n     sites (Boston, Massachusetts; Contra Costa County, \n     California; Fort Belknap Indian Reservation, Harlem, Montana; \n     Imperial County, California; Seattle, Washington; and St. \n     Louis, Missouri). The SafeFutures program assists these \n     communities in developing a coordinated continuum of care to \n     reduce youth violence and delinquency. Mentoring is a \n     component of this coordinated effort in each of the \n     SafeFutures sites.\n       In addition to the funding for JUMP and SafeFutures \n     grantees, OJJDP supports mentoring programs through its \n     Formula Grants program to the States. In FY 1995, for \n     example, Formula Grants funds in 28 States supported 91 \n     programs that included mentoring as part or all of the \n     program.\n\n\n              Big Brothers/Big Sisters (BB/BS) of America\n\n       BB/BS is a federation of more than 500 agencies that serve \n     children and adolescents. Its mission is to make a difference \n     in the lives of young people, primarily through a \n     professionally supported one-to-one relationship with a \n     caring adult, and to assist them in reaching their highest \n     potential as they grow into responsible men and women by \n     providing committed volunteers, national leadership, and \n     standards of excellence. The organization's current goals \n     include increasing the number of children served; improving \n     the effectiveness, efficiency, and impact of services to \n     children; and achieving a greater racial and ethnic diversity \n     among volunteers and staff. BB/BS volunteer mentors come from \n     all walks of life, but they share the goal of being a caring \n     adult who can make a difference in the life of a child.\n       For more than 90 years, the BB/BS program has paired \n     unrelated adult volunteers with youth from single-parent \n     households. BB/BS does not seek to ameliorate specific \n     problems but to provide support to all aspects of young \n     people's lives. The volunteer mentor and the youth make a \n     substantial time commitment, meeting for about 4 hours, two \n     to four times a month, for at least 1 year.\n       Developmentally appropriate activities shared by the mentor \n     and the young person may include taking walks; attending a \n     play, movie, school activity, or sporting event; playing \n     catch; visiting the library; washing the car; grocery \n     shopping; watching television; or just sharing thoughts and \n     ideas about life. Such activities enhance communication \n     skills, develop relationship skills, and support positive \n     decisionmaking.\n       The BB/BS mentor relationships between mentors and youth \n     are achieved through professional staff and national \n     operating standards that provide a level of uniformity in \n     recruitment, screening, matching, and supervision of \n     volunteers and youth. BB/BS agencies provide orientation for \n     volunteers, parents, and youth to assist the individuals in \n     determining if involvement in the program is appropriate for \n     them. Opportunities to participate in volunteer education and \n     development programs such as relationship building, \n     communication skills, values clarification, child \n     development, and problem solving are available to local \n     affiliates.\n       Supervision includes contact with all parties within the \n     first 2 weeks following a match. BB/BS maintains monthly \n     contact with the volunteer and parent or child for the first \n     year. In addition, inperson or telephone contact is \n     maintained quarterly between case managers and both the \n     volunteer and the parent, guardian, and/or child for the \n     duration of the match. Although its standards are reinforced \n     through national training, national and regional conferences, \n     and periodic agency evaluations, BB/BS is not monolithic. \n     Individual agencies adhere to national guidelines, but they \n     customize their programs to fit the circumstances in their \n     area.\n\n\n  How youth benefit from big brothers/big sisters relative to similar \n               nonprogram youth 18 months after applying\n\n                              (In percent)\n\n        Outcome                                                  Change\nAntisocial activities:\n    Initiating Drug Use...........................................-45.8\n    Initiating Alcohol Use........................................-27.4\n    Number of Times Hit Someone...................................-31.7\nAcademic outcomes:\n    Grades..........................................................3.0\n    Scholastic Competence...........................................4.3\n    Skipped Class.................................................-36.7\n\n[[Page S12126]]\n\n    Skipped Day of School........................................ -52.2\nFamily relationships:\n    Summary Measure of Quality of the Relationship..................2.1\n    Trust...........................................................2.7\n    Lying to Parent...............................................-36.6\nPeer Relationships: Emotional Support...............................2.3\n\n\\1\\ For ease of presentation, we will refer to the group that was \nimmediately eligible for a mentor as ``mentored youth'' or ``Little \nBrothers and Little Sisters,'' even though this group includes some \nyouth (22 percent) who were never matched.

The \n     sites selected were in Columbus, Ohio; Houston, Texas; \n     Minneapolis, Minnesota; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Phoenix, \n     Arizona; Rochester, New York; San Antonio, Texas; and \n     Wichita, Kansas.\n       The young people in the study were between 10 and 16 years \n     old (with 93 percent between 10 and 14). Slightly more than \n     60 percent were boys, and more than 50 percent were minority \n     group members (of those, about 70 percent were African \n     American). Almost all lived with one parent (usually the \n     mother), the rest with a guardian or relatives. Many were \n     from low-income households, and a significant number came \n     from households with a history of either family violence or \n     substance abuse. For the study, youth were randomly assigned \n     to be immediately eligible for a mentor or put on a waiting \n     list.\\1\\\n       The goal of the research was to determine whether a one-to-\n     one mentoring experience made a tangible difference in the \n     lives of these young people. The researchers considered six \n     broad areas that mentoring might affect: antisocial \n     activities, academic performance, attitudes and behaviors, \n     relationships with family, relationships with friends, self-\n     concept, and social and cultural enrichment. The findings \n     presented below were based on self reported data obtained \n     from baseline and following up interviews or from forms \n     completed by agency staff.\n       The overall findings, summarized in the table, are \n     positive. The most noteworthy results are these:\n       Mentored youth were 46 percent less likely than controls to \n     initiate drug use during the study period. An even stronger \n     effect was found for minority Little Brothers and Little \n     Sisters, who were 70 percent less likely to initiate drug use \n     than similar minority youth.\n       Mentored youth were 27 percent less likely than were \n     controls to initiate alcohol use during the study period, and \n     minority Little Sisters were only about one-half as likely to \n     initiate alcohol use.\n       Mentored youth were almost one-third less likely than were \n     controls to hit someone.\n       Mentored youth skipped half as many days of school as \n     control youth, felt more competent about doing schoolwork, \n     skipped fewer classes, and showed modest gains in their grade \n     point averages. These gains were strongest among Little \n     Sisters, particularly minority Little Sisters.\n       The quality of their relationship with their parents was \n     better for mentored youth than for controls at the end of the \n     study period, primarily due to a higher level of trust \n     between parent and child. This effect was strongest for white \n     Little Brothers.\n       Mentored youth, especially minority Little Brothers, had \n     improved relationships with their peers.\n       P/PV did not find statistically significant improvements in \n     self-concept or the number of social and cultural activities \n     in which Little Brothers and Little Sisters participated.\n       P/PV concluded that the research presented clear and \n     encouraging evidence that mentoring programs can create and \n     support caring relationships between adults and youth, \n     resulting in a wide range of tangible benefits. It was the \n     researchers' judgment that the successes they observed are \n     unlikely without both the relationship with the mentor and \n     the support from the BB/BS program.\n       The study did not find evidence that any mentoring \n     programming will work but that programs that facilitate the \n     specific types of relationships observed in BB/BS work well. \n     The researchers noted that following about the relationships \n     between Little Brothers and Little Sisters and their Big \n     Brothers and Big Sisters:\n       They had a high level of contact, typically meeting three \n     times per month for 4 hours per meeting. Many had additional \n     contact by telephone.\n       The relationship were built using an approach that defines \n     the mentor as a friend, not a teacher or preacher. The \n     mentor's role is to support the young person in his or her \n     various endeavors, not explicitly to change the youth's \n     behavior or character.\n       The study lists the following elements as prerequisites for \n     an effective mentoring program:\n       Thorough volunteer screening that weeds out adults who are \n     unlikely to keep their time commitment or who might pose a \n     safety risk to youth.\n       Mentor training that includes communication and limit-\n     setting skills, tips on relationship-building, and \n     recommendations on the best way to interact with a young \n     person.\n       Procedures that take into account the preferences of the \n     youth, their families, and volunteers and that use a \n     professional case manager to determine which volunteer would \n     work best with each youth.\n       Intensive supervision and support of each match by a case \n     manager who has frequent contact with the parent or guardian, \n     volunteer, and youth and who provides assistance as \n     difficulties arise.\n       One of the strongest conclusions of the P/PV study is the \n     importance of providing mentors with support in building \n     trust and developing positive relationships with youth. Many \n     of the relationships between the volunteers and youth would \n     have faltered and dissolved if they had not been nurtured by \n     BB/BS's caseworkers. Thus to be effective, mentoring programs \n     should provide an infrastructure that fosters and supports \n     the development of effective relationships.\n       Over 8 years, P/PV studied numerous mentoring programs \n     other than BB/BS. The extent to which these mentoring \n     programs included standardized procedures in the areas of \n     screening, orientation, training, match supervision and \n     support, matching practices, and regular meeting times varied \n     tremendously. Some programs included virtually none of these \n     elements, while others were highly structured. The \n     researchers identified three of these areas as vitally \n     important to the success of any mentoring program: screening, \n     orientation and training, and support and supervision.\n       The screening process provides programs with an opportunity \n     to select adults who are most likely to be successful as \n     mentors by looking for individuals who already understand \n     that a mentor's primary role is to develop a friendship with \n     the youth. Orientation and prematch training provide \n     important opportunities to ensure that youth and their \n     mentors share a common understanding of the adult's role in \n     these programmatically created relationships and to help \n     mentors develop realistic expectations of what they can \n     accomplish. Ongoing staff supervision and support of matches \n     is critical to ensuring that mentors and youth meet regularly \n     over a substantial period of time and develop positive \n     relationships.\n       It is interesting to note that matching did not turn out to \n     be one of the most critical elements. None of the objective \n     factors (e.g., age, race, and gender) that staff take into \n     account when making a match correlate very strongly with the \n     frequency of meetings, length of the match, or its \n     effectiveness. Programs may prefer to make same-race matches, \n     and parents and youth sometimes prefer a mentor of the same \n     race. Programs should continue to honor these preferences and \n     make same-race matches whenever possible. At the same time, \n     it is clear that youth who wait a long time for a same-race \n     mentor are in most cases only delaying the benefits that a \n     mentor of any race can provide.\n       There are two obstacles to replication of effective \n     mentoring programs: the limited number of adults available to \n     serve as mentors and the scarcity of organizational resources \n     necessary to carry out a successful program. The researchers \n     report that between 5 million and 15 million children could \n     benefit from being matched with a mentor; the organization \n     matches only about 75,000 youth in a year. Even with the \n     multitude of smaller mentoring programs around the country, \n     it seems reasonable to conclude that at best just a small \n     percentage of young people are benefiting from mentoring.\n       In regard to organizational resources, the study notes that \n     effective programs require agencies that take substantial \n     care in recruiting, screening, matching, and supporting \n     volunteers. Paid caseworkers carry out these critical \n     functions for BB/BS at a program cost of approximately \n     $1,000 per year per match.\n\n\n                       ojjdp and the p/pv results\n\n       The P/PV evaluation, plus its 2 years of experience with \n     JUMP, led OJJDP to modify the project design guidelines in \n     its 1996 JUMP solicitation to reflect the latest knowledge \n     about what works--and does not work--in mentoring. Based on \n     the P/PV study, OJJDP expanded the guideline on mentor \n     support and training, emphasizing that the program \n     coordinator should have frequent contact with parents of \n     guardians, volunteers, and youth and should provide \n     assistance when requested or as problems arise. This \n     guideline also specifies the type of training mentors should \n     receive. From its JUMP experience, OJJDP inserted a guideline \n     on the role of the mentor, added a caution about time \n     limitations that may interfere with the effectiveness of \n     college undergraduate or graduate students as mentors, \n     suggested that parents should have a say in the selection of \n     mentors, called for screening mechanisms to weed out \n     volunteers who will not keep their commitments, and \n     established minimum expectations for the time mentors should \n     spend with youth (1 hour per week for at least 1 year).\n\n[[Page S12127]]\n\n                           evaluation of jump\n\n       OJJDP is required by Congress to submit a report regarding \n     the success and effectiveness of JUMP initiatives 120 days \n     after their termination. Evaluations are critical to ensuring \n     that mentoring programs operate as designed and meet their \n     goals in terms of both the process and the impact on youth.\n       To prepare for the timely initiation of evaluation \n     activities once the grantee is chosen for the national \n     evaluation, OJJDP directed its management evaluation \n     contractor, Caliber Associated, to design an evaluation and \n     prepare for initial data collection. The JUMP evaluation will \n     be accomplished through a partnership among the grantees, \n     OJJDP, and the JUMP evaluation grantee. Caliber produced a \n     workbook containing an overview of the JUMP initiative and \n     the national evaluation that defined the roles of OJJDP, the \n     evaluator, and JUMP grantees. Caliber also pilot tested \n     grantee administration of data collection instruments and \n     conducted followup interviews of participating grantees. Once \n     the grantee for the evaluation is selected, Caliber also will \n     help coordinate the transition to the evaluation grantee. \n     Selection of the evaluation grantee is expected to take place \n     in spring 1997.\n       Although formal evaluations have not yet been implemented, \n     the mentoring programs funded under JUMP appear to be making \n     a difference in the lives of many young people. The \n     preliminary accomplishments of a few of the OJJDP-funded \n     mentoring programs are highlighted below.\n       The Big Brothers/Big Sisters of southwest Idaho have made \n     41 matches of at-risk youth and mentors in this JUMP project. \n     According to parents and teachers familiar with the program, \n     30 percent of the youth who participated in the program \n     showed improvement in their school attendance, 30 percent \n     showed academic improvement, 35 percent showed improvement in \n     their general behavior, and 48 percent increased the \n     frequency of appropriate interactions with peers. For \n     example, a female being raised by her father was matched to a \n     female volunteer and, after the match, scored higher in \n     measures of grades, self-satisfaction, self-esteem, positive \n     attitude toward others, and pride in appearance.\n       Project Caring Connections in New York City provides 30 \n     youth with caring relationships with adult mentors from \n     corporations and the community. As an integral part of the \n     Liberty Partnerships Program, it offers a comprehensive range \n     of services from academic enrichment to cultural experiences \n     to a safe environment in which young people can learn social \n     skills. During afterschool hours, Project Caring Connections \n     mentors work with students one-to-one or in a group to \n     provide academic support, job shadowing (going to the \n     mentor's workplace), and social and cultural enrichment. \n     Through the program, at-risk students may gain exposure to \n     publishing, theater, law, art, government, and business and \n     also do community service. This past year, some youth were \n     able to serve as panelists on a cable news show and discuss \n     crime in their communities, curfews, and the importance of \n     staying in school.\n       Big Sisters of Colorado, in Denver, matched 59 girls, \n     mostly Hispanic, with mentors. Program activities funded by \n     OJJPD included a Life Choices program to develop \n     decisionmaking and academic skills; recreation, community \n     service, and challenge course activities; a pregnancy-\n     prevention program; and mentor visits to the girls' schools. \n     None of these girls have become pregnant or had problems with \n     alcohol or drugs since their involvement in the program.\n       Big Brothers/Big Sisters of Pensacola, Florida, is a JUMP \n     initiative in which 26 youth from single-parent families who \n     are at risk for juvenile delinquency, teen pregnancy, \n     truancy, and dropping out of school are being mentored by \n     legal professionals, members of the military, corporate \n     employees, and others. The youth are actively encouraged to \n     stay in school and meet the goals their individualized case \n     plans. All have had increased exposure to athletic, \n     recreational, and cultural activities, and many have \n     demonstrated improved social and academic skills. The program \n     has also engaged youth in a 3-day Kids N Kops police mini-\n     academy. This innovative program provides mentoring and \n     training by police officers and educates youth about the \n     dangers of drugs, guns, and gangs while strengthening the \n     relationship between police and at-risk youth.\n       The Cincinnati Youth Collaborative in Ohio matched 136 \n     youth and volunteers in its first year in JUMP. Mentors \n     include doctors, dentists, lawyers, judges, teachers, \n     chemists, police officers, nurses, waiters, postal clerks, \n     travel agents, and college students. Some special activities \n     were a trip to New York City, visits to college campuses, a \n     community bowl-a-thon, job shadowing, and participation in a \n     school beautification project. The project reports that 99 of \n     the 136 young people have improved academically and 102 have \n     improved socially.\n       The RESCUE Youth mentoring program in Los Angeles, \n     California, was developed and implemented by the Los Angeles \n     County District Attorney's Office, in conjunction with the \n     Los Angeles County Fire Department, to rescue youth ages 12 \n     to 14 at the earliest signs of at-risk behavior. The district \n     attorney's staff match the students with volunteer \n     firefighter mentors in an effort to address truancy, juvenile \n     delinquency, and potentially serious criminal behavior. \n     Through this JUMP initiative, mentors worked with 140 youth \n     on their communication and conflict resolution skills and \n     provided training in fire prevention and first aid.\n       The JUMP projects offer many success stories, including the \n     following examples. One student, who began the 1995-96 school \n     year as a repeat first grader, ended the year with straight \n     A's with the help of her mentor. In another instance, a male \n     student being raised by his father alone showed a twofold \n     increase in his grades and in measures of self-esteem after \n     being matched with a female mentor. It is expected that the \n     JUMP evaluation will document a significant number of similar \n     positive outcomes.\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       The research conducted by P/PV--and the preliminary reports \n     from JUMP--provide powerful evidence that youth can be \n     positively influenced by adults who care. More important, \n     these positive relationships do not have to be left to chance \n     but can be created through structured mentoring programs.\n       The P/PV research, however, has even broader implications \n     for social policy than just encouraging the spread of \n     mentoring--namely, that practitioners and policy makers \n     should take a new approach to serving youth. For the past 30 \n     years, society's attention and resources were directed \n     predominantly at teenagers' problems, as evidenced by \n     programs focusing on issues such as dropping out of school, \n     truancy, substance abuse, and teen pregnancy. With only small \n     gains to show, the public and politicians alike have \n     concluded, probably prematurely, that youth, even those as \n     young as 14, are too old to be helped.\n       The BB/BS results suggest that, where its youth policy is \n     concerned, society's focus has been too narrow. What is \n     desperately needed is a more positive approach that meets the \n     basic needs of youth, especially those living in high-risk \n     neighborhoods, for nurturing and supportive adults, positive \n     things to do after school and on weekends, and volunteer and \n     work opportunities that develop skills, foster learning, and \n     instill a sense of civic responsibility. If society focuses \n     on these basic developmental needs, youth will mature \n     responsibly, avoid many negative behaviors, and become more \n     resilient in the face of inevitable setbacks.\n       P/PV's evaluation of BB/BS suggests that strengthening this \n     aspect of youth programming is likely to be more effective in \n     producing responsible young adults than the traditional \n     approach to youth policy, which has attempted to prevent \n     specific problems or to correct problems that have already \n     arisen. These traditional elements will still be needed, but \n     they should complement and support the basic developmental \n     needs addressed by mentoring programs.\n       The BB/BS mentoring program did not provide tutoring and \n     antidrug counseling--it simply provided adult friendship on a \n     regular and intensive basis. Yet it achieved improvements in \n     school performance and reductions in antisocial behavior. The \n     findings thus provide a direction for building and \n     strengthening one approach to delinquency prevention.\n       Dealing with the problems of juvenile delinquency, creating \n     more positive opportunities for our youth, and helping them \n     find strong and positive adult role models in their lives are \n     among the societal goals that can be achieved in part through \n     the implementation of sound mentoring programs. While many \n     children are being served by these efforts already, hundreds \n     of thousands more could also benefit from the special bond of \n     mentoring before serious problems develop.\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I am so pleased to join my colleague \nSenator Lautenberg in introducing the JUMP Ahead Act of 1997. As a \nnational board member of Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, I know \npersonally how important this legislation is, and the type of \nopportunity it will give to thousands of at-risk youth around the \ncountry.\n  While intuitively we know that mentoring relationships can make a \nhuge difference in the lives of young people, we now have \nscientifically reliable evidence about the positive impact that \nmentoring programs can have. In 1995, Public/Private Ventures, a policy \nresearch organization in Philadelphia, conducted an impact study of the \nBig Brothers Big Sisters program. The results were startling. The \naddition of a Big Brothers or Big Sister to a young person's life \ndrastically reduced first time drug use, significantly lowered \nabsenteeism, and reduced violent behavior. Furthermore, the young \npeople studied were less likely to start using alcohol and more likely \nto do well in school.\n  JUMP Ahead will link community based mentoring programs with public \nschools to give more children the chance to reap the benefits of a one-\nto-one mentoring relationship. JUMP Ahead is based on a small, \ninnovative, federal program known as the Juvenile Mentoring Program \n[JUMP].\n  Building on the success of JUMP, the JUMP Ahead Act will create a \ncompetitive grant program which allows local, nonprofit social service \nand education agencies to apply cooperatively\n\n[[Page S12128]]\n\nand directly for grants from the Department of Justice's Office of \nJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. These grants are used to \nestablish mentoring services utilizing responsible individuals as \nmentors.\n  During the last session of Congress, I introduced the Character \nDevelopment Act as part of my Project for American Renewal. The \nCharacter Development Act, like the JUMP Ahead Act, Stressed the \nimportance of mentoring relationships in the process of cultural \nrenewal.\n  The need for additional adult support and guidance for our Nation's \nyouth has never been greater than at this time. Currently 38 percent of \nall American children live without their fathers. It is increasingly \nimportant to support the work of organizations that are attempting to \nstand in the gap left by absent fathers.\n  Since mentoring programs work through the efforts of volunteers, only \nmodest funds are necessary to have a far-reaching impact. I am \nconvinced that the investment that the JUMP Ahead Act calls for over \nthe next 5 years, will produce tremendous positive results in the lives \nof many at-risk youth.\n  I encourage my colleagues to take a close look at this bill and \nconsider supporting it. One-to-one mentoring has proven its \neffectiveness in positively impacting the lives of at risk youth. I ask \nmy colleagues to join me and Senator Lautenberg in this effort to \nencourage and expand opportunities for one-to-one mentoring \nrelationships for at-risk youth. The JUMP Ahead Act of 1997 takes an \nimportant step forward in meeting the needs of so many of this \ncountry's hurting youth.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Santorum):\n  S. 1642. A bill to authorize the Delaware and Lehigh Navigation Canal \nNational Heritage Corridor Act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n the delaware and lehigh national heritage corridor act amendments of \n                                  1997\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce legislation to reauthorize the Delaware and Lehigh Canal \nNational Heritage Corridor Act of 1988, which established a Federal \nCommission to assist in planning and implementing an integrated \nstrategy for promoting and protecting the cultural, historical, and \nnatural resources in the canal region, which consists of a 150-mile \nlong corridor stretching through five counties in eastern Pennsylvania, \nincluding Luzerne, Carbon, Lehigh, Northampton, and Bucks. As a member \nof the Senate Appropriations Committee, I have been pleased to support \nannual funding for the work of the Commission, and believe \nreauthorization is necessary to continue preserving the heritage of the \ncanal region and to promote economic development.\n  Mr. President, let me provide you and my colleagues with some \nbackground on the Delaware and Lehigh corridor. The Delaware Canal \nfirst opened for regular commercial navigation in 1834 and served as \nthe primary means for transporting coal and other bulk goods from the \nanthracite region of Pennsylvania to New York, New Jersey, \nPhiladelphia, and even to industrial centers in Europe. The canal \nprovided an early and essential link in a 4,000 mile national \ntransportation route and helped to transform Pennsylvania from a solely \nagrarian State to the center of an industrialized society. The Delaware \nCanal and the Lehigh Navigation Canal played a critical role in \nsupplying our developing Nation with the coal that heated its homes and \nthe fuel for its burgeoning factories.\n  In 1998, Congress wisely established the Corridor and the Delaware \nand Lehigh National Corridor Commission. The commission was charged \nwith conserving, interpreting, and promoting the natural, historic, \ncultural, scenic, and recreational resources of the region. Nine \nnational historic landmarks, six national recreation trails, two \nnational natural landmarks, and hundreds of sites listed on the \nNational Register are situated within these boundaries. In addition, 7 \nState parks, 3 State historical parks, 14 State scenic rivers, and 14 \nState game lands are located in the region. This is an impressive and \nhistoric area that must be preserved. More than three million visitors \nexplore the region each year to see the numerous attractions in the \narea, including the Allentown Art Museum, Eckley Miners Village, \nWashington Crossing, and Moravian Tire Work.\n  Another attraction that will preserve the region's heritage and \npromote economic development is a cultural center in Two Rivers Landing \nthat will house the city of Easton's National Canal Museum and the \nCrayola Factory. Two Rivers Landing first opened in June 1996, marking \na rebirth of Easton's downtown. Since then, more than 300,000 visitors \nhave come. The project has been credited with attracting 82 businesses \nto downtown and creating nearly 100 jobs.\n  The Delaware and Lehigh National Heritage Corridor has established a \nstrong record of successful partnership projects that link Federal, \nState and local governments with nonprofit organizations and private \nindustries. Two Rivers Landing is just one of the many successful \nprivate/public partnerships led by the Commission. Another example is \nthe Lehigh River Foundation, which was formed in 1991 to give private \nsector support the Commission's initiatives. The foundation has raised \nmore than $150,000 from local businesses and individuals to create an \neducational film, sponsor heritage events, and establish an information \ncenter in Bethlehem, the site of the only American 19th century steel \nplant to retain all of its historic elements. The corridor is sustained \nby broad public involvement and nonfederal investment. There are many \nproject supporters, such as the Heritage Conservancy, the Pennsylvania \nDepartment of Conservation and Natural Resources, the Pennsylvania \nHistorical and Museum Commission, and the Pennsylvania Department of \nCommunity and Economic Development. Corporations such as Binney and \nSmith, makers of Crayola products, Bethlehem Steel, and Mack Trucks \nhave also made major financial commitments to support new industrial \nmuseums and attractions.\n\n  Statutory authority for the Delaware and Lehigh National Corridor \nCommission will expire in November, 1998 unless Congress acts. I \nbelieve there is ample need for reauthorization because of the \nunfinished work of the Commission. I would note that the Commission was \nauthorized to receive up to $350,000 in operating funds a year, but \nfunding for the program did not begin until 1990, and since then, it \nhas regularly received only $329,000 a year through the annual Interior \nand related agencies appropriations bill.\n  The primary reason for reauthorization is the delay in implementing a \nManagement Action Plan for the region. The 1988 act mandated a series \nof studies and public meetings in order to complete a management action \nplan, which will serve as an action agenda for the first 10 years of \ncorridor development. The management action plan did not received final \napproval from the Secretary of the Interior until August, 1994. \nFurther, the findings of the management action plan envisioned a 15-\nyear implementation period after approved by the Secretary. I am \nconcerned that with less than one year left until the Act expires, \nthere is insufficient time to implement the plan to help conserve the \nresources of this historically significant region.\n  The Corridor Commission has made significant progress and there is \npublic enthusiasm and support for the projects being carried out by the \nCommission, particularly where they promote economic development. \nHowever, they can not do this alone. There is a real need for \nsufficient Federal support of operations. I would note that the \nCommission must, by law, raise sufficient private and other nonfederal \nfunds so that the annual Federal grant to the Commission constitutes no \nmore than 50 percent of its operating budget. For each government \ndollar raised, the Commission has been successful in leveraging $8 to \n$14 in matching funds. This project has clearly demonstrated that \nFederal investment acts as a catalyst for local and private investment.\n  Building on the success of the Corridor Commission, my legislation \nwill authorize an increase in the Commission's operating budget from \n$350,000 to $650,000 a year, which will leverage additional private, \nState, and local funds. My legislation retains the 50 percent \nlimitation on the amount of the Federal subsidy. Also, the legislation \nauthorizes up to $10 million over 10 years to implement projects \nincluded in the\n\n[[Page S12129]]\n\nmanagement action plan and approved by the Secretary of the Interior, \nincluding the restoration and preservation of the Delaware Canal, and \nlanding developments in 8 to 10 cities. The legislation extends the \nCommission another 10 years, thereby allowing the project to realize \nits goals while improving operating efficiency and extending \nparticipation.\n  The corridor's management action plan has become an important tool \nfor both community and economic revitalization. It is recognized as a \nnational model for the coordination of grassroots community efforts \nwith those of government and private industry. Last year, the 104th \nCongress created nine new national heritage areas based in part on the \nsuccess of the Delaware and Lehigh model. Mr. President, I encourage my \ncolleagues to support this valuable Commission and to reauthorize the \n1988 act so that Americans can continue to learn about the rich history \nof the region and appreciate the lands, waterways, and structures \nwithin the Delaware and Lehigh Heritage Corridor. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the legislation and a section-by-\nsection summary of my legislation be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1462\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to change the date for regularly scheduled Federal \nelections and establish polling place hours; to the Committee on Rules \nand Administration.\n\n\n                           WEEKEND VOTING ACT\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a disturbing trend in our \ndemocracy--the decline of voter turnout in our elections.\n  During the past 2 years we have debated at length our campaign \nfinance system. We have seen in ample detail the corrupting influences \ninvading our elections, and the effect these stories are having on the \nAmerican public. Voters are increasingly distrustful of their system of \ngovernment. They have lost confidence in America's institutions, its \nleaders, and its electoral process.\n  The Senate is taking steps to reform the campaign finance system, and \nI am hopeful that before the spring we will have a campaign finance \nreform bill to present to the American public. But there are other \nreforms which we can undertake to restore citizens' faith in our \ndemocracy and increase participation in elections.\n  For decades we've seen a gradual decline in voter turnout. In 1952, \nabout 63 percent of eligible voters came out to vote--that number \ndropped to about 49 percent in the 1996 election. Non-Presidential year \nvoter turnout is even more abysmal.\n  Analysts point to a variety of reasons for this dropoff. Certainly, \ncommon sense suggests that the general decline in voter confidence in \ngovernment institutions is one logical reason. However, I'd like to \npoint out, one survey of voters and nonvoters suggested that both \ngroups are equally disgruntled with government.\n  We must explore ways to make our electoral process more user \nfriendly. We must adjust our institutions to the needs of the American \npublic of the 21st century. Our democracy has always had the amazing \ncapacity to adapt to the challenges thrown before it, and we must \ncontinue to do so if our country is to grow and thrive.\n  I propose that we consider innovative ways to increase voter turnout \nand enhance our citizens' impression of the process. One way to do this \nwould be change the hours that polls are open.\n  Mr. President, today I am introducing the Weekend Voting Act of 1997, \nwhich would change the day for congressional and presidential elections \nfrom the first Tuesday in November to the first weekend in November.\n  Mr. President, I come from the business world, where you had a \nperfect gauge of what the public thought of you and your products. If \nyou turned a profit, you knew the public liked your product--if you \ndidn't, you knew you needed to make changes. If customers weren't \nshowing up when your store was open, you knew you had to change your \nstore hours.\n  In essence, it's time for the American democracy to change its store \nhours. Since the mid-19th century, election day has been on the first \nTuesday of November. Ironically, this date was selected because it was \nconvenient for voters. Tuesdays were traditionally court day, and land-\nowning voters were often coming to town anyway.\n  Just as the original selection of our national voting day was done \nfor voter convenience, we must adapt to the changes in our society to \nmake voting easier for the regular family. Two in every three \nhouseholds have both parents working. Since most polls in the U.S. are \nopen only 12 hours, from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m., voters often have only 1 or \n2 hours to vote. If they have children, and are dropping them off at \nday care, voters often must take time off work to vote.\n  We can do better by offering more flexible voting hours for all \nAmericans, especially working families.\n  Under this bill, polls would be open nationwide for a uniform period \nof time from Saturday, 6 p.m. eastern time to Sunday, 6 p.m. eastern \ntime. Polls in other time zones would also open and close at this time. \nSome Western States have complained that early return information \nbroadcast over television networks has decreased voter turnout. By \nestablishing uniform nationwide voting schedules, this problem would be \nsolved.\n  I should note, while I've been an advocate of weekend voting for some \ntime, it was NBC Anchor Tom Brokaw who suggested the uniform voting \nschedule, and I thank him for his contribution to this proposal.\n  Mr. President, of 27 democracies, 17 of them allow their citizens to \nvote on holidays or the weekends. And in nearly every one of these \nnations, voter turnout surpasses our country's poor performance. We can \ndo better.\n  Like most innovative plans, States already are experimenting with \nnovel ways to increase voter turnout and satisfaction. Texas has \nimplemented an early voting plan, California has relaxed restrictions \non absentee voting, and Oregon's special election for Senator in 1996 \nwas done entirely by mail. While results are still inconclusive whether \nthese new models increase voter turnout, there is no doubt that voters \nare much more pleased with the additional convenience and ease with \nvoting.\n  Under the Weekend Voting Act, States would be permitted to close the \npolls during the overnight hours if they determine it would be \ninefficient to keep them open. Because the polls are open from Saturday \nto Sunday, they would not interfere with religious observances.\n  I know that partisans in both parties will decry this plan as \ndetrimental to their candidates. Republican consultants will worry that \nunion households that traditionally vote Democratic will have more time \nto go and vote. Democrat consultants will worry that the combination of \nchurch and voting on Sundays will hurt their party's chances at the \npoll. I hope both are right, and that the end result is more people \naffiliated with both parties coming out to vote. That should be the \ngoal of a democracy.\n  Mr. President, I recognize a change of this magnitude will take some \ntime. But, how much more should voting turnout decline before we \nrealize we need a change. How much lower should our citizens' \nconfidence plummet before we adapt and create a more ``consumer-\nfriendly'' polling system.\n  The Weekend Voting Act will not solve all of this democracy's \nproblems, but it is a commonsense approach for adapting this grand \ndemocratic experiment of the 18th century to the American family's \nlifestyle of the 21st century.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself and Mr. Torricelli):\n  S. 1465. A bill to consolidate in a single independent agency in the \nexecutive branch the responsibilities regarding food safety, labeling, \nand inspection currently divided among several Federal agencies; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                           the safe food act\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould replace the current fragmented Federal food safety system with a \nconsolidated, independent agency with responsibility for all Federal \nfood safety activities--the Safe Food Act. I am pleased to be joined by \nSenator Torricelli in this important effort.\n  Make no mistake, our country has been blessed with the safest and \nmost abundant food supply in the world. However, we can do better. The \nGeneral Accounting Office estimates that\n\n[[Page S12131]]\n\nas many as 33 million people will suffer food poisoning this year and \nmore than 9,000 will die. The Department of Health and Human Services \npredicts that foodborne illnesses and deaths are likely to increase 10 \nto 15 percent over the next decade. The annual cost of foodborne \nillnesses in this country may rise to as high as $22 billion per year.\n  According to a Princeton Research survey conducted last summer, 44 \npercent of Americans believe that the food supply in this country is \nless safe than it was 10 years ago, while another 30 percent feel it is \nonly ``about as safe.'' The survey also found that 48 percent of \nAmericans are ``very concerned'' about the safety of the food that they \neat.\n  Currently, 12 different Federal agencies and 35 different laws govern \nfood safety and inspection functions. Of these 12 agencies, six have \nmajor roles in carrying out food safety and quality activities. With so \nmany bureaucrats in the kitchen, breakdowns can more easily occur. With \noverlapping jurisdictions, Federal agencies many times lack \naccountability on food safety-related issues. A single, independent \nagency would help focus our policy and improve the enforcement of food \nsafety and inspection laws.\n  At a time of government downsizing and reorganization, the United \nStates simply can't afford to continue operating multiple systems. In \norder to achieve a successful, effective food safety and inspection \nsystem, a single agency with uniform standards is needed.\n  The Safe Food Act would empower a single, independent agency to \nenforce food safety regulations from farm to table. It would provide an \neasier framework for implementing U.S. standards in an international \ncontext. Research could be better coordinated within a single agency \nrather than among multiple programs. And, new technologies to improve \nfood safety cold be approved more rapidly with one food safety agency.\n  With incidents of food recalls and foodborne illnesses on the rise, \nit is important to move beyond short-term solutions to major food \nsafety problems. A single, independent food safety and inspection \nagency could more easily work toward long-term solutions to the \nfrustrating and potentially life-threatening issue of food safety.\n  The administration has stepped forward on the issue of food safety--\nfrom working with Congress to enact HACCP to increased funding to \nimprove surveillance and monitoring to last week's announcement on the \n``Fight Bac--Keep Food Safe From Bacteria Campaign'' initiative. I \ncommend President Clinton and Secretaries Glickman and Shalala for \ntheir commitment to improving our Nation's food safety and inspection \nsystems. A single, independent food safety agency is the logical next \nstep.\n  Mr. President, together, we can bring the various agencies together \nto eliminate the overlap and confusion that have, unfortunately, at \ntimes characterized our food safety efforts. I encourage my colleagues \nto join me in this effort to consolidate the food safety and inspection \nfunctions of numerous agencies and offices into a single, independent \nfood safety agency.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Mack, Mr. Abraham, Mr. \n        Conrad, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Murkowski, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \n        Rockefeller, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 1464. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \npermanently extend the research credit, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\nThe Research and Experimentation Credit Permanent Extension Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce a bill with \nmy colleagues Senators Baucus, Mack, Abraham, Conrad, Lieberman, Boxer, \nMurkowski, Rockefeller, Feinstein, Murray, and Durbin to make the tax \ncredit for increasing research activities permanent. Companion \nlegislation has been introduced in the House by Representatives Nancy \nJohnson and Robert Matsui.\n  The United States is a leader in the development of new technology. \nHistorically, the R credit has played a major role in elevating this \ngreat Nation to such a significant and influential leadership position. \nThe United States is currently ahead of the ever increasing competition \nin developing and marketing new products. With greater market \nchallenges in the future, we will have to fight hard to maintain the \nU.S. lead in new technology and innovation. The role of the R tax \ncredit will be increasingly important.\n  But, we must recognize that scientific breakthroughs usually do not \nhappen overnight. Research and development is a long-term, on-going \nprocess. The development of new products and services is the result of \nslow and steady effort and investment. It is for this reason that start \nand stop nature of the R credit hinders American progress in \nresearch. The tax credit is authorized only for a short time--which in \nscience is practically no time at all--and then goes to the brink of \nexpiration before Congress acts to extend it again. Permanent extension \nof the R tax credit would provide badly needed predictability.\n  Our country provides very little in the way of direct funding for \nresearch. While we subsidize basic research to some extent through the \nNational Science Foundation and other science agencies, the United \nStates depends on the private sector to finance applied research to a \nvery substantial degree. This paradigm has worked well. Government does \nnot make decisions about what research to fund or make judgments about \nwhat sectors look promising. Yet, risk-taking, particularly in fields \nsuch as pharmaceuticals where the cost of developing just one new drug \ncan reach into the hundreds of millions of dollars, is an activity that \nwe encourage with the R tax credit.\n  Without the R tax credit, American industry is put at a tremendous \ndisadvantage relative to foreign competitors whose governments provide \ndirect subsidies for research. We simply must not let American \nleadership in science and technology lapse.\n  There are enormous benefits from research. Additional investment in \nresearch yields new jobs--in some cases entire new industries-- \nstrengthens our international position, and often results in an \nenhanced quality of life for consumers. Simply put, the tax credit is \nan investment for economic growth and the creation of new jobs.\n  Mr. President, my home state of Utah is home to many innovative \ncompanies that invest a significant percentage of their revenue in \nresearch and development activities. Scattered across the Wasatch front \nis a large stretch of software and computer engineering firms. This \narea is second only to California's Silicon Valley as a thriving high \ntechnology commercial area. Utah also has approximately 700 \nbiotechnology and biomedical firms which employ nearly 9,000 workers. \nThese companies were conceived through research and development and \nwill continue to grow and thrive only if they can continue to afford to \ntake risks.\n  In all, Mr. President, there are approximately 80,000 employees \nworking in Utah's 1,400 plus and growing technology based firms. \nResearch and development is the lifeblood of these Utah firms and \nhundreds of thousands more throughout the Nation that are like them.\n  The research and experimentation tax credit has been on the books for \nmany years, and there is no doubt that it has proved beneficial to our \nNation's technology enterprise. But, there is also no doubt that its \nbenefits could be even greater if the credit were made permanent and \nthe perennial uncertainty with respect to the availability of the \ncredit--and thus the cost of doing research--were eliminated.\n  With the introduction of this bill, I am pleased to inform you that \nwe have included one slight change in this permanent extension. As \nalready established, companies whose research efforts do not qualify \nthem for the credit are allowed to choose the alternative incremental \ncredit. The bill would increase the three alternative incremental \ncredit rates by one percentage point each, thereby spurring tax credit \nbenefits and encouraging more extensive research and development \nefforts.\n  I am aware, Mr. President, that not every company that participates \nin the research and development process benefits from the credit. \nHowever, I believe that Congress should never permit the credit to \nexpire. I urge my colleagues to support this concept of a\n\n[[Page S12132]]\n\npermanent R credit by cosponsoring this legislation and support the \ntype of research activities that will maintain American technological \nleadership into the 21st century.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1464\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF RESEARCH CREDIT.\n\n       (a) Credit Made Permanent.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 41 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 (relating to credit for increasing research activities) \n     is amended by striking subsection (h).\n       (2) Conforming amendment.--Paragraph (1) of section 45C(b) \n     of such Code is amended by striking subparagraph (D).\n       (b) Increase in Alternative Incremental Credit Rates.--\n     Subparagraph (A) of section 41(c)(4) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 is amended--\n       (1) in clause (i), by striking ``1.65 percent'' and \n     inserting ``2.65 percent'',\n       (2) in clause (ii), by striking ``2.2 percent'' and \n     inserting ``3.2 percent'', and\n       (3) in clause (iii), by striking ``2.75 percent'' and \n     inserting ``3.75 percent''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsections (a) \n     and (b) shall apply to amounts paid or incurred after June \n     30, 1998.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I join with \nmy colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, and my other colleagues to \nintroduce this bill, which is so critical to the ability of American \nbusinesses to effectively compete in the global marketplace. Companion \nlegislation has been introduced in the House by Representatives Nancy \nJohnson and Robert Matsui.\n  Our Nation is the world's undisputed leader in technological \ninnovation, a position that would not be possible absent U.S. \ncompanies' commitment to research and development. Investment in \nresearch is an investment in our Nation's economic future, and it is \nappropriate that both the public and private sector share the costs \ninvolved, as we share in the benefits. The credit provided through the \nTax Code for research expenses provides a modest but crucial incentive \nfor companies to conduct their research in the United States, thus \ncreating high-skilled, high-paying jobs for U.S. workers.\n  The R credit has played a key role in placing the United States \nahead of its competition in developing and marketing new products. \nEvery dollar that the Federal Government spends on the R credit is \nmatched by another dollar of spending on research over the short run by \nprivate companies, and two dollars of spending over the long run. Our \nglobal competitors are well aware of the importance of providing \nincentives for research, and many provide more generous tax treatment \nfor research and experimentation expenses that does the United States. \nAs a result, while spending on non-defense R in the United States as \na percentage of GDP has remained relatively flat since 1985, Japan's \nand Germany's has grown.\n  The benefits of the credit, though certainly significant, have been \nlimited over the years by the fact that the credit has been temporary. \nIn addition to the numerous times that the credit has been allowed to \nlapse, last year, for the first time, when Congress extended the credit \nit left a gap of an entire year during which the credit was not \navailable. This unprecedented lapse sent a troubling signal to the U.S. \ncompanies and universities that have come to rely on the Government's \nlongstanding commitment to the credit.\n  Much research and development takes years to mature. The more \nuncertain the long-term future of the credit is, the smaller its \npotential to stimulate increased research. If companies evaluating \nresearch projects cannot rely on the seamless continuation of the \ncredit, they are less likely to invest on research in this country, \nless likely to put money into cutting-edge technology innovation that \nis critical to keeping us in the forefront of global competition.\n  Our country is locked in a fierce battle for high-paying \ntechnological jobs in the global economy. As more nations succeed in \ncreating educationally advanced workforces and join the United States \nas high-technology manufacturing centers, they become more attractive \nto companies trying to penetrate foreign markets. Multinational \ncompanies sometimes find that moving both manufacturing and basic \nresearch activities overseas is necessary if they are to remain \ncompetitive. The uncertainty of the R credit factors into their \neconomic calculations, and makes keeping these jobs in the United \nStates more difficult.\n  Although the R credit is not exclusively used by high-technology \nfirms, they are certainly key beneficiaries of the credit. In my own \nState of Montana, 12 of every 1,000 private sector workers were \nemployed by high-tech firms in 1995, the most recent year for which \nstatistics are available. Almost 400 establishments provided high-\ntechnology services, at an average wage of $34,500 per year. These jobs \npaid 77 percent more than the average private sector wage in Montana of \n$19,500 per year. Many of these jobs would never have been created \nwithout the assistance of the R credit. Making the credit permanent \nwould most certainly provide the incentive needed to create many more \nin the future.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and look forward to \nworking with them and with the administration to make the research and \nexperimentation tax credit permanent.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ABRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Hutchison, and Mr. Coats):\n  S. 1466. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to permit \nfaith-based substance abuse treatment centers to receive Federal \nassistance, to permit individuals receiving Federal drug treatment \nassistance to select private and religiously oriented treatment, and to \nprotect the rights of individuals from being required to receive \nreligiously oriented treatment; to the Commission on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n            the drug and alcohol abuse treatment choice act\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Effective \nSubstance Abuse Treatment Act. This legislation will increase the \nvariety and effectiveness of drug and alcohol treatment centers. It \nwill do so by allowing faith-based organizations, consistently shown to \nbe most effective at treating substance abuse, to accept Federal funds \nwithout sacrificing their religious character. In addition, it will \nallow individuals receiving drug and alcohol abuse treatment services \nto choose a faith-based treatment center for their care.\n  This legislation builds on the charitable choice provision included \nin last year's welfare bill. That provision allowed faith-based \ncharities to contract with government to supply social services without \nhaving to give up their religious character.\n  Mr. President, each year we face staggering statistics about the use \nof illegal drugs and the abuse of alcohol. The percentage of teenagers \nwho admitted using illicit drugs during the last month more than \ndoubled between 1992 and 1995. This increase in drug use, especially \namong young people, demands that we find new ways to address the \naddiction that often follows. I believe we owe it to our citizens and \nparticularly those addicted to drugs or alcohol, to make the most \neffective treatment available to them. That treatment is provided by \nfaith based charities.\n  Mr. President, government-run drug rehabilitation programs generally \nhave long-run success rates in the single digits. This is a tragedy for \naddicts, their friends and their families, all of whom are given false \nhope by institutions that rarely produce the results they promise. \nHowever, there are many programs that do work. For example, Burton \nFulsom of Michigan's Mackinac Center reports on the Mel Trotter \nMinistries in Grand Rapids. Named for its former alcoholic founder, the \nMel Trotter Ministries has an astounding 70-percent long term success \nrate in its faith based rehabilitation program.\n  According to director Thomas Laymon, government programs leave \naddicts without spiritual support. Worse, addicts are not held \naccountable for addictions, and they have no incentive to change their \nbehavior. Meanwhile, Trotter Ministries provides guidance, a supporter \ncommunity and integration into a life beyond drugs.\n  Another successful faith based substance abuse treatment center is \nSan Antonio's Victory Fellowship, run by\n\n[[Page S12133]]\n\nPastor Freddie Garcia. Victory Fellowship has saved thousands of \naddicts in some of the city's toughest neighborhoods. The program \noffers addicts a safe haven, a chance to recover, job training, and a \nchance to provide for themselves and their families. It has served more \nthan 13,000 people and has a success rate of over 80 percent.\n  It is very simple, Mr. President, where most treatment centers fail, \nthose that are faith based work. This being the case, we have a duty to \nmake faith based treatment more available. This does not require any \nspecial program, Mr. President. Rather, we can achieve this important \ngoal by allowing faith based programs to stand on an equal footing with \nother centers in applying for Federal funds to heal individuals in need \nwithout changing the nature of the care they give.\n  We owe it to our families and communities, torn apart by drugs and \ndrug related violence, to fight the scourge of substance abuse. We owe \nit to the individuals in need to allow them to obtain the best \ntreatment available. This legislation will achieve these goals without \nincreasing the cost of government. I ask my colleagues for their \nsupport.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire text of the bill be entered \ninto the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1466\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am introducing the Senate \ncompanion bill to H.R. 2515, the Forest Recovery and Protection Act \nintroduced by my good friend and colleague, Congressman Bob Smith. My \nbill focuses on the western forest and Bureau of Land Management lands \nwhere there has been the most fire and disease damage.\n  Let me tell you what the forest lands are like in Oregon. On the \neastside of my State, disease and bug infestation have ravaged forests, \ncreating dangerous conditions for catastrophic fires. In 1996, I \nwitnessed firsthand fires that burned vast acres of forest land and \nthreatened many homes. This was a situation that didn't have to happen.\n  And yet, the political beliefs of a few have seemed to guide forest \npolicy back in Washington, DC--where bureaucrats with personal agendas \nseem to rule the roost and sound public policy fails to get heard.\n  Teddy Roosevelt said: ``The nation behaves well if it treats the \nnatural resources as assets which it must turn over to the next \ngeneration increased, and not impaired, in value.''\n  This legislation is a thoughtful approach to forest management--it \nincludes accountability through reports to Congress, performance \nstandards for forest inventory and analysis, and calls for the \nelimination of bureaucratic red tape and unnecessary delay that \nprevents on-the-ground results.\n  Concerns that environmentalists have about cutting of timber are \naddressed by ensuring that all forest health activities are carried out \nin compliance with existing forest plans. The legislation also \nprohibits entry into wilderness areas or other areas protected by law, \ncourt order, or forest plan. And finally, the bill provides for \npriority treatment of areas of greatest risk of destruction or \ndegradation by severe natural disturbance.\n  The bill has a local component which gives the local community and \nconcerned citizens the ability to identify Federal forest lands in need \nof recovery and allows them to petition the Secretary of the Interior \nand the Secretary of Agriculture to conduct forest recovery projects in \nthe identified areas. In addition, money is provided to those agencies \nresponsible for the forests at the local level with the necessary tools \nand incentives to address forest health problems in pro-active ways.\n  Furthermore, this legislation requires the Secretary of Agriculture \nand the Secretary of the Interior to commence a 5-year national program \nto restore and protect the health of forests located on Federal forest \nlands. The program includes the following components: Within 1 year of \nenactment, standards and criteria must be established for designating \nand assigning priority ranking to forest lands in need of recovery or \nprotection; a requirement that the Secretary to publish in the Federal \nRegister the proposed decisions on lands to be recovered or protected.\n  The bill also calls for no new forest management plans, but instead \nenhances existing ones. The bill requires that all forest health plans \nbe carried out in compliance with existing forest plans; sets up an \nindependent Scientific Advisory Panel, consisting of experts in forest \nmanagement, to evaluate the Advance Recovery Projects which are \nbasically pilot projects in areas of significant recovery or protection \nneed as identified by the Secretary of the Interior and Secretary of \nAgriculture.\n  And finally, one of the most important components of this legislation \nis the inclusion of local citizens and the prioritization that directs \nmore money on the ground. This component allows local citizens to \npetition the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture \nin identifying problems in forests, such as dead and diseased timber; \nprovides more money to the local levels of the agencies responsible for \nthe forests.\n\n[[Page S12135]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1467\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) There are tradeoffs in values associated with \n     proactive, passive, or delayed forest management, but the \n     values gained by proactive management outweigh the values \n     gained by delayed or passive management of certain Federal \n     forest lands.\n       (2) Increases in both the number and severity of wildfire, \n     insect infestation, and disease outbreaks on Federal forest \n     lands are occurring as a result of high tree densities, \n     species composition, and structure that are outside the \n     historic range of variability. These disturbances cause or \n     contribute to significant soil erosion, degradation of air \n     and water quality, loss of watershed values, habitat loss, \n     and damage to other forest resources.\n       (3) Serious forest health problems occur in all regions of \n     the United States. Management activities to restore and \n     protect forest health are needed in each region and should be \n     designed to address region-specific needs.\n       (4) Between 35,000,000 and 40,000,000 of the 191,000,000 \n     acres of Federal forest lands managed by the Forest Service \n     are at an unacceptable risk of destruction by catastrophic \n     wildfire. Additional tens of millions of Bureau of Land \n     Management lands are in the same situation. The condition of \n     these forests can pose a significant threat of destruction to \n     human life as well as fish and wildlife habitats, public \n     recreation areas, timber, and other important forest \n     resources.\n       (5) Restoration of forest health requires active forest \n     management involving a range of management activities, \n     including thinning, salvage, prescribed fire (after \n     appropriate thinning), insect and disease control, riparian \n     and other habitat improvement, soil stabilization and other \n     water quality improvement, and seedling planting and \n     protection.\n       (6) A comprehensive, nationwide effort is needed to address \n     forest health decline in an organized, timely, and scientific \n     manner. There should be immediate action to improve the areas \n     of Federal forest lands where forest health decline has been \n     thoroughly inventoried and assessed or where serious resource \n     destruction or degradation by natural disturbance is \n     imminent.\n       (7) Frequent forest inventory and analysis of the status \n     and trends in the conditions of forests and their resources \n     are needed to identify and reverse declining forest health in \n     a timely and effective manner. The present average 12- to 15-\n     year cycle of forest inventory and analysis to comply with \n     existing statutory requirements is too prolonged to provide \n     forest managers with the data necessary to make timely and \n     effective management decisions, particularly decisions \n     responsive to changing forest health conditions.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide for the conveyance of one (1) acre of land \nfrom Santa Fe National Forest to the Village of Jemez Springs, New \nMexico, as the site of a fire sub-station; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n       S. 1469. A bill to provide for the expansion of the \n     historic community of El Rito, New Mexico, through the \n     special designation of five acres of Carson National Forest \n     adjacent to the cemetery; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n\n    jemez springs fire sub-station and el rito cemetery legislation\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two bills that \nwould have a significant impact on two communities within northern New \nMexico. The villages of Jemez Springs, and El Rito, NM, are small \ncommunities that are completely surrounded by Forest Service land. \nDespite the fact that their populations are not growing rapidly, they \ndo have some specific land needs; some of which are actually caused by \ntheir proximity to national forest land.\n       For example, on any given weekend, the Jemez National \n     Recreation Area, within the Santa Fe National Forest will \n     have over 50,000 visitors. Village of Jemez Springs is the \n     only community wholly within the Jemez National Recreation \n     Area. As such, this community of 460 people is often called \n     upon for assistance with emergencies within the national \n     forest. In fact, over 90 percent of the village's fire \n     responses, emergency rescues, and ambulance calls are outside \n     the town limits, placing enormous strain on the village's \n     resources. To help address this problem, in 1996, the State \n     of New Mexico provided funds to Jemez Springs to build a fire \n     substation which would house three emergency vehicles. \n     However, Jemez Springs does not have a suitable location for \n     this facility, nor does the village have the tax base \n     available to buy land for it.\n       Mr. President, what this first bill would do is to \n     acknowledge the services that the Santa Fe National Forest \n     currently receives from the village of Jemez Springs, and the \n     additional benefit that a fire substation would provide to \n     visitors to the forest. In recognition of these benefits, my \n     bill would transfer one acre of land to Jemez Springs for use \n     as the site of a fire substation.\n       Mr. President, my second bill concerns the venerable \n     customs and religious practices of the people of El Rito, NM. \n     El Rito is a community of a little over 2,000 people nestled \n     within the Carson National Forest in New Mexico. It is a \n     community that has existed for hundreds of years, that is now \n     running out of space. Specifically the El Rito cemetery, \n     where people have buried their dead for generations, is full. \n     As a result, the residents of El Rito must now obtain special \n     permission from the Forest Service in order to bury their \n     family members on Forest Service land that is adjacent to \n     their cemetery. This situation has created what can only be \n     described as an unbecoming bureaucratic burden upon families \n     just at the time that they are grieving.\n       To solve this problem, my first thought was to transfer a \n     small portion of land from the Forest Service to El Rito for \n     their cemetery. However despite its age, the community of El \n     Rito is not an incorporated town so the Forest Service would \n     not have a legal public entity to transfer the land to. In \n     order to solve this problem, my bill does not transfer the \n     land, but rather it recognizes the historic nature of this \n     cemetery, and designates five acres of adjacent Forest \n     Service land as special use land for expansion of that \n     cemetery. This will remove the need for the residents of El \n     Rito to obtain a special use permit each time someone dies.\n       Mr. President, I think all of the New Mexico delegation \n     realizes that both of the problems addressed by these bills \n     need to be resolved. In fact, the House has passed a bill \n     concerning these two issues which was originally sponsored by \n     former Representative Richardson, and is currently sponsored \n     by Representative Redmond. However in response to concerns \n     raised by the Forest Service, the bill as passed by the House \n     would require these small communities to either exchange land \n     of equal value or pay for these lands. Mr. President I think \n     the reality here is that being surrounded by Forest Service \n     land, that it will be next to impossible for these \n     communities to find land of equal value to exchange. These \n     communities also do not have the financial resources for \n     outright purchases of property.\n       I believe that the way my two bills are written can meet \n     the concerns of the Forest Service and still resolve the \n     underlying problems these communities are facing. I am \n     committed to working with other Members of the delegation to \n     move this legislation as quickly as possible.\n       Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that these two bills \n     be entered into the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1468\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) The Village of Jemez Springs, New Mexico, (Jemez \n     Springs) is an incorporated town under the laws of the State \n     of New Mexico, and is completely surrounded the Jemez \n     National Recreation Area within the Santa Fe National Forest;\n       (b) Jemez Springs is a small community of approximately 460 \n     residents, however given it's location within the Jemez \n     National Recreation Area, as many as 30,000 people will pass \n     through this town on any given day;\n       (c) The large size of the tourist crowds within the \n     surrounding national recreation area create a strain on Jemez \n     Springs' emergency response capabilities. Over ninety (90) \n     percent of the ambulance, fire, and emergency rescue calls \n     are outside of the town limits.\n       (d) The State of New Mexico has appropriated funds for \n     Jemez Springs to build a fire sub-station to handle the \n     increase in emergency response needs, however, the town does \n     not have suitable land upon which to build the sub-station.\n\n     SEC. 2 LAND CONVEYANCE, SANTA FE NATIONAL FOREST, NEW MEXICO\n\n       (a) Conveyance.--The Secretary of Agriculture shall convey, \n     to Jemez Springs all right, title, and interest of the United \n     States in and to a parcel of real property, together with any \n     improvements thereon, consisting of approximately one acre \n     located in the Santa Fe National Forest in the State of New \n     Mexico. The emergency services provided by Jemez Springs to \n     the visitors of the Santa Fe National Recreation Area shall \n     be deemed adequate consideration to the United States for the \n     purposes of this conveyance.\n       (b) Condition of Conveyance.--The conveyance under \n     subsection (a) shall be subject to the condition that Jemez \n     Springs agrees to use the real property for the purpose of \n     constructing and operating a fire sub-station for Jemez \n     Springs.\n       (c) Reversionary Interest.--If the Secretary determines \n     that the real property conveyed under subsection (a) is not \n     being used in accordance with the condition in subsection \n     (b), all right, title, and interest in and to the property \n     shall revert to the United States, and the United States \n     shall have immediate right of entry thereon.\n       (d) Description of Property.--The exact acreage and legal \n     description of the real property conveyed under subsection \n     (a) shall be determined by a survey satisfactory to the \n     Secretary. The cost of the survey shall be borne by Jemez \n     Springs.\n       (e) Additional Terms and Conditions.--The Secretary may \n     require such additional terms and conditions in connection \n     with conveyance under subsection (a) as the Secretary \n     considers appropriate to protect the interests of the United \n     States.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 1469\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) The village of El Rito, New Mexico, (El Rito) is a \n     small community of approximately 2,500 residents, completely \n     surrounded by the Carson National Forest in New Mexico.\n       (b) The historic community cemetery of El Rito is adjacent \n     to the lands of the Carson National Forest in New Mexico. \n     After generations of use, there is no more available space \n     left in the cemetery and the community members are required \n     to get special use permits to bury their deceased on Forest \n     Service land.\n       (c) The requirement for special use permits creates an \n     undue bureaucratic requirement upon families within the El \n     Rito community when they are suffering from grief.\n\n     SEC. 2. DESIGNATION OF LANDS.\n\n       The Secretary of Agriculture, acting through the United \n     States Department of Agriculture Forest Service shall \n     designate five acres of land in the Carson National Forest \n     adjacent to the historic El Rito cemetery as special use land \n     for use as cemetery land for members of the El Rito community \n     to bury their deceased.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM:\n  S. 1471. A bill to prohibit the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices from treating any Medicaid-related funds recovered as part of \nState litigation from one or more tobacco companies as an overpayment \nunder the Medicaid Program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                          medicaid legislation\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of introducing \nlegislation which has been necessitated by a relatively arcane \nprovision in the Social Security Act. That provision, Mr. President, is \nsection 1903(d)3 which states that ``the pro-rata share to\n\n[[Page S12139]]\n\nwhich the United States is equitably entitled'' as determined by the \nsecretary--this would be the Secretary of HHS--``of the net amount \nrecovered during any quarter by a State or any political subdivision \nthereof with respect to medical assistance furnished under the State \nplan shall be considered an overpayment to be adjusted under this \nsubsection.''\n  Under that provision, Mr. President, the Health Care Financing \nAdministration has sent a letter to the States stating that they will \nnow be responsible for providing to the Federal Government through an \noffset against their otherwise entitled funds under Medicaid, the \nhealth financing program for the poor, that portion of any recovery \nthat they have made under a tobacco settlement that would be \nattributable to the Federal Government's share of previous payments for \nthose Medicaid beneficiaries who had been deemed to have suffered a \ndisease or illness related to tobacco.\n  The letter states, Mr. President, that ``under current law,'' the law \nthat I have just read, ``tobacco settlement recoveries must be treated \nlike any other Medicaid recoveries.''\n  Mr. President, this is a situation which cries out for congressional \nattention. In the past, that section that I read had been interpreted \nto apply to those cases where there had been a billing error, where \nsome Medicaid provider had overstated their reimbursement, the State \nhad taken action to reduce that request for payment and had received \nfunds from the provider that had been inappropriately paid in a \nprevious account. This will be the first time that this section of the \nlaw is being used to really go to policy questions, and that is, what \nis the Federal Government's share of these tobacco settlements which \nhave been negotiated by the States?\n  I believe that the reasons that Congress should take action on this \nare several. First, this is a policy issue and should not be settled at \na bureaucratic level, applying a statute that was written to deal with \nmuch different, much less policy-oriented issues as the question of the \nState and Federal share of State-initiated tobacco settlements.\n  I will read, Mr. President, from a letter dated November 7 to the \nPresident and signed by nine of our Nation's Governors in which they \nstate:\n\n       The issue of control of the settlement funds will be \n     difficult to resolve, and clearly a discussion of the \n     distribution of hundreds of billions of dollars demands \n     congressional involvement. Unfortunately, it appears that the \n     Health Care Financing Administration is not prepared to wait \n     for Congress to act.\n\n  Then the letter goes on to recount the fact that on November 3 the \nHealth Care Financing Administration contacted the State Medicaid \ndirectors to begin the process of collecting what it, the Health Care \nFinancing Administration, perceives to be the Federal portion of \nsettlement funds attributable to Medicaid.\n  Second, the reality is that the Federal Government has known about \nthese suits initiated by the States since their pendency. In the case \nof the State of Florida, that means approximately 4 years. But the \nFederal Government has been passive. It did not ask or respond to \nrequests to be listed as a coplaintiff and therefore be actively \ninvolved in litigation. It has provided none of the financing of the \nlitigation, which in some cases has amounted to tens of millions of \ndollars, and yet now after a successful recovery, it wants to insert \nitself through this provision, that was designed to deal with \nreimbursements of minor amounts, to collect major amounts under these \ntobacco settlements.\n  Finally, the Federal Government is not restricted from initiating its \nown effort to collect what funds it thinks it is due from the tobacco \nsettlements. If the Federal Government feels--whether it is Medicare; \nprograms under CHAMPUS, the health care for military personnel and \ntheir dependents; the Veterans Administration; or any other program in \nwhich the Federal Government is paying all or a substantial portion of \nhealth care costs--if the Federal Government feels that it has a \nlegitimate case for recovery, it ought to do the same thing that the \nStates have done, and that is initiate direct action toward such a \nrecovery. But it is unseemly for the Federal Government to now be \ncoming in after the fact and trying to collect on the good efforts that \nthe States have taken.\n  I have met with representatives of the White House and will continue \nto meet to determine if it is felt that specific legislation might be \nrequired in order to give the Federal Government the potential to \nrecover those funds that the national taxpayers have paid which they \nshould not have paid because they were due to illnesses or disease \noccasioned by the use of tobacco. I suggest that the representatives of \nthe White House look closely at State legislation such as that which \nwas passed in Florida, upon which Florida's successful settlement was \npredicated.\n  Mr. President, I will be sending to the desk legislation which will \nstate that the provision that I cited and other provisions analogous to \nit shall not apply to any amount recovered or paid to a State as part \nof a settlement or judgment reached in litigation initiated or pursued \nby a State against one or more manufactures of tobacco products. This \nwould clearly state that as a matter of congressional policy it was not \nour intention that that arcane accounting provision should be applied \nto a major policy issue such as the allocation of funds between the \nFederal Government and the States that were recovered as a result of \nState-initiated litigation against a tobacco company.\n  Rather, that is an issue which should be resolved by the policymakers \nbefore the Federal Government; that is, the United States Congress, in \nappropriate consultation with the President.\n  So, Mr. President, I send this legislation to the desk and ask for \nits immediate referral.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be received and referred to the \nappropriate committee.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthose documents which I referred to during my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                       Health Care\n\n\n                                     Financing Administration,\n\n                                  Baltimore, MD, November 3, 1997.\n       Dear State Medicaid Director: A number of States have \n     settled suits against one or more tobacco companies to recoup \n     costs incurred in treating tobacco-related illnesses. This \n     letter describes the proper accounting and reporting for \n     Federal Medicaid purposes of amounts received from such \n     settlements that are subject to Section 1903(d) of the Social \n     Security Act.\n       As described in the statute, States must allocate from the \n     amount of any Medicaid-related expenditure recovery ``the \n     pro-rata share to which the United States (Federal \n     government) is equitably entitled.'' As with any recovery \n     related to a Medicaid expenditure, payments received should \n     be reported on the Quarterly Statement of Expenditures for \n     the Medicaid Assistance Program (HCFA-64) for the quarter in \n     which they are received. Specifically, these receipts should \n     be reported on the Form HCFA-64 Summary Sheet, Line 9E. This \n     line is reserved for special collections. The Federal share \n     should be calculated using the current Federal Medicaid \n     Assistance Percentage. Please note that settlement payments \n     represent a credit applicable to the Medicaid program whether \n     or not the monies are received directly by the State Medicaid \n     agency. States that have previously reported receipts from \n     tobacco litigation settlements must continue to report \n     settlement payments as they are received.\n       State administrative costs incurred in pursuit of Medicaid \n     cost recoveries from tobacco firms qualify for the normal 50 \n     percent Federal financial participation (FFP). They should be \n     reported on the Form HCFA-64.10, Line 14 (Other Financial \n     Participation).\n       Only Medicaid-related expenditure recoveries are subject to \n     the Federal share requirement. To the extent that some non-\n     Medicaid expenditures and/or recoveries were also included in \n     the underlying lawsuits, HCFA will accept a justifiable \n     allocation reflecting the Medicaid portion of the recovery, \n     as long as the State provides necessary documentation to \n     support a proposed allocation.\n       Under current law, tobacco settlement recoveries must be \n     treated like any other Medicaid recoveries. We recognize that \n     Congress will consider the treatment of tobacco settlements \n     in the context of any comprehensive tobacco legislation next \n     year. Given the States' role in initiating tobacco lawsuits \n     and in financing Medicaid programs, States will, of course, \n     have an important voice in the development of such \n     legislation, including the allocation of any resulting \n     revenues. The Administration will work closely with States \n     during this legislative process as these issues are decided.\n       If you would like to discuss the appropriate reporting of \n     recoveries with HCFA, please call David McNally of my staff \n     at (410) 786-3292 to arrange for a meeting or conversation. \n     We look forward to providing any assistance needed in meeting \n     a State's Medicaid obligation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Sally K. Richardson,\n\n                                     Director, Center for Medicaid\n                                             and State Operations.\n\n[[Page S12140]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 7, 1997.\n     The President,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: When Congress reconvenes in January, \n     one of its most important priorities will be the development \n     of national tobacco settlement legislation. The nation's \n     Governors look forward to working with you and with members \n     of Congress to ensure that a final, comprehensive solution is \n     found to the dozens of state lawsuits pending against the \n     tobacco industry. The very fact that a solution is in reach \n     is because of the hard work and leadership of Governors and \n     the state attorneys general on behalf of the states.\n       An important component of the legislative debate will be \n     the issue of control of tobacco settlement funds. The \n     Governors attach the highest priority to clarifying that \n     settlement funds negotiated by the states to settle state \n     lawsuits must go to the states. Any efforts by the federal \n     government to seek to recoup federal costs must be separate \n     and distinct. Enclosed is a copy of the settlement funds \n     policy we, the Executive Committee of the National Governors' \n     Association, adopted last month.\n       This issue of control of the settlement funds will be \n     difficult to resolve, and clearly a discussion of the \n     distribution of hundreds of billions of dollars demands \n     congressional involvement. Unfortunately, it appears that the \n     Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) is not prepared \n     to wait for Congress to act.\n       On November 3rd, HCFA contacted state Medicaid directors to \n     begin the process of collecting what it perceives to be the \n     federal portion of settlement funds attributable to Medicaid. \n     Although in its letter HCFA mentions the importance of the \n     congressional process, it effectively preempts that process \n     by beginning to collect funds from those states that have \n     already settled their individual lawsuits.\n       The Governors believe that no action should be taken by \n     HCFA to withhold state Medicaid reimbursement prior to \n     congressional development of settlement legislation. Further, \n     the Governors will strongly support clarification in that \n     legislative package that tobacco settlement funds are not \n     subject to federal recoupment. Recoupment is more appropriate \n     for addressing billing errors than for inserting a federal \n     claim into the multibillion-dollar, state-driven tobacco \n     settlement. Accordingly, the Governors are supporting \n     legislation developed by Senator Bob Graham clarifying that \n     funds made available to the states through individual state \n     tobacco settlements or a national settlement are not subject \n     to federal recoupment.\n       We appreciate your consideration of our concerns. If we can \n     provide you with any additional background information, \n     please do not hesitate to let us know.\n           Sincerely,\n         George V. Voinovich, Governor of Ohio; David M. Beasley, \n           Governor of South Carolina; Howard Dean, M.D., Governor \n           of Vermont; Bob Miller, Governor of Nevada; Tommy G. \n           Thompson, Governor of Wisconsin; Thomas R. Carper, \n           Governor of Delaware; Lawton Chiles, Governor of \n           Florida; Michael O. Leavitt, Governor of Utah; Roy \n           Romer, Governor of Colorado.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN (for herself and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 1472. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na tax credit for public elementary and secondary school construction, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             the school repair and construction act of 1997\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nSchool Repair and Construction Act of 1997. This bill would help States \nand school districts rebuild our crumbling schools by providing tax \ncredits to developers and builders who build new schools or renovate \ncrumbling schools at below-market rates.\n  Under this proposal, the Treasury would allocate pools of tax credits \nto States. States would allocate the credits to school districts. \nSchool districts would be able to give these tax credits to developers \nand builders to cover a portion of the cost of their school repair, \nrenovation, modernization, and construction projects. By allocating tax \ncredits in this manner, the bill would reduce the cost to school \ndistricts of school improvement projects by up to 30 percent.\n  The School Repair and Construction Act of 1997 creates a mechanism \nfor paying for this proposal that is contingent upon our future \neconomic prosperity. If actual revenue into the Federal Treasury \nexceeds the revenue projections, a portion of those excess revenues \nwould be deposited in a School Infrastructure Improvement Trust Fund. \nThe money in this Trust Fund--up to $1 billion per year--would be \navailable for disbursement to States in the form of the allocable tax \ncredits.\n  Earlier this year, the Congress enacted broad tax legislation \ndesigned to generate wealth and spur economic growth and prosperity. If \nwe are right and that promise comes true, our children ought to benefit \nfrom our prosperity. The legislation I am introducing today will \nguarantee that these revenues are used to rebuild and modernize our \nschools so they can serve all our children into the 21st century.\n  According to the U.S. General Accounting Office, 14 million children \nattend schools in such poor condition they need major renovations or \nshould be replaced outright; 12 million children attend schools with \nleaky roofs; and 7 million children attend schools with life-\nthreatening safety-code violations. These conditions exist in every \ntype of American community. Thirty-eight percent of urban schools, 30 \npercent of rural schools, and 29 percent of suburban schools are \nfalling down around our children. According to the GAO, it will cost \n$112 billion just to bring schools up to good, overall condition.\n  The $112 billion price tag does not include the cost of upgrading \nschools for technology, the cost of upgrading electrical systems and \ninstalling outlets in classrooms that were built decades ago. The FCC \nrecently issued a landmark ruling that will give millions of children \naccess to modern computer and communications technology. Too many \nchildren, however, will be unable to take advantage of this \nopportunity, because their schools lack the basic infrastructure \nnecessary to allow their teachers to plug computers into the classroom \nwalls. According to the GAO, 15 million children attend schools that \nlack enough electrical power to fully use computers and communications \ntechnology. Almost 50 percent of schools lack the necessary electrical \nwiring to deploy computers to classrooms.\n  In addition, public high school enrollment is expected to increase 15 \npercent by the year 2007. Just to maintain current class sizes, we will \nneed to build 6,000 new schools by the year 2007.\n  I have visited schools in Illinois where study halls are literally \nheld in hallways because of a lack of space. I have seen stairway \nlandings converted into computer labs. There is a school where the \nlunchroom has been converted into two classrooms, students eat in the \ngym, and instead of gym class, many children have what the school calls \nadaptive physical education, while they stand next to their desks.\n  These overcrowded and dilapidated conditions are no accident. They \nare predictable results of the way we fund education. As long as we \ncontinue to rely on the local property tax to fund school \ninfrastructure improvements, the conditions of schools will not \nimprove.\n  The local property tax is simply an inadequate way of paying for \nschool infrastructure improvements. According to the GAO, poor- and \nmiddle-class school districts try the hardest to raise revenue, but the \nsystem works against them. In 35 States, poor districts have higher tax \nrates than wealthy districts--but raise less revenue because there is \nless property wealth to tax.\n  These districts cannot rely on State support. The GAO found that in \nfiscal year 1994, State governments only contributed $3.5 billion to \nthe school infrastructure crisis--barely 3 percent of the total need.\n  This local funding model does not work for school infrastructure, \njust as it would not work for highways or other infrastructure. Imagine \nwhat would happen if we based our system of roads on this same funding \nmodel. Imagine if every community were responsible for the construction \nand maintenance of the roads within its borders. In all likelihood, \nthere would be smooth, good roads in the wealthy towns, a patchwork of \nmediocre roads in middle-income ones, and very few roads at all in poor \ncommunities. Transportation would be hostage to the vagaries of wealth \nand geography. Commerce and travel would be difficult, and navigation \nof such a system would not serve the interests of the whole country. \nThat hypothetical, unfortunately, precisely describes our school \nfunding system.\n  The time has come for us to heed the call of superintendents, \nparents, teachers, architects, mayors, governors, contractors, and \nchildren from around the country and create a partnership to fix our \nNation's crumbling schools.\n\n[[Page S12141]]\n\n  Winston Churchill once said, ``We shape our buildings; thereafter, \nthey shape us.'' No where is that more true than in schools. The poor \ncondition of America's schools has a direct affect on the ability of \nour students to learn the kinds of skills they will need to compete in \nthe 21st century, global economy. America can't compete if our students \ncan't learn, and our students can't learn if their schools are \ncrumbling down around them.\n  This School Repair and Construction Act of 1997 is a sensible way of \nhelping States and school districts meet their school repair, \nrenovation, modernization and construction needs. I urge all of my \ncolleagues to join me in sponsoring this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the School \nRepair and Construction Act of 1997 and a summary of the legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1472\n\n         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives \n     of the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I give my strong support to the bill \nbeing introduced today by Senator Moseley-Braun to provide up to $1 \nbillion a year for improving America's school facilities.\n  Good education begins with good places to learn. We can't expect \nchildren to learn, when school roofs are crumbling, pipes are leaking, \nand boilers are failing. Adequate school facilities are essential to \nprepare children for the 21st century. It's preposterous to pretend \nthat we can prepare students for the 21st century in dilapidated 19th \ncentury classrooms.\n  We can no longer ignore this national crisis. We need to develop \neffective public-private partnerships to address these needs. Senator \nMoseley-Braun's bill provides that opportunity.\n  Schools across the country are facing enormous problems with \ncrumbling facilities. 14 million children in one-third of the nation's \nschools are now learning in substandard school buildings. Over half of \nall schools report at least one major building in disrepair, with \ncracked foundations, leaking roofs, or other major problems.\n  This bill can be a major start toward repairing the nation's \ncrumbling schools, by encouraging business and government to work \ntogether. It offers tax credits to developers and builders to cover \ncosts of school improvements. Each state will receive funds based on \nthe number of school-age children in the state who are eligible for \nfederal education assistance. The states will have the flexibility to \naward the tax credits to developers in school districts with the \ngreatest need.

Mr. President, today I introduce the Northern Ireland/\nBorder Counties Free Trade, Development and Security Act. This \nlegislation is a carbon copy of S. 1976, legislation that I introduced \nin the 104th Congress. Joining me as original cosponsors are my friends \nand colleagues, the senior Senator from Illinois, Senator Moseley-Braun \nand the Senator from Mississippi, Mr. Cochran.\n  The Northern Ireland Free Trade, Development and Security Act \nreintroduced today will--by University of Ulster estimates, create \n12,000 jobs within the twelve counties of Northern Ireland and the \nBorder Counties. It will produce an additional $1.5 billion into that \neconomy annually. The new jobs it will create will be targeted to those \nareas that need the most, areas where the current unemployment rate \nranges between 30 percent and 50 percent, areas that have never felt \nthe effects of real economic expansion or growth. Further, this \nlegislation will provide those jobs and hope without any discernable \nimpact upon our nations trade or budget deficit, as was the case with \nGaza/West Bank legislation. This bill will operate in harmony with \nstated goals of the European Union, United Kingdom and the Irish \nRepublic. It will additionally comport with the requirements of the \nWorld Trade Organization.\n  Mr. President, the paradox of Northern Ireland is that she has given \nso much to other cultures and lands but has been incapable of fully \nreaping the rewards of her own peoples skills and strengths at home. \nThe unfortunate reality is that as in the Republic of Ireland, a large \nmajority of the North's highly educated and skilled younger generation \nhas been forced to emigrate due to high unemployment levels which are \nas high as 70 percent in some areas. These disadvantaged areas are the \nones which this legislation has been especially designed to target. \nJoint cooperation and joint economic development between the United \nStates, Northern Ireland and the European Union will integrate the most \ndistressed parts of Northern Ireland and the Border Counties into a \ndynamic economy that--while firmly rooted in the European Union--\ncontinues to expand and cement new trading relationships beneficial to \nall trading partners.\n  Northern Ireland's peace process must move forward and the \naspirations and goodwill of the vast majority of its citizens must be \naccompanied by hard work and endeavor. A more prosperous economy with \nmore evenly spread and meaningful job opportunities can only serve to \nbridge the social and economic disparities that exist in this region. \nIn conclusion this opportunity cannot be overlooked, after 25 years \nsince the outbreak of the ``troubles,'' the people of Northern Ireland \nhave suffered enough violence and depravity. Now it is time to embark \non a rebuilding process that will give no chance to the terrorist but \nevery chance to peace and reconciliation.\n  Mr. President, it is time to roll up our sleeves and do something \nreal and substantive for all the people of Northern Ireland. This \nlegislation goes far beyond symbolic gestures and grand statements of \nconcern. It will provide a real and solid foundation that the people of \nNorthern Ireland can use to build that new and brighter future. This \nlegislation represents the Senate's down payment on that future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a public statement of \nsupport from Minister James McDaid, the Minister of Tourism and Trade \nfor the Republic of Ireland, found in today's Irish News--be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         [From the Irish News]\n\n        Minister Gives Backing to U.S. Free Trade Bill for North\n\n                          (By Jim Fitzpatrick)\n\n       The Republic's tourism minister Dr. Jim McDaid has given \n     his backing to the American free trade bill for Northern \n     Ireland and the border counties.\n       The Irish News reported last month that the proposed bill, \n     which a University of Ulster study concluded would create at \n     least 12,000 jobs, was facing opposition from officials in \n     London, Dublin and Brussels.\n       But Fianna Fail minister Dr. McDaid gave his unqualified \n     backing to the proposal yesterday, saying that he felt \n     special measures were necessary to redress the economic \n     imbalance on the island.\n       The bill would allow companies based in the northern twelve \n     counties of Ireland to sell products directly into the U.S. \n     without any tariffs.\n       Its backers argue that it would be a massive boost for \n     foreign investment and create thousands of jobs because it \n     would allow companies free access the two largest markets in \n     the world--north America and Europe.\n       But the legislation, which is in the early stages of \n     development in the U.S. Congress, has faced opposition from \n     some sections of the Irish political establishment.\n       Dr. McDaid's predecessor, Fine Gael minister Enda Kenny who \n     also held responsibility for trade, said the bill would \n     require customs posts to be set up within the Republic along \n     the border of the zone.\n       But Dr. McDaid rejected that suggestion: ``I don't agree \n     that this bill will mean the `re-partition of Ireland'. The \n     bill addresses an area which has already been recognized by \n     the European Union and the International Fund for Ireland as \n     needing special assistance.''\n       He said there was a need for ``positive discrimination'' \n     and a radical economic plan to tackle the economic problems \n     of the northern part of Ireland so that the ``whole of the \n     island'' can share in its economic success.\n       He said the bill would undoubtedly be a boost to the peace \n     process, and help redress the economic imbalance crested by \n     the years of violence in the north.\n       Dr. McDaid said he felt that the free trade status would \n     probably have to be granted on a time-limited basis--perhaps \n     for 25 years or more.\n       It's understood that support for the free trade bill has \n     been growing within Irish political circles, although the \n     Irish government has not taken a formal position on the \n     matter.\n       A number of senators and MEPs from border counties have \n     submitted letters of support to the U.S. Congress.\n       The U.S. Congressman pushing the bill wrote to the Irish \n     News recently calling on people in the region to publicly \n     support the initiative.\n       Massachusetts Congressman Marty Meehan praised the Clinton \n     administration's current efforts to bring new investment to \n     the north, and called on the people of the north to work with \n     the influential American politicians who are backing the free \n     trade initiative.\n       ``I encourage the people of Northern Ireland and the border \n     counties to work with me through trade associations, councils \n     and elected representatives to help pass this bill as well as \n     other related measures. Together, we can help lay the \n     groundwork for a sound economic future in Northern Ireland,'' \n     he wrote.\n       Mr. Meehan stressed in his letter that, contrary to some of \n     the criticisms levelled against the bill, his legislation \n     would comply fully with European Union law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. D'AMATO:\n  S. 1477. A bill to amend the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United \nStates to provide that certain goods may be reimported into the United \nStates without additional duty; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n         U.S. CATALOGUE MERCHANTS EXPORT PROMOTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nnecessary to correct a problem faced by an important segment of the \nAmerican exporting community, catalogue merchants. Catalogue merchants \nare multi-billion dollar export businesses in New York State and across \nthe nation. Due to an anomaly in our customs law, some products sold by \nthese merchants face double duties when the goods are returned to them \nby customers abroad. The bill I am introducing today seeks to correct \nthis problem by making sure that duties are only assessed once--as the \nlaw intended--the first time a product comes into this country from \nabroad.\n  If I may Mr. President, let me explain the problem by first telling \nyou how the system is supposed to work. When a catalogue merchant \nimports a product directly from abroad, as the\n\n[[Page S12145]]\n\nimporter of record, he pays a duty on the product. Let's say the \nproduct is a pair of trousers from Taiwan. A merchant in the United \nStates takes direct delivery of a pair of pants from a company in \nTaipei, and pays duties to the U.S. Treasury on the trousers when they \nenter the United States. The merchant then sells the pants to a \ncustomer in Montreal, Canada. But, the pants are the wrong size, and \nthe customer returns the same pair of trousers directly to the \ncatalogue merchant in the U.S. In that case, properly, is no duty paid \non the returned trousers. After all, a duty was properly paid on the \ntrousers when they were first imported into the U.S. That is how the \nlaw works when the catalogue merchant is also the official importer of \nrecord.\n  Now, take the same situation, but add a broker here in the United \nStates, (the way most catalogue merchants import merchandise into the \nUnited States) who is officially the importer of record. The trousers \ncome into the United States from Taipei, but this time, instead of \ngoing directly to the merchant, they are imported by a U.S. \ndistributer. The distributer, who is the importer of record, properly \npays the duty on the pants, and then transfers the trousers to the \ncatalogue merchant in the U.S. The catalogue merchant then sells the \ntrousers to the customer in Montreal, who subsequently returns the \ntrousers to the U.S. merchant (via a return clearinghouse in Canada, \nthat is set up to ship returned products back to the U.S. in bulk). \nThat is where the problem comes in. When the trousers come back to the \nUnited States (as part of a bulk shipment), duty has to be paid on the \ntrousers a second time. Officially, that is because the catalogue \nmerchant is not the original importer of record, and thus a second duty \nis assessed on the trousers.\n  Clearly, this makes no sense. A second duty should not have to be \npaid on the same pair of trousers, just because the U.S. catalogue \nseller is not the original U.S. importer of record. What this amendment \nsays, essentially, is that it doesn't matter who the original importer \nof record is; as long as the proper duty is paid when an article first \nenters the U.S., a duty is not assessed the second time the article \nenters the U.S., when it re-enters the U.S. as a sales return.\n  The President may know that I have sought this change in law for more \nthan a year, and it is my hope that when the Senate next turns to \nmiscellaneous trade matters, this very minor provision can be included. \nThe U.S. Customs Service has told importers that legislation is the \nonly remedy to correct this anomaly. Furthermore, the measure should be \ndeemed ``revenue neutral'' because importers can already avoid the \ndouble duty by simply shipping the returns back by (inefficiently) \nshipping the returns back to the U.S. individually rather than \n(efficiently) consolidating the shipments.\n  This measure is a common-sense, good government measure which \npromotes U.S. exports, and correspondingly keeps companies from moving \ngood jobs in distribution and logistics offshore.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 1480. A bill to authorize appropriations for the National Oceanic \nand Atmospheric Administration to conduct research, monitoring, \neducation and management activities for the eradication and control of \nharmful algal blooms, including blooms of Pfiesteria piscicida and \nother aquatic toxins; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n        the harmful algal bloom research and control act of 1997\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation designed \nto address a serious national problem affecting our coasts.\n  The recent outbreak of Pfiesteria in the Chesapeake Bay has garnered \na lot of media attention, and deservedly so. But Pfiesteria is actually \njust one example of a larger phenomenon--Harmful algal blooms.\n  These damaging outbreaks of often toxic algae affect every U.S. \ncoastal State and territory. In my State of Maine, we have outbreaks of \nparalytic shellfish poisoning every year which require the closure of \nclam flats along the coast, and the loss of millions of dollars in \npotential income.\n  On Georges Bank off the New England coast, harmful algal blooms cause \n$3 million to $5 million worth of damage every year. In Washington in \n1991, an outbreak resulted in losses of razor clams exceeding $15 \nmillion. And off Alaska, which has our Nation's most pristine \ncoastline, an estimated $50 million worth of shellfish remain \nunexploited each year due to these outbreaks.\n  What is frightening is that these blooms have been increasing over \nthe last 30 years with no sign of abatement--and science cannot explain \nwhy. Nor do we have any other way of addressing the problem besides \nclosing areas to swimming and fishing.\n  My bill is designed to address this problem with focused and \nappropriate Federal action. NOAA, the lead Federal agency on harmful \nalgal blooms, currently has the major Federal research program to \naddress the problem--the Ecology and Oceanography of Harmful Algal \nBlooms project, or ECO-HAB. It is part of NOAA's Coastal Ocean Program, \nbut it does not have a specific authorization. My bill would give this \nprogram a specific authorization for $10.5 million annually during \nfiscal years 1998, 1999, and 2000, providing it with a more certain \nfuture as the next century approaches.\n  The bill would also authorize the following activities for the next 3 \nyears--$5 million per year for NOAA to upgrade its research lab \ncapabilities to more effectively study the problem; $3 million annually \nfor education and extension services through the Sea Grant colleges; \n$5.5 million annually to augment Federal and State monitoring programs \nto help detect harmful algal blooms early; and $8 million annually in \ngrants to the States through the Coastal Zone Management Act [CZMA] \nprograms to help States control blooms in their area.\n  My bill represents a coordinated strategy for attacking this serious \nproblem. I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting this \nlegislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed, in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1480\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Harmful Algal Bloom Research \n     and Control Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the recent outbreak of the harmful microbe Pfiesteria \n     piscicida in the coastal waters of the United States is one \n     of the larger set of potentially harmful algal blooms that \n     appear to be increasing in abundance and intensity in the \n     Nation's coastal waters;\n       (2) in recent years, harmful algal blooms have resulted in \n     massive fish kills, the deaths of numerous endangered West \n     Indian manatees, beach closures, and threats to public health \n     and safety;\n       (3) other recent occurrences of harmful algal blooms \n     include red tides in the Gulf of Mexico and the southeast, \n     brown tides in New York and Texas, and shellfish poisonings \n     in the Gulf of Maine, the Pacific northwest and the Gulf of \n     Alaska;\n       (4) harmful algal blooms have been responsible for an \n     estimated $1,000,000,000 in economic losses during the past \n     decade;\n       (5) harmful algal blooms are composed of naturally \n     occurring species that reproduce explosively when the natural \n     system is out of balance;\n       (6) under certain circumstances, harmful algal blooms can \n     lead directly to other damaging marine conditions such as \n     hypoxia, as has been found in the Gulf of Mexico;\n       (7) factors thought to cause or contribute to harmful algal \n     blooms include excessive nutrients and toxins from polluted \n     runoff;\n       (8) there is a strong need for a national strategy to \n     identify better means of controlling polluted runoff;\n       (9) the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration \n     (NOAA) in the Department of Commerce, through its ongoing \n     research, grant, and coastal resource management programs, \n     possesses a full range of capabilities necessary to support a \n     near and long-term comprehensive effort to control and \n     eradicate harmful algal blooms; and\n       (10) funding for NOAA's research and related programs will \n     aid in improving the Nation's understanding and capabilities \n     for addressing the human and environmental costs associated \n     with harmful algal blooms.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR ALGAL BLOOM \n                   ERADICATION AND CONTROL.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of \n     Commerce for activities related to the research, eradication, \n     and control of harmful algal blooms $32,000,000 in\n\n[[Page S12146]]\n\n     each of fiscal years 1998, 1999, and 2000, to remain \n     available until expended. Of such amounts for each fiscal \n     year--\n       (1) $5,000,000 may be used to enable the National Oceanic \n     and Atmospheric Administration to carry out research \n     activities, including procurement and maintenance of research \n     facilities, of the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Research, National Marine Fisheries Service, and the National \n     Ocean Service;\n       (2) $10,500,000 may be used to carry out the Ecology and \n     Oceanography of Harmful Algal Blooms (ECO-HAB) project and \n     related research under the Coastal Ocean Program established \n     under section 201(c) of Public Law 102-567.\n       (3) $3,000,000 may be used for outreach, education and \n     advisory services administrated by the National Sea Grant \n     Office established under subsection 204(a) of the National \n     Sea Grant College Program Act (33 U.S.C. 1123(a));\n       (4) $5,500,000 may be used to carry out federal and state \n     annual monitoring and analysis activities administered by the \n     Office of Resource Conservation and Assessment of the \n     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; and\n       (5) $8,000,000 may be used for grants under sections 306, \n     306A and 310 of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (16 \n     U.S.C. 1455, 1455a and 1456c).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE:\n  S. 1481. A bill to amend the Social Security Act to eliminate the \ntime limitation on benefits for immunosuppressive drugs under the \nMedicare Program, to provide for continued entitlement for such drugs \nfor certain individuals after Medicare benefits end, and to extend \ncertain Medicare secondary payer requirements; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n            the immunosuppressive drugs coverage act of 1997\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will \nhelp organ transplant recipients maintain access to drugs that they \nneed to prevent their immune systems from rejecting transplanted \norgans. This bill is the product of many conversations I have had with \nfolks in the organ and tissue transplant community, including many \npeople from Ohio.\n  I have worked with people interested in organ and tissue donation for \nquite some time to increase awareness and education about transplant \nissues. Organs are very scarce, and we work hard to raise awareness so \nwe can increase donation. Despite our efforts, more than 55,000 \nAmericans are on the organ transplant waiting list--where they wait, \nand wait, and some of them die.\n  Others are lucky--they get one of the precious organs, allowing them \nto live a healthier, longer life. Because of the wonderful gift these \nlucky few have been given, it is particularly tragic that some can't \nafford the drugs--called immunosuppressive drugs--that help ensure that \ntheir immune systems won't reject their new organs.\n  That is why I am introducing the ``Immunosuppressive Drugs Coverage \nAct of 1997.'' This bill makes sure that the 75,000 people that have \nreceived an organ transplant covered by Medicare always have access to \nimmunosuppressive drugs. Medicare currently limits coverage for \nimmunosuppressive drugs to 30 months after a transplant. In 1998, the \nlimit will rise to 36 months under current law.\n  But then what? After Medicare coverage ends, the transplant recipient \nmust find some other way to pay for these essential drugs. Many \ntransplant recipients may not be able to get other insurance coverage \nor be able to afford to pay out-of-pocket for the drugs, which average \naround $5,000 annually and can cost in excess of $10,000. Without a way \nto pay for them, these patients may be forced to stop taking the \nimmunosuppressive drugs. Others will ration use of the drugs and take \nthem irregularly. In either case, the risk of rejection for the \ntransplant organ is much greater.\n  If a transplanted organ is rejected, the recipient may die or may \nneed intensive, life-sustaining medical care, which Medicare often does \npay for. And yet, it won't pay for the drugs to prevent these life-\nthreatening episodes.\n  For kidney recipients, who make up the vast majority of Medicare \ntransplant recipients, immune rejection means an immediate return to \nrenal dialysis at a cost to Medicare of around $30,000 a year. For some \nkidney patients and all other Medicare transplant recipients, rejection \nmeans a return to the transplant waiting list, and a need for expensive \nlife-sustaining care. If they are lucky, they will get a second \ntransplant, which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n  My bill simply makes sure that everyone who receives an organ \ntransplant through Medicare will have continued access to \nimmunosuppressive drugs. This bill will help people who cannot pay for \nlife-preserving immunosuppressive drugs and, at the same time, will \nhelp Medicare avoid the huge additional costs currently incurred when \norgans are rejected.\n  When working with people to write this bill, I wanted to make sure \nthe cost was as low as possible, while still getting the job done. That \nis why my bill contains safeguards that say that if any patient has \nprivate insurance coverage, it is the private insurance plan--and not \nMedicare--that pays for the immunosuppressive drugs.\n  Someday, immunosuppressive drugs may not be necessary. We are \nbeginning to see some promising research in this area. But today's \ntransplant recipients need help now. They need this bill.\n  The miracle of transplantation gives people the ``Gift of Life.'' It \ndoes not make sense to put this gift at risk because the recipient is \nunable to pay for immunosuppressive drugs. I urge every Senator to \nconsider cosponsoring and supporting this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COATS:\n  S. 1482. A bill to amend section 223 of the Communications Act of \n1934 to establish a prohibition on commercial distribution on the World \nWide Web of material that is harmful to minors, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                            PORN LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, during Senate consideration of the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996 I, along with Senator James Exon, \nintroduced an amendment to the Act which came to be known as the \nCommunications Decency Act or CDA. This amendment held forth a basic \nprinciple, that children should be sheltered from obscene and indecent \npornography. There was spirited debate on the amendment. However, \nultimately the Senate adopted the CDA by an overwhelming margin of 84 \nto 16.\n  On the very day that the President signed the Telecommunications Act \ninto law, the American Civil Liberties Union and the American Library \nAssociation, along with America On-Line and other representatives of \nthe computer industry, filed a law suit against the CDA in District \nCourt. In short, the case ultimately came before the Supreme Court, \nwhere it was struck down.\n  Mr. President, however much I disagree with the ruling of the Supreme \nCourt, it is reality and as such, I have studied the opinion of the \nCourt and come before my colleagues today to introduce legislation that \nreflects the parameters laid out by the Court's opinion.\n  Mr. President, during Congressional consideration of the CDA, \nopponents of the measure took what I like to call an ostrich approach. \nThey stuck their head in the sand and their rear end in the air.\n  With companies like America on Line and Microsoft in the forefront, \nthere came an indignant claim from the computer industry that there was \nno problem with pornography on the Internet. They claimed that there \nwas very little pornography, and that what exists is difficult to find. \nHowever incredulous, this is what they claimed.\n  Well, Mr. President, this ostrich appears to have extricated its head \nfrom the sand. For after the Supreme Court's ruling, the computer \nindustry, along with so-called civil liberties groups, gathered for a \nWhite House summit to address the issue of pornography on the net, and \nwhat could be done about it. There are now panels and working groups, \nmedia discussions and industry alternatives all designed to address \nthis problem of the proliferation of pornography on the Internet and \nthe threat it poses to our children.\n  Mr. President, let me congratulate the computer industry, and welcome \nthem to the real world.\n  And what is this real world? Mr. President, I turn now to the \nFebruary 10 edition of U.S. News and World Report. The cover story is \nentitled, ``The Business of Porn.'' The article outlines in rather \ndisturbing clarity the issue of pornography in America. ``Last year''\n\n[[Page S12147]]\n\nit states, ``America spent more than $8 billion on hard-core videos, \npeep shows, live sex acts, adult cable programming, sexual devices, \ncomputer porn, and sex magazines--an amount much larger than \nHollywood's domestic box office receipts and larger than all the \nrevenues generated by rock and country music recordings. Americans now \nspend more money at strip clubs than at Broadway, off-broadway, \nregional, and nonprofit theaters; at the opera, the ballet, and jazz \nand classical music performances combined.''\n  This is truly alarming, and reflects poorly on the moral direction of \nthe country. And, Mr. President, as the Internet continues to grow as a \nmedium of communication and commerce in our society, its role in \nexpanding the commerce of pornography increases exponentially.\n  The Article goes on to say that: ``In much the same way that hard-\ncore films on videocassette were largely responsible for the rapid \nintroduction of the VCR, porn on and CD-ROM and on the Internet has \nhastened acceptance of these new technologies. Interactive adult CD-\nROMS, such as Virtual Valarie and the Penthouse Photo Shoot, create \ninterest in multimedia equipment among male computer buyers.'' It goes \non: ``Porn companies have established elaborate Web sites to lure \ncustomers . . . Playboy's web site, which offers free glimpses of its \nPlaymates, now averages about 5 million hits a day.''\n  The Article quotes Larry Flint, who says he ``imagines a future in \nwhich the TV and the personal computer have merged. Americans will lie \nin bed, cruising the Internet with their remote controls and ordering \nhard-core films at the punch of a button. The Internet promises to \ncombine the video store's diversity of choices with the secrecy of \npurchases through the mail.''\n  Mr. President, there has been a virtual explosion of commerce in \npornography on the Internet. Adult book stores, live peep shows, adult \nmovies, you name it and it is there. It is available, Mr. President, \nnot just to adults, but to children.\n  And what does the computer industry, the ACLU, and the American \nLibrary Association tout as a solution to this problem? They tout self-\nratings systems and blocking software. Opponents of the CDA, companies \nlike America On-Line, the ACLU, the American Library Association, Larry \nFlint, have argued that there is no role for government in protecting \nchildren, that the Internet can regulate itself. The primary solution \nthese people promote is system called PICs (Platform for Internet \nContent Selection), a type of self-ratings system. This would allow the \npornographer to rate his own page, and browsers, the tool used to \nsearch the Internet, would then respond to these ratings. Aside from \nthe ludicrous proposition of allowing the pornographer to self-rate, \nMr. President, there is no incentive for compliance.\n  I now turn to an editorial by writers in PC Week Magazine, a very \nprominent voice in the computer industry. The editorial is titled: \n``Web Site Ratings--Shame on Most of Us.'' The column discusses the \nlack of voluntary compliance by content providers with the PICs system: \n``We and many others in the computer industry and press have decried \nthe Communications Decency Act and other government attempts to \nregulate the content of the Web. Instead, we've all argued, the \ngovernment should let the Web rate and regulate its own content. Page \nratings and browsers that respond to those ratings, not legislation, \nare the answers we've offered.''\n  The article goes on, ``Too bad we left the field before the game was \nover.'' the article says, ``We who work around the Web have done little \nto rate our content.'' it states that, in a search of the Web, they \nfound ``few rated sites.'' And that rated sites were the ``exception to \nthe rule'' In other words, PICs does not work. It does not work, \nbecause there is no incentive for pornographers to comply.\n  And what about blocking software? Mr. President, let me begin by \npointing out the amazing level of deceit that proponents of this \nsolution are willing to go to. The American Library Association, a \nprincipal opponent of the CDA, lined up with plaintiffs in challenging \nthe Constitutionality of the Act. It was a central argument of the \nLibrary Association and their cohorts, that blocking software presented \na non-governmental solution to the problem.\n  However, Mr. President, if one logs onto the American Library \nAssociation Web site one finds quite a surprise. Contained on the site \nis a resolution, adopted by the ALA Council on July 2, 1997, that \nresolves: ``That the American Library Association affirms that the use \nof filtering software by libraries to block access . . . violates the \nLibrary Bill of Rights.'' Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthis Resolution be inserted into the Record.\n  So, here we find the true agenda of the American Library Association. \nThey represent to the Court that everything is O.K., that all we need \nis blocking software. Then, they turn around and implement a policy \nthat says no-way.\n  And what are the implications? I quote now from a February 12, 1997 \narticle in the Boston Herald. ``John Hunt, a parent from Dorchester, \nsaid he was furious to learn his 11-year-old daughter was able to view \npornography yesterday while working on a school essay at the BPL's \nCopley Square branch.'' The article goes on: ``She said all the boys \nwere around the computer and they were laughing and called the girls \nover to look at the pictures of naked people,'' Hunt said. ``I want to \nfind out from these library officials what is going on.''\n  The article goes on to tell the story of another parent, Susan \nSullivan who said she was stunned when her 10-year-old son spent the \nafternoon researching a book report on the computer in the BPL's Adams \nStreet branch, but ended up looking through explicit photographs \ninstead.\n  Ms. Sullivan says: ``I'm very, very upset because I have no idea what \nhe saw on the screen. He said he was using the Internet to do a book \nreport on Indians and he was able to access dirty pictures, pictures of \nnaked people.''\n  When the library spokesman was asked about parent's concerns, he \ndismissed them saying, ``We do have children's librarians but we do not \nhave Internet police.''\n  So here is the genuine concern of the American Library Association \nfor children and their genuine support for blocking software as a \nsolution.\n  Again, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be \nmade part of the record.\n  However, Mr. President, this is a side issue. As I pointed out \nearlier, in the case of the computer industry, deceit and denial are \ntactics regularly employed by opponents of real child protections. The \nfact is, Mr. President, that the software does not work. In fact, it is \nparticularly dangerous because it creates a false sense of security for \nparents, teachers, and children.\n  I have here a transcript from Morning Edition on National Public \nRadio. It is from the September 12, 1997 program. The host, Brooke \nGladstone is interviewing a 12-year-old named Jack. Ms. Gladstone asks \nJack what he does when he bumps up against Net Nanny, a popular \nblocking software program.\n  Jack replies: ``You go to hacking sites such as the Undernet, which \nis a site which you pay money to go a member{sic}. And then, after \nthat, you have full access to all these hacking, cracking and phreaking \nand credit card fraud and all these other tools.''\n  Ms. Gladstone then asks Jack if kids use these services.\n  Jack replies: ``A lot. I mean, you have kids at school who bring in \n3.5 inch disks saying hey, buddy, come here. I'll sell you this disk \nfor $10 dollars. There's all the hacking stuff you'll ever need.\n  Ms. Gladstone then goes on to discuss with Jack how he made money \ndown-loading pornography and selling it to his school-mates, making \n$30.\n  Jack describes the various methods by which he defeats the blocking \nsoftware his parents have installed.\n  Later in the interview, Ms. Gladstone interviews Jay Friedland, \nfounder of Surf Watch, another well-hyped blocking software program. \nMr. Friedland readily concedes that his software can be broken, even \ndescribing the ways to hack the program.\n  In describing the security his product offers parents, he says: \n``It's a little bit like suntan lotion. It allows you to stay out in \nthe sun longer, but you can still get sunburnt.'' Mr. President, this \ndoes not sound very reassuring to me.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this article be \ninserted into the Record at the appropriate place.\n\n[[Page S12148]]\n\n  The bottom line here is money. There are millions upon millions of \ndollars being made on the Internet in the pornography business. There \nis even more money being made marketing software to terrified parents, \nsoftware that does not work.\n  Let's look at the situation. You have the computer industry working \nto defeat laws designed to prohibit distribution of pornography to \nchildren. The solution that they promote is blocking software, \nmanufactured by themselves. They are making tens- of-millions of \ndollars off of it. However, what we find out is that the software \ndoesn't work. And all the while, you have companies like America On-\nLine out there, head in the sand, telling parents, schools, Congress, \nand the American public that there isn't a problem with pornography on \nthe Internet. And the Internet Access Providers are pulling in the big \nbucks, providing access to the red light district.\n  ``The Erotic Allure of Home Schooling,'' that is the name of an \narticle, published in the September 8 edition of Fortune Magazine. Mr. \nPresident, I have long been an advocate of home schooling. But, I must \nconfess that its erotic allure has never been one of my motivations.\n  It begins: ``Here's one of the Web's dirtiest words: Mars. Try \nsearching for sites about the red planet lately, and you could land on \na porn purveyor's on-line playground. What next?'' the article asks, \n``Smut linked to the keywords`home schooling'? Don't look now--it's \nalready happened.''\n  The article goes on: ``Perverse as these connections seem, they're \nright out of Economics 101, specifically the part about competition. \nPornography sites are among the Web's few big moneymakers. There are \nthousands of them, from the R-rated to the boundlessly perverse. They \ncompete furiously, and their main battleground for market share is \nsearch engines like Yahoo, Lycos, Excite, and Infoseek. Web surfers \nlooking for porn typically tap into such search services and use \nkeywords like ``sex'' and ``XXX.'' But so many on- line sex shops now \ndisplay those words that their presence won't make a site stand out in \na list resulting from a user's query. To get noticed, pornographers \nincreasingly try to trick search engines into giving them top billing--\nsometimes called `spoofing'.''\n  The article points out that: ``Search engine companies like Infoseek \nconstantly develop new filters to defeat spoofing. But calls still come \nin from irate mothers and grade-school teachers who click on innocent-\nlooking search results and find themselves on a page too exotic to \nmention.'' The article concludes: ``The Clinton Administration is \nencouraging efforts based on`voluntary restraint.' That's a lot to ask \nin the Web's open bazaar, where market share is the name of the game.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this article be \ninserted in the record at the appropriate place.\n  Mr. President, it is not just a lot to ask. It is foolish and futile \nto ask. The bottom line is that, unless commercial distributors of \npornography are met with the force of law, they will not act \nresponsibly.\n  I am here today to introduce legislation that will provide just such \nforce of law.\n  As I stated in my opening comments, the legislation I introduce today \nis designed to accommodate the concerns of the Supreme Court. This \nlegislation is specifically targeted at the commercial distribution of \nmaterials harmful to minors on the World Wide Web.\n  It states simply that ``Whoever in interstate or foreign commerce in \nor through the World Wide Web is engaged in the business of the \ncommercial distribution of material that is harmful to minors shall \nrestrict access to such material by persons under 17 years of age.''\n  It is an affirmative defense to prosecution that the defendant \nrestricted access to such material by requiring use of a verified \ncredit card, debit account, adult access code, or adult personal \nidentification number. The bill also calls upon the FCC to prescribe \nalternative procedures. The FCC is expressly restricted from regulation \nof the Internet, or Internet Speech.\n  Further, the FCC and the Justice Department are directed to post on \ntheir Web sites information as is necessary to inform the public of the \nmeaning of the term ``harmful to minors.''\n  As I know that it will be of some concern to my colleagues that any \nlegislation dealing with this topic takes into account the Supreme \nCourt's ruling in the CDA, I would like to take some time now to \nexamine the key precedents which the Court considered in its opinion on \nthe CDA and how they relate to this bill.\n  Central to the construction of this legislation is the Ginsberg case. \nThis Court ruling upheld the constitutionality of a New York statute \nthat prohibited the selling to minors under 17 years of age material \nthat was considered obscene as to them even if not obscene as to \nadults. In Ginsberg, the Court rejected the defendant's argument that \n``the scope of the constitutional freedom of expression secured to a \ncitizen to read or see material concerned with sex cannot be made to \ndepend on whether the citizen is an adult or a minor.''\n  In Ginsberg, the Court relied on both the state's interest in \nprotecting the well-being of children, but also on the principle that \n``the parent's claim to authority in their own household to direct the \nrearing of their own children is basic in the structure of our \nsociety.''\n  In the Court's opinion on the CDA, they laid out four differences \nbetween the CDA and the question contained in the Ginsberg case. As you \nwill see, the legislation I introduce today carefully addresses each of \nthese concerns.\n  First, the Court points out that in the New York statute examined in \nGinsberg, ``the prohibition against sales to minors does not bar \nparents who so desire from purchasing the magazines for their \nchildren.'' The Court interpreted the CDA to prohibit such activity. \nThough I must confess to my colleagues that I find it a disturbing \nproposition that a parent should so desire to purchase pornographic \nmaterial for their children's consumption, it seems that this is a \nright that this Court feels compelled to protect.\n  The legislation I introduce today places no restriction on a parent's \nright to purchase such material, and to provide it to their children, \nor anyone else. In fact, it places no restriction on any potential \nconsumer of pornography. Rather, it simply requires the commercial \npurveyor of pornography to cast their message in such a way as not to \nbe readily available to children.\n  The Court's second issue relating to the Ginsberg case is that the \nNew York statute applied only to commercial transactions. As I have \npreviously stated, my legislation deals only with commercial \ntransactions.\n  Third, the Court points out that in Ginsberg, the New York statute \ncombined its definition of harmful to minors with the requirement that \nit be ``utterly without redeeming social importance for minors.'' The \nCourt goes on to express that the CDA omits any requirement that the \nmaterial covered in the statute lack serious literary, artistic, \npolitical, or scientific value.\n  This concern is addressed directly in my legislation, with a specific \nplank of the definition of harmful to minors requiring that the \nmaterial in question ``lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or \nscientific value.'' Mr. President, I do not believe that it is possible \nto address a concern more directly.\n  Finally, the Court states that the New York statute considered in \nGinsberg defined a minor as a person under the age of 17, whereas the \nCDA applied to children under the age of 18, citing concern that by \nextending protection to those under 18, the CDA reached ``those nearest \nthe majority.''\n  Mr. President, here again I am confused my the rationale of the \nCourt. For it is common practice in federal statute to recognize minors \nas those under the age of 18 years. However, the legislation I \nintroduce today contains the same under 17 requirement established \nunder Ginsberg.\n  The second case of importance as relates to the Supreme Court ruling \non the CDA is the Pacifica case. Though the specifics of this case are \nwell- known to most by now, a summary might be helpful. In the Pacifica \ncase, the Supreme Court upheld a declaratory order of the FCC relating \nto the broadcast of a recording of a monologue entitled ``Filthy \nWords.''\n  The Commission found that the use of certain words referring to \nexcretory or sexual activities or organs ``in an afternoon broadcast \nwhen children are in the audience was patently offensive'' and thus \ninappropriate for broadcast.\n\n[[Page S12149]]\n\n  In considering the precedent established in Pacifica, and their \nrelationship to the CDA, the Court outlined 3 concerns.\n  First, the Court stated that, unlike in Pacifica where the content in \nquestion was regulated as to the time it was broadcast, the CDA made no \nsuch distinction. Further, the Court makes a rather curious distinction \nin stating that the regulation in question in the Pacifica case had \nbeen promulgated by an agency with ``decades'' of experience in \nregulating the medium.\n  On the first point, the regulation of Internet content in the context \nof time is irrelevant, as a child may access or be inadvertently \nexposed to pornography any time he or she logs onto the Internet. That \ncould be in the evening, when doing a research paper, or during class--\nworking on an assignment, or at the public library. The simple fact \nthat a child runs the risk of exposure any time presents a more \nsubstantial potential for harm than the time regulation approach \napproved in Pacifica, and calls for a higher level of control, not \nlower as the Court concluded.\n  On the question of regulation by an agency with decades of \nexperience, given the fact that the Internet is a very new medium of \ncommunication, it is a rather ludicrous distinction to make. No agency, \nshort of the Defense Department, could demonstrate the historical \nrelationship to the Internet that the FCC can with broadcast radio. \nSurely the Supreme Court would not advocate Defense Department \nregulation of the Internet.\n  Further, given the concern among supporters of the Internet regarding \ngovernment regulation of the medium, it would seem preferable to have a \nclearly defined statute, enforced by the Justice Department, as opposed \nto a regulatory regime, which would be enforced by an unaccountable \nfederal agency and subject to bureaucratic creep. During debate and \nnegotiations on passage of the CDA, opponents raised strong concerns \nthat the FCC not be given any regulatory authority over the Internet. \nIt was this opposition to a regulatory solution that resulted in a very \nrestricted agency roll.\n  Though the FCC is expressly prohibited from regulating content under \nthe legislation I introduce today, a specific provision is made for the \nFCC to prescribe a method of restricting access that would function as \nan affirmative defense to prosecution.\n  As such, this legislation provides the benefit and flexibility of an \nevolving agency regulation, whereby as technology evolved and new and \nmore effective means of access restriction emerge, the Commission could \nmodify the regulation, without the creation of a regulatory regime with \nexpansive FCC authority over the Internet and speech.\n  The Court goes on to point out that in Pacifica, the Commission's \ndeclaratory order was not punitive, whereas there were penalties under \nthe CDA. Here, it is important to distinguish the difference in scope \nbetween this legislation and the CDA.\n  A principal concern of the Court with the CDA, was that the CDA dealt \nwith both commercial and non-commercial communications. As such, the \ncost and technology burdens necessary to restrict access that would be \nimposed by the CDA on non-commercial speakers, according to the opinion \nof the Court, would be prohibitive. The result would be, in the Opinion \nof the Court, that speech would be chilled.\n  The legislation I introduce today is strictly limited to the \ncommercial distribution of pornography on the World Wide Web. The \ncommercial distributors of pornography on the Web already use the very \nmechanisms (credit cards and PIN numbers) that are required under this \nbill. The difference between the status quo and this bill is that \npornography distributors would be required to cease to give away the \nfreebies that any child with a mouse could gain access to.\n  As such, Court concerns regarding the potential chilling effect to \nnon-commercial speech that they perceived under the CDA is moot. The \nscope of this legislation does not extend to the non-commercial \nspeaker. Secondly, this legislation imposes no new technological or \neconomic burden on the commercial operator. It simply imposes a control \non the manner of distribution and provides penalties for violations. \nMr. President, there is a long tradition of fines and penalties for \nviolations of laws governing the commercial distribution of \npornography. This legislation is simply a continuation of these \nprinciples. In fact, the very treatment of fines in penalties under \nthis legislation, mirrors those under dial-a-porn, which have been \nupheld by the Supreme Court.\n  Finally, under an examination of Pacifica, the Court points out the \ndifferences between the level of First Amendment protection extended to \nbroadcast and the Internet. Mr. President, I must say that however much \nI differ with the opinion of the Court on this question in general, I \nwould simply point out that the harmful to minors standard has \ntraditionally been used, and has been constitutionally upheld, as a \nstandard for regulating print media. Print media is extended the \nhighest level of First Amendment protection. As such, this legislation \nclearly accounts for the Supreme Court's concerns in this area.\n  The Court also examines the precedents established under Renton. The \nRenton case dealt with a zoning ordinance that kept adult movie \ntheaters out of residential neighborhoods. It did so based on the \n``secondary effects'' of the theaters--such as crime and deteriorating \nproperty values. It was the Court's opinion that the CDA treated the \nentire universe of cyberspace rather than specific areas or zones. \nFurther, the Court seemed preoccupied that the CDA dealt with the \nprimary, not the secondary effects of pornography.\n  The legislation I introduce today deals with a narrow zone of the \nInternet, commercial activity on the World Wide Web. Though there is \ntremendous economic activity in pornography on the Web. The cyber-\ngeography of this bill is very limited.\n  Mr. President, on this question of primary and secondary effects, I \nmust differ with the Court and would like to go into this question in \nsome detail.\n  The underlying principle which the Senate supported by a vote of 84 \nto 16 in adopting the CDA, and which is embodied in the legislation I \nintroduce today is articulated in New York versus. Ferber: ``It is \nevident beyond the need for elaboration that the State's interest in \n`safeguarding the physical and psychological well-being of a minor' is \ncompelling.''\n  There is no question that exposure to pornography harms children. A \nchild's sexual development occurs gradually through childhood. Exposure \nto pornography, particularly the type of hard-core pornography \navailable on the Internet, distorts the natural sexual development of \nchildren.\n  Essentially, pornography shapes children's sexual perspective by \nproviding them information on sexual activity. However, the type of \ninformation provided by pornography does not provide children with a \nnormal sexual perspective. As pointed out in Enough is Enough's brief \nto Court on the CDA, pornography portrays unhealthy or antisocial kinds \nof sexual activity, such as sadomasochism, abuse, and humiliation of \nfemales, involvement of children, incest, group sex, voyeurism, sexual \ndegradation, bestiality, torture, objectification, that serve to teach \nchildren the rudiments of sex without adult supervision and moral \nguidance.\n  Ann Burgess, Professor of Nursing at the University of Pennsylvania, \nstates that children generally do not have a natural sexual capacity \nuntil between 10 and 12 years old. Pornography unnaturally accelerates \nthat development. By short-circuiting the normal development process \nand supplying misinformation about their own sexuality, pornography \nleaves children confused, changed and damaged.\n  As if the psychological threat of pornography does not present a \nsufficient compelling interest, there is a significant physical threat. \nAs I have stated, pornography develops in children a distorted sexual \nperspective. It encourages irresponsible, dehumanized sexual behavior, \nconduct that presents a genuine physical threat to children. In the \nUnited States, about one in four sexually active teenagers acquire a \nsexually transmitted disease (STD) every year, resulting in 3 million \nSTD cases. Infectious syphilis rates have more than doubled among \nteenagers since the mid-1980's. One million American teenage girls \nbecome pregnant each year. A report entitled ``Exposure to Pornography, \nCharacter and Sexual\n\n[[Page S12150]]\n\nDeviance'' concluded that as more and more children become exposed not \nonly to soft-core pornography, but also to explicit deviant sexual \nmaterial, society's youth will learn an extremely dangerous message: \nsex without responsibility is acceptable.\n  However, there is a darker and more ominous threat. For research has \nestablished a direct link between exposure and consumption of \npornography and sexual assault, rape and molesting of children. As \nstated in Aggressive Erotica and Violence Against Women, ``Virtually \nall lab studies established a causal link between violent pornography \nand the commission of violence. This relationship is not seriously \ndebated in the research community.'' What is more, pedophiles will \noften use pornographic material to desensitize children to sexual \nactivity, effectively breaking down their resistance in order to \nsexually exploit them.\n  A study by Victor Cline found that child molesters often use \npornography to seduce their prey, to lower the inhibitions of the \nvictim, and as an instruction manual. Further, a W.L. Marshal study \nfound that: ``87 percent of female child molesters and 77 percent of \nmale child molesters studied admitted to regular use of hard-core \npornography.''\n  Given these facts, Mr. President, any distinction the Court makes \nregarding the effects of pornography on children seems to miss the very \npoint of the state's compelling interest. For the sanctity and security \nof childhood is what these efforts are all about.\n  As I have stated before in addressing this subject, childhood must be \ndefended by parents and society as a safe harbor of innocence. It is a \nprivileged time to develop values in an environment that is not hostile \nto them. But this foul material on the Internet invades that place and \ndestroys that innocence. It takes the worst excesses of the red-light \ndistrict and places it directly into a child's bedroom, on the computer \ntheir parents bought them to help them with their homework.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and yield the \nfloor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From U.S. News & World Report, Feb. 10, 1997]\n\n                      The Business of Pornography\n\n                          (By Eric Schlosser)\n\n\n Most of the outsize profits being generated by pornography today are \n being earned by businesses not traditionally associated with the sex \n                                industry\n\n       John Stagliano is a wealthy entrepreneur, a self-made man \n     whose rise to the top could happen only in America. Raised in \n     a conservative, Midwestern household, Stagliano read the \n     books of Ayn Rand and was greatly influenced by their heroes, \n     rugged individualists willing to defy conventional opinion. \n     He attended the University of California--Los Angeles hoping \n     to become a professor of economics. Instead, he studied \n     modern dance, struggled to find work as an actor, became one \n     of the original Chippendale dancers, performed occasionally \n     in hard-core films, and used the prize money won during a \n     cable television strip contest to finance and direct a porn \n     film of his own.\n       Today, Stagliano is the nation's leading director of hard-\n     core videos, a porn auteur whose distinctive cinema verite \n     style of filmmaking has been widely imitated. His videos cost \n     about $8,000 to produce--and often earn him 30 times that \n     amount. Stagliano shoots without a crew, edits the films \n     himself, and performs in them. He also is a major contributor \n     to the Cato Institute, a well-known think tank in Washington, \n     D.C., where he regularly discusses policy issues with its \n     economists.\n       Stagliano's company, Evil Angel Video, has become a \n     veritable United Artists of porn, distributing the work of \n     other top directors. Evil Angel sold about half a million \n     videos last year. At its modern Southern California \n     warehouse, hundreds of VCRs, stacked floor to ceiling, run 24 \n     hours a day, five days a week, churning out copies of hard-\n     core films.\n       A great deal has been written about pornography, both pro \n     and con. A new movie about the life of Larry Flynt, the \n     publisher of Hustler magazine, has once again raised the \n     issue of pornography and the First Amendment. But much less \n     attention has been given to the underlying economics of porn, \n     to porn as a commodity, the end product of a modern industry \n     that arose in this country after the Second World War and has \n     grown enormously ever since.\n       Critics of the sex industry have long attacked it for being \n     ``un-American''--and yet there is something quintessentially \n     American about it: the heady mix of sex and money, the \n     fortunes quickly made and lost, the new identities assumed \n     and then discarded, the public condemnations of a private \n     obsession. Largely fueled by loneliness and frustration, \n     the sex industry has been transformed from a minor \n     subculture on the fringes of society into a major \n     component of American popular culture.\n       Meese formation. More than a decade ago, Attorney General \n     Edwin Meese III's Commission on Pornography issued its \n     controversial report, asserting that sexually explicit \n     materials were harmful and calling for strict enforcement of \n     the federal obscenity laws. The report prompted President \n     Ronald Reagan to launch one of the most far-reaching assaults \n     on porn in the nation's history, a campaign that continued \n     under President George Bush. Hundreds of producers, \n     distributors, and retailers in the sex industry were indicted \n     and convicted. Many were driven from the business and \n     imprisoned.\n       The Reagan-Bush war on pornography coincided, however, with \n     a dramatic increase in America's consumption of sexually \n     explicit materials. According to Adult Video News, an \n     industry trade publication, the number of hard-core-video \n     rentals rose from 75 million in 1985 to 490 million in 1992. \n     The total climbed to 665 million, an all-time high, in 1996. \n     Last year Americans spent more than $8 billion on hard-core \n     videos, peep shows, live sex acts, adult cable programming, \n     sexual vices, computer porn, and sex magazines--an amount \n     much larger than Hollywood's domestic box office receipts and \n     larger than all the revenues generated by rock and country \n     music recordings. Americans now spend more money at strip \n     clubs than at Broadway, off-Broadway, regional, and nonprofit \n     theaters; at the opera, the ballet, and jazz and classical \n     music performances--combined.\n       Porn has become so commonplace in recent years that one can \n     easily forget how strictly it was prohibited not long ago. \n     The sociologist Charles Winick has noted that the sexual \n     content of American culture changed more in two decades than \n     it had in the previous two centuries. Twenty-five years ago, \n     a federal study of pornography estimated that the total \n     retail value of all the hard-core porn in the United States \n     was no more than $10 million, and perhaps less than $5 \n     million.\n       Durng the 1980s, the advent of adult movies on \n     videocassette and on cable television, as well as the huge \n     growth in telephone sex services, shifted the consumption of \n     porn from seedy movie theaters and bookstores into the home. \n     As a result, most of the profits being generated by porn \n     today are being earned by businesses not traditionally \n     associated with the sex industry--by mom and pop video \n     stores; by long-distance carriers like AT by cable \n     companies like Time Warner and Tele-Communications Inc.; and \n     by hotel chains like Marriott, Hyatt, and Holiday Inn that \n     now reportedly earn million of dollars each year supplying \n     adult films to their guests. America's porn has become one \n     more of its cultural exports, dominating overseas markets. \n     Despite having some of the toughest restrictions on sexually \n     explicit materials of any Western industrialized nation, the \n     United States is now by far the world's leading producer of \n     porn, churning out hard-core videos at the astonishing rate \n     of about 150 new titles a week.\n       Parallel universe. In the San Fernando Valley of Southern \n     California, near Universal City and the Warner Bros. back \n     lot, an X-rated-movie industry has emerged, an adult dream \n     factory, with its own studios, talent agencies, and stars, \n     its own fan clubs and film critics. Perhaps three quarters \n     of the hard-core films made in the United States today \n     come from Los Angeles County. Sound stages, editing \n     facilities, and printing plants are tucked away in middle- \n     and working-class neighborhoods, amid a typical Southern \n     California landscape of palm trees, shopping malls, car \n     washes, and fast-food joints. You could hardly choose a \n     more unexceptional spot for the world capital of porn.\n       Nevertheless, strange things are happening in the valley, \n     behind closed doors. Every few weeks, in the upscale suburb \n     of Sherman Oaks, there's an open casting call at the \n     industry's top talent agency. Scores of young men and women \n     crowd its small offices, undressing for producers and \n     directors who audition promising newcomers and inspect them \n     for tattoos. At the sleek headquarters of an adult-film \n     company in Chatsworth, the hallways are lined with \n     autographed basketball and hockey jerseys, expensively \n     framed. There is not an obscene image in sight. It could be \n     the headquarters of ESPN. In addition to hard-core videos, \n     the company's start-of-the-art, $30 million duplicating \n     equipment also copies videos for government agencies and \n     local church groups. At a factory in Panorama City, near the \n     foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains, shelves are lined \n     with plaster casts of the buttocks and genitalia of famous \n     porn stars. The casts are used to make sexual devices, \n     lifelike reproductions packaged with celebrity endorsements. \n     A rival L.A. company sells a plastic, inflatable woman that \n     speaks with an English accent. The factory calls to mind the \n     set of a science fiction movie: Wires peek from battery-\n     powered devices; metal cages on the floor are filled with \n     rubber body parts.\n       The distribution of sexually explicit material has become \n     intensely competitive. Hundreds of companies now produce and \n     distribute hard-core films, selling them to wholesalers and \n     retailers and directly to consumers. Videotape has lowered \n     production costs so much, according to one industry \n     executive, that the only barriers to entry today are ``a \n     sense of embarrassment and the lack of a good lawyer.'' The \n     availability of hard-\n\n[[Page S12151]]\n\n     core films on home video has forced adult theaters out of \n     business in cities nationwide. Los Angeles once had more than \n     30 adult theaters; today it has perhaps six. The number of \n     adult bookstores has also declined, though not so \n     precipitously. The bookstores are supported mainly by their \n     peep booths, which at some locations now allow a customer to \n     watch five hard-core videos simultaneously on dual TV \n     screens, demanding a new quarter every 20 seconds.\n       Although the sex industry in Southern California is \n     booming, most of the revenues generated by hard-core videos \n     are going to mainstream video stores. The consolidation of \n     the retail video business, marked by the growth of national \n     chains like Blockbuster, has put enormous pressure on mom and \n     pop video stores. Faced with competition from superstores, \n     independent retailers have turned to renting and selling \n     hard-core porn as a means of attracting customers. This \n     marketing strategy has been made possible by Blockbuster's \n     refusal to carry X-rated material and by the higher profit \n     margins of hard-core videos. A popular Hollywood movie on \n     videotape, such as Pulp Fiction, may cost the retailer $60 or \n     more per tape and rent for $3 a night. A new hard-core \n     release, by comparison, may cost $20 per tape and rent for $4 \n     a night. Some mom and pop video stores now derive a third of \n     their income from porn. According to Paul Fishbein, editor of \n     Adult Video News, there are approximately 25,000 video stores \n     that rent and sell hard-core films--almost 20 times the \n     number of adult bookstores.\n       Economies of scale. The spread of hard-core videos into \n     mainstream channels of distribution has fueled a tremendous \n     rise in the production of porn. Since 1991, the number of new \n     hard-core titles released each year has increased by 500 \n     percent. The falling cost of video equipment has attracted \n     more and more filmmakers to the business. In 1978, perhaps \n     100 hard-core feature films were produced, at a typical cost \n     in today's dollars of about $350,000. Last year, nearly 8,000 \n     new hard-core videos were released, some costing just a few \n     thousand dollars to produce. Wholesale prices have been \n     driven down by this flood of product. A market once \n     characterized by a relatively undifferentiated product has \n     segmented into various niches, with material often aimed at \n     narrowly defined audiences.\n       Hard-core videos now cater to almost every conceivable \n     predilection--and to some that are difficult to imagine. \n     There are gay videos and straight videos; bondage videos and \n     spanking videos; tickling videos, interracial videos, and \n     videos like Count Footula for people whose fetish is feet. \n     There are ``she-male'' videos featuring transsexuals and \n     ``cat fighting'' videos in which naked women wrestle one \n     another or join forces to beat up naked men. There are hard-\n     core videos for senior citizens, for sadomasochists, for \n     people fond of verbal abuse. The sexual fantasies being sold \n     in this country are far too numerous to list. America's sex \n     industry today offers a textbook example of how a free market \n     can efficiently gear production to meet consumer demand.\n       Men are by far the largest consumers of porn. Most of the \n     hard-core material being sold depicts sexuality from a \n     traditional male perspective, with women's bodies as the \n     central focus, little subtlety, and an emphasis on the \n     mechanics of sex. Some American women, however, are consuming \n     a good deal of hard-core material. During the late 1980s, a \n     survey by Redbook magazine, famous for its recipes and \n     household tips, found that almost half of its readers \n     regularly watched pornographic movies in the privacy of their \n     homes. And a recent survey by the Advocate, a leading gay \n     magazine, found that 54 percent of its lesbian readers had \n     watched an X-rated video in the previous 12 months.\n       Valley girls. The office of Vivid Video are in Van Nuys, \n     Calif., the epicenter of the sex industry. Located in the \n     middle of the San Fernando Valley and founded with the slogan \n     ``The Town That Started Right,'' Van Nuys has long been known \n     as a solid middle-class community, home to the ``Valley \n     girls'' whose distinctive idiom is often parodied. Great \n     Western Litho, which prints the box covers for hard-core \n     videos, is now one of the town's largest employers, along \n     with Hewlett-Packard and Anheuser-Busch. The Mid-Valley \n     Chamber of Commerce never mentions in its community guide \n     that hard-core videos are one of the area's major exports. \n     And yet from an inconspicuous set of buildings, across the \n     street from a quiet residential block, Vivid Video has become \n     one of the two or three leading adult-film companies in the \n     world by adapting the old Hollywood studio system to the mass \n     production of porn.\n       Steven Hirsch, the founder and president of Vivid, has long \n     hair, a good tan, a firm handshake, a brand-new black Ferrari \n     parked outside his office. As he talks about pay-per-view buy \n     rates, brand recognition, and foreign licensing rights, he \n     seems no different from the aggressive young Hollywood \n     executives a few miles to the south. He started his company \n     in 1984, at the age of 23. He thought that all porn films \n     looked alike--and that he could make better ones. He signed \n     actresses to exclusive contracts, heavily promoted his stars \n     as the ``Vivid Girls,'' and put them in films aimed at \n     couples, with dialogue and a plot. His formula soon proved a \n     success.\n       In addition to creating a sex-star system, Hirsch has made \n     Vivid one of the top hard-core film companies--along with VCA \n     Pictures, Leisure Time, and Metro--by exploiting new avenues \n     of distribution. Vivid's films appear on Playboy's cable \n     channel, and in partnership with Playboy, Vivid has launched \n     a new pay-per-view cable service called AdultVision. It \n     offers porn films 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Adult \n     movies on pay-per-view have become a large source of profits \n     for cable companies; a ``cash cow,'' one executive told \n     Variety. When an adult film is sold on pay-per-view, the \n     cable operator typically gets to keep 70 percent of the \n     revenue.\n       Last year, Americans spent more than $150 million ordering \n     adult movies on pay-per-view. Most of that money was earned \n     by the nation's major cable companies: Time Warner, \n     Continental Cablevision, Cablevision Systems Corp., and \n     TeleCommunications Inc. The porn services like AdultVision \n     and its main competitor, the Spice Channel, often attract \n     more viewers than channels offering Hollywood movies. Some of \n     the adult services give cable operators 5 percent of the \n     revenues gained by selling various products that are \n     advertised between porn films. There are cable companies that \n     rank in the Fortune 500 that now earn money through the sale \n     of love oils and lingerie.\n       Even larger revenues are being earned by companies that \n     offer adult films in hotels. Last year guests spent about \n     $175 million to view porn in their rooms at major hotel \n     chains such as Sheraton, Hilton, Hyatt, and Holiday Inn. Few \n     hotels have refused to carry adult material on their pay-per-\n     view systems. Whenever a guest orders an adult movie through \n     pay-per-view, the hotel gets a cut of up to 20 percent.\n       Hirsch also sells the foreign distribution rights to \n     Vivid's films, sometimes covering the entire cost of a \n     production through an overseas sale. Canal Plus, one of \n     France's biggest cable companies, broadcasts two hard-core \n     Vivid movies every month, which earn some of the channel's \n     highest ratings. European countries tend to have much looser \n     standards about nudity on television and much tougher \n     restrictions on violence. In Germany, films like Rambo and \n     RoboCop cannot be broadcast on television or rented in video \n     stores by anyone under the age of 18--and yet German pay \n     cable service offers extremely hard-core films. Although the \n     French sex industry is growing, American porn dominates \n     overseas markets.\n       In order to meet domestic and overseas commitments, Vivid \n     shoots eight new hard-core movies a month, half on video, \n     half on 16-mm film, with an average budget of $80,000. \n     ``We're like a big machine,'' Hirsch says. Logistical \n     nightmares are common: Screenplays fail to arrive on time; \n     performers don't show up on the set.\n       Hirsch says his job is not as exciting as some people \n     think: ``You spend half your day on the phone selling the \n     product and the other half of the day collecting for it.'' He \n     also believes there's nothing wrong with being in the porn \n     business; indeed, he grew up in it. Hirsch's father is a \n     former stockholder who started his own adult-film company and \n     put his teenage kids to work in the warehouse during summer \n     vacations. Hirsch's sister is now the head of production at \n     Vivid.\n       Nina Hartley is the stage name of a well-known porn star \n     whose career in the sex industry has lasted more than a \n     decade. Hartley grew up in Berkeley, considers herself a \n     radical feminist, and comes from a long line of American \n     rebels. She says that her grandfather (a physics \n     professor) and her father (a radio announcer) were members \n     of the Communist Party. Raised as a feminist to distrust \n     the male gaze, Hartley secretly fantasized about dancing \n     naked. After graduating magna cum laude with a nursing \n     degree from San Francisco State, she decided to become a \n     porn star. Since the early 1980s, she has appeared in more \n     than 300 hard-core films. She is a proud exhibitionist. \n     For the past 14 years, she has lived in a stable, \n     triangular relationship with her husband--a former member \n     of the campus radical group Students for a Democratic \n     Society--and another woman. ``Nina Hartley'' is a \n     deliberate creation of theirs, a larger-than-life persona \n     designed to show that a woman can be strong and sexually \n     autonomous.\n       Fear of sex? ``For all the lip service we give to sex being \n     holy and wonderful and spiritual,'' Hartley says, ``we let \n     Madison Avenue use it to sell spark plugs and dishwashing \n     detergent--to sell anything but sex.'' She thinks a great \n     deal of today's porn is not only misogynous but misanthropic, \n     treating men with disrespect. It is a disposable commodity, \n     reflecting the culture's deep fear of sex. ``The people who \n     run the porn business are not sex radicals,'' she notes, with \n     regret; their sex lives at home tend to be extremely \n     conventional. ``You'd be surprised how many of the producers \n     and manufacturers are Republicans.''\n       Some women are drawn to the sex industry because they're \n     exhibitionists who love the sex and the stardom. Most are \n     attracted by the money. One well-known porn star put herself \n     through law school by acting in hard-core films; others have \n     saved their earnings, invested well, and then quit. But many \n     are drawn to the industry by drug habits and self-loathing. \n     For these women, hard-core videos become a permanent record \n     of the most degrading moments of their life.\n       There is a constant demand for new talent, and few \n     actresses last more than a year or two. Hartley warns new \n     performers to avoid overexposure. A woman's pay is largely \n     based on her novelty. Hundreds of women are constantly \n     entering and exiting the industry. As in Hollywood, the \n     demand is greatest for actresses in their late teens and \n     early 20s.\n\n[[Page S12152]]\n\n       Sexually transmitted diseases are one of the industry's \n     occupational hazards. Performers are now required to undergo \n     monthly HIV testing, and their test results serve as a \n     passport for work. A number of producers insist upon the use \n     of condoms during especially high-risk activity; the majority \n     of producers don't. A leading actor with AIDS could in a \n     matter of days spread the virus to many other performers. \n     Because such an epidemic has not yet struck the porn \n     community, many performers question the prevailing wisdom \n     about AIDS and how it is spread. Behind these doubts lies a \n     great deal of fear, denial, and wishful thinking. Drawing \n     upon her experience as a registered nurse, Hartley has \n     published a set of ``Health and Hygiene Tips for Adult \n     Performers.''\n       Attempts to form a union for sex workers have met with \n     little success. Most of the performers, according to Hartley, \n     are ``eighties kids'' who want to be rich and pay fewer \n     taxes: ``Solidarity? Brotherhood? Sisterhood? Ha!'' Verbal \n     contracts are routinely made and broken, by producers and \n     performers. Checks sometimes bounce. The borderline legal \n     status of the industry makes performers reluctant to seek \n     redress in court.\n       The highest-paid performers, the actresses with exclusive \n     contracts, earn between $80,000 and $100,000 a year for doing \n     about 20 sex scenes and making a dozen or so personal \n     appearances. Only a handful of actresses--perhaps 10 to 15--\n     are signed to such contracts. Other leading stars are paid \n     roughly $1,000 per scene. The vast majority of porn actresses \n     are ``B girls,'' who earn about $300 a scene. They typically \n     try to do two scenes a day, four or five times a week. At the \n     moment, there is an oversupply of women in Southern \n     California hoping to enter the porn industry. Overtime is a \n     thing of the past, and some newcomers will work for $150 a \n     scene.\n       The dirty dozen. The actors in hard-core films serve mainly \n     as props for the female performers. Leading actors earn less \n     money than the top actresses but enjoy much longer careers. \n     Most enter the business in order to have sex with a large \n     variety of women. The men are valued primarily for their \n     ability to perform on cue. Perhaps a dozen men consistently \n     display that skill; some have now appeared in more than 1,000 \n     hard-core films.\n       Hartley spends about half of her year on the road, dancing \n     in strip clubs four to six nights a week. Like many porn \n     actresses, that is how she earns the bulk of her income. The \n     huge growth in the hard-core-video business during the 1980s \n     coincided with the opening of large strip clubs all over the \n     country. Hard-core videos now serve as a promotion for live \n     performances. According to Rob Abner, a former analyst at \n     E.F. Hutton who now publishes Stripper magazine, a trade \n     journal, the number of major strip clubs in the United States \n     roughly doubled between 1987 and 1992. Today there are about \n     2,500 of these clubs nationwide, with annual revenues ranging \n     from $500,000 to more than $5 million at a well-run \n     ``gentlemen's club.'' The salaries of featured dancers have \n     risen astronomically. The nation's top five or six porn \n     actresses earn $15,000 to $20,000 a week to dance at strip \n     clubs, doing four 20-minute shows each night. Another five or \n     six porn actresses earn between $8,000 and $15,000 a week. \n     Featured dancers are now paid, for the most part, according \n     to the ``credits'' they have accumulated--their appearances \n     in hard-core films, on video-box covers, in men's-magazine \n     photo spreads. In the hierarchy of sex workers, strippers \n     always used to look down at porn stars, viewing their work \n     with distaste. Now strippers from all over the United States \n     are flocking to Southern California and competing for roles \n     in hard-core films.\n       The uncontrolled, and perhaps uncontrollable, nature of \n     today's sex industry is best illustrated by the thriving \n     trade in home-made hard-core videos. During the 1980s the \n     camcorders advertised as a means of recording weddings, \n     graduations, and a child's first steps were soon used to \n     record sex. People began making and exchanging tapes of \n     themselves in bed. An underground market arose for these \n     crude but authentic sex tapes, and companies began to \n     distribute them. Today anywhere from one fifth to one third \n     of the hard-core videos being sold in the United States are \n     classified as ``amateur,'' featuring to some degree the work \n     of nonprofessionals. Most of the companies that distribute \n     amateur porn are located in Southern California. But there \n     are hard-core amateur-video companies distributing tapes from \n     Vandalia, Ohio, and Wentzville, Mo.; from Wichita, Kan., and \n     Ronkonkoma, N.Y.; from Woodridge, Ill., and Chattanooga, \n     Tenn. Americans who like to be watched and Americans who like \n     to watch are now linked in a commerce worth hundreds of \n     millions of dollars.\n       The oldest, and one of the largest, amateur porn companies \n     is based in San Diego, not far from the Salk Institute. \n     Homegrown Video offers more than 500 different tapes of \n     ordinary people having sex. The company's current owner, \n     Tim Lake, is 31 years old and could easily pass for a \n     drummer in a Seattle rock band. Lake and his wife, Alyssa, \n     sift through the new tapes that arrive at their office \n     each week from around the world. The people who appear in \n     these videos are of every race, size, and shape. Their \n     bodies are different from those seen in typical hard-core \n     films, in which the performers often look like parodies of \n     the reigning masculine and feminine ideals. People who \n     send tapes to Homegrown hope to break into the porn \n     business, or earn a little extra money, or show off. The \n     company pays them $20 for every minute of video it uses; \n     about half the tapes that Homegrown receives are \n     eventually released in some form. In a sense, the company \n     serves as a clearinghouse for the democracy of porn, \n     supplying hard-core videos by the people, for the people.\n       Lake, whose real name is Farrell Timlake, was raised in \n     Fairfield County, Conn. He attended prep schools in New \n     Canaan and Kent, studied literature at the University of \n     Washington, became a performance artist, met his wife at a \n     rock club, and followed the Grateful Dead with her for years. \n     The two have been together for more than a decade and have a \n     young daughter. Lake was a porn star in Los Angeles before \n     buying Homegrown, as was his wife. Lake's brother, who \n     attended Exeter and Stanford, is now Homegrown's head of \n     sales and has performed in its films.\n       In much the same way that hard-core films on videocassette \n     were largely responsible for the rapid introduction of the \n     VCR, porn on CD-ROM and on the Internet has hastened \n     acceptance of these new technologies. Interactive adult CD-\n     ROMs, such as Virtual Valerie and The Penthouse Photo Shoot, \n     created interest in multimedia equipment among male computer \n     buyers. The availability of sexually explicit material \n     through computer bulletin board systems has drawn many users \n     to the Internet. Porn companies have established elaborate \n     Web sites to lure customers. But these new technologies have \n     not yet become a major source of income for the sex industry. \n     Most of the adult-film producers in Southern California--like \n     their Hollywood counterparts--have been disappointed with \n     their multimedia sales. Despite the vast quantities of porn \n     available on the Internet, the revenues being generated are \n     minuscule compared with the video trade. Nevertheless, \n     distributing porn via the Net may yield large profits one \n     day. Playboy's Web site, which offers free glimpses of its \n     Playmates, now averages about 5 million hits a day.\n       Larry Flynt imagines a future in which the TV and the \n     personal computer have merged. Americans will lie in bed, \n     cruising the Internet with their remote controls--and \n     ordering hard-core films at the punch of a button. The \n     Internet promises to combine the video store's diversity of \n     choices with the secrecy of purchases through the mail. The \n     best example of how such ``non-face-to-face transactions'' \n     will take place can be found in any recent issue of Hustler. \n     Most of the ads, which cost $15,000 a page, are selling \n     telephone sex.\n       Tough call. Telephone sex--considered simply one more form \n     of ``audiotext'' by executives in the trade--became a huge \n     business in the 1980s despite government efforts at \n     regulation. Every night, between the peak hours of 9 p.m. and \n     1 a.m., perhaps a quarter of a million Americans pick up the \n     phone and dial a number for commercial phone sex. The average \n     call lasts six to eight minutes, and the charges range from \n     89 cents to $4 a minute. According to the owner of one of \n     America's largest ``audiotext providers,'' three quarters of \n     the callers are lonely hearts seeking conversation with a \n     woman. The sexual content of the call is often of \n     secondary importance. Some calls reach a recorded message, \n     but most are answered by ``actresses''--bank tellers, \n     accountants, secretaries, and housewives earning a little \n     extra money at the end of the day. The ease, anonymity, \n     and interactive quality of phone sex explain its \n     commercial success and its relevance to the future of the \n     Internet. Last year Americans spent between $750 million \n     and $1 billion on telephone sex.\n       AT is one of the biggest carriers of phone sex. In 1991, \n     the FCC restricted the type of adult calls that could be made \n     to numbers with a 900 prefix, banning ``obscene \n     communications for commercial purposes.'' But no such \n     restrictions apply to overseas calls, which can easily be \n     made from most telephones. Audiotext providers now make \n     financial arrangements with foreign phone companies and route \n     their phone-sex calls to ``actresses'' in the Dominican \n     Republic, Aruba, the Marianas, Guyana, and Russia. Half of \n     every dollar spent on one of these international sex calls \n     goes to the domestic phone company; the foreign telephone \n     company gets the other half, splitting its take with the \n     phone-sex provider. Some phone-sex providers have started \n     their own long-distance phone companies in order to cut the \n     U.S. carrier out of the deal. The use of overseas calls for \n     phone sex has been a boon to some foreign telephone \n     companies. This new routing system helps explain why the \n     annual volume of long-distance calls to the small African \n     nation of Sao Tome recently increased from 40,000 minutes to \n     13 million minutes.\n       Online sex. The nation's obscenity laws and the \n     Communications Decency Act are the greatest impediments to \n     Flynt's brave new world of porn. Even he is shocked by some \n     of the material he has obtained through the Internet. ``Some \n     of the stuff othere,'' he says, ``I mean, I wouldn't even \n     publish it.'' He supports the V-chip, which will soon give \n     parents the ability to prevent their children from watching \n     violent TV programming. And he thinks children should be \n     strictly denied access to sexually explicit material. But \n     Flynt believes that adults can safely read any book or see \n     any movie without risk of being corrupted and that the \n     obscenity laws are an insult to the intelligence of the \n     American people.\n       Flynt has slowly, almost imperceptibly, made the sexual \n     content of Hustler more explicit over the past few years. Its \n     photo spreads are now right on the border between soft core \n     and hard core. Readers have noticed the change and have sent \n     letters asking if\n\n[[Page S12153]]\n\n     what they see is real. Flynt may soon cross the line and make \n     Hustler hard core. His attorneys are not pleased with the \n     idea. But Flynt is beginning to think about his legacy. The \n     Supreme Court's 1988 decision in Larry Flynt v. Jerry Falwell \n     extended constitutional protection to political satire. The \n     infidel who once cursed the Supreme Court now seems almost \n     old-fashioned in his yearning to set another legal precedent. \n     ``I have all the money I need now,'' Flynt says, ``and I'm \n     not really motivated by it anymore. The most important \n     contribution I could make would be an end to the obscenity \n     laws.''\n       Flynt predicts that if the obscenity laws are rescinded, \n     the amount of hard-core material sold in the United States \n     will skyrocket--but not for long. Once the taboo is lifted, \n     once porn loses the aura of a forbidden vice, people will \n     lose interest in it. Within a decade of overturning the \n     obscenity laws, he claims, the size of the American sex \n     industry would decline to a fraction of what it is today.\n       Bruce A. Taylor is president and chief counsel of the \n     National Law Center for Children and Families, one of the \n     leading supporters of the Communications Decency Act and \n     of its provision banning information on abortion from the \n     Internet. Taylor thinks that Flynt's prediction is absurd, \n     that eliminating the nation's obscenity laws would be an \n     unmitigated disaster. Taylor opposes hard-core porn \n     because, he says, it degrades women, promotes rape, and \n     thrives on prostitution--hiring people to have sex. He \n     thinks most soft-core porn should be outlawed as well. \n     Taylor warns Americans not to be fooled by Flynt: ``Of \n     course people in the business want to see it legalized!''\n       But Flynt's theory--that legalizing porn will eventually \n     reduce the demand--may not be as outlandish as it seems. That \n     is exactly what happened in Denmark a generation ago. In \n     1969, Denmark became the first nation in the world to rescind \n     its obscenity laws, an act taken after much deliberation and \n     study. According to Vagn Greve, director of the Institute of \n     Criminology and Criminal Law at the University of Copenhagen, \n     when the Danish obscenity law was overturned, there was a \n     steep rise in the consumption of porn, followed by a long, \n     steady decline. ``Ever since then,'' he says, ``the market \n     for pornography has been shrinking.'' Porn sales remain high \n     in Copenhagen mainly because of purchases by foreigners. \n     Greve's colleague at the institute, the late Berl Kutchinsky, \n     studied the effects of legalized pornography in Denmark for \n     more than 25 years. In a survey of Copenhagen residents a few \n     years after the ``porno wave'' had peaked, Kutchinsky found \n     that most Danes regarded porn as being ``uninteresting'' and \n     ``repulsive.'' Less than a quarter of the population said \n     they liked watching hard-core films. Subsequent research \n     confirmed these findings. ``The most common immediate \n     reaction to a one-hour pornography stimulation,'' Kutchinsky \n     concluded, ``was boredom.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      [From PC Week, Feb. 3, 1997]\n\n                 Web Site Ratings--Shame on Most of Us\n\n       We and many others in the computer industry and press have \n     decried the Communications Decency Act and other government \n     attempts to regulate the content of the Web. Instead, we've \n     all argued, the government should let the Web rate and \n     regulate its own content. Page ratings and browsers that \n     respond to those ratings, not legislation, are the answers \n     we've offered.\n       The argument has been effective. With the CDA still wrapped \n     up in the courts, the general feeling seems to be that we, \n     the good guys, carried the day on this one.\n       Too bad we left the field before the game was over. We who \n     work around the Web have done little to rate our content. We \n     stumbled upon this situation while testing the latest release \n     of Ziff-Davis' BrowserComp browser compatibility test \n     (available at www.zdbop.com). We were checking a few random \n     sites to verify that they contained ratings. They did not.\n       After visiting a broader set of sites, we were shocked by \n     how little use of ratings we found. You can see for yourself \n     by cranking up Internet Explorer 3.0. Follow the menu path \n     View/Options/Security, and you'll see the Content adviser \n     section. Enable ratings and start checking pages. We think \n     your search will produce the same results as ours: few rated \n     sites. A few notable exceptions, such as Playboy and \n     Microsoft, had rated their pages, but they were more the \n     exception than the rule.\n       They don't rate.\n       Shame on the sites, including some of Ziff-Davis' own, that \n     lack ratings. No excuses really justify this lack of support. \n     Rating pages certainly isn't particularly hard. Pretty much \n     everyone agrees that the way to put a rating in a page is to \n     use the HTML PICS (Platform for Internet Content Selection) \n     tags. These tags let you specify for each of a set of rating \n     areas, such as language or violence, a level, or ratings, \n     that applies to that page. (For more information, visit \n     www.w3.org/pub/WWW/PICS.)\n       Exactly which rating types a site should use is less \n     settled, but the RSACi system from the Recreational Software \n     Advisory Council (www.rsac.org) seems to be the front-runner \n     and is the one IE supports. Some might argue that their sites \n     contain no objectionable content and thus don't need ratings. \n     That argument doesn't wash, however, because to be safe those \n     wishing to limit access to potentially unsuitable pages will \n     choose the option of having the browser block unrated pages. \n     For even the best-behaved pages to be available to such \n     folks, it needs a rating.\n       A bigger excuse may be the current paucity of browser \n     support for ratings. Netscape's Navigator 3.0 does not \n     include RSACi support. (Such support is coming in a future \n     release from Netscap, but it's sad that this leader in the \n     Web community was not a leader in ratings support.)\n       If you are as outraged as we are by the lack of page \n     ratings, do something about it. Stop by the PICS and RSACi \n     pages. Try our experiment. Complain to sites that are not \n     rated. Complain if your browser does not support ratings.\n       Raise a ruckus!

Desmond)\n\n       Pssst. Here's one of the Web's dirty words: Mars. Try \n     searching for sites about the red planet lately, and you \n     could land in a porn purveyor's online playground. What next? \n     Smut linked to the keywords ``home schooling''? Don't look \n     now--it's already happened.\n       Perverse as these connections seem, they're right out of \n     Economics 101, specifically the part about competition. \n     Pornography sites are among the Web's few big moneymakers. \n     There are thousands of them, from the R-rated to the \n     boundlessly perverse. They compete furiously, and their main \n     battleground for market share is search engines like Yahoo, \n     Lycos, Excite, and Infoseek. Web surfers looking for porn \n     typically tap into such search services and use keywords like \n     ``sex'' and ``XXX.'' But so many online sex shops now display \n     those words that their presence won't make a site stand out \n     in a list resulting from a user's query. To get noticed, \n     pornographers increasingly try to trick search engines into \n     giving them top billing--sometimes called ``spoofing.''\n       For a while, spoofing seldom went beyond simple tactics \n     such as stuffing home pages with lines like \n     ``SEXSEXSEXSEXSEX.'' If a search-engine user types ``sex,'' \n     the program looks for sites in its index of millions of pages \n     with the most occurrences of the words. Winners come up first \n     in the search results.\n       Once that trick became old hat, porn sellers got bolder. \n     Some bought ads on the search engines--one of the more \n     startling ads run recently by Yahoo and Excite reads: ``Which \n     site ALSO offers live sorority-slut sex shows, for FREE? \n     Fastporn.'' Others took spoofing to new depths. Infoseek \n     staffers recently deleted porn pages from the index that were \n     labeled with words like Tyson, Mars, and home schooling--\n     apparently the sites' sponsors hope to snag unwitting \n     surfers.\n       Search-engine companies like Infoseek constantly develop \n     new filters to defeat spoofing. But calls still come in from \n     irate mothers and grade-school teachers who click on \n     innocent-looking search results and find themselves on a page \n     too toxic to mention. All this, of course, has direct bearing \n     on the powwows in Washington about making the Web safe for \n     kids. The Clinton Administration is encouraging efforts based \n     on ``voluntary restraint.''

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the treatment of tax-exempt bond financing of certain electrical \noutput facilities; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              tax-exempt output facility bonds legislation\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today we are on the verge of a \nrevolution in the transmission and distribution of electricity that is \nfast bringing about competition and deregulation at both the wholesale \nand retail level.\n  Nowhere has the competitive model advanced further than in \nCalifornia, where full deregulation will become a reality at the \nbeginning of 1998. As many as 13 States representing one-third of \nAmericans have moved to competition in the electricity industry.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation that I believe will enhance all \nStates' ability to facilitate competition. This legislation arises from \nthe Energy Committee's intensive review of the electric power industry \nand from the Joint Tax Committee's report that I requested.\n  Over the past two Congresses, the Committee has held 14 hearings and \nworkshops on competitive change in the electric power industry, \nreceiving testimony from more than 130 witnesses. One of the workshops \nspecifically focused on how public power utilities will participate in \nthe competitive marketplace. At these and in other forums, concerns \nhave been expressed by representatives of public power about the \npotential jeopardy to their tax-exempt bonds if they participate in \nState competitive programs, or if they transmit power pursuant to FERC \norder No. 888, or pursuant to a Federal Power Act section 211 \ntransmission order.\n  The Joint Tax Committee report, titled Federal Income Tax Issues \nArising in Connection with Proposal to Restructure the Electric Power \nIndustry, concluded that current tax laws effectively preclude public \npower utilities from participating in State open access restructuring \nplans without jeopardizing the tax-exempt status of their bonds. Under \nthe tax law, if the private use and interest restriction is violated, \nthe utility's bonds become retroactively taxable.\n  These concerns have been echoed by the FERC. For example, in \nFERC Order No. 888, the Commission stated that reciprocal transmission \nservice by a municipal utility will not be required if providing such \nservice would jeopardize the tax-exempt status of the municipal \nutility. A similar concern exists if FERC issues a transmission order \nunder section 211 of the Federal Power Act.\n\n  Mr. President, if consumers and businesses are to maximize the full \nbenefits of open competition in this industry it will be necessary for \nall electricity providers to interconnect their facilities into the \nentire electric grid. Unfortunately, this system efficiency is \nsignificantly impaired because of current tax law rules that \neffectively preclude public power entities--entities that financed \ntheir facilities with tax-exempt bonds--from participating in State \nopen access restructuring plans and Federal transmission programs, \nwithout jeopardizing the exempt status of their bonds.\n  No one wants to see bonds issued to finance public power become \nretroactively taxable because a municipality chooses to participate in \na State open access plan. That would cause havoc in the financial \nmarkets and could undermine the financial stability of many \nmunicipalities. At the same time, public power should not obtain a \ncompetitive advantage in the open marketplace based on the Federal \nsubsidy that flows from the ability to issue tax-exempt debt. Clearly \nwe must provide for the transition to allow public providers to enter \nthe private competitive marketplace without severe economic dislocation \nfor municipalities and consumers.\n  Top remedy this dilemma, I am today introducing legislation that will \nallow municipal utilities to interconnect and compete in the open \nmarketplace without the draconian retroactive impacts currently \nrequired by the Tax Code. My bill is modeled after legislation that \npassed Congress last year which addressed electricity and gas \ngeneration and distribution by local furnishers.\n  My bill removes the current law impediments to public power's \ncapacity to participate in open access plans if such entities are \nwilling to forego future use of federal subsidized tax-exempt \nfinancing. If public power entities make this election, and choose to \ncompete on a level playing field with other power suppliers, tax-\nexemption of the interest on their outstanding debt will be unaffected. \nThey will be allowed an extended period during which outstanding bonds \nsubject to the private use restrictions may be retired instead of \nretroactive taxation, which is the situation under existing law. The \nrelief provided by my bill applies equally to outstanding bonds for \nelectric generation, transmission, and distribution facilities.\n\n[[Page S12155]]\n\n  Mr. President, without this legislation, public power will face an \nuntenable choice: either stay out of the competitive marketplace or \nface the threat of retroactive taxability of their bonds. With this \nlegislation, public power will be able to transition into the \ncompetitive marketplace.\n  Let me provide a few examples of real-world choices that public power \nfaces today. According to the Joint Tax Committee report, the mere act \nof transferring public power transmission lines to a privately operated \nindependent service operator [ISO] could cause the public power \nentity's tax exempt bonds to be retroactively taxable. Similarly, a \ntransfer of transmission lines to a State operated ISO could, in many \ninstances, trigger similar retroactive loss of tax-exemption depending \non the amount or value of the power that is transmitted along those \nlines to private users.\n  Moreover, participation in a state open access plan could, de facto, \nforce public power entities to take defensive actions to maintain their \ncompetitive position which could inevitably lead to retroactive \ntaxation of their bonds. Such actions would include offering a \ndiscounted rate to selective customers or selling excess capacity to a \nbrokers for resale under long-term contract at fixed rates or \ndiscounted rates.\n\n  I have also heard from the California Governor and members of the \nCalifornia Legislature about many of these problems and the need for \nlegislation to address them. I stand ready to work with them and \nrepresentatives from other States to solve this problem as part of the \nlegislation I introduced today.\n  Mr. President, my bill allows public power to participate in the new \ncompetitive world and provides a safe harbor within which they can \ntransition from tax-exempt financing to the level playing field of the \ncompetitive marketplace. In addition, the legislation recognizes that \nthere are some transactions that public power entities engage in that \nshould not jeopardize the tax-exempt status of their bonds under \ncurrent law and seeks to protect those transactions by codifying the \nrules governing them. This list may need to be expanded and I look \nforward to the input of the affected utilities in this regard.\n  In general, the exceptions contained in this bill closely parallel \nthe policies enunciated in the legislative history of the amendments \nmade in the 1986 Tax Reform Act. For example, the sale of electricity \nby one public power entity to another public power entity for resale by \nthe second public power entity would be exempt so long as the second \npublic power entity is not participating in a State open access plan. \nIn addition, a public power entity would be allowed to enter into \npooling and swap arrangements with other utilities if the public power \nentity is not a net seller of output, determined on an annual basis. \nFinally, the bill contains a de minimis exception for sales of excess \noutput by a facility when such sales do not exceed $1 million.\n  Mr. President, this legislation attempts to balance many competing \ninterests. This will be a difficult transition and this legislation \ndoes not address all the difficult problems to be faced. This is why I \nemphasize today that this is a starting point for discussion over the \nmonths ahead. This will be a difficult transition and this legislation \ndoes not address all the difficult problems to be faced. This is why I \nemphasize today that this is a starting point for discussion over the \nmonths ahead. I look forward to receiving comments from all interested \nparties and will encourage Finance Committee Chairman Roth to hold \nhearings on this bill early next year.\n  I am open to making revisions to this bill consistent with a public \npolicy that emphasizes a level playing field and a soft transition to \ncompetition for our important public utilities. I look forward \nespecially to working with the Chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, Senator Roth, who has been a leader in addressing tax issues \nrelating to competition in this industry.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1483\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to increase the number of qualified teachers; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n           the quality teacher in every classroom act of 1997\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. Presdient, I rise today to introduce the Quality \nTeacher\n\n[[Page S12156]]\n\nin Every Classroom Act, a bill to ensure quality and accountability in \nFederal efforts to improve public school teaching.\n  Let me begin by stating that I am a strong supporter of the hard-\nworking teachers in American classrooms. Coming from a family of \nteachers, I know first-hand how challenging the work is. Having visited \nschools throughout my home State of New Mexico, I know how dedicated \nand professional the vast majority of our teachers are. And any time \nyou talk to students, the conversation always comes back to teachers.\n  However, it's also pretty clear that we are not doing anyone--neither \nteachers nor students--a great service by putting so many under-\nqualified teachers in American classrooms, and providing so little \nsupport to teachers and the institutions that prepare and support them.\n  Too often, our teachers lack enough background in their subjects, our \ncolleges of education are not rigorous enough, our state licensing \nstandards are too low, and local districts have too few high-quality \ncandidates to choose from.\n  Improving teaching quality won't solve all of our educational \nproblems, but it is at the heart of what goes on in individual \nclassrooms around the nation. And as shown on the following charts, the \nstate and national statistics are alarming. None of us is doing as much \nas is needed to improve teaching quality:\n  As this first chart shows, most States have a long way to go in \npromoting teaching quality. In the 1997 Education Week national report \ncard called ``Quality Counts,'' none of the States received an ``A'', \nand most received ``C's.''\n  Like many other States, New Mexico received a ``C-minus'' for \nteaching quality in this report because--while the State does require \nnational certification for all its schools of education: Only 52 \npercent of NM high school teachers have degrees in their subject areas; \nthe State does not require that teachers have a degree in liberal arts \n(math, science, history, etc.); and fewer than three-fourths of NM \nteachers who participated in professional development received some \nform of support to do so.\n  As a Nation, we are unfortunately actually doing worse over all as \nthe 1990's have progressed. The just-released 1997 Goals report showed \nthat the percentage of high school teachers with a degree in their \nsubject area actually declined over all from 66 percent in 1990 to 63 \npercent in 1994. For New Mexico, the percentage has remained near the \nbottom, at 52 percent.\n  For New Mexico students, that means that it's about a 50-50 chance \nwhether their teachers have a strong background in the area they are \nteaching.\n  And the situation is particularly bleak in the key areas of math and \nscience, where we need to be at our best.\n  This second chart shows the latest data showing that nearly one in \nthree high school math teachers lacks a math degree. In New Mexico, the \npercentage was 36 percent, and in other states over half the math \nteachers lack even a minor in math.\n  This next charts shows a similar story in the area of high school \nscience. Nearly one in four high school science teachers lacks a \nscience degree. In most states, over 20 percent of the high school \nscience teachers lack that background. It's worth noting that in this \narea New Mexico fares better than most States, at only 19 percent.\n  More than 50,000 people are teaching America's children without the \nminimal training required to meet professional standards. In schools \nwith the highest minority enrollments, minority students have less than \na 50% chance of sitting in the class of a math or science teacher with \na degree in that field.\n  From talking to teachers, however, I know that it's they more than \nanyone else who want our public schools to be improved so that children \nto learn as much as they can. And that's important, because improving \nand maintaining the quality of America's teaching force is on the mind \nof every policy maker today. Clearly, all our efforts at raising \ncurriculum and testing standards for children will be severely diluted \nwithout the powerful presence of a competent instructor in each \nclassroom.\n  More than anything else, the public is demanding properly prepared \nteachers. A properly prepared teacher in every classroom is a \nreasonable demand. And the federal government, which has for too long \ntalked about improving teaching without doing anything about it, needs \nto become a leader in this area. That's what this legislation is all \nabout.\n  Now I want to be the first to acknowledge that I am not the only one \ninterested in this issue. Senators Kennedy, Reed, Frist, and others \nhave already introduced teacher training legislation, much of it based \non the 1996 findings of the National Commission on Teaching and \nLearning. And I know that the Chairman of the Labor Committee is \nextremely interested in this issue. I look forward to working with all \nof them as the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act continues.\n  However, this legislation, called the Quality Teacher in Every \nClassroom Act, is distinctive in several regards. Most importantly, \nthis is the only Senate proposal that provides a thorough formula for \nreform in teacher training. The legislation addresses the problem \ncomprehensively, and leverages as much improvement as possible given \nthe limited Federal investment in education.\n  Let me take a moment to describe its main features, which are \noutlined on the chart summarizing the bill.\n  First, the Act would take the simple step of making sure that parents \nhave available to them important information about the basic \nqualifications and academic background of their children's teachers.\n  Teachers are professionals just like the family doctor or the local \nlawyer, and so their backgrounds should be just as available as if \ntheir diplomas were framed on the wall. I believe that the availability \nof this information will engage and empower parents in advocating for \nimproved schools.\n  Second, the Act calls on states to reduce the percentage of teachers \nwho are uncertified or lack a sufficient academic background. States \nmust make zero tolerance for poorly prepared teachers their number one \npriority.\n  This bill gives them five years to reduce substantially the number of \nunlicensed teachers as well as those who are teaching outside of their \narea of expertise. It also requires them to accept any teacher from \nanother area who has national certification as a master teacher as \nfully qualified to teach in that state.\n  Next, the Act calls on colleges of education to make substantial \nchanges in the preparation that they provide teaching candidates, \nincluding graduating more students who will pass state teacher \nlicensing exams and requiring a rigorous liberal arts major in an \nacademic subject area, which is not uniformly required.\n  In addition, the Act will address the lack of high-quality teachers \nand teaching candidates in our most poverty-stricken schools by \nproviding financial incentives for highly qualified teaching \ncandidates. For each year they taught in high-need areas, new teachers \nwould have their school loans forgiven. And experienced teachers who \npursue advanced work such as national certification or Advanced \nPlacement training would also qualify for loan forgiveness.\n  This incentive should bring new energy and talent to poor \ncommunities, inspiring students and instilling parents with renewed \nconfidence in their children's schools.\n  Finally, the bill would help improve the recruitment and support \nprovided for new teachers by creating a competitive grant program to \nfund partnerships among colleges of education, school districts, and \nschools.\n  Each member of the partnership including a school district, a school \nthat includes at least 30% children who meet criteria for poverty, and \na university or college that offers teacher preparation. Special \npriority would be given to applications that used or created laboratory \nor ``teaching'' schools with their partner districts, where teaching \ncandidates learn hands-on.\n\n  In conclusion, I would like to say that I am excited to introduce a \nbill that brings together so many of the legislative agendas I have \nbeen promoting for many years: rigorous standards, constructive support \nfor those who are\n\n[[Page S12157]]\n\nfailing to meet those standards, and a comprehensive approach to \nsolving central problems of American public life.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1484\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Quality Teacher in Every \n     Classroom Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF POLICY; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Statement of Policy.--The Congress declares it to be \n     the policy of the United States that each student shall have \n     a competent and qualified teacher.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The number of elementary and secondary school students \n     is expected to increase each successive year between 1997 and \n     2006, at which time total enrollment will reach 54,600,000.\n       (2) As the number of students increases, the need for \n     qualified teachers will increase. Increases in enrollment and \n     teacher retirements together will create demand for 2,000,000 \n     new teachers by the year 2006.\n       (3) The lack of qualified teachers to meet this demand is a \n     significant barrier to students receiving an appropriate \n     education.\n       (4) The National Commission on Teaching and America's \n     Future has found that one-quarter of the Nation's classroom \n     teachers are not fully qualified to teach in their subject \n     areas. Unless corrective action is taken at the local, State, \n     and Federal levels, the additional demand for teachers is \n     likely to result in a further decline in teacher quality.\n       (5) 1997 is the time to redouble efforts to ensure that \n     teachers are properly prepared and qualified, and receive the \n     ongoing support and professional development teachers need to \n     be effective educators.\n                        TITLE I--PARENTAL RIGHTS\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to authorize acquisition of certain real property for \nthe Library of Congress, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nRules and Administration.\n\n\n          real property acquisition authorization legislation\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in my capacity as chairman of the Rules \nCommittee, I rise to introduce legislation that will authorize the \nacquisition of property for use by the Library of Congress. This \nlegislation will allow the Library of Congress to take advantage of a \nunique opportunity to advance the preservation of the Library's motion \npictures, recorded sound, television and radio collections, a unique \nrecord of American life and history in the 20th century.\n  The Library of Congress is clearly facing a crisis in fulfilling its \nstatutory--and I underline, Mr. President, ``statutory''--obligations \nto preserve, maintain and make available these national collections. \nThe Library must vacate its Suitland, MD, storage location by next May \n1998. Facilities in Ohio at Wright Patterson Air Force Base are beyond \ncost-effective repair. This has created an urgent need to find a new \nfacility.\n  The former Richmond Federal Reserve facility in Culpepper, VA, is \ncurrently available for purchase on the open market and it already has \nmany of the attributes, that is, the physical attributes, the \nconstruction and the like, needed to consolidate the Library's \ncollection in a single, efficient facility for conservation, storage \nand access. That facility in Culpepper, VA, is reasonably accessible \nfrom the Nation's Capital for scholars and others to work on this \nmaterial.\n  The staff of the Rules Committee has reviewed an extensive financial \nanalysis the Library provided us, showing alternative arrangements and \nsites for creating an audiovisual and digital master conservation \ncenter. The analysis concluded that Culpepper, VA, by allowing \nconsolidation of various storage and Library sites into a single \nfacility, is the most cost-effective option that they have found to \ndate. We can increase the cost-effectiveness of this proposal for the \ntaxpayer even further by taking advantage now of a generous offer by a \nnationally known foundation to provide up to a $10 million donation for \nthe purchase and initial modifications of the Culpepper property.\n  However, it appears the gift will only be available if Congress \npasses legislation as incorporated in this bill and in this session to \nauthorize acceptance of the building by the Architect of the Capitol.\n  I stress, Mr. President, that this $10 million gift to the American \ntaxpayers for preservation of this very important collection--and I \nparticipated somewhat in the discussion of this with the chairman of \nthe board of the foundation together with the Librarian of Congress. We \nhave reason to believe that if we do not act in this session, this gift \nmight not be available at the time the Congress resumes its work next \nyear. Congress clearly has responsibility to enable the Library to \nfulfill its statutory mandates to preserve\n\n[[Page S12160]]\n\nthese collections, and these urgent storage and access needs must be \naddressed both from an oversight and an appropriations viewpoint. We \nnow have an opportunity to meet these needs in a cost-effective manner, \nwhich takes advantage of a significant private donation.\n  In my view, moving forward with the Culpepper option at this time is \nin the best interests of the Library and the American taxpayers. \nTherefore, I hope all Members will support this legislation promptly, \nthat it can be cleared on the hotline here within the next 24 hours, \nand that this body, the Senate, will act. I have reason to believe, \nhaving had consultations with my colleagues in the House with \ncomparable responsibility as the Rules Committee, that the House will \nquickly accept this bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 1488. A bill to ratify an agreement between the Aleut Corp. and \nthe United States of America to exchange land rights received under the \nAlaska Native Claims Settlement Act for certain land interests on Adak \nIsland, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n       the adak island naval base reuse facilitation act of 1997\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwhich will facilitate and promote the successful commercial reuse of \nthe Naval Air Facility being closed on Adak Island, AK. This \nlegislation will ratify an agreement between the Aleut Corp. in Alaska, \nthe Department of the Interior, and the Department of the Navy.\n  While not yet complete, the Aleut Corp. has been working together \nwith the Department of the Interior and the Department of the Navy on \nthe agreement that would be ratified by this legislation. I know from \nmy Aleutian constituents that a good number of issues have been \nresolved through extracted negotiations, but that important issues \nremain on the table. it is my hope that the remaining issues can be \nresolved through mutual agreement prior to hearings on this bill early \nnext year. In the meantime, it is imperative that the Navy make the \nfacilities at Adak available for interim reuse, as has been done with \ntransfers at other closed facilities.\n  For many decades the Navy has been an important and steadfast \nconstituent in Alaska's Aleutian Chain. Their presence was first \nestablished during World War II with the selection and development of \nthe island because of its combination of ability to support a major \nairfield and its natural and protected deep water port. The Navy's \npresence there contributed greatly to the defense of our Pacific coast \nduring World War II and throughout the cold war. Through the Navy's \npresence, Adak became the largest development in the Aleutians as well \nas Alaska's sixth largest community.\n  The facility was selected for closure during the last base closure \nround, and while the importance of using the island for defense \npurposes has diminished, it has not lost any of its unique geographic \nadvantages. Adak is a natural stepping stone to Asia and is at the \ncrossroads of air and sea trade between North America, Europe, and \nAsia. The Aleutian Islands, although stark and desolate to some, are \nthe ancestral home to the shareholders of the Aleut Corp. This \nlegislation will allow Adak's natural constituents, the Aleut people, \nto reinhabit the island and to make use of its modern developments.\n  These very same features that made Adak strategically important to \nthe Navy for defense purposes make the island strategically important \nfor commercial purposes. Adak Island is at the middle of the great \nexpanse of the Aleutian Islands, and is among the island chain's \nsouthernmost islands, near to the great circle route shipping lanes. \nWith the ability to use Adak commercially, the Aleut Corp. aims to make \nthe island an important intercontinental location with enterprise \nenough to provide year round jobs for the Aleut people. These goals are \nconsistent with the promises and the Alaska Native Claims Settlement \nAct, the legislation that created the corporation.\n  The legislation supports the broader interests of the country as \nwell. In addition to the Navy, Adak has housed the Department of the \nInterior's Aleutian Islands subunit of the Alaska Maritime National \nWildlife Refuge. This legislation promotes the Department of the \nInterior's interests in managing and protecting the refuge by the \nexchange of base lands for certain property interests the Aleut Corp. \nholds throughout the rest of the Aleutian Islands refuge. In addition \nto the Department of the Interior, the Department of Defense is \npromoting this exchange as the most effective way to meet this \ncountry's objectives of conversion of closed defense facilities into \nsuccessful commercial reuse.\n  Many potential concurrent reuse possibilities of the Adak lands are \nbeing explored. These include but are certainly not limited to an air \nand sea transhipment, refueling and reprovisions facility, a new \necotourism cruise ship destination, a law enforcement or Job Corps \ntraining facility or a somewhat less glamorous but nonetheless needed \ncorrectional facility. All these are possibilities available through \nenactment of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, it is my intention to hold a hearing on this \nlegislation at the earliest opportunity when Congress returns next \nyear. I suggest to all the parties to this agreement that I will be \nkeeping a close eye on progress toward expedient closure on the final \nissues. If progress is not made, or if negotiated commitments are not \nhonored, I am prepared to modify this legislation and direct an \nappropriate structure for this land exchange.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 1489. A bill to provide the public with access to outfitted \nactivities on Federal land, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                    the outfitter policy act of 1997\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the \nOutfitter Policy Act of 1997.\n  This legislation puts into law many of the management practices by \nwhich Federal land management agencies have successfully managed the \noutfitter and guide industry on national forests, national parks and \nother Federal lands over many decades.\n  The bill recognizes that many Americans need and seek the skills and \nexperience of commercial outfitters and guides in order to enjoy a safe \nand pleasant journey through wild lands and over the rivers and lakes \nthat are the spectacular destinations for many visitors to our Federal \nlands.\n  My bill assures the public continued opportunities for reasonable and \nsafe access to these special areas. It assures high standards will be \nmet for the health and welfare of visitors who chose outfitted services \nand quality professional services will be avaiable for their \nrecreational and educational experiences on federal land.\n  This legislation is called for because the management of outfitted \nand guided services by this administration has created problems that \nthreaten to destabilize some of these typically small, independent \noutfitter and guide businesses. In addressing these problems, this \nlegislation relies heavily on practices that have historically worked \nwell for outfitters, visitors, and other user groups, as well as for \nFederal land managers in the field. When the bill is enacted, it will \nassure that these past fine levels of service are continued and \nenhanced.\n  When I introduced similar legislation, S. 2194, at the conclusion of \nthe 104th Congress, I did do so for the purpose of creating discussion \nconcerning outfitter and guide operations within the context of the \nbroader issue of concessioner reform that this Congress has been \naddressing for two decades.\n  In the year that has followed, the Senate Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources has held one oversight hearing on concessions \noperations, but has not yet addressed the issue of concessions that \nspecifically offer outfitting and guiding services. S. 2194 provided \nthe intended opportunity for discussion, however. It has allowed for \nthe examination of the historical practices that have offered \nconsistent, reliable outfitter services to the public. This earlier \nversion of the bill also facilitated a discussion of the need for \nconsistency between Federal agencies in the management of outfitted \nservices and allowed the opportunity to examine policies that have \nprovided high\n\n[[Page S12161]]\n\nquality recreation services, protection of natural resources, a fair \nreturn to the government, and reasonable economic stability that the \npublic expects. The legislation I am now introducing is a result of \nthose discussions.\n  I look forward to a hearing on this legislation and to moving with \nits enactment in the coming session of the 105th Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS.\n  S. 1490. A bill to improve the quality of child care provided through \nFederal facilities and programs, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n              quality child care for federal employees act\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Quality \nChild Care for Federal Employees Act. This bill was drafted with an eye \ntoward several serious incidents which occurred earlier this year in \nfederal child care facilities. At that time, it came to my attention \nthat child care centers located in Federal facilities are not subject \nto even the most minimal health and safety standards.\n  As you know, Federal property is exempt from State and local laws, \nregulations, and oversight. What this means for child care centers on \nthat property is that State and local health and safety standards do \nnot and cannot apply. This might not be a problem if federally owned or \nleased child care centers met enforceable health and safety standards. \nI think most parents who place their children in Federal child care \nwould assume that this would be the case. However, I think Federal \nemployees will find it very surprising to learn, as I did, that, at \nmany centers, no such health and safety standards apply.\n  I find this very troubling, and I think we sell our Federal employees \na bill of goods when federally-owned leased child care cannot guarantee \nthat their children are in safe facilities. The Federal Government \nshould set the example when it comes to providing safe child care. It \nshould not be turn an apathetic shoulder from meeting such standards \nsimply because State and local regulations do not apply to them.\n  In 1987, Congress passed the Trible Amendment which permitted \nexecutive, legislative, and judicial branch agencies to utilize a \nportion of federally-owned or leased space for the provision of child \ncare services for Federal employees. The General Services \nAdministration [GSA] was given the authority to provide guidance, \nassistance, and oversight to Federal agencies for the development of \nchildren centers. In the decade since the Trible Amendment was passed, \nhundreds of Federal facilities throughout the Nation have established \nonsite child care centers which are a tremendous help to our employees.\n  The General Services Administration has done an excellent job of \nhelping agencies develop child care centers and have adopted strong \nstandards for those centers located in GSA leased or owned space. \nHowever, there are over 100 child care centers located in Federal \nfacilities that are not subject to the GSA standards or any other laws, \nrules, or regulations to ensure that the facilities are safe places for \nour children. Most parents, placing their children in a Federal child \ncare center, assume that some standards are in place--assume that the \ncenters must minimally meet State and local child care licensing rules \nand regulations. They assume that the centers are subject to \nindependent oversight and monitoring to continually ensure the safety \nof the premises.\n\n  Yet, that is not the case. In a case where a Federal employee had \nstrong reason to suspect the sexual abuse of her child by an employee \nof a child care center located in a Federal facility, local child \nprotective services and law enforcement personnel were denied access to \nthe premises and were prohibited from investigating the incident. \nAnother employee's child was repeatedly injured because the child care \nproviders under contract with a Federal agency to provide onsite child \ncare services failed to ensure that age-appropriate health and safety \nmeasures were taken--current law says they were not required to do so, \neven after the problems were identified and injuries had occurred.\n  As Congress and the administration turn their spotlight on our \nNation's child care system, we must first get our own house in order. \nWe must safeguard and protect the children receiving services in child \ncare centers housed in Federal facilities. Our employees should not be \ndenied some assurance that the centers in which they place their \nchildren are accountable for meeting basic health and safety standards.\n  The Quality Child Care for Federal Employees Act will require all \nchild care services located in Federal facilities to meet, at the very \nleast, the same level of health and safety standards required of other \nchild care centers in the same geographical area. That sounds like \ncommon sense, but as we all know too well, common sense is not always \nreflected in the law. This bill will make that clear.\n  Further, this legislation demands that Federal child care centers \nbegin working to meet these standards now. Not next year, not in 2 \nyears, but now. Under this bill, after 6 months we will look at the \nFederal child care centers again, and if a center is not meeting \nminimal State and local health and safety regulations at that time, \nthat child care facility will be closed until it does. I can think of \nno stronger incentive to get centers to comply.\n  Now, just as there have often been difficulties with Federal \nfacilities ignoring State and local standards simply because of a \ndivision of power between the Federal and State governments, so, too, \ndo divisions in the Federal Government--what we call the separation of \npowers--help create chaos in enforcement at the Federal level. Who has \noversight of the facilities in the Federal Government, and who is \nresponsible for monitoring and enforcement?\n  Mr. President, this legislation respects the separation of powers \nwithin the Federal Government, but it also makes it very clear where \nthe oversight and responsibility for meeting health and safety \nstandards lies. For the most part, centers located in agencies within \nthe executive branch--within, for example, the Department of Veterans' \nAffairs--will retain responsibility for monitoring and ensuring \ncompliance. For centers within the jurisdiction of the legislative \nbranch, including the Library of Congress, this responsibility will lie \nwith the Architect of the Capitol or his designee. In the judicial \nbranch, monitoring and compliance will fall under the jurisdiction of \nthe Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. The GSA \nwill continue to monitor centers it owns and leases in the judicial and \nexecutive branches. The costs of this monitoring are already included \nin this year's appropriations bills and will not add to the deficit.\n  It should also be made clear that State and local standards should be \na floor for basic health and safety, and not a ceiling. The role of the \nFederal Government--and, I like to think, of the U.S. Congress in \nparticular--is to constantly strive to do better and to lead by \nexample. Federal facilities should always try to meet the highest \npossible standards. In fact, the GSA has required national accredition \nin GSA-owned and leased facilities, and has stated that its centers are \neither in compliance or are strenuously working to get there. This is \nthe kind of tough standard we should strive for in all of our Federal \nchild care facilities.\n  Federal child care should mean something more than simply location on \na Federal facility. The Federal Government has an obligation to provide \nsafe care for its employees, and it has a responsibility for making \nsure that those standards are monitored and enforced. Some Federal \nemployees receive this guarantee. Many do not. We can do better.\n  I urge swift passage of this legislation, and thank my colleagues for \ntheir attention to this matter.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my \nlegislation appear in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1490\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Act and the Federal Food, \nDrug and Cosmetic Act to prevent the use of tobacco products by minors, \nto reduce the level of tobacco addiction, to compensate Federal and \nState Governments for a portion of the health costs of tobacco-related \nillnesses, to enhance the national investment in biomedical and basic \nscientific research, and to expand programs to address the needs of \nchildren, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n                 the healthy and smokefree children act\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, I am joining Senators Lautenberg, \nDurbin, Reed, and Kerry to introduce the Healthy and Smokefree Children \nAct, which is a comprehensive tobacco control initiative. Congress has \nan historic opportunity in the next session to protect current and \nfuture generations from nicotine addiction and early death caused by \ntobacco.\n  We know the enormous adverse health consequences of youth smoking. \nEach day, three thousand children begin smoking. A thousand of them \nwill die prematurely from tobacco-induced illnesses. Ninety percent of \ncurrent adult smokers began to smoke before they reached the age of 18.\n  Our primary goal is to reduce youth smoking and help children. Our \nlegislation will raise the price of cigarettes by $1.50 a pack over \nthree years. A substantial portion of the revenues raised by the \nincrease will be used to fund major new initiatives in biomedical \nresearch, child health, and child development.\n  The legislation will affirm the authority of the Food and Drug \nAdministration to regulate tobacco products. It also provides for \nstrongly worded warning labels on packs of cigarettes, for a large-\nscale anti-tobacco advertising campaign, new restrictions on youth \naccess to tobacco products, new protections against secondhand smoke, \nand transitional assistance to farmers.\n  Public health experts tell us that the most effective way to reduce \nyouth smoking is by a significant increase in the price of cigarettes. \nTeenagers have less money to spend on tobacco products than adults, and \nthose who are not yet addicted will be less likely to spend their \ndollars on smoking. In fact, price increases are three times more \nlikely to deter youth from smoking than adults.\n  The 65 cent increase in the Attorneys' General settlement is not \nenough to do the job. If the national goal is to dramatically reduce \nteenage smoking,\n\n[[Page S12164]]\n\na price increase of at least $1.50 a pack will be needed. Even with a \nprice increase of that magnitude, cigarettes in America will still cost \nless than the current price in many European countries.\n  It would be irresponsible to wait another decade while we test the \nimpact of lesser measures on youth smoking. Too many children are \nbecoming addicted to tobacco each day. The most effective way to reduce \nyouth smoking is a substantial price increase, and we should do it now.\n  The $1.50 increase will enable us to provide approximately $20 \nbillion per year to be divided equally between medical research and \nchild development investments. Under our proposal, half of these \nadditional funds will be used for an unprecedented expansion of \nbiomedial research to solve the scientific mysteries of the most severe \ndiseases and medical conditions. We stand on the threshold of \nextraordinary medical breakthroughts against cancer, heart disease, \nAlzheimer's Disease, AIDS, diabetes, mental illness, and many other \nconditions. The benefits of greater research will save millions of \nlives and improve the quality of life for countless more.\n  The other half of the new funds will be directed to child health and \nchild development. The brain research conducted in recent years has \ndemonstrated the critical importance of the first three years of life \nto a child's learning potential. Additional resources will enable us to \nbuild on that foundation of knowledge, and implement it in ways that \nwill enrich the lives of the next generation of children. By expanding \nHead Start to reach the large number of eligible pre-school children \nwho are not now being served, and by improving the quality and \navailability of child care for working families, we can give far more \nchildren a better foundation on which to build their lives.\n  In addition, under our proposal, the key public health provisions in \nthe Attorneys General agreement will be implemented, and smokers \nseeking to stop will be able to obtain help in overcoming their \naddiction. States will receive compensation from the tobacco industry \nfor their Medicaid costs attributable to smoking, and will not have to \nreimburse the federal government for the federal share of the Medicaid \ncosts recovered. These funds will be available to the states to address \nthe unmet needs of children.\n  A strong FDA with broad authority to regulate tobacco is also \nessential. Our legislation affirms FDA's finding that nicotine is an \naddictive drug and that cigarettes are a drug delivery device. The \nscope of regulation will include manufacturing, marketing, advertising, \nand distributing tobacco products. The FDA will be freed from the \nnumerous procedural roadblocks which the tobacco industry has placed in \nits path.\n  This legislation will substantially reduce smoking in America, \nenhance medical research, and help millions of children reach their \nfull potential. Congress has a unique opportunity. We own it to \nAmerica's children and America's future to act now.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1492\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that, in order to provide \n     funds to carry out this Act, Congress should enact an \n     increase in the excise taxes on tobacco products of \n     approximately $1.50 per pack of cigarettes (and corresponding \n     increases on taxes on other tobacco products) over a 3-year \n     period, that increases in such tax in future years should be \n     indexed to inflation, and that the payment of such tax should \n     not be considered to be an ordinary and necessary expense in \n     carrying on a trade or business and should not be deductible.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am joining Senators Kennedy \nand Durbin in introducing the Healthy and Smoke-free Children Act of \n1997. Likewise, Senators Kennedy and Durbin are cosponsoring \nlegislation I introduced last week, the Public Health and Education \nResource Act, S. 1343, or PHAER. As we join forces behind comprehensive \ntobacco legislation to reduce smoking, especially among our young \npeople, and to enhance the public health, we urge Senators of both\n\n[[Page S12179]]\n\nparties to unify behind our approach. It is a simple and \nstraightforward but effective model for drastically reducing the \n400,000 preventable deaths each year in our country caused by a deadly \naddiction to nicotine.\n  Mr. President, it's time for Congress to act. We have the legislative \npackages to get started. The message we are sending out today is clear: \nthe goal of comprehensive tobacco legislation is to prevent kids from \nbecoming hooked on tobacco--not to get the tobacco companies off the \nhook.\n  Our legislation would raise the price of cigarettes by $1.50 per pack \nin order to reduce teen smoking and fund critical public health \nprograms. It explicitly prohibits the industry from deducting the cost \nof increased excise taxes from its corporate tax payments. With the \nproceeds of the tax, states will receive back funds for public health \nand children's programs, including health, education, and smoking \ncessation programs aimed at both children, teenagers, and adults. \nFurther, our bill will fund a significant increase in medical research. \nTo increase industry incentives to reduce teen smoking, the legislation \nwe are introducing today will impose penalties on companies which fail \nto meet teen smoking reduction targets. Finally, recognizing the \npotential dislocation to tobacco farmers that could flow from a \nreduction in national smoking rates, our bill provides transitional \nassistance to farmers and displaced tobacco workers.\n  Mr. President, of critical importance, our legislation affirms the \nauthority of the Food and Drug Administration to regulate tobacco as a \ndrug and drug delivery device. It gives FDA explicit authority over the \nadvertising, marketing and sale of cigarettes. It also calls for larger \nand more explicit warning labels on cigarettes and ingredient \ndisclosure, drawing on legislation I introduced earlier this year, and \npermits states to enact more restrictions on tobacco. It also \nincorporates the essence of the Smokefree Environment Act which I also \nintroduced earlier this year, to protect non-smokers from secondhand \nsmoke.\n  The President has called for comprehensive tobacco legislation that \ngives the Food and Drug Administration authority to regulate nicotine. \nHe has also called for a $1.50 increase in the price of cigarettes to \ndeter teen smoking and help pay for a variety of public health \nprograms. Our legislation accomplishes that.\n  Mr. President, the tobacco industry has been trying to convince the \nCongress and the public that the only way to accomplish the President's \ngoals is through its proposed settlement with the state Attorneys \nGeneral. We know that this is not the case. Our legislation offers a \nmore efficient and effective way of serving the public health. The \nCongress can move ahead without permission from the tobacco industry \nand we should do just that.\n  Mr. President, our proposals embody the goals outlined by the \nPresident and embraced by the public health community. In fact, a broad \nrange of groups supported the introduction of S. 1343, the PHAER Act, \nwhen I introduced it. These groups include Action on Smoking and \nHealth, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Cancer \nSociety, the American College of Physicians, the American College of \nPreventive Medicine, the American Heart Association, the American Lung \nAssociation, the American Medical Association, the American Society of \nClinical Oncology, Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, the National \nAssociation of Counties, the National Association of County and City \nHealth Officials, and Partnership for Prevention and Physicians for \nSocial Responsibility.\n  Mr. President, these bills eliminate the tobacco industry as the \nmiddleman in achieving public health goals. We have laid out an \nambitious, but achievable, program for reducing smoking and death and \nillness. Congressional action on comprehensive tobacco legislation \nshould live up to the standards we have established.\n  Beyond taking strong, preventive steps to reduce smoking \ndomestically, we should also pursue legislation affecting our tobacco \ncompanies' commercial activities overseas. If we don't, in the next few \ndecades we will experience a worldwide health epidemic attributable to \ntobacco. Earlier this year, I introduced S. 1060, the Worldwide Tobacco \nDisclosure Act, to require warning labels on exported packages of \ncigarettes and to codify current trade policies that prevent government \nagencies from promoting tobacco sales overseas and from weakening \npublic health measures undertaken by foreign governments.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us on the \npublic health side of this fight by endorsing our comprehensive tobacco \nlegislation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Kennedy and \nLautenberg in proposing sweeping new legislation that fills in many of \nthe specifics relating to children and the public health that must be \nincluded in any future legislation related to the proposed tobacco \nsettlement.\n  The tobacco companies have made billions of dollars addicting and \nexploiting our children. Now, they seek to protect themselves from \nexisting and potential lawsuits. This legislation brings us back to the \nfundamental issues that must stay at the top of the public health \nagenda. Reducing the devastation and disease caused by tobacco should \nbe our number one goal, not an afterthought.\n  This legislation is our effort to start filling in the blanks on any \ntobacco measure. It's time to stop speculating and start laying down \nmarkers we feel must be part of any comprehensive agreement.\n  Under this legislation, the tobacco tax would be raised $1.50 per \npack of cigarettes. This kind of increase is a proven deterrent to \nunderage smoking.\n  Of the additional revenues that would be raised beyond what was \nproposed by the state attorneys general, one-half would be used to fund \nmedical research into illnesses such as cancer, heart disease and \ndiabetes. The other half of the additional revenues would fund an \nexpansion of the Head Start program, child care grants, and other child \nand family initiatives.\n  The legislation seeks to ensure a significant decline in underage \nsmoking by establishing tough performance smoking reduction targets. \nThe reduction targets--modeled on legislation I introduced earlier this \nyear--set a goal of a 40 percent reduction in youth tobacco use in four \nyears, 60 percent in 6 years, and 80 percent in 10 years. If the goal \nis not met, penalties of up to $1 a pack will be imposed on the sale of \ntobacco products manufactured by a company whose products are consumed \nby underage users, with steeper penalties for repeated failure to meet \nyouth tobacco targets.\n  In addition, we are offering some new incentives for the tobacco \ncompanies to meet the targets. If a company fails to comply for three \nor more consecutive years, the company will be required to stop selling \ncigarettes in single packs--the size kids buy--and start selling them \nonly in cartons, whose price might cause kids to reconsider their \ndesire to buy cigarettes. If this step was not sufficient to bring a \ncompany into compliance, another year violating the performance \nstandard would trigger a requirement that the product be sold using \ngeneric packaging, without catchy logos.\n  As far as kids are concerned, it's time for the tobacco companies to \nput their profits on the line. Under our legislation, every new child \nwho picks up a cigarette or pockets a can of spit tobacco will become \nan economic loss to a tobacco company. We must hold each company \nindividually responsible for its sales to minors.\n  In addition to setting performance standards, the legislation \nprovides for a national tobacco use reduction program which includes \nsmoking cessation programs, media-based advertising about the dangers \nof tobacco use and aggressive public education.\n  The bill also compensates states for Medicaid expenditures resulting \nfrom tobacco-related illnesses; affirms the authority of the Food and \nDrug Administration [FDA] to regulate tobacco as a drug and delivery \ndevice; mandates strong warning labels and ingredient disclosures; \nreduces exposure to secondhand smoke; prohibits tobacco companies from \ndeducting any settlement liabilities as a business expense; and \nprovides assistance for tobacco farmers.\n  I commend this legislation to my colleagues and urge them to support \nit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12144-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12179-S12180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 61\n\n  At the request of Mr. Lott, the name of the Senator from Michigan \n[Mr.\n\n[[Page S12180]]\n\nAbraham] was added as a cosponsor of S. 61, a bill to amend title 46, \nUnited States Code, to extend eligibility for veterans' burial \nbenefits, funeral benefits, and related benefits for veterans of \ncertain service in the United States merchant marine during World War \nII.\n\n\n                                 S. 318\n\n  At the request of Mr. D'Amato, the name of the Senator from Rhode \nIsland [Mr. Chafee] was added as a cosponsor of S. 318, a bill to amend \nthe Truth in Lending Act to require automatic cancellation and notice \nof cancellation rights with respect to private mortgage insurance which \nis required by a creditor as a condition for entering into a \nresidential mortgage transaction, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 773\n\n  At the request of Mr. Durbin, the name of the Senator from New Jersey \n[Mr. Lautenberg] was added as a cosponsor of S. 773, a bill to \ndesignate certain Federal lands in the State of Utah as wilderness, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n\n                                 S. 778\n\n  At the request of Mr. Abraham, his name was added as a cosponsor of \nS. 778, a bill to authorize a new trade and investment policy for sub-\nSaharan Africa.\n\n\n                                S. 1151\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dodd, the name of the Senator from Louisiana \n[Ms. Landrieu] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1151, a bill to amend \nsubpart 8 of part A of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to \nsupport the participation of low-income parents in postsecondary \neducation through the provision of campus-based child care.\n\n\n                                S. 1195\n\n  At the request of Mr. Chafee, the name of the Senator from South \nDakota [Mr. Johnson] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1195, a bill to \npromote the adoption of children in foster care, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1307\n\n  At the request of Mr. Daschle, the name of the Senator from North \nDakota [Mr. Dorgan] was added as a cosponsor of S. 1307, a bill to \namend the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 with respect \nto rules governing litigation contesting termination or reduction of \nretiree health benefits and to extend continuation coverage to retirees \nand their dependents.\n\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Resolution 49\n\n  At the request of Mr. Abraham, his name was added as a cosponsor of \nSenate Concurrent Resolution 49, a concurrent resolution authorizing \nuse of the Capitol Grounds for ``America Recycles Day'' national kick-\noff campaign.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12179-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 66--TO CORRECT THE ENROLLMENT OF S. 399\n\n  Mr. McCAIN submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

the current estimate of the hispanic population \n     in the United States is 26,000,000, with projections of \n     30,000,000 by the year 2000, 40,000,000 by 2010, and almost \n     60,000,000 (or 20 percent of the total United States \n     population) by the year 2030;\n       Whereas the number of Hispanic immigrants to the United \n     States has increased from 1,500,000 in the 1960's, to \n     2,400,000 in the 1970's, to 4,500,000 in the 1980's, and the \n     number of Hispanic immigrants is expected to continue to \n     rise;\n       Whereas two-thirds of all Hispanics in the United States \n     today are of Mexican origin, and 70 percent of United States \n     Hispanics live in 4 States: California, Texas, New York, and \n     Florida;\n       Whereas New Mexico's Hispanic population is 39 percent (or \n     over 660,000 of the 1995 total State population of 1,700,000) \n     and represents the highest percentage of Hispanics in any \n     State in the United States;\n       Whereas the United States has an enriched legacy of \n     Hispanic influence in politics, government, business, and \n     culture due to the early settlements and continuous influx of \n     Hispanics into the United States;\n       Whereas the New Mexico State Government has funded a \n     Hispanic Cultural Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with \n     assistance from the Federal Government, local governments, \n     and private contributions, to celebrate and preserve Hispanic \n     culture including literature, performing arts, visual arts, \n     music, culinary arts, and language arts;\n       Whereas the Archbishop of Santa Fe, Michael Sheehan, is \n     planning events throughout 1998 in New Mexico, including the \n     opening of ``Jubilee year'', an encuentro at Santo Domingo \n     Pueblo to mark the meeting of the missionaries with the \n     Pueblo peoples, an\n\n[[Page S12181]]\n\n     Archdiocesan reconciliation service at the Santuario de \n     Chimayo, and an Archdiocesan celebration of St. Francis of \n     Assisi in Santa Fe;\n       Whereas in order to commemorate Don Juan de Onate's \n     arrival, the city of Espanola will have a fiesta in July \n     1998, the city of Santa Fe is planning several special \n     events, and the New Mexico statewide committee is planning a \n     parade, a historical costume ball, and a pageant in \n     Albuquerque;

and\n       (B) calling on the people of the United States and \n     interested groups to observe the year with appropriate \n     ceremonies, activities, and programs to honor and celebrate \n     the contributions of Hispanic people to the cultural and \n     economic life of the United States; and\n       (6) calls upon the people of the United States to support, \n     promote, and participate in the many Onate Cuartocentenario \n     activities being planned to commemorate the historic event of \n     the early settling of the Southwest Region of the United \n     States by the Spanish.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, next year, 1998, is the 400th \nanniversary of Don Juan de Onate's establishment of the first Hispanic \ncolony in New Mexico. In July 1589, he and a few Spanish families \nsettled near modern day San Juan Pueblo and the city of Espanola in \nnorthern New Mexico.\n  New Mexico will be the center of many exciting events throughout the \nyear to commemorate this extremely important historic milestone. Four \nhundred years ago Western civilization found itself ensconced in \nnorthern New Mexico, and since that time to the present it has been \nthere and part of the culture and part of the value system in the State \nof New Mexico.\n  New Mexico will be the center of many exciting events throughout the \nyear to commemorate this important historic milestone. New Mexicans are \nlooking forward to fiestas, balls, parades, and other stimulating \nevents to mark this historic occasion.\n  The Archbishop of Santa Fe will be opening a Jubilee year in January. \nAmong other events, he will hold an encuentro at Santo Domingo Pueblo \nto mark the meeting of the missionaries with the Pueblo Peoples.\n  The city of Espanola will have a fiesta in July to commemorate the \nactual arrival of the Spanish into the area. Santa Fe, Las Vegas, Taos, \nAlbuquerque, and other New Mexico towns and cities will be holding such \nspecial events as fiestas, historic reenactments, a State Fair Pageant, \nan historic Spanish costume ball, and parades. Seminars and lectures \nwill abound.\n  State Fair pageant plans include a reenactment of De Vargas' reentry \ninto New Mexico, a review of the Pueblo Revolt and its ramifications, \nlife under the American flag during the middle to late 1800's, and a \npatriotic tribute to all Hispanics who have fought for the United \nStates. This two and a half-hour spectacular will be performed twice \nbefore a large audience. It will also be televised.\n  This resolution also asks the President to issue a proclamation \ndeclaring 1998 is a year to commemorate the arrival of Hispanics and \ncelebrate their growth in importance in our Nation's culture and \neconomy. An estimated 26 million Hispanics in the United States today \nmake up about 11 percent of our population. In New Mexico, Hispanics \nmake up 39 percent of the population, the largest percentage of any \nState.\n  Some projections indicate that by the year 2010, Hispanics will \nnumber about 40 million, and by the year 2030, an estimated 60 million \nHispanics will be living in the United States, making up about one-\nfifth of the total population.\n  As Hispanic culture continues to grow as a major influence in the \nUnited States, the State of New Mexico is creating a major Hispanic \nCultural Center in Albuquerque to celebrate and preserve Hispanic arts, \nliterature, performing arts, music, visual arts, culinary arts and \nother cultural treasures. We are hoping that this Hispanic Cultural \nCenter will become a successful economic venture to attract tourism and \nto bring national and international attention to Hispanic life in the \nAmerican Southwest.\n  The Cuartocentenario, know in English as the 400th Anniversary, is a \ntime for America to take note of the profound influence of Hispanics in \nthe founding of America as a New World as well as the participation of \nHispanics in all walks of life. Hispanics have been noteworthy \ncontributors and will continue to be significant contributors to our \nnational politics, science, arts, economy, and cultural life.\n  Mr. President, 1998 is a major milestone for the Spanish settlement \nin the Southwestern United States. I urge my colleagues to join me in \ncommemorating this important anniversary by supporting this resolution \nand participating in Hispanic events to mark this important year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12180-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12181-S12183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 149--REGARDING THE STATE VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES \n           OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Smith of \nOregon, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Grams, Mr. Robb, and Mr. Roth) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 149\n\n       Whereas, the ability of the United States and the People's \n     Republic of China to avoid conflict, to cooperate, and to act \n     as partners rather than adversaries has a substantial bearing \n     on peace and stability in Asia and worldwide;\n       Whereas on October 28-30, 1997, President Jiang Zemin of \n     the People's Republic of China conducted a state visit to \n     Washington, DC;\n       Whereas the state visit included meetings with President \n     Bill Clinton, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, and the \n     Congressional leadership;\n       Whereas, in connection with the state visit, china gave \n     clear assurances that it will conduct no new nuclear \n     cooperation with Iran, reiterated its commitment not to \n     assist unsafeguarded nuclear facilities, joined the Zangger \n     Committee, and promulgated national regulations to control \n     exports of nuclear material, equipment and technology;\n       Whereas, President Clinton announced his intention to \n     certify that China has met the conditions necessary to \n     implement the 1985 Agreement for Cooperation Between the \n     Government of the United States and the Government of the \n     People's Republic of China Concerning the Peaceful Uses of \n     Nuclear Energy;\n       Whereas China agreed to allow a delegation of American \n     religious leaders to conduct a fact-finding mission on \n     religious freedom in China, to resume a project of accounting \n     for prisoners, and to conduct preparatory talks on \n     establishing a Non-Governmental Organization forum on human \n     rights;\n       Whereas the United States and China agreed to conduct \n     regular summit, cabinet-level, and sub-cabinet level meetings \n     in their respective capitals, and agreed to the establishment \n     of a direct telephone link between the two Presidents;\n       Whereas the United States and China agreed to increase \n     contacts between their respective militaries in order to \n     avoid incidents at sea between their naval forces, and to \n     coordinate their responses to humanitarian crises;\n       Whereas the United States and China agreed to increase \n     cooperation aimed at promoting the rule of law in China, \n     including training judges and lawyers, drafting legal codes, \n     and developing due process of law;\n       Whereas the United States and China agreed to expand their \n     cooperation in law enforcement efforts, including by \n     stationing officers of the United States Drug Enforcement \n     Administration in the United States Embassy in Beijing;\n       Whereas the United States and China have agreed to \n     cooperate on developing clean energy projects in China \n     through the use of United States products and technology;\n       Whereas despite some significant achievements reached \n     during the state visit of President Hiang Zemin, many \n     significant concerns and problems remain in the U.S.-China \n     relationship;\n       Whereas the United States continues to have serious \n     concerns about the human\n\n[[Page S12182]]\n\n     rights policies and practices of the People's Republic of \n     China, including the imprisonment of Wei Jingsheng, Wang Dan, \n     and other dissidents, limitations on the free practice of \n     religion, harsh population control measures (including \n     isolated reports of forced abortion), the use of prison labor \n     to produce cheap consumer goods, the continuing suppresson of \n     the people of Tibet, and the refusal of China's leadership to \n     meet with the Dalai Lama;\n       Whereas the United States continues to have deep concerns \n     about reports of exports from China of nuclear, chemical, and \n     ballistic missile technology, and advanced conventional \n     weapons, to countries who are known proliferators, such as \n     Iran and Pakistan;\n       Whereas the United States continues to seek from the \n     People's Republic of China measures to reduce the growing \n     trade imbalance between the United States and China, \n     including access to China's markets for United States \n     products and services;\n       Whereas the United States believes it is imperative that \n     the People's Republic of China commit to resolving the Taiwan \n     question by exclusively peaceful means, and that both sides \n     should resume a Cross-Straits dialogue as soon as possible;\n       Whereas the recently concluded U.S.-China summit is part of \n     President Clinton's articulated policy of engagement with the \n     People's Republic of China, a central goal of which is to \n     further draw the People's Republic of China into the \n     international community and toward internationally recognized \n     standards of behavior; and\n       Whereas President Clinton accepted President Jiang's \n     invitation to make a return visit to the People's Republic of \n     China in 1998: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) welcomes the agreements and understanding reached by \n     the United States and the People's Republic of China during \n     the state visit of President Jiang Zemin;\n       (2) urges the President to continue to press vigorously for \n     further progress in China's policies and practices in the \n     areas of human rights, nonproliferation, trade, Tibet, and \n     Taiwan;\n       (3) views the expected return visit to the People's \n     Republic of China in 1998 by President Clinton as an \n     opportunity for the United States and the People's Republic \n     of China to advance their relationship by enhancing \n     cooperation in areas of accord and making genuine progress \n     toward resolving areas of disagreement.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, today I am joined by a bipartisan \ngroup of my colleagues in submitting a resolution that expresses \nsupport for the agreements reached at the recent summit between \nPresident Clinton and President Jiang Zemin of the People's Republic of \nChina.\n  As the resolution makes clear, the United States and China did not \ncome to agreement on every issue that divides us during the summit. \nSignificant, even fundamental differences remain in some areas, \nparticularly in the area of human rights. But there is no question that \nthe summit was a positive step forward in building a cooperative \npartnership between the largest developed country and the largest \ndeveloping country on earth.\n  The summit has, of course, occasioned a vigorous debate on the United \nStates' policy toward China. It seems to me that the key to a \nsuccessful China policy is to be able to encourage this large nation to \ntake its place in the world as a stable, responsible leader that can \nhelp ensure peace and stability in Asia and the world.\n  The question is how to do this? Our choices seem to boil down to two:\n  Some say we should contain China, prevent its rise, and isolate it \nfrom the world community. We should recognize it as an adversary.\n  Others--myself and the cosponsors of this resolution included--say we \nshould engage China, understand that our relationship is complex, \ndevelop a strategic partnership where we have like interests, and \nthrough intensive communication try to achieve common ground.\n  Last week's summit was, in my view, the beginning of a course of \nongoing top level dialogue and diplomacy.\n  It showed that we must deal with China on the top levels. Prior to \nlast week, our two presidents had had little communication. There was \nno red telephone, no way for the leaders to speak. Our dialogue was \nsporadic, and took place on second and third levels.\n  Was the summit a success? Yes. It was definitely more that just a \nseries of photo-ops. It accomplished progress and concrete results \nwhich bear explicit restatement.\n  First, the summit established the ability of two country's leaders to \ntalk with each other. They have resolved to engage in ongoing \ncommunication, conduct regular summit meetings--indeed, President \nClinton will go to China next year--and the establishment of a \ntelephone hotline.\n  This high-level communication is important, because Beijing does not \nalways know what all its ministries are doing. Our intelligence can \nhelp bring it to their attention, as was the case when Chinese \ncompanies shipped ring magnets to Pakistan. U.S. intelligence also \nhelped China shut down a number of illegal CD factories.\n  Second, the summit produced a very important nuclear non-\nproliferation agreement. China committed that it would engage in no new \nexport of nuclear technology, expertise, or equipment to Iran. This is \nin addition to China having already signed the N.P.T., the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty, the CWC, and its commitment to abide by \nthe Missile Technology Control Regime and its annexes. China also \nagreed to participate in multi-lateral efforts to control and monitor \nthe export of nuclear materials. In exchange we have agreed to allow \nthe export of peaceful nuclear energy technology to China.\n  Third, the summit led to several extremely useful military-to-\nmilitary agreements. Two two sides agreed to expand military-to-\nmilitary exchanges, including at the Secretary of Defense level, and to \nestablish communications links to avoid accidental incidents at sea \nbetween the our navies.\n  Fourth, the summit produced agreements aimed at increasing U.S.-China \ncooperation on law enforcement. China agreed to the stationing of two \nDEA agents at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, and we will expand our \ncooperation in combating organized crime, counterfeiting, alien \nsmuggling, and money laundering.\n  Fifth, the two sides reached agreements aimed at improving China's \nenergy usage and decreasing its pollution problem. The United States \nand China will engage in a cooperative effort--using U.S. technology to \nwork on China's serious urban air pollution problem, and to provide \nelectricity to rural villages.\n  Sixth, in perhaps the most important contribution we can make to the \ncause of human rights in China, the two sides agreed on a number of \nmeasures aimed at promoting the rule of law in China. The United States \nand China will engage in a joint effort in developing the rule of law \nin China. It will involve the training of judges and lawyers, exchanges \nof legal experts, and assistance to China in drafting new criminal, \ncivil, and commercial codes.\n  Seventh, even in the area of human rights, there were some modest \ngains. I emphasize ``modest'' because we still have fundamental \ndifferences with the Chinese on human rights. What we see as issues of \nbasic human freedom and dignity, the regard as their ``internal \naffairs,'' with deep implications for China's stability and unity.\n  America's position was clearly put forward--by the President, by \nMembers of Congress, and by the many demonstrations that followed \nPresident Jiang around. I believe Chinese leaders may now have an \nunderstanding of the depth of feeling about human rights issues in the \nUnited States in a way they could not have known before the visit.\n  Nevertheless, there was some limited progress. China agreed to \nreceive a group of religious leaders from the U.S. to conduct fact-\nfinding on religious freedom. China also agreed to resume a prisoner \naccounting project run by a businessman and human rights activist, John \nKamm. In addition, China agreed to the establishment of a non-\ngovernmental organization human rights forum. Preparatory sessions will \nbe held soon. And just prior to the summit, China signed the U.N. \nCovenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, which obligates \nparties to promote these rights in their countries.\n  Clearly, there were also major disappointments on human rights. There \nwas no release of dissidents, and no comment that indicated any new \nthinking on Tiananmen Square. On Tibet, China clings to old and \ndiscredited arguments and has been non-committal on all overtures for \ntalks with the Dalai Lama, and the repression in Tibet continues.\n  But even with the disappointments, things are changing in China. No \nlarge country has changed as much as China has in the last 30 years \nsince the end of cultural revolution. Today there is a freer lifestyle, \nan improved standard of\n\n[[Page S12183]]\n\nliving, and much greater educational opportunities. There is a greater \nopenness, and tremendous economic development. There is also a gradual \nlowering of tariffs and opening of borders.\n  Our relationship with China is not without its strains. Taiwan, for \nexample remains the number one issue of sensitivity for China. The \nChinese view it as a fundamental issue of sovereignty. I think the \nAdministration understands this, and is firmly committed to the One \nChina policy.\n  But otherwise, all issues remain negotiable and subject to the \nenterprise of diplomacy conducted at the highest levels. In this \nregard, the summit was definitely a step forward. For that reason, my \ncolleagues and I submit this resolution to recognize the achievements \nof the summit, and to express our support for President Clinton's \nintention to make a return visit to China next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12181-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12183]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               THE RECIPROCAL TRADE AGREEMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        REED AMENDMENT NO. 1613\n\n  Mr. REED proposed an amendment to the bill (S. 1269) to establish \nobjectives for negotiating and procedures for implementing certain \ntrade agreements; as follows:\n\n       Amend section 2(b) after section 2(b)(15) to add the \n     following new paragraph:\n       (16) The principal negotiating objective of the United \n     States regarding the environment is to promote adherence to \n     internationally recognized environmental standards.\n       Amend section 10 at the end, to add the following new \n     definition:\n       (7) Internationally Recognized Environmental Standards--The \n     term ``internationally recognized environmental standards'' \n     includes--\n       (A) mitigation of global climate change;\n       (B) reduction in the consumption and production of ozone-\n     depleting substances;\n       (C) reduction in ship pollution of the oceans from such \n     sources as oil, noxious bulk liquids, hazardous freight, \n     sewage, and garbage;\n       (D) a ban on international ocean dumping of high-level \n     radioactive waste, chemical warfare agents, and hazardous \n     substances;\n       (E) government control of the transboundary movement of \n     hazardous waste materials and their disposal for the purpose \n     of reducing global pollution on account of such materials;\n       (F) preservation of endangered species;\n       (G) conservation of biological diversity;\n       (H) promotion of biodiversity; and\n       (I) preparation of oil-spill contingency plans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12183-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12183-S12188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE ADOPTION PROMOTION ACT OF 1997\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        CRAIG AMENDMENT NO. 1614\n\n  Mr. CRAIG proposed an amendment to the bill (H.R. 867) to promote the \nadoption of children in foster care; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, on Thursday, in the Wall Street \nJournal, two articles appeared highlighting additional facets of the \nyear 2000 [Y2K] problem. While the computer and business industries \nhave been the primary focus of news articles in the past, these reports \nfocused on the legal and accounting fields. And today, in an editorial \nin the New York Post, the editors warn that ``attorneys hope to make a \nkilling off the so called Year 2000 problem.''\n  In the Journal article entitled ``Threat of Computer Glitch in 2000 \nHas Lawyers Seeing Dollar Signs,'' the authors report that ``corporate \nlawyers are urging clients to review their information systems and \nwrite warranties into their contracts.'' The possibility of future \nlitigation has caused New York law firms, such as Skadden, Arps, Slate, \nMeagher, Flom, to establish special groups of attorneys to ensure that \nall contracts contain Y2K warranties.\n  The other article, ``CPA Group to Issue Guidelines on Costs of Year \n2000 Bug,'' reports that the American Institute of Certified Public \nAccountants will advise ``auditors on how to push corporations to \ndisclose and account'' for Y2K costs. Further, many companies have yet \nto begin the process of changing their systems to alleviate the \nproblem, and are unaware of the enormous costs that lie ahead. This \ncould well lead to misstatement of profits or loses of 10 percent or \nmore. Lastly, in their no-holds-barred manner, the Post editors write: \n``this [problem] could make the litigation over breast implants and \nasbestos look like chump-change wrangling.'' My dutiful peer, Senator \nBennett of Utah, has been looking into these matters, as Chair of the \nBanking Subcommittee on Financial Services and Technology. And for that \nwe are most grateful. Yet his voice, like that of Congressman Stephen \nHorn, is being lost among the din over many less pressing issues.\n  Mr President, we are beginning to see the ripple-like effects of this \nmost serious issue. The overall costs have been estimated as high as a \nhalf a trillion dollars, and that widespread failure to comply could \nlead to a global recession, in the opinion of New York Federal Reserve \nBank President William J. McDonough.\n  Above all, from our standpoint, we have an obligation to get our own \nhouse in order. The lagging response of the U.S. Government to this \nproblem, a relative benchmark, as the United States is ahead of most \ncountries, is without excuse. With just under 800 days left, we cannot \nhave half of our agencies still assessing how many mission critical \nsystems will be affected. This is but the first phase of three--\nrenovation and testing/implementation are the other two. We need an \noutside body to ensure this problem is fixed. My bill, S. 22, will do \njust that.\n  I ask that the articles from the Wall Street Journal and the \neditorial from the New York Post be printed in the Record.\n  The articles follow:\n\n                 [From the New York Post, Nov. 8, 1997]\n\n                  The Millennium Bug--and The Lawyers\n\n       Plaintiff's lawyers plan to celebrate the millennium in a \n     big, and profitable, way--with the mother of all class-action \n     suits. And experts say this could make the litigation over \n     breast implants and asbestos look like chump-change \n     wrangling.\n       The attorneys hope to make a killing off the so-called Year \n     2000 Problem: Many computer systems, especially older \n     mainframes, recognize only the last two digits of a year, so \n     when the century ends and the calendar flips over to double \n     zeros, the computers will crash or, even worse, produce crazy \n     outputs.\n       This is a serious--and hugely expensive--worldwide problem, \n     affecting almost every industry and governmental operation, \n     from payrolls to nuclear-missile safeguards. Computer \n     consultants estimate the worldwide cost of fixing the \n     ``millennium bug'' at as much as $600 billion.\n       The reality of a Year 2000 crisis has been creeping up \n     gradually on most firms in recent years. But now that it's \n     been widely recognized, the race is on for a solution: \n     Massive computer failure isn't in anyone's interests.\n       Inevitably, of course, some firms will fall behind the \n     pack.\n       Just as inevitably, the trial lawyers are licking their \n     chops.\n       While computer consultants hunt through billions of lines \n     of code looking for YR2000 liabilities, a conference of \n     lawyers in San Francisco this week devoted itself to scoping \n     out possible litigation targets, the Wall Street Journal \n     reports.\n       We're not surprised to find the tort bar gearing up. What's \n     even more disturbing is that the government is sitting on its \n     hands. Some federal agencies don't even know the extent of \n     their YR2000 problem.\n       Congress issued a report card in September rating various \n     agencies' efforts to avoid millennial meltdown. Three failed, \n     including two Cabinet departments: Education and \n     Transportation.\n       And that's not the bad news.\n       The Pentagon got a ``C'' and the Energy Department and \n     Nuclear Regulatory Commission got ``Ds.'' It's hard to say \n     what would happen if defense and nuclear-monitoring computers \n     went berserk at the turn of the century--but it wouldn't be \n     anything pretty.\n       Even in New York, the systems that control everything from \n     traffic lights to arrest-monitoring are poised to break down \n     or malfunction unless they are fixed soon.\n       Government officials at all levels admit that it's unlikely \n     all the kinks will be ironed out in time.\n       But the trial lawyers aren't getting excited: Taxpayers \n     have no class-action standing.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 6, 1997]\n\n   Threat of Computer Glitch in 2000 Has Lawyers Seeing Dollar Signs\n\n                         (By Christopher Simon)\n\n       The glitch that threatens to shut down computers in the \n     year 2000 and cause chaos in the business world has plenty of \n     people worried. But not lawyers. They see the millennium bug \n     as a business opportunity.\n       As protection against any 2000 problems, corporate lawyers \n     are urging clients to review their information systems and \n     write warranties into their contracts with software vendors. \n     Plaintiffs' lawyers are exploring potential litigation \n     targets.\n       There are even conferences on the subject. One starting \n     today in San Francisco will feature sessions on the potential \n     liability of the computer industry, consultants, financial \n     institutions, insurance companies and even landlords, as well \n     as the defenses that might be offered. Some lawyers predict \n     year 2000 litigation will dwarf the environmental and absetos \n     class actions of earlier decades.\n       The problem, as everyone knows by now, is that computer \n     codes programmed to read dates only as two digits will be \n     unable to read the year 2000. Unless datesensitive software \n     and hardware are fixed soon, experts say, computers \n     controlling everything from credit-card billing records to \n     inventories will be confused and shut down.\n       To fix the problem, Gartner Group, an information \n     technology consulting concern in Stamford, Conn., estimates \n     that $300 billion to $600 billion will be spent world-wide \n     reworking more than 250 billion lines of computer code.\n       ``Whenever there's this kind of money involved, people \n     always start looking for people to shift the liability to,'' \n     says Stuart D. Levi, of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom \n     in New York. In the spring, the firm established its own Y2K \n     Group (for year 2000) to help clients by writing warranties \n     into their contracts with software vendors and giving them \n     other advice.\n       The New York law firm Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, \n     known for bringing shareholder class actions, has set up an \n     in-house committee of computer experts and lawyers to explore \n     various legal actions if a crisis does occur. Possible \n     targets of litigation, says partner Melvyn Weiss, are \n     corporate directors and officers. Mr. Weiss says management \n     may be responsible for failing to disclose the costs of \n     fixing the problem to shareholders. ``Stockholders could be \n     blind-sided,'' he says.\n       Just last month, in fact, the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission told companies and mutual funds they must keep \n     investors informed about the costs of adapting computer \n     systems to handle the change to the year 2000.\n       Some people dismiss the idea of massive litigation as \n     wishful thinking by lawyers. ``The lawyers who are gleefully \n     rubbing their hands hoping to make millions in litigation are \n     wrong,'' says Harris N. Miller, president of the Information \n     Technology Association of America in Alexandria, Va. Computer \n     companies and their customers both ``have a very strong \n     incentive to solve [the problem] and will do so.''\n       But attorneys say raising the legal issues of a potential \n     crash is part of the solution. Marta A. Manildi of Miller, \n     Canfield, Paddock and Stone in Detroit says her firm has sent \n     letters to hundreds of clients warning them about potential \n     problems with their software, part of a campaign coordinated \n     by the firm's Team 2000. She says advanced\n\n[[Page S12190]]\n\n     planning may allow clients to secure favorable tax treatment \n     for any expenditures they incur in fixing the problem.\n       And at least one suit seeking damages for an alleged \n     inability of a computer to recognize dates after the year \n     2000 has already been filed. Produce Palace International \n     Inc., which operates a grocery store in Warren, Mich., claims \n     in a suit filed in state court in Macomb County, Mich., that \n     cash registers it purchased in 1995 aren't capable of reading \n     credit cards with expiration dates after the year 1999. The \n     suit names TEC America Inc. of Atlanta and All American Cash \n     Register Inc. of Inkster, Mich., as defendants.\n       Mark Yarsike, who owns Produce Palace, says he was dismayed \n     to discover a problem with the high-tech cash registers, \n     which cost $150,000 and are capable of tracking inventory, \n     among other things. The entire network crashes, he says, \n     whenever a customer tries to use a credit card with an \n     expiration date later than 1999. Mr. Yarsike is seeking \n     $10,000 in damages.\n       TEC denies that its system is flawed and has filed a cross-\n     complaint against All American Cash Register, which installed \n     the machines, claiming that any problems were caused during \n     installation and maintenance. A lawyer for All American Cash \n     Register declined to comment.\n       Ms. Manaldi, the attorney for TEC, notes that the lawsuit \n     has received a lot of media attention for being possible the \n     first to make a year 2000 claim and calls the allegations \n     about a millennium bug a stunt to generate publicity. Produce \n     Palace's attorney, Brian P. Parker of Bingham Farms, Mich., \n     defends the action. ``I just wrote the complaint based on \n     what [my client] was telling me,'' he says. ``A lot of \n     lawyers are salivating over this. I'm not into that.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 6. 1997]\n\n        CPA Group to Issue Guidelines on Costs of Year 2000 Bug\n\n                        (By Elizabeth MacDonald)\n\n       The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants will \n     issue guidelines today advising auditors on how to push \n     corporations to disclose and account for year-2000 costs.\n       Computer experts say the year-2000 software bug, by causing \n     systemwide failures when the clock strikes midnight on New \n     Year's Eve in 1999, could cost billions of dollars to fix. At \n     that time, many computers will read ``00'' as 1900 instead of \n     2000 and subsequently process data incorrectly or shut down \n     altogether.\n       The problem is many companies have yet to address the \n     issue, and the accounting industry is getting anxious. The \n     new ``tool kit'' by the accounting industry's largest trade \n     group summariles all of the year-2000 accounting, disclosure \n     and auditing standards now in place and describes companies' \n     and auditors' responsibilities in reporting the associated \n     costs.\n       The guidelines state that auditors must get ``reasonable \n     assurance'' from corporate-audit clients that their financial \n     statements ``are free of material misstatements'' involving \n     likely year-2000 problems and how much it will cost to fix \n     them. ``Material misstatements,'' such as inflated \n     inventories, could prompt companies to overstate or \n     understate profits.\n       Under the guidelines, however, auditors need to get the \n     assurances only for these material misstatements, errors that \n     some accounting experts say could result in losses of about \n     10% or more of a company's pretax profit. ``Auditors could \n     argue that they're not liable for smaller losses resulting \n     from the year-2000 problem because the amounts are not \n     material,'' says J. Edward Ketz, an associate professor of \n     accounting at Pennsylvania State University's Smeal College \n     of Business. ``But if they don't detect a problem that \n     results in losses greater than 10% then they may be held \n     responsible.''\n       Last month, the Securities and Exchange Commission related \n     disclosure guidelines that instruct companies to ``consider'' \n     disclosing their year-2000 costs to investors in their annual \n     reports or to indicate how the year-2000 problem might hurt \n     future profits. The Financial Accounting Standards Board \n     passed an accounting rule, which took effect last year, that \n     lets companies immediately write off these costs.\n       But so far only a few corporations, including New England \n     Power Co. and Equitable of Iowa Cos. have quantified their \n     year-2000 costs and disclosed them in their quarterly \n     reports, according to a study by the Analyst's Accounting \n     Observer, a stock analysts' publication in Baltimore.\n       Auditors are afraid they could be hit with shareholder \n     lawsuits if they don't flag the problem for corporate \n     clients. Such suits could add to the Big Six accounting \n     firms' $30 billion in legal claims stemming from allegedly \n     flawed audits. ``That's why the profession is now publicizing \n     what their responsibilities are, which could protect them \n     against investor lawsuits,'' Prof. Ketz says.\n       Alan Anderson, chairman of AICPA's year-2000 task force, \n     says, ``Clearly, the year-2000 problem is not just an \n     accounting issue but a business issue with global \n     implications.'' Larry Martin, chairman of Data Dimensions \n     Inc., a Bellevue, Wash., computer-consulting firm, says of \n     the problem, ``A third of the companies in this country will \n     either fail or face significant reductions in their business \n     operations.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12189-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DR.

From the widely popular Public \nPrograms, which includes the annual lecture series to the nationally \nrecognized International Visitors Program, the World Affairs Council \nhas been an instrumental force in bringing together varied and diverse \ncultures as well as exposing Washington State to changing political \nenvironments around the globe and the importance of international \ntrade.\n  Booth Gardner was first elected to public office in 1972 where he \nserved 3 years as a State senator followed by election as Pierce County \nExecutive in 1980. In 1984, Booth Gardner realized his boyhood dream \nwith his election to Washington's governorship. A widely popular \nGovernor, Booth was re-elected to a second term in 1988.\n  As Governor of the most trade dependant State in the Nation, Governor \nGardner was exposed on numerous occasions to the importance of \ninternational cooperation and negotiation. Trade missions to Europe and \nAsia allowed Governor Gardner to boost Washington's ties abroad \ncreating new business, cultural, and educational opportunities.\n  After completing his second term, Governor Gardner was appointed by \nthe newly elected President Clinton to become the first U.S. ambassador \nto the World Trade Organization. Assuming the much deserved title of \nAmbassador, Booth Gardner played a major role in shaping this important \norganization and particularly representing U.S. interests. Throughout \nhis service to the WTO, he carefully balanced the needs of the United \nStates with the goals of multilateral cooperation. Ambassador Gardner \nset the standard for U.S. participation at the WTO.\n  Congratulations Ambassador Booth Gardner. Your public service from \nWashington State to capital cities throughout the world makes all of \nWashington very proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12190-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12190-S12191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FEDERAL STATISTICAL ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, yesterday Mr. Moynihan, Mr. \nThompson and Mr. Kerrey joined me in introducing the Federal \nStatistical System\n\n[[Page S12191]]\n\nAct of 1997. This legislation will also be introduced in the House by \nRepresentatives Horn and Maloney. This commonsense piece of legislation \nwill improve the quality of an important function of the Federal \nGovernment while reducing its cost.\n  The current Federal statistical system is in disarray. There are more \nthan 70 Federal agencies responsible for gathering and analyzing \nstatistics. Many of these agencies expend resources attempting to \ngather the same information from the same sources. This duplication is \nunnecessarily burdensome on both taxpayers and respondents. Although a \nsmall group of people in the Office of Management and Budget [OMB] is \nnominally responsible for coordinating Federal efforts, no one in the \nFederal Government is held accountable for maintaining the quality of \nthe Government statistics or overseeing the modernization of the \nstatistical system.\n  The Federal Government spends $2.6 billion each year to finance this \nthicket of Federal statistical programs. Yet, in spite of the resources \nwe dedicate to gathering and analyzing statistics, Americans have lost \nconfidence in the quality of Government data. For example, over the \npast several years, a debate has raged over the accuracy of the \nConsumer Price Index. According to the General Accounting Office, the \n1990 census was inaccurate and the 2000 census is a high-risk project \nthat may produce unsatisfactory data again. And, according to a recent \nWall Street Journal article, the Department of Treasury is unable to \naccount for the source of billions of tax receipts this year.\n  Mr. President, the Federal Statistical System Act of 1997 is a \nnecessary first step to consolidate the Federal statistical system and \nimprove the quality of Government data. This legislation would \nestablish a Federal Commission on Statistical Policy to recommend how \nthe Federal statistical system should be reorganized and streamlined, \nand to draft legislation to consolidate the three largest Federal \nstatistical agencies--the Bureau of the Census, the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis--into a single Federal \nStatistical Service.\n  After the Federal Statistical Service legislation is enacted, the \ncommission shall then study and develop recommendations on which other \nFederal statistical organizations should be consolidated, eliminated or \nreorganized. The commission shall also make recommendations on issues \nregarding privacy of information collected by the Federal government, \nthe use of statistical data in Federal funding formulas, and standards \nof accuracy of Federal data.\n  Finally, Federal Statistical System Act of 1997 will allow the \nFederal Government to reduce further the cost and improve the accuracy \nof statistical programs while reducing the reporting burden on \nrespondents. This will be achieved by certain agencies to share \nnonidentifiable statistical information, exclusively for statistical \npurposes. This provision will also ensure that existing avenues and \nlimitations for public access to Government information under the \nPrivacy Act of Freedom of Information Act are retained without change.\n  Mr. President, we cannot improve the effectiveness and reduce the \ncost of Government programs unless we have a firm grasp on the measures \nwe use to implement and judge them. We cannot make an accurate \nassessment of our economic progress unless our relevant activity in \ntoday's economy is measured. Finally, we cannot make informed \nassessments on the state of our urban or rural areas and communities \nunless we have accurate and meaningful economic and social indicators. \nI believe Federal Statistical System Act of 1997 is an important first \nstep in streamlining Government and improving the quality of Government \ninformation, and I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12190-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HEROES SHINE IN NORTH DAKOTA FLOOD\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to draw the Senate's \nattention to some truly remarkable people, people whose work speaks \nvolumes about what special people North Dakotans are.\n  As my colleagues in the Senate are well aware, one of the Nation's \nworst weather-related disasters this year was the devastating flooding \nin Grand Forks, ND, and the entire Red River Valley. This historic \nflood captured the attention of the Nation in late spring as over 95 \npercent of the residents of Grand Forks and East Grand Forks were \nevacuated from their homes and much of North Dakota's second largest \ncity's downtown district was ravaged by fire and water.\n  History will have a dramatic record of the loss and devastation of \nthe flood. The hardship and heartbreak endured by so many of our \nfriends and neighbors will be forever etched into our memory.\n  But this year has also shown that North Dakota is a State blessed \nwith wonderful and resilient people, and with real-life heroes. It's \noften said that difficult times bring out the best in people, and that \ncertainly was the case in North Dakota. So now that a few months have \npassed since the waters have subsided, I would like to take a moment to \nreflect back on some of the many heroes, people that stepped up when \ntheir community needed them, whose efforts shined in the midst of the \nrising waters.\n  In a disaster, maintaining a working communication system is critical \nin fighting back and preserving the safety of those in the area. Today, \nI would like to recognize the efforts of several US West Communications \nemployees who worked tirelessly to maintain critical telephone service \nto the Grand Forks area throughout the flooding.\n  On April 19, 1997, before the flooding hit Grand Forks, a crew of \nnine central office technicians barricaded themselves into the US West \nbuilding in the heart of the city to keep the area's communication \nsystems up and running during the disaster. Their extensive preventive \nwork to prepare for the flooding would soon be tested as the waters \nrushed into town. As the entire city was evacuated, their building was \nsurrounded by 4 feet of water, and sat just one block away from a \nraging fire. But these brave men and women hung in and sustained phone \nservice, service which was essential to the rescue and recovery efforts \nof the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Federal Aviation \nAdministration, State and local emergency workers, and so many others \nin the flooded region.\n  To give you an idea of the challenges facing each of these brave \nheroes, they labored alone, night and day to keep the wires dry as 26 \ninches of water threatened basement cables. Sustained by the food, \nclothing, and cots delivered via boat by the National Guard, these \nfolks stayed on in a flooded town whose entire population had been \nordered to leave. Armed with only high-volume pumps, drying machines, \nand sandbags, these courageous people kept the communications system \nworking.\n  These heroes deserve to be recognized by name for their dedicated \nservice. The members of the initial emergency team were: Denny Braaten, \nLinda Potucek, Larry McNamara, Bob Schrader, Dan Kaiser, Dale Andrews, \nGlenda Wiess, Rick Hokenson, and Lew Ellingson.\n  Two days later, US West reinforcements arrived to provide additional \nsupport and hard work. I would like to recognize these workers now: Don \nJordan, Ray Jacobsen, Tim Kennedy, Roger Jones, Bruce Bengston, Gary \nBoser, Jim Falconer, Bion McNulty, Jack Olson, and Tim Rogers.\n  These people, along with the many others who volunteered and continue \nthe rebuilding effort today, are part of the story of this year's flood \nthat doesn't get told nearly enough, of people helping their neighbors \nin extremely hard circumstances, and of extraordinary acts of heroism \nperformed by everyday people.\n  I can't express my admiration enough.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12191-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12191-S12192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            STRIPED BASS CONSERVATION ACT AMENDMENTS OF 1997\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of H.R. \n1658, the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act Amendments of 1997. \nThis legislation will allow the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service to continue their important work with \nthe States to ensure the continued recovery of the striped bass \nfishery.\n\n[[Page S12192]]\n\n  The striped bass, commonly called rockfish in this area, is an \nanadromous fish which lives in marine waters during its adult life and \nmigrates to a freshwater river stream to spawn. On the Atlantic coast, \nstriped bass range from the St. Lawrence River in Canada to the St. \nJohns River in Florida. They are migratory, moving along the coast \nprimarily within the three-mile zone which is subject to State fishery \nmanagement. Adult habitats include the coastal rivers and the nearshore \nocean and are distributed along the coast from Maine through North \nCarolina. Because striped bass pass through the jurisdiction of several \nStates, Federal involvement in conservation efforts are necessary.\n  A severe population decline, which began in the 1970's, raised \nserious concerns about the sustainability of the striped bass fishery. \nIn 1979, I offered an amendment to the Anadromous Fish Conservation Act \nthat directed the Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine \nFisheries Service to conduct an emergency study of striped bass. The \nstudy found that, although habitat degradation played a role, \noverfishing was the primary cause of the population decline.\n  In 1981, the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission prepared the \nfirst coast-wide management plan for the Atlantic striped bass. In 1984 \nCongress enacted the Striped Bass Act in 1984 to ensure that the States \nwould comply with the plan. The act, which includes funding authority \nfor a Federal striped bass study, has been amended in 1986, 1988, and \n1991. The most recent reauthorization bill expired at the end of fiscal \nyear 1994.\n  Under the Striped Bass Act, States are required to implement \nmanagement measures that are consistent with the Commission's plan for \nthe conservation of striped bass. The act authorizes the Secretaries of \nCommerce and the Interior to impose a moratorium on striped bass \nfishing in any state that is not in compliance with the Commission's \nmanagement plan. The act also authorizes funding for the ongoing \nstriped bass study that was approved by Congress in 1979 in response to \nthe decline in the Atlantic striped bass populations. The Federal \nstudy, undertaken jointly by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the \nNational Marine Fisheries Service, provides information on the threats \nto and the status of the striped bass population and scientific data \nnecessary for sound management decisions.\n\n  The striped bass study in 1994 showed that most population indices \nhad returned to pre-decline levels, and the Atlantic States Marine \nFisheries Commission declared the species to be fully restored. It is a \ngreat testament to the Striped Bass Act and the cooperative efforts of \nthe States and Federal Government that the fishery is continually \nimproving.\n  The striped bass has proven once again that, given a chance, nature \nwill rebound and overcome tremendous setbacks. But it is up to us to \nhelp the striped bass receive that chance. Reauthorization of the \nAtlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act Amendments of 1997 will ensure \nthat the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine \nFisheries Commission will continue to monitor the populations, and \ncollect data that will provide the necessary information needed to make \ninformed decisions essential to maintaining healthy populations of \nstriped bass.\n  Mr. President, I strongly encourage the Senate to pass H.R. 1658 to \ncontinue one of the most significant recovery ever experienced for a \ncoastal finfish species.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12191-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             PEOPLE'S LODGE\n\n Mr. INOUYE.

Mr. President, I was pleased to join yesterday \nwith the distinguished Senator from Indiana, Senator Lugar, as a \ncosponsor of his bill, S. 1413, the Enhancement of Trade, Security, and \nHuman Rights Through Sanctions Reform Act.\n  This bill is an attempt to bring some order to one of the more vexing \nforeign policy problems we in Congress face--the question of when to \nimpose unilateral economic sanctions.\n  Congress has been quick to enact unilateral economic sanctions over \nthe years in response to behavior of foreign nations that we find \nobjectionable. At times, the executive branch has done the same. By one \nestimate, between 1993 and 1996, the United States imposed unilateral \nsanctions 61 times on 35 countries.\n  The question we must ask, and which in my view we fail to ask at \ntimes, really is fundamental to the conduct of U.S. foreign policy: Are \nU.S. interests advanced best by deepening relations or diminishing \nrelations with a country that is not acting as we would like?\n  Frankly, there is no one answer to this question. The answer clearly \nvaries from case to case. There is no doubt that unilateral sanctions \ndo have a place in our foreign policy tool box. I have voted for them \nat times, as has nearly every Member of Congress.\n  However, there is no doubt, as well, that we have imposed sanctions \nrecklessly at times, without due regard to their effectiveness, or to \nthe damage they could cause other U.S. foreign policy interests, the \nU.S. economy, and our ability to provide humanitarian assistance.\n  What S. 1413 would do is force Congress and the executive branch to \napply the brakes in the occasional rush to impose unilateral sanctions. \nOur effort is not to prevent unilateral sanctions in all cases, but \ninstead to impose a more judicious process that we should follow before \nthey are imposed. This process is designed to create some breathing \nspace--time to adequately consider both the possible impact of \nunilateral sanctions on other U.S. interests, and whether there are \nother policy alternatives that might be more effective than unilateral \nsanctions.\n  It will also ensure that when we do pass unilateral sanctions, we do \nnot lock ourselves into a policy that deprives us of all flexibility. \nBy making Presidential waivers and a 2-year sunset policy standard \npractice for the imposition of unilateral sanctions, we will ensure \nthat we are not forced to perpetuate a policy that is not working, has \nbecome outdated, or is excessively damaging U.S. interests in other \nareas.\n  It is worth repeating that nothing in this legislation will prevent \nus from passing unilateral sanctions into law. This bill is merely \ndesigned to bring some order and discipline to the process. I want to \ncommend the Senator from Indiana for his leadership in this area, and I \nlook forward to working with him to pass this bill into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12192-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12192-S12193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SUPPORT THE COMPREHENSIVE TEST BAN TREATY\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to join a number of my \ncolleagues in speaking briefly about one of the most important issues \nthat will come before the Senate next year in the second session of the \n105th Congress.\n  In late September, President Clinton submitted the Comprehensive Test \nBan Treaty to the Senate for ratification. The President's transmission \nstatement includes the following:\n\n       The Conclusion of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty \n     is a signal event in the history of arms control. The subject \n     of the treaty is one that has been under consideration by the \n     international community for\n\n[[Page S12193]]\n\n     nearly 40 years, and the significance of the conclusion of \n     negotiations and the signature to date of more than 140 \n     states cannot be overestimated. The Treaty creates an \n     absolute prohibition against the conduct of nuclear weapon \n     test explosions or any other nuclear explosion anywhere. . . \n     . The Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty is of singular \n     significance to the continuing efforts to stem nuclear \n     proliferation and strengthen regional and global stability. \n     Its conclusion marks the achievement of the highest priority \n     item on the international arms control and nonproliferation \n     agenda.\n\n  I commend the President for his leadership on this issue. I look \nforward to working closely and in a bipartisan fashion to secure prompt \nratification of the CTBT. I will do absolutely everything I can to \nsupport the passage of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. I expect a \nspirited debate on the CTBT including vigorous opposition from some who \ncontinue to believe in nuclear expansion and experimentation.\n  Several Senate hearings have recently been held and I urge the body \nto move forward in a timely and deliberative manner early in 1998. As a \nmember of the Appropriations Energy and Water subcommittee with funding \nresponsibility for nuclear weapons activities including stockpile \nstewardship, I look forward to actively participating in Senate \nconsideration of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n  Mr. President, at this point, I ask that a brief titled, ``Ten \nReasons for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,'' be printed in the \nRecord. This information was prepared by a nongovernmental organization \nin support of CTBT ratification.\n  The material follows:\n\n       Ten Reasons for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n\n\n  1. the ctbt would guard against the renewal of the nuclear arms race\n\n       The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty would limit the ability \n     of nuclear weapons states to build new nuclear weapons by \n     prohibiting ``any nuclear weapon test explosions and all \n     other nuclear explosions.'' The ban on nuclear explosions \n     would severely impede the development of new, sophisticated \n     nuclear weapons by the existing nuclear powers. While \n     countries could build advanced, new types of nuclear weapons \n     designs without nuclear explosive testing, they will lack the \n     high confidence that the weapons will work as designed. Thus, \n     the Treaty can impede a nuclear arms buildup by five declared \n     and three undeclared nuclear weapon states.\n\n\n          2. The CTBT would curb nuclear weapons proliferation\n\n       Under the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, ``threshold'' \n     states would be prevented from carrying out the types of \n     tests required to field a modern nuclear arsenal. While a \n     country could develop nuclear weapons for the first time \n     without conducting nuclear explosions, the bomb design would \n     be fare from optimal in size and weight and its nuclear \n     explosive power would remain uncertain. The CTBT is therefore \n     vital to preventing the spread of nuclear weapons to \n     additional states, where these weapons could destabilize \n     international security.\n\n\n   3. The CTBT would strengthen the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty\n\n       The conclusion of the CTBT is a key element in the global \n     bargain that led to the signing and the extension of the \n     Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. in May 1995, non-nuclear \n     states agreed to extend that Treaty in May 1995 with the \n     understanding that Article VI measures in the original \n     treaty--like the CTBT--would be implemented. At the May 1995 \n     NPT extension conference, all nations agreed to ``The \n     completion by the Conference on Disarmament of the \n     negotiations on a universal and internationally and \n     effectively verifiable Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty \n     no later than 1996.'' Ratification of the CTBT would further \n     legitimize U.S. non-proliferation efforts and lay the basis \n     for universal enforcement of the CTBT, even against the few \n     nations that may not sign.\n\n\n    4. Nuclear testing is not necessary to maintain the safety and \n                    reliability of the U.S. arsenal\n\n       The U.S. has a solid and proven warhead surveillance and \n     maintenance program to preserve the safety and reliability of \n     the U.S. nuclear deterrent without nuclear test explosions \n     and this program is being augmented through the Science-Based \n     Stockpile Stewardship Program (SBSS). Although some of the \n     projects that are part of the SBSS program are not essential \n     to the maintenance of the stockpile, many objective experts--\n     both critics and supporters of the program--agree that the \n     program can ensure the safety and reliability of the U.S. \n     nuclear stockpile without resorting to nuclear explosive \n     testing.\n       All operational U.S. nuclear weapons are already ``one-\n     point safe'' against accidental detonation of the warhead's \n     high explosives, making even low-yield nuclear explosions, \n     known as ``hydronuclear'' tests unnecessary. in addition, the \n     nuclear warhead designs of operational U.s. nuclear weapons \n     incorporate additional modern safety features. Since \n     instituting a new annual warhead safety and reliability \n     certification process in 1995, U.S. nuclear weapons have been \n     twice certified without nuclear test explosions.\n\n\n                 5. The CTBT is effectively verifiable\n\n       The CTBT would put into place an extensive, global array of \n     170 seismic monitoring stations, 80 radionuclide monitoring \n     stations, 11 hydroacoustic monitoring stations, and 60 \n     infrasound monitoring stations to detect and deter possible \n     nuclear test explosions. Monitoring capabilities would be \n     especially sensitive at and around the established nuclear \n     test sites. With this monitoring system, the CTBT would--with \n     high confidence--be able to detect nuclear test explosions \n     that are militarily significant. In addition, the CTBT \n     would provide an additional deterrent against potential \n     test ban violations by establishing on-site inspection \n     (OSI) rights that could allow detection of the radioactive \n     gases leaking from an underground nuclear test.\n\n\n    6. the ctbt would substantially enhance current u.s. monitoring \n                              capabilities\n\n       Whether or not the CTBT is ratified, U.S. intelligence \n     agencies will be tasked with monitoring nuclear weapons \n     programs of the nuclear powers and the efforts of non-nuclear \n     states and groups to attain nuclear weapons. The Treaty will \n     make that task easier by establishing a far-reaching \n     international monitoring system across the globe that would \n     augment existing national intelligence tools. Clearly, U.S. \n     intelligence capabilities to detect nuclear tests and nuclear \n     weapons development programs would be far better with the \n     CTBT\n\n\n   7. the ctbt would enhance the international norm against nuclear \n                                testing\n\n       If the five declared nuclear weapon states ratify the \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, it will strengthen the global \n     norm against testing and weapons development that helps make \n     the nuclear ``have-not'' nations far less inclined to develop \n     nuclear weapons. The U.S. has not tested a nuclear weapon \n     since 1992 when Congress passed and President Bush signed the \n     Hatfield-Exon-Mitchell legislation establishing a moratorium \n     on nuclear testing. This law, which remains in effect, says \n     that the U.S. may not conduct a nuclear test explosion unless \n     another nation conducts a test.

U.S. public support for a \n     nuclear weapons test ban has remained consistently high since \n     the early days of the Cold War. The most recent poll, \n     conducted in September 1997 by the Mellman Group, revealed \n     that 70 percent of Americans support United States \n     ratification of a nuclear test an treaty.\n\n\n  9. the ctbt is the longest-sought initiative to help reduce nuclear \n                            weapons dangers\n\n       The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty marks an historic \n     achievement pursued by Presidents since Dwight D.

Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today \nto bring to my colleagues' attention the games being played by the \nmajority regarding needed reforms at the IRS.\n  On one hand, the people want IRS reform, and only the Senate stands \nin the way. The House overwhelmingly passed an IRS reform bill, 426 to \n4, and the President is waiting to sign it into law. But the Senate \nleadership says ``no way, we can't begin fixing the IRS we have to get \nhome for the holidays.'' So the taxpayer will have to wait for needed \nreforms making the IRS more user friendly. This means changes aimed at \nhelping the American taxpayer deal with the IRS will be unnecessarily \ndelayed and taxpayers will see little change in the IRS. Instead of a \nnew IRS oversight board bringing new and more taxpayer friendly \nservices, Americans who are dutifully paying their\n\n[[Page S12194]]\n\ntaxes will see the same old IRS--business as usual. Instead of \npermitting taxpayers to recover up to $100,000 for negligent collection \nactions, the taxpayers will continue to fight an uphill and seemingly \nimpossible battle when challenging an IRS ruling.\n  We all were appalled by some of the IRS practices recently \nhighlighted in Congressional hearings and we all agree there is no \nplace in government for these abuses, yet when given the chance to \nbegin to remedy them, the Senate Leadership refuses to act.\n  As a cosponsor and supporter of the Taxpayer Bill of Rights and the \nTaxpayer Bill of Rights II that provided for increased taxpayer \nprotection, I urge the Senate to take the next much needed step and \npass the Internal Revenue Service Improvement Act.\n  In my mind it is outrageous that at the same time we have the Senate \nrefusing to act on the IRS Improvement Act, the majority is attempting \nto spend $100 million of taxpayer's money to conduct a poll to find if \nU.S. taxpayers like the IRS. I can't imagine what new information this \nwill provide. We all know that most Americans don't like the IRS. We \nall know it is government's most disliked agency. Spending $100 million \nto determine whether people like it seems a huge waste of money. This \nis nothing more than the Republican Majority using hard earned taxpayer \ndollars for their self-serving political theatrics. Why not make \ntaxpayers give the Majority $100 million dollars worth of stamps and \ncopying machines to run their 1998 election campaign. Does the \nLeadership really need to spend an extra $100 million to find out that \nmost Americans don't like paying taxes.\n  This is the most outrageous and hypocritical use of taxpayer funds \nthat I have seen in my forty years in politics. Yes, there have been \nother abuses and scams defrauding the American taxpayer, but none more \nblatantly political and painfully obvious.\n  If we want to add $100 million in federal spending why use it for \npartisan political purposes to prove what we all already know. Instead \nlet us use this $100 million for real government such as constructing \n1,325 additional federal prison beds or incarcerating 4000 more federal \nprisoners. Or maybe we could add 725 new border patrol agents or enroll \n20,000 more children in headstart. We could also add 55,300 new summer \njobs or train 27,600 low income adults. I am sure most of my colleagues \nhear a constant cry back home for more spending to improve roads and \nhighways, certainly South Carolina could use $100 million for roads. As \nI understand, $100 million would resurface 670 miles of highway. At a \ntime of mounting transportation needs, spending federal funds for an \nIRS poll seems ridiculous.\n  Mr President, let me conclude by stating the obvious. Spending $100 \nmillion of taxpayer money on an IRS poll does not help a single \ntaxpayer. In short, it is a huge waste of money. If we want to assist \ntaxpayers, if we want real reform, we should pass the IRS Reform bill \nnow. I urge the Majority Leader to free the IRS Reform bill, let the \nSenate vote and begin providing relief to the American \ntaxpayer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12193-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SHORT TERM EXTENSION OF ISTEA\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, I served on the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works when the original ISTEA bill was written. \nI believe ISTEA has been one of the most important, innovative pieces \nof legislation ever to pass the United States Congress. Our stated goal \nwas to turn over more spending power and authority to the states and \nlocalities while maintaining a strong national transportation system.\n  In the last 6 years we have made great progress and, when we are \nfinally able to pass a bill, I feel confident that ISTEA II will carry \nus further in the same direction. Until we get to that point, the \nCongress must must pass a short-term measure that ensures that the \nstate programs remain stable while we are finishing work on the \nreauthorization.\n  ISTEA made the states partners with the federal government in \nbuilding and maintaining a strong transportation system. Leaving them \nin the lurch now would be no way to treat a partner. I believe the \nCongress needs to pass a short-term extension to ISTEA to ensure \ncontinuity in the state programs and to live up to our obligation to \nthe American people to provide a world-class transportation system.\n  I am delighted that the Senate passed this short term extension by \nunanimous consent last night, putting aside regional differences over \nformula funding. I am hopeful that the House will respond quickly and \nthat we will be able to go home knowing that we have done the right \nthing for the states and the American people.\n  Senator Bond, the primary author of this approach, takes care of our \nshort term needs and he deserves our praise for developing it and \nselling it to all of his colleagues while under tremendous time \npressures. State programs will continue, but we keep the pressure \non ourselves to get the 6 year reauthorization done.\n\n  Several of my colleagues have came to the Floor last night to explain \nhow the bill works and I will not repeat their effort. However, I do \nwant to offer high praise to Senator Chafee, Senator Bond, Senator \nBaucus, and Senator Warner for developing a measure that will work and \nhas the support of the Senate.\n  Additionally, I would like to offer thanks to key members of their \nstaff for their hard work and late hours, not only this week but \nthroughout the year, Kathy Ruffalo of Senator Baucus' staff, Dan \nCorbett of Mr. Chafee's staff, and Ann Loomis of Senator Warner's staff \nhave put in tremendous hours of hard work this year developing a 6 year \nreauthorization of ISTEA, a bill that passed the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works unanimously.\n  Additionally, Tracy Henke of Senator Bond's staff did top notch work \nin putting together the Senate's short term extension bill and I am \ngrateful for her efforts.\n  In particular I want to thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for \naccommodating my request to include the Federal Lands Highway Programs \nin the bill. For states, such as mine, that have vast holdings of \npublic lands, the Federal Lands Highways Programs are a vital part of \nour transportation network.\n  There are three programs that make up the Federal Lands Highway \nProgram:\n  Public Lands Highway Program for roads and maintenance on federal \nlands. Eighty-seven percent of Nevada is federally-owned;\n  Indian Reservation Roads Program for roads and maintenance on Indian \nreservations; and\n  Parkways and Park Highways Program that funds roads and maintenance \nwithin National Parks.\n  These programs serve as a transportation lifeline for the vast rural, \nfederally-owned areas that blanket the Western United States. The \nfederal government has a duty and obligation to build and maintain \nroads on federal lands. It would be unreasonable for the federal \ngovernment to ignore the needs of citizens living in these areas.\n  If the goal of today's action is to keep the state highway programs \nrunning until we complete work on the reauthorization of ISTEA, then it \nis critical that the Federal Lands Highway Program be included.\n  Nevada has become the most urbanized state in the Union; a higher \npercentage of our population lives in urban areas than in any other \nstate. Coupled with the dramatic growth Nevada is experiencing, it is \ndifficult for the rural areas to get the attention they need and \ndeserve without these programs. They are an absolutely essential piece \nof Nevada's state program.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for recognizing the unique needs of \nNevada and other vast public lands states and for including funding for \nthe Federal Lands Highway Programs in this bill.\n  We still have a long ways to go in reaching a short-term compromise \nwith the House, but after the Senate's actions last night, I am \nconfident that we will get there.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12194-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12194-S12195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE SURFACE TRANSPORTATION EXTENSION ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to comment on S. 1454, \nthe Surface Transportation Extension Act of 1997, which the Senate \nadopted last night. This bill allows States to obligate funds for six \nmonths, to ensure that\n\n[[Page S12195]]\n\ntransportation funding continues to flow for highways, mass transit and \nsafety programs. In addition, this bill will enable continued operation \nof the United States Department of Transportation.\n  Each state will be assured access to transportation funds equaling at \nleast 50 percent, and not more than 75 percent of the state's total \ntransportation funding in FY1997. Moreover, states will have until May \n1, 1998, to obligate those funds. No state will be able to obligate \nFederal funds after that date.\n  Every member should understand that this approach essentially creates \nanother transportation funding crisis in only a few short months. This \nis far from a comfortable situation.\n  Next year, when we take up the ISTEA reauthorization bill, we will be \nin the middle of the FY99 budget discussions and a decision about \nwhether to allocate new funds that may become available as a result of \nimproved budget projections. So, the debate over ISTEA, and the reality \nof another funding cutoff, will likely coincide with discussions over \nthe FY99 Budget Resolution. As the Ranking Democratic Member of the \nBudget Committee, I can assure you that I will be doing my best to make \nadditional investment in our transportation infrastructure a high \npriority during these discussions.\n  Mr. President, when it became clear over one month ago that there was \nnot enough time to fully debate a multi-year authorization bill, I \nstarting calling for enactment of a short-term extension of ISTEA. This \nwas the logical approach toward ensuring that States' transportation \nfunding would not run dry.\n  The States need additional funds now to meet their immediate \ntransportation needs. ISTEA expired over a month ago, and although \nStates have funding left over from previous years, these available \nfunds will begin to run dry very soon for many States. Highway safety \nprograms have been particularly hard hit because they have no leftover \nfunding. Mass transit programs have no funding reserves.\n  A straightforward reauthorization of ISTEA for six months is, to me, \nthe easiest and fastest way to proceed. A House bill to do just that is \ncurrently pending on the Senate calendar. By simply continuing current \nlaw, this short-term extension also bypasses the controversy caused by \nenacting changes to the existing funding formulas or apportionments. In \naddition, passage of the House extension bill would allow us to \nimmediately send this legislation to the President, rather than having \nto begin new discussions in a conference with the House. However, I \nunderstand that controversy is in the eye of the beholder, and there is \na feeling among many in this body that allocation of new money will \ninevitably result in a discussion of formulas. So here we are.\n  Mr. President, in the absence of a six month extension of current \nlaw, I reluctantly support the Bond compromise, which identified those \nneeds that had to be addressed in a stop-gap measure.\n  Mr. President, it is imperative that by the time Congress adjourns \nthis year, both the House and Senate agree on an approach and send a \nbill to the President that can be signed into law. It is clear to most, \nthat failure to enact some stopgap measure before we adjourn will have \na severe impact on the transportation programs of the States. All State \nplans for new transportation construction, maintenance, and repair \nactivities will be stopped. State transit agencies, metropolitan \nplanning organizations, safety programs, and State planning and bidding \nactivities will immediately suffer from funding shortages. Without a \nbill, important agencies within USDOT will shut down by mid- to late \nDecember. As a result, no projects involving Federal funding could go \nforward. This would have a huge impact on the States. Federal funds pay \nfor over half the capital costs of State and local highway projects.\n  The situation is even more bleak for all the other programs \nauthorized under ISTEA--the safety programs, Intelligent Transportation \nSystems program, research programs, and--something very important to my \nstate--the federal transit program. There are no funds left over to \ncontinue these programs.\n  Perhaps the most distressing effect of our failure to act is the \nsafety risk imposed on our constituents, as drunk driving prevention \nprograms, truck and bus safety enforcement, bridge inspections, and \nhighway/rail crossing projects are suspended. For safety reasons alone, \nwe must ensure that some authority is extended. This bill does just \nthat.\n  While this bill is important, I do have some concerns. Under this \nbill, States would have the flexibility to shift unobligated balances \namong programs to ensure that states can use their scarce funds where \nthey are most needed. For instance, a State could use its left-over \nCMAQ or enhancement funds to pay for a highway construction project. \nLanguage is included to prevent States from abandoning the \nresponsibility to pay back the accounts from which they transferred \nfunds. I remain concerned that these pay-back provisions will not be \nhonored. States must be strictly required to pay back all of these \ntransfers, including transfers from their CMAQ accounts, otherwise \nvaluable programs, critical to our Nation's health and welfare, may be \ndepleted. We must watch this closely to ensure that the program is \nprotected.\n  Mr. President, this bill authorizes the additional funding needed to \nkeep crucial safety programs running, to allow States to continue their \ntransportation projects and plans, to keep the U.S. Department of \nTransportation operating, and to continue the federal transit program \nfor six months. Although this bill will most likely lead to yet another \nfunding crisis in the near future, I want to do all I can to make sure \nthat the Senate does not adjourn without somehow addressing the lapse \nin transportation funding. I prefer a straight extension of current \nlaw, and urged Senator Lott to bring it up. However, he rejected that \npath. Since that option is not before the Senate, I support this \nproposal as an acceptable compromise to carry us over until an ISTEA \nreauthorization bill is passed into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12194-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12195-S12196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SUPPORT U.S. ENCRYPTION EXPORTS\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss an issue of \ngreat importance to Washington state. I remain deeply concerned about \nthe Administration's lack of progress in working with interested \nSenators and industry to craft a workable, effective solution for \nmodernizing the United States export controls on products with \nencryption capabilities. I have been involved in this debate for a long \ntime, too long. We need to take action.\n  I am an original cosponsor of several encryption legislative \ninitiatives introduced by Senator Burns and Senator Leahy. Both of \nthese Senators continue to do extraordinary work on this issue and I \ncommend them for their thoughtful leadership. The Burns and Leahy bills \nbasically say that if strong encryption is generally available or \ncomparable encryption is available from foreign vendors, then our U.S. \ncompanies--the ones dominating the computer industry--should be able to \nsell their products as well. Previously, I also introduced similar \nlegislation on encryption.\n  I simply do not understand the Administration's continued refusal to \nacknowledge technological and marketplace realities when it has \nembraced the use of technology in so many ways.\n  Computer users are demanding the ability to communicate securely over \nthe Internet and to store data safely on their personal computers. We \nhave all heard the stories about hackers monitoring our communications \nand even financial transactions, while at the same time gaining access \nto our hard drives while we are looking at a certain website. Until \nconsumers have confidence that transactions and communications are \nsecure, I do not believe that we will ever see the full potential of \nthe communication technologies that are currently available and those \nto be developed in the future.\n  I was hopeful late last year that the Administration had taken a very \nsmall, positive step on encryption exports. Instead, the result was \nbasically the status quo. Computer software publishers and hardware \nmanufacturers are still limited to shipping the same old 40-bit \nencryption unless they agree to design key recovery systems according \nto a government mandated standard. Ultimately, due to economics and\n\n[[Page S12196]]\n\nmarketing issues in the computer world, most Americans are still \nlimited to this 40-bit strength encryption as well, because our \ncompanies develop one product for worldwide distribution.\n  What will it take for the federal government to learn that consumers \nare opposed to having ``Big Brother'' interfere with their technology \nchoices. We all remember the failed Administration attempts on Clipper \nI and Clipper II. Yet, the federal government persists in its efforts \nto peek into the private lives of law-abiding American citizens. The \nlatest salvo by FBI Director Louis Freeh in demanding government \nmandated encryption for domestic users is the latest example of \ngovernment obstruction of private decisions by American consumers and \nbusiness opportunities for American innovators. If Director Freeh gets \nhis way, the federal government will have even greater authority to \npeer and peek into the private lives of American citizens. ``Big \nBrother'' as feared by law-abiding Americans has a powerful champion at \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n  While this war of attrition is taking place, we are losing in the \ntrenches. Foreign vendors are happily supplying stronger 128-bit \nencryption to our foreign purchasers. Some of these vendors have \npublicly thanked the U.S. government for helping them to develop \nthriving businesses. Importantly, current U.S. policy represents a \nsurrender of an industry where our innovative workers and companies are \ntechnologically superior. We are surrendering jobs and economic \nopportunities both today and for the long term. There are many examples \nfrom my own State of Washington, usually small start-up firms eager to \ngrow, diversify and develop new high-tech applications in computer \nhardware and software. These firms regularly point out to me the names \nand business histories of their foreign competitors that have gladly \ntaken business opportunities from Washington firms restricted by \nineffective government mandates.\n  It is time for the United States to acknowledge that we no longer \nexclusively control the pace of technology. Purchasers around the world \ncan download software off of the Internet from any country by simply \naccessing a website. Foreign purchasers have turned to Russian, German, \nSwiss and other foreign vendors for their encryption needs. We are \ntruly trying to put the genie back in the bottle--a genie so nimble \nthat it can transfer in seconds from one location to another using a \nmodem over a traditional telephone line.\n  U.S. law enforcement seems to believe that Americans will recapture \nthis market once our industry has developed key recovery systems for \n128-bit or stronger encryption technology. This is extremely naive in \nmy opinion. All the world will know that the U.S. government approved \nexport technology will enable U.S. law enforcement to view encrypted \ninformation. Most foreigners believe the U.S. government will use this \ncapability to spy on them; for law enforcement, political and economic \ninformation. Foreigners will simply buy elsewhere, period. It's pretty \nsimple to me. What foreign entity would want to surrender information \nto the U.S. government when they can easily avoid this by purchasing \nsomeone else's product?\n  Again, I turn to the approach advocated by Senator Burns and Senator \nLeahy. S. 909 as adopted by the Senate Commerce Committee simply does \nnot go far enough. While it makes some minor modifications to export \ncontrols, it also goes in the totally wrong direction by starting down \nthe path of domestic controls on encryption.\n  Washington state and American companies deserve the opportunity to \ncompete free from government restrictions. Their role in the \ninternational marketplace should be determined by their ingenuity and \ncreativity rather than an outdated, ineffectual system of export \ncontrols. The time to act is now, the longer we wait, the further \nbehind America gets on this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12195-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNITION OF GIRL SCOUT GOLD AWARD RECIPIENTS\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

Mr. President, Friday, the 7th of November 1997, on the \noccasion of the bicentennial of the birth of Joseph Henry, the Joseph \nHenry Medal was presented to Dr. Frederick Seitz at a dinner of the \nSmithsonian Council. Clearly, this was a special occasion, and it was \nsingularly appropriate that Frederick Seitz should be the honoree. The \ncitation of the splendid gold medal reads:\n\n       The Board of Regents gratefully presents the Joseph Henry \n     Medal to Frederick Seitz in recognition of his manifold \n     contributions to The Smithsonian Institution. His advancement \n     of the Smithsonian's research and educational programs in the \n     sciences, history, and the history of science has exemplified \n     the ideals of James Smithson's mandate . . . ``for the \n     increase and diffusion of knowledge.''--May 4, 1997.\n\n  Having received the medal, Dr. Seitz, with his enormous erudition and \nno less prodigious self-effacing manner, presented a paper of great \ninterest. Entitled, Joseph Henry: 200th Anniversary of Birth, he wrote \nof the belated appearance of science as a large-scale activity in the \nAmerican Republic, but also of four early pioneers: Benjamin Franklin, \nBenjamin Thompson, Henry A. Rowland, and Joseph Henry himself. Which of \nus would know that Franklin discovered the Gulf Stream? That is just \none of the absorbing details of this fascinating disquisition. I ask \nthat it be printed in the Record in honor of Frederick Seitz, Joseph \nHenry, and all that splendid company.\n  The material follows:\n\n                Joseph Henry; 200th Anniversary of Birth\n\n       When I first heard the rumor that I would receive the \n     Joseph Henry Medal on this special anniversary, I assumed it \n     was a case of mistaken identity. Very friendly calls from \n     Senator Moynihan, Homer Neal and Marc Rothenberg, however, \n     finally carried conviction. Needless to say I will continue \n     to experience a sense of awe in playing a role on this \n     special anniversary since the scientific community, of which \n     I have been part for most of my life, owes so much to Henry, \n     as I shall presently relate.\n       Our country, had so many difficult practical problems to \n     solve in its early days, that it did not take much interest \n     in the fundamental aspects of science, in contrast to the \n     European countries, until the end of the nineteenth century, \n     that is, about a hundred years ago when it created what was \n     then called the National Bureau of Standards. Even this step \n     had a very practical aspect since we were encouraging exports \n     and wanted to be in tune with standards of manufacture \n     internationally as well as at home. It is true that we did \n     have the closely linked Smithsonian Institution and National \n     Academy of Sciences at that time. However their existence was \n     in the last analysis tied closely to the unsolicited gift in \n     1832 of James Smithson, an English scientist who admired the \n     promises for the future of mankind that our republic offered. \n     Moreover, he felt that it was inevitable that we would \n     eventually become deeply involved in the pursuit of basic \n     science.\n       Even though our country did not encourage the development \n     of the basic sciences until the century we are now leaving \n     behind, we did manage to produce from our own soil a few \n     world-class scientists, including four truly great \n     physicists, not least Joseph Henry, during the previous two \n     centuries. I would like to say a few words about each.\n       The first was no less a person than Benjamin Franklin, born \n     in Boston in 1706, but more generally linked to Philadelphia, \n     his adopted home. We all know about the experiment with \n     lightning and the kite and his research with lightning \n     arrestors, however, this is only part of the story. He \n     discovered, as a result of extensive correspondence, that our \n     continental weather tends to have a\n\n[[Page S12197]]\n\n     strong eastward drift; he discovered what we now term the \n     Gulf Stream which encircles the Atlantic Ocean, although he \n     falsely ascribed it not to winds and Coriolis forces, but to \n     the influence of the emergence of a yet undiscovered \n     underground river.\n       Perhaps even more remarkably, he was apparently the first \n     person to provide a good measure of molecular dimensions. He \n     noted that when a quantity of the right kind of oil is poured \n     onto water it spreads rapidly at first, but then stops \n     spreading and retains cohesion. He concluded that the \n     thickness of the oil film at the point of maximum spread mut \n     be linked to what we would now term the size of its molecular \n     constituents. Using measured quantities of oil he obtained an \n     entirely reasonable value for those dimensions.\n       The second great scientists, namely Benjamin Thompson, is \n     probably entirely unknown to many of you. He was born in \n     Woburn, in what was then the colony of Massachusetts in 1753, \n     and developed a strong interest in science during his youth. \n     He was not sympathetic to the Revolution and moved to England \n     in 1776 where he joined the military and served throughout \n     the war as an administrator. In 1794, after serving in \n     various roles in England and on the continent he was offered \n     a high post in the Bavarian government which he held for \n     eleven years. There among many other activities he supervised \n     the boring of canon in the royal arsenal. Being highly \n     observant, he noted that the extent to which the canon became \n     heated during the drilling was essentially proportional to \n     the length of time the drilling had taken place. He concluded \n     that the heat content of the metal was a form of energy \n     closely related to the energy of work. This proposal stood in \n     sharp contradiction to the popular theory of the time to the \n     effect that heat was the manifestation of the presence of a \n     special weightless fluid called phlogiston. He wrote a \n     convincing treatise on this topic, thereby opening the \n     doorway to the field of thermodynamics and statistical \n     mechanics which occupied some of the best scientific minds \n     during the next century. I should add that the great Chemist \n     Lavoisier, who was guillotined in 1794 and whom Thompson \n     knew, had also come to the conclusion that the phlogiston \n     theory must be wrong. Thompson's treatise pointed the way to \n     a new positive approach.\n       Thompson, incidentally, joined with Joseph Banks, the \n     President of the Royal Society in establishing the Royal \n     Institution in London where Humphrey Davy and Michael Faraday \n     later carried out their great researches and gave popular \n     public lectures on science. It is easy to imagine that \n     Smithson had the Royal Institution in mind as a role model \n     for our country when he gave the money to create the \n     Smithsonian. I should also add that Thompson came to terms \n     with his native land at the end of the Revolutionary War, \n     establishing good relationships with the Massachusetts \n     community.\n       Skipping chronological order for the moment, the third \n     great American scientist in my list is Henry A. Rowland, born \n     in Honesdale, Pennsylvania in 1848. He received his higher \n     education at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, \n     New York, and was appointed to the chair in physics at the \n     Johns Hopkins University when it opened its doors in 1876. He \n     carried on research in many areas of physics, but is probably \n     best known for the development of a machine which engraved on \n     a material such as glass so-called diffraction line gratings \n     that were of special use in separating different wavelengths \n     of light. He was also interested in telegraphic equipment and \n     invented a widely used form of teletype machine.\n       Rowland gained early fame as a result of an experiment he \n     carried out in Europe in the laboratory of Hermann Helmholtz \n     in 1875, the year before he took residence in Baltimore. In \n     the previous decade, the very brilliant Scottish physicists, \n     James C. Maxwell, had collected all known information \n     concerning electromagnetic phenomena and placed it in the \n     form of a mutually consistent set of four mathematical \n     equations, generally known as Maxwell's equations. To achieve \n     what his intuition told him would provide appropriate \n     symmetry and balance in the equations, he modified one of the \n     set of four. In effect, the modification amounted to saying \n     that an isolated, moving electric charge would have a \n     magnetic field related to the velocity associated with it, \n     but one so weak for normal velocities achievable at the time \n     that it would be very difficult to measure. Helmholtz, \n     recognizing that the young American was an exceedingly \n     talented experimenter, suggested that he attempt to measure \n     that field, which Rowland did with ingenuity and notable \n     success in a remarkably short time. It should be added that \n     Rowland had to repeat the experiment twice in later decades \n     in order to convince others who had tried to duplicate his \n     work without success.\n       I should also add that Maxwell noted that one set of \n     solutions to his modified equations describe free \n     electromagnetic waves traveling with the speed of light in a \n     vacuum. He decided that ordinary visible light must consist \n     of electromagnetic waves. Helmholtz was quick to pick up on \n     this and convinced his brightest young colleague, Henrich \n     Hertz, to look into the matter on a laboratory scale to see \n     if he could generate much longer waves, independent of a \n     light source, using available electrical equipment. The ages \n     of wireless telegraphy, radio, television and radar loomed \n     over the horizon.\n       It would be equivalent to shipping oil from Texas to Saudi \n     Arabia for me to present a detailed biography of Joseph Henry \n     on this occasion since his background is well known to most \n     of you. In brief, he was born in Albany, New York, just 200 \n     years ago and spent a portion of his early years living with \n     his grandmother in nearby Galway, a few miles west of \n     Saratoga. Incidentally, if you chance to pass through Galway \n     please note the handsome high school building, probably built \n     in the 1920's, which bears Henry's name. He studied at the \n     Albany Academy, which still exists, and early on had \n     difficulty deciding whether to become an actor or a \n     scientist. Fortunately, science won. He began a series of \n     highly innovative experiments with electromagnets and soon \n     discovered the induction of electric fields by changing \n     magnetic fields--the basis for one of Maxwell's equations. \n     Michael Faraday, in England, made the same discovery somewhat \n     later, but published his results before Henry managed to. \n     Never the less the international community has given credit \n     to Henry by naming the unit of measurement of magnetic \n     inductance after him. In connection with this research, he \n     invented the so-called electric transformer, so valuable in \n     alternating current circuits.\n       Although well established at the Albany Academy, he \n     accepted an appointment at what is now Princeton University \n     in 1832, and continued to carry on his research there, \n     focusing in part on various aspects of telegraphy. Much of \n     his original equipment is well preserved in the physics \n     department.\n       In 1846 he was offered the post of Secretary of the newly \n     created Smithsonian Institution which he accepted even though \n     he was reluctant to leave the special environment that he had \n     enjoyed at Princeton. He was soon widely recognized as the \n     dean of American science as he developed the new institution \n     into a center for research as well as public exhibitions \n     related to science. He was to serve in the post for thirty \n     two years.\n       In 1863, when the Civil War broke out, a small group of \n     scientifically oriented individuals in Washington, led by \n     Alexander Bache, a great grandson of Franklin, and Commodore \n     Charles Davis, succeeded in having a bill that created a \n     National Academy of Sciences passed by the Congress. Their \n     intention was to rally the available scientific community \n     into research associated with the war effort. The bill was \n     sponsored by Senator Henry Wilson of Massachusetts. President \n     Lincoln signed the charter. Henry took an interest in the \n     activities of the new organization from the start, \n     recognizing fully its potentialities. During the course of \n     the war Henry became a good friend of President Lincoln who \n     expressed much admiration for him.\n       When, at the end of the war, the founders were at somewhat \n     of a loss in deciding what to do with the Academy during \n     peacetime, Henry agreed to become its president and retained \n     leadership until his death in 1878. During that period he \n     essentially made the Academy a temporary wing of the \n     Smithsonian, holding regular scientific meetings, expanding \n     the membership and challenging the members to do everything \n     they could to increase the amount of basic scientific \n     research being carried on in the country. By the time of his \n     death, the National Academy, although still closely tied to \n     the Smithsonian, was a well-running organization prepared to \n     play a major role in guiding the progress of good science in \n     the Republic.\n       I should add at this point that immediately after World War \n     I, another great Secretary of the Smithsonian, Charles D. \n     Walcott, who had served as the very effective president of \n     the Academy during that war, succeeded in obtaining private \n     funds which made it possible for the Academy to have a new \n     home of its own on Constitution Avenue. Walcott, \n     incidentally, was also a New Yorker, having been born in New \n     York Mills near Utica in 1850.\n       Our debt to Joseph Henry can perhaps be summarized by \n     saying that, in addition to establishing a high standard for \n     scientific research through his own laboratory work, he \n     encouraged general acceptance of those standards and took \n     leadership in establishing National institutions which could \n     carry them forward. In other words, he did for the promotion \n     of science in our country what Washington had done in helping \n     to establish the republic in which we have the good fortune \n     to live. I can think of no higher praise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12196-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12197-S12198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         DANIEL URBAN KILEY, 1997 NATIONAL MEDAL OF ARTS WINNER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I pay \ntribute to Daniel Urban Kiley, a landscape architect from Charlotte, \nVermont, who was named by President Clinton as recipient of the 1997 \nNational Medal of Arts. Established by Congress in 1984, this award \nhonors individuals who have made outstanding contributions to the arts \nin our nation.\n  My wife, Marcelle, and I have enjoyed the work of Daniel Urban Kiley \nfor many years and I am honored that a Vermonter, and a friend, has \nreceived this national recognition.\n  I ask to have printed in the Record a list of Mr. Kiley's \naccomplishments put together by the awards committee.\n  The material follows:\n\n       As one of this country's most eminent landscape architects, \n     Daniel Kiley combines\n\n[[Page S12198]]\n\n     experience and imagination with the vision to create classic \n     civic design where building and site come together as one. In \n     a professional career spanning over 50 years, Kiley has \n     worked on some of this country's most important commissions \n     along with many of today's most distinguished architects and \n     firms in 16 foreign countries. He has helped design sites \n     including the Washington Mall, the National Gallery of Art \n     East Wing, National Sculpture Garden--all in Washington, D.C. \n     More recently, he worked on the design of the Pittsburgh \n     Cultural Trust plaza and museum, the Soros residence, and \n     Riverfront Park in Corning, New York. He is the recipient of \n     many awards and honors including the 1995 Arnold W. Brunner \n     Prize in Architecture, the Outstanding Lifetime Achievement \n     Award from the Harvard Graduate School of Design, and a 1991 \n     Governor's Award for Excellence in the Arts from the Vermont \n     Council on the Arts. Kiley's work has been shown at the \n     Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Library of Congress, \n     and in traveling national exhibitions. He has lectured \n     extensively and served on many design juries. His work has \n     been widely published in the U.S. and abroad. In 1998, Kiley \n     will publish a book exploring the breadth of his work. He \n     served on President Kennedy's Advisory Council for \n     Pennsylvania Avenue, the National Council on the Arts, the \n     Boston Redevelopment Authority, the Cambridge Redevelopment \n     Authority, the Washington, D.C. Redevelopment Land Agency, \n     and the Vermont Council on the Arts. He also has been a \n     Landscape Architect-in-Residence at the American Academy in \n     Rome. Kiley's designs have been widely cited for their \n     ability to raise public consciousness and enhance awareness \n     of man's relationship to nature, while maintaining a sense of \n     joyousness, fun, and excitement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12197-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FIRST ANNUAL WORLD EDUCATOR AWARD\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise to join the Washington \nWorld Affairs Council in congratulating Mr. Keith Forest of Decatur \nHigh School in Federal Way, Washington, as the very first recipient of \nthe World Educator Award.\n  The World Affairs Council is a 1,200 member nonprofit organization of \nbusiness and community leaders with more than 40 years of experience \nbringing the world to Washington State. Through its many programs, \nincluding the Global Classroom, the World Affairs Council has been an \ninstrumental force in educating the people of my State about the world \naround us; our varied and diverse cultures, changing political and \nsecurity environments, and of course, the importance of international \ntrade. It is appropriate and noteworthy that this widely respected \norganization would annually recognize a World Educator in our State.\n  On December 6, 1997, Mr. Keith Forest will be presented with the \nWorld Educator Award. This award recognizes an outstanding teacher of \nthe world including global cultures, contemporary world issues and \nworld languages.\n  I would like to join the World Affairs Council in acknowledging and \nrecognizing Keith Forest for his invaluable contributions to our \nchildren's understanding of the world. Keith Forest has been a teacher \nfor more than 25 years. His own experience as a student of the world \nhas been shared with thousands of students and future leaders.\n  Mr. Forest does not rely on easily outdated texts to teach about the \never changing world, but instead has designed his own curriculum. As a \nfrequent traveler, Mr. Forest brings to his class slides and videos and \nstories from around the globe. The posters of Chairman Mao's Cultural \nRevolution and the pottery shards used by his archeology students are \ntangible examples of how Keith Forest's teaching brings world history \nto life.\n  Mr. Forest has taught social studies at Decatur High School in \nWashington State for 15 years and his reputation precedes him through \nthe halls. Students line up to take his classes, knowing the hands-on, \nin-depth exposure they will receive in his class. His passion and \nenthusiasm for helping his students grasp socio-political concepts and \nforeign affairs easily transfers to his eager classroom participants.\n  A Fullbright Scholar, Mr. Forest has studied in Japan, Korea and \nChina and has led numerous expeditions and exchange programs. He wrote \nthe Washington State curriculum on the Holocaust after a trip to \nIsrael. Additionally, he authored the Port of Seattle sponsored \ncurriculum on international trade that is used throughout the State.\n  Congratulations to Keith Forest and the World Affairs Council. Your \nwork in the classroom echoes through our State and educates us \nall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12198-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12198-S12202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     ADOPTION PROMOTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today, it is my pleasure to support and urge \npassage of the Promotion of Adoption, Safety, and Support for Abused \nand Neglected Children Act or the PASS Act for short. This legislation \ncontains the right combination of reforms to dramatically change the \nchild welfare system for the better.\n  The foster care system reflects a part of modern society which \nprompts us to ask many questions of ourselves and each other. It is a \nmirror which can be troubling to look into.\n  Today, we join the tens of thousands of loving foster care and \nadoptive families and dedicated professionals who are daily witnesses \nof the successes and failures in a system through which millions of \npeople pass each year. Each report to a child protective service agency \ninvolves a victim and a perpetrator--in most cases, a child and his or \nher parent. A case may take a single day or many years to close.\n  Many of these cases are complex and that the length of time in foster \ncare has an effect on the child. Between 1985 and 1995, the number of \nchildren in foster care increased from 276,000 to 494,000, an increase \nof nearly 80 percent.\n  Much of this increase is due to the hurricane-force waves of drug \nabuse which continue to unleash their destructive powers on communities \nand families. Those who believe for even a foolish moment that drug use \nis a victimless crime are proven wrong by the recent trends in the \nchild welfare system. One need only to look inside the hospital crib of \nan abandoned crack baby to understand the truth.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services estimates that 100,000 \nchildren currently in foster care cannot return home without \njeopardizing their health, safety, and development.\n  There is great concern that more children are staying in foster care \nfor longer periods of time. The very laws which are intended to protect \nchildren may in practice work against their best interests.\n  The child welfare system itself is complex and is composed of many \nparts and programs. Although the Federal Government has assumed a \ngreater share of the cost of these programs in recent years, State and \nlocal governments still provide the majority of the resources for the \nchild welfare system.\n  In fiscal year 1997, the Federal Government contributed approximately \n$5 billion to the child welfare system.\n  Of this amount, 85 percent was spent through title IV-E programs.\n  CBO estimates that under current law, outlays for foster care and \nadoption assistance will increase by more than 50 percent from $3.9 \nbillion in fiscal year 1997 to $5.9 billion in 2002.\n  Federal funds are used to subsidize about half of the children in \nfoster care and about two-thirds of the children receiving adoption \nassistance payments.\n  The Promotion of Adoption, Safety, and Support for Abused and \nNeglected Children Act includes much needed reform to the child welfare \nsystem.\n\n[[Page S12199]]\n\n  The PASS Act provides that in determining ``reasonable efforts,'' the \nchild's health and safety shall be the paramount concern.\n  It clarifies circumstances, including murder, voluntary manslaughter, \nand felony assault under which ``reasonable efforts'' to reunite \nfamilies are not required.\n  It requires the States to initiate or join proceedings to terminate \nparental rights if a child has been in foster care for 12 of the most \nrecent 18 months.\n  The PASS Act strengthens the ``permanency plan'' for children in \nfoster care.\n  It requires criminal background checks for prospective foster care \nand adoptive parents and any other adults residing in the household and \nemployees of foster care institutions. The amendment specifies \ncircumstances when approval shall not be granted.\n  The PASS Act provides adoption incentive payments to the States to \nincrease the number of children which may total $6,000 per child.\n  It expands the number of child welfare demonstration projects.\n  The amendment also reauthorizes and expands the Family Preservation \nand Support Services program and includes reforms to this program.\n  It renames the program to the Promoting Adoptive, Safe, and Stable \nFamilies program.\n  Funding is increased by $50 million.\n  The amendment adds adoption promotion and time-limited family \nreunification services to the program.\n  It removes geographic barriers to adoption.\n  The PASS Act requires States to provide for health insurance coverage \nfor adopted children with special needs.\n  It continues eligibility for adoption assistance payments for \nchildren whose initial adoption has been disrupted.\n  It provides for an annual report on the State performance in \nprotecting children.\n  The PASS Act requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nrecommend to Congress a new incentive system based on State performance \nwithin 6 months.\n  The PASS Act once again calls upon our State partners to address the \nproblems of a system in much need of reform. This will be the first \nsignificant reform of the child welfare system since 1980.\n  We have enacted sweeping welfare reform and Medicaid reform \nlegislation.\n  We have created a new partnership with the States through the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. The PASS Act calls upon the States \nto channel their efforts to the child welfare system with the same \ncommitment, creativity, and innovation which led to last year's \nhistoric welfare reform legislation.\n  Last year we worked to free millions of families from the trap of \nwelfare dependency. Let us now work together to ensure that no children \nwill be left without the opportunity to be a part of a loving, safe, \nand stable family.\n  There are a number of Senators who deserve our special thanks and \nrecognition for their tireless efforts to bring this bipartisan bill to \nthe floor today.\n  Without naming them all, let me just thank them and congratulate them \nfor a job well done.\n  Mr. President, I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, at least half a million American \nchildren are living in this country's foster care system--a system that \nwas never designed and never intended to provide a permanent home for \nchildren who have been abused and neglected by their parents. \nTragically, many of these children could be adopted, but are forced to \nwait to become a part of a new family because the current child welfare \nsystem has become tired and broken. Most vulnerable among this already \nfragile population are those children with special needs--children who, \nwithout help and strong governmental support, will never have the \nopportunity to become a part of an adoptive family.\n  Acknowledging our collective obligation to let no child fall through \nthe cracks of the system--especially those facing severe emotional, \nphysical, and other circumstantial limitations--I am pleased to have \nthe opportunity to lend my vote and full support to the Promotion of \nAdoption Safety and Support for Abused and Neglected Children [PASS] \nAct. This legislation, the produce of a series of hard-fought and \nsometimes painful compromises, represents a positive first step in a \nlong journey of essential work to be done on behalf of abused and \nneglected children.\n  While many of us properly acknowledge that the journey is by no means \nover, we would not have been able to come this far had it not been for \nthe unflagging leadership of my good friends and colleagues Senators \nJohn Chafee and Larry Craig. They are the reason that this unique \nbipartisan coalition has been able to bring this bill forward. I would \nalso like to express my special thanks to the other hard-working \nmembers of the Senate adoption working group who have made this first \nstep possible: Senators Jeffords, DeWine, Coats, Bond, Landrieu, Levin, \nMoynihan, Kerrey, and Dorgan. Finally, I would like to acknowledge the \nwork of Senator Roth who has made it possible for this legislation to \nbe fairly considered here today.\n  The PASS Act will fundamentally and positively shift the focus of the \ncurrent foster care system by insisting, for the first time in Federal \nlaw, that a child's health and safety and the opportunity to find a \nloving, permanent home, should be the paramount considerations when a \nState child welfare agency makes any decision regarding the well-being \nof an abused and neglected child. The main objective of this bill is to \nmove abused and neglected kids into adoptive or other permanent homes \nand to do so more quickly and more safely than ever before.\n  While PASS appropriately preserves current Federal requirements to \nreunify families when that is best for the child and family, it does \nnot require the States to use ``reasonable efforts'' to reunify \nfamilies that have been irreparably broken by abandonment, torture, \nphysical abuse, murder, manslaughter, and sexual assault. Thanks to \nChairman Roth, the legislation includes a new fast track provision for \nsuch children in cases of severe abuse. Under the new provision, when \nreasonable efforts are not appropriate, a permanency planning hearing \nwould be held within 30 days. In practice, this change could yield \ntremendous results. For example, in the case of an abandoned infant \nwhere reasonable efforts are waived, a permanency hearing would be \nscheduled within the month, and that child could be moved swiftly into \na safe and permanent home. To provide balance, the PASS Act requires \nthat the States use the same ``reasonable efforts'' to move children \ntowards adoption or another permanent placement consistent with a well-\nthought out and well-monitored plan.\n  In addition, PASS encourages adoptions by rewarding States that \nincrease adoptions with bonuses for foster care and special needs \nchildren who are placed in adoptive homes. Most significantly, the \nlegislation takes the essential first step of ensuring ongoing health \ncoverage for all special needs children who are adopted. Without this \nessential health coverage, many families who want to adopt children \nwith a range of physical and mental health issues would be unable to do \nso. I am happy to see that medical coverage, which has always been a \nvital cornerstone of any program that substantively helps children, is \nalso a key component of this bipartisan package.\n  Ensuring safety for abused and neglected children is another \nsignificant goal of this legislation. PASS seeks to accomplish this \ngoal by ensuring that the ``safety of the child'' is considered at \nevery stage of the child's case plan and review process. Moreover, the \nbill requires criminal background checks for all potential foster and \nadoptive parents and other adults living in the same household.\n  PASS also cuts by one-third the time a child must wait to be legally \navailable for adoption into a permanent home by requiring States to \nfile a petition for termination of parental rights for a child who has \nbeen waiting too long in a foster care placement. At the same time that \nit speeds adoptions where appropriate, it also gives States the \ndiscretion to choose not to initiate legal proceedings when a child is \nsafely placed with a relative, where necessary services have not been \nprovided to the family, or where the State documents a compelling \nreason not go forward.\n  At the same time that this bill imposes tough but effective measures \nto decrease a child's unnecessary wait in\n\n[[Page S12200]]\n\nfoster care, PASS continues investments in strengthening families at \nthe community level by reauthorizing the 1993 budget provision for \nfamily preservation and family support for 3 years, with an extra $60 \nmillion in funding. This is an innovative prevention program, and this \nbill's new language encourages States to ensure that adoptive families \nare also served by the program. As part of a balanced bipartisan \npackage, these programs will support a range of fundamental State \nservices to help parents, children, adoptive families and to improve \nthe court system. This legislation also takes care to assure that \nchildren who have gone through adoptions that have been disrupted or \nwhose adoptive parents die will remain eligible for Federal support.\n  PASS provides a strong foundation for the work that is yet to be done \non behalf of abused and neglected children. Years ago, as chairman of \nthe National Commission on Children, I was proud to issue a bold, \nbipartisan report called Beyond Rhetoric. This report included bold \nrecommendations to reform our current, inadequate system to help abused \nand neglected children. I am committed to the agenda laid out in this \nplan and will keep working until we achieve all of its goals for \nchildren and families.\n  The PASS Act is a bold step forward. It has been extremely rewarding \nto forge such a strong bipartisan consensus to promote adoption and to \ntake key steps in helping every child find a safe, stable, and \npermanent home.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am gratified that Congress is today \npassing legislation to promote the adoption of children in foster care. \nThis legislation is not perfect, but it does clarify that it is in the \nbest interest of every child--regardless of his or her age, race or \nspecial need--to be raised by a family who will provide a safe, \npermanent, and nurturing home.\n  Congress should be unmistakably clear in expressing this judgment: \nFoster care children should not be returned to unfit, abusive parents; \nand the barriers that currently prevent the adoption of foster care \nchildren must be lifted. Believe me, Mr. President, there is no \nshortage of prospective parents. The National Council for Adoption \nestimates that 2 million couples are waiting to adopt a child. \nNonetheless, each year 15,000 children reach adulthood and leave the \nfoster care system without ever becoming part of a permanent home.\n  Because the current Federal law requires States to make reasonable \nefforts to reunite children with their biological parents, children \nhave tragically been returned to their abusive and sometimes murderous \nparents.\n  Under this adoption-foster care bill, States are not required to make \nreasonable efforts to reunite children with parents who have murdered \nanother child; committed a felony assault that results in serious \nbodily injury to a child; or who pose a serious risk to a child's life.\n  Foster care children who can never return safely home should not be \nleft to linger in the foster care system--which, after all, is supposed \nto be temporary. Instead, these children should be placed up for \nadoption, and the parental rights of abusive parents should be \nterminated so adoption can take place.\n  Let me be clear, parents who use reasonable discipline in rearing \ntheir children are not the parents who should have their rights \nterminated. This legislation includes language to ensure that \nreasonable discipline--such as reasonable spanking--is not \nmisinterpreted as an act of abuse. Therefore, no State agency or court \nshall disrupt a home where parents use reasonable discipline.\n  What we are talking about, Mr. President, are children who have been \ntaken out of their homes because they've been truly abused and \nneglected. But because of current Federal law, these children are not \nbeing placed up for adoption--but are growing up in foster care. The \nnumbers speak for themselves. There are more than half a million \nchildren currently living in foster care--an alarmingly high number \nwhich illustrates how the foster care system is in disarray.\n  Is it not the responsibility of our civilized society to ensure the \nsafety and well-being of these vulnerable children by promoting \nadoption? And shouldn't we provide couples willing to love and care for \nthese children the opportunity to do so? I believe the answer is \nclearly yes.\n\n\n                            Crisis Nurseries\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, the reauthorization of the Family \nPreservation and Support Act is important to families who are at risk \nor in crisis. One notable service now specifically mentioned in the act \nis the care provided by a crisis nursery. Crisis nurseries provide \nrespite and therapeutic services for families with young children to \nassist parents in attaining self-sufficiency. One crisis nursery in \nparticular, the relief nursery of Eugene, OR, is a model child abuse \nand prevention program. After involvement with the relief nursery, \nfewer than 9 percent of the 373 children served reported abuse, \nneglect, or domestic violence to the State child protection office. \nMoreover, 82 percent of children served by the relief nursery were \nliving safely with their parents at the end of the year, averting \nfoster care or other out-of-home placement. The relief nursery has \naccomplished these results through dedication to comprehensive family \nservices emphasizing programs that strengthen the parent-child \nrelationship. Does the Senator agree that crisis nurseries can play an \nimportant role in saving families?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Yes. Crisis nurseries help reduce child abuse \nincidents and, ultimately, reduce the necessity for foster care \nplacements. Crisis nurseries can save a family.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I think the relief nursery is a needed member of the \ncommunity, providing invaluable services to children who need them \nmost. Crisis nurseries work because they provide intensive, \npersonalized, and long-term services to families with children in the \nmost vulnerable age groups. I thank the Senator for recognizing the \nwork of nurseries, such as the relief nursery, in your bill.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I support the Promotion of \nAdoption, Safety and Support for Abused and Neglected Children [PASS] \nAct, as a commonsense approach to child welfare. Under the PASS Act, a \nState, for the first time, must make a child's health and safety the \nparamount consideration when making any decision regarding a foster \ncare or adoption placement.\n  It seems inconceivable that this is not currently the guiding \nprinciple behind every State's child welfare policy. The evolution of \nthe child welfare system, however, has left a patchwork of goals and \nrules that can jeopardize a child's well being.\n  The PASS Act will, for the first time, guarantee that every adopted \nchild with special needs will receive needed health care coverage from \nthe State. Previously, a child's eligibility for health care was tied \nto the ability of the birth parents to pay, even though the birth \nparents had given up all legal and economic ties to the child. There \nwas no consideration given to the ability of the adoptive, permanent \nparents to afford health care for the child.\n  Another example of the PASS Act's commonsense approach is the \nrequirement that States provide for criminal records and child abuse \nregistry checks of any prospective foster or adoptive parents, \nnoncustodial adults living in a foster or adoptive home, and employees \nof child care institutions. Choosing a safe and supportive home for a \nchild is not a simple task, but ensuring that the child is not placed \nwith someone convicted of a serious crime or child abuse must be a \nbasic requirement. This is not required under current law.\n  There are a number of other important provisions in this bill, \nincluding the reauthorization of the family preservation and family \nsupport program to strengthen families, and a system of rewards for \nStates that increase adoption placements. Taken as a whole, this bill \nis an important step forward in our efforts to improve child health and \nsafety.\n  The sponsors of this bill have worked diligently to forge bipartisan \ncompromise on this legislation. I commend them for their efforts and \ntheir success.\n  As with all compromise legislation, there are provisions in the PASS \nAct with which I do not necessarily agree. I am concerned that \ninsufficient efforts will be made to keep sound families together, that \nthe allowance of child welfare waivers will lead to inadequate Federal \noversight of child welfare in\n\n[[Page S12201]]\n\nthe States, and that funding must be increased in order to achieve a \npermanent solution to the problems plaguing our child welfare system.\n  While it is politically popular to withdraw Federal support and \noversight for programs and turn power over to the States, I firmly \nbelieve that we cannot abandon our Federal role in providing for the \nwelfare of the Nation's children. Whether we are talking about \nproviding access to early childhood education, repairing the Nation's \ncrumbling schools, or guaranteeing the health and safety of children in \nour foster care and adoption system, the Federal Government must \ncontinue to assist and oversee State efforts.\n  In the end, no child's welfare should be dependent on the generosity \nor failure of the foster care and adoption program in the State in \nwhich he or she was born. Commonsense requires that we continue to \nmarshal the Nation's resources to provide for the next generation of \nAmericans.\n  The PASS Act is an opportunity for Congress to assist States in \nproviding for those of America's children in need of foster care or \nadoption. By ensuring that the health and safety of the child are \nparamount, this legislation puts us on the track to making the foster \ncare and adoption system work for the children it is meant to serve. I \nthank my colleagues for their efforts and for their commitment to \ncommon sense, and urge the Senate to approve the PASS Act.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nestablishment of a national voluntary mutual reunion registry contained \nin section 205 of the Promotion of Adoption, Safety, and Support for \nAbused and Neglected Children [PASS] Act. This provision would permit \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services, at no net expense to the \nFederal Government, to facilitate the voluntary, mutually requested \nreunions of biological relatives who have been separated by adoption.\n  This registry is intended to help reunite the hundreds of thousands \nof adult adoptees, birth parents and siblings who are searching for \neach other. Currently, the search can be very costly, cumbersome, and \nfutile. The national registry would help many individuals who were \nseparated by adoption and are now searching for each other.\n  Some concerns have been raised that this provision would infringe an \nindividual's privacy, and that a national voluntary registry could \nresult in the inappropriate disclosure of private, sensitive \ninformation. This is completely inaccurate. I and the other sponsors of \nthis provision, along with the Finance Committee have worked tirelessly \nto ensure that all the necessary safeguards have been included in this \nprovision to ensure that an individual's personal privacy is not \nviolated in any manner.\n  Under the guidelines for the national voluntary registry established \nin this bill, one party could not search out another individual unless \nboth parties were searching for one another. All parties involved would \nhave to, on their own accord, voluntarily decide to search for each \nother and participate in the registry. This provision specifically \nrequires that the registry only contain information necessary to \nfacilitate a match, that the confidentiality of all consenting \nparticipants be protected and that no information be disclosed without \nprior, written consent from the individual.\n  Section 205 specifically requires that any computerized system \ncreated to implement this registry must not intrude on any existing \ndata systems at the Department of Health and Human Services and must \nutilize appropriate methods to protect the privacy of information \ncontained in the registry. In addition, it establishes criminal and \nfinancial penalties for potential abusers of the national registry.\n  Finally, the measure specifically states that this registry does not \npreempt any State laws relating to adoption and the confidentiality of \nadoption records.\n  Mr. President, this provision is not a mandate, has absolutely no \ncost to the Federal Government or taxpayers, and is completely \nvoluntarily. This important provision will help thousands of Americans \nwho want to learn about themselves and their biological history.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, in significant ways, the promotion of \nadoption, safety, and support for abused and neglected children \nrepresents an important step forward in Federal policy for child \nwelfare. It parallels Oregon's best interest of the child bill in its \nrecognition of the crucial importance of timely achievement of \npermanent family placements for children who must be temporarily placed \nin foster care. Further, it clarifies that a child's health and safety \nare paramount concerns in considerations of reasonable efforts for \nfamily preservation. The PASS Act also broadens support for adoptive \nplacement, increases post-adoption assistance for families, and \nemphasises the link between the child's welfare and parent's well-\nbeing. Moreover, the bill's intense interest in kinship care is both \nwise and timely. I am particularly concerned about this complex issue \nand I have devoted a lot of attention to it over the past several \nyears.\n  Kinship care, the full-time care and protection of children by a \nrelative, is in many cultures, a time honored tradition. Throughout \nhistory relatives have come forward to care for and raise children when \nthe parents were unable to do so themselves. Recently, the decision \nover whether relatives may best provide for children has increasingly \ninvolved child welfare agencies. Yet, Mr. President, our country does \nnot have a national policy to deal with relative care arrangements. In \nlight of this fact, the PASS Act makes significant strides toward \nrecognizing relative care arrangements for what they are--legitimate, \nappropriate placements--for a family. There is a precedent for this \nrecognition; last year I fought for language in the welfare reform bill \nrequiring that kinship care be considered first for children needing \nplacement.\n  I am pleased that many of the provisions I included in my kinship \ncare bill, S. 822, were incorporated in the PASS Act. One such \nprovision allows kinship providers an opportunity to be heard during \nabuse and neglect proceedings. I have heard from grandparents in Oregon \nwho tell me that they can add additional information that may be \nhelpful to the court's determination of the child's future living \narrangements, but often are not aware of their grandchild's placement \nin foster care or where they are in the system. It is important that \nrelative caregivers are notified when there are administrative \nproceedings on a child's status.\n  The inclusion of a kinship care advisory panel instructed to make \nrecommendations about kinship care policies is also included in this \nbill. Thankfully, relative caregivers and former foster children in \nrelative care arrangements will now be able to sit on a panel and \nexamine what is needed to improve these arrangements for all involved. \nThe panel's findings must be submitted in a comprehensive report to the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. The report will examine who \nkinship caregivers are, what services are provided to them and many \nother factors that will help us develop a national policy on this \ngrowing child welfare issue.\n  Another critical provision in the bill deals with standby \nguardianship. Many relative caregivers are caring for families \ndevastated by HIV/AIDS. In adoption or guardianship proceedings today, \ndying parents are asked to give up their custodial rights over their \nchildren in order to ensure a permanent, stable placement for their \nchild. Under this bill, any parent who is chronically ill or near death \nmay designate a standby guardian without being forced to surrender \ntheir parental rights. PASS encourages States who have not already \npassed standby guardianship laws to do so. As we seek to adequately \nsupport relative care providers caring for children, we must first ask \neducated questions and receive thorough answers. Ultimately, the PASS \nAct has made a good-faith effort to recognize and study the issue of \nkinship care. This is a good first step for children and families.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the substitute \namendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1614) was agreed to.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nconsidered read a third time and\n\n[[Page S12202]]\n\npassed, as amended, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating to the bill appear at the appropriate \nplace in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 867), as amended, was read a third time and passed.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the Senate, by this action, has just passed \na major reform in the foster care of this country, an issue that \nbipartisan Senators have gathered on over the last several months to \nresolve. Senator Roth, of the Finance Committee, in the last several \nweeks, working with Senator Rockefeller, Senator Chafee, myself, \nSenator Coats, and Senator DeWine have taken on an effort to reform \nfoster care in this country by the proposal of this legislation that we \nhave now gained the concurrence of the Senate on.\n  It is without question, in my opinion, a landmark piece of \nlegislation because what it does, for the first time, is use foster \ncare the way we intended it originally to be used. It ensures the \nsafety for abused and neglected children. It promotes adoption. It \naccelerates permanent placement. It offers to children of this country \nin need an opportunity for a loving and permanent home. And it \nincreases the accountability of reform.\n  I am extremely pleased that at this late hour we could finally bring \nabout a conclusion to this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12198-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12202-S12203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NATIONAL VOLUNTARY MUTUAL REUNION REGISTRY\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, once again the Senate has gone on record in \nsupport of a measure aimed at humanizing the process through which \nadult biological relatives separated by adoption, who are looking for \neach other, can make contact.\n  The passage of this Craig-Levin bill would not have been possible \nwithout the steadfast leadership of Senator Larry Craig. His \nsensitivity, his commitment, his compassion and his clear understanding \nof this issue has been enlightening to all of the Members of this body. \nLet me also thank Senator McCain and Senator Landrieu for their \ncommitment and bipartisan spirit throughout our discussions on this \nissue.\n  Mr. President, we are deeply touched by the difficulties experienced \nby adult adopted persons, birth parents, and separated siblings who, \noften for many years and at great expense, have been seeking one \nanother. Aside from the natural human desire to know one's roots and \ngenetic heritage, there are other important reasons why many birth \nrelatives seek to make contact with each other. Some are seeking a \ndeeper sense of identity, some need vital information which may affect \ntheir own mental and physical health and some are facing momentous \nfamily decisions that require more knowledge about their heritage; and \na substantial percentage of birth parents say they want to be available \nto the adult children many relinquished at birth, during a time of \nstress, should they also desire to make contact.\n  We believe that S. 1487, the National Voluntary Mutual Reunion \nRegistry, deals with these needs and emotions in a careful and \nsensitive way. The legislation permits the HHS Secretary, at no net \nexpense to the Federal Government, to facilitate the voluntary, \nmutually requested exchange of identifying information that has been \nmutually consented to in a signed notarized statement of identifying \ninformation by the birth parent, adult adoptee 21 years or older or \nadult siblings.\n  This legislation does not call for the unsealing of adoption records. \nCurrently, over half the States provide for voluntary and mutual \nreunion facilitation. However, State-based systems are restricted, by \nnature, to the geographic boundaries of the State. Since we are a \nmobile society, that limitation reduces the utility of State-based \nsystems. Adoptions are often started in one State but finalized in \nanother. Additionally, the adoptee, birth parent or siblings may be a \nresident of several different States during their lifetimes.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this legislation does not mandate, but simply \ngives the Secretary the discretion to facilitate voluntary, mutual \nreunions, if she so chooses.\n  I commend my colleagues in the Senate on the passage of this humane \nand much-needed legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be included in the Record again at this point.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, once again the Senate has gone on record in \nsupport of a measure aimed at humanizing the process through which \nadult biological relatives separated by adoption, who are looking for \neach other, can make contact.\n  The passage of this Craig-Levin bill would not have been possible \nwithout the steadfast leadership of Senator Larry Craig. His \nsensitivity, his commitment, his compassion and his clear understanding \nof this issue has been enlightening to all of the Members of this body. \nLet me also thank Senator McCain and Senator Landrieu for their \ncommitment and bipartisan spirit throughout our discussions on this \nissue.\n  Mr. President, we are deeply touched by the difficulties experienced \nby adult adopted persons, birth parents, and separated siblings who, \noften for many years and at great expense, have been seeking one \nanother. Aside from the natural human desire to know one's roots and \ngenetic heritage, there are other important reasons why many birth \nrelatives seek to make contact with each other. Some are seeking a \ndeeper sense of identity, some need vital information which may affect \ntheir own mental and physical health and some are facing momentous \nfamily decisions that require more knowledge about their heritage; and \na substantial percentage of birth parents say they want to be available \nto the adult children many relinquished at birth, during a time of \nstress, should they also desire to make contact.\n  We believe that S. 1487, the National Voluntary Mutual Reunion \nRegistry, deals with these needs and emotions in a careful and \nsensitive way. The legislation permits the HHS Secretary, at no net \nexpense to the Federal Government, to facilitate the voluntary, \nmutually requested exchange of identifying information that has been \nmutually consented to in a signed notarized statement of identifying \ninformation by the birth parent, adult adoptee 21 years or older or \nadult siblings.\n  This legislation does not call for the unsealing of adoption records. \nCurrently, over half the States provide for voluntary and mutual \nreunion facilitation. However, State-based systems are restricted, by \nnature, to the geographic boundaries of the State. Since we are a \nmobile society, that limitation reduces the utility of State-based \nsystems. Adoptions are often started in one State but finalized in \nanother. Additionally, the adoptee, birth parent or siblings may be a \nresident of several different States during their lifetimes.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this legislation does not mandate, but simply \ngives the Secretary the discretion to facilitate voluntary, mutual \nreunions, if she so chooses.\n  I commend my colleagues in the Senate on the passage of this humane \nand much-needed legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be included in the Record again at this point.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S12203]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12202-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                 PRIVATE RELIEF ACT OF BELINDA McGREGOR\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, these two bills will provide relief for \ntwo men who have fought with valor and honor for this country. H.R. \n2731 and H.R. 2732 will provide justice for two Americans by correcting \nthe date they became U.S. citizens.\n  One of these men, John Andre Chalot, resides in my home State of \nFlorida. Mr. Chalot, a retired postal worker living in Bradenton, FL, \nwas born in Le Havre, France, on December 19, 1919. He immigrated to \nthe United States with his parents in 1921. After being graduated from \nhigh school in 1939, he sought to enlist in the U.S. Army Air Corps. \nBecause he was considered too young to fly in the corps he moved to \nCanada, joined the Royal Canadian Air Force [RCAF], and received his \npilot wings. He flew Spitfires with the RCAF based in England from 1940 \nto 1943. While still in England, Mr. Chalot transferred to the U.S. \nArmy Corps, 358th fighter Squadron, and received a commission as second \nlieutenant. At the time of his commission in 1943, Mr. Chalot had \ncompleted the naturalization process to become a U.S. citizen. \nUnfortunately, our Government misplaced Mr. Chalot's naturalization \nforms somewhere in the process.\n  Early in 1944, while flying a routine P-51 mission over Germany, Mr. \nChalot's plane was fired upon and hit, causing him to crash-land in \nHolland. With the help of the Resistance, Mr. Chalot managed to get to \nParis, but in July 1944, he was betrayed by Gestapo agents and confined \nat Fresnes Prison.\n  In August 1944, Germans crowded Mr. Chalot and 168 Allied airmen into \nboxcars and transported them to Buchenwald concentration camp. There \nthey were confined in miserable, degrading, and inhumane conditions, \nforced to subsist on a starvation diet, and subjected to Nazi medical \nexperiments. In November 1944, Mr. Chalot and most of his fellow airmen \nwere transferred from Buchenwald to Luftstalag III, an infamous subcamp \nof Buchenwald, where they remained until their liberation at the end of \nthe war.\n\n[[Page S12204]]\n\n  After the war, Mr. Chalot returned to the United States, and was \nfinally naturalized as a U.S. citizen on September 18, 1945.\n  On September 20, 1996, he applied to the Foreign Claims Settlement \nCommission for compensation pursuant to the Agreement Between the \nUnited States and Germany Concerning Final Benefits To Certain United \nStates Nationals Who Were Victims of National Socialist Measures of \nPersecution.\n  On September 5, 1997, the Commission denied Mr. Chalot's claim on the \nground that he was not a U.S. citizen during his time as a Nazi \nprisoner of war and was, therefore, ineligible for compensation. H.R. \n2731 would modify the date Mr. Chalot became a U.S. citizen and make \nhim eligible for compensation under the Agreement Between the Federal \nRepublic of Germany and the United States of America.\n  The other bill, H.R. 2732, provides relief for Mr. Roy Desmond Moser, \na Massachusetts resident with an almost identical situation.\n  This legislation would make Mr. Chalot and Mr. Moser eligible for \ncompensation by deeming them to be naturalized U.S. citizens as of the \ndates they began their military service.\n  Mr. President, I believe that these two bills provide relief for two \ncourageous men who fought for our Nation during World War II. I hope my \ncolleagues understand the personal significance of these measures for \nthese two individuals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12203-6", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ASIAN ELEPHANT CONSERVATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, I rise today to make a brief statement \nregarding S. 1258, a bill I introduced on October 6, 1997. This \nlegislation will amend the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real \nProperty Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 to prohibit an alien not \nlawfully present in the United States from receiving assistance under \nthat act. The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works has \nreviewed this bill and approved it for Senate floor action.\n  My purpose in bringing this bill before the Senate is to address a \nloophole that was inadvertently created when immigration and welfare \nreform bills were recently enacted. In part, these bills were crafted \nto prevent illegal immigrants from entering the United States by \ndenying Federal taxpayer paid benefits to illegal aliens. Currently, \nillegal aliens are still eligible to receive relocation assistance. \nOften, this assistance turns out to be a significant sum of money.\n  This legislation was originally introduced in the other body \nfollowing an incident in California in which an illegal immigrant was \nawarded $12,000 because her legal status in this country made her \nineligible to be moved into section 8 housing. In other instances, \nrelocation assistance is being awarded to illegal aliens who then use \nthe money to buy homes in their countries of origin.\n  This legislation simply closes a loophole which was overlooked in \nprevious legislation and fully complies with the intent of Congress \nwhen it enacted immigration and welfare reform laws. I note that this \nlegislation will not affect foreign nationals residing in the\n\n[[Page S12208]]\n\nUnited States as legal residents or under the legal protection of a \nvalid visa. In addition, the bill provides Federal agencies the ability \nto waive the provisions of this act in case of an exceptional and \nextremely unusual hardship.\n  I have one technical amendment to bring the bill into conformance \nwith the legislation already passed by the other body. This amendment \ndoes not change the substance of the bill and I ask that it be \nconsidered with the bill. I have worked closely with the Senate \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works in bringing this bill to the \nfloor. I appreciate their support and the help of committee staff in \nmoving this legislation toward enactment.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering S. 1258, a \nbill introduced by Senator Bennett to amend the Uniform Relocation \nAssistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 to \nprohibit an alien who is not lawfully present in the United States from \nreceiving assistance under that act. The Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works unanimously approved this bill on Wednesday, October 29, \n1997.\n  S. 1258 includes several features, in addition to the general \nprovision prohibiting illegal aliens from receiving Federal assistance, \nto ensure that the act is carried out in a fair manner. In cases of \nextreme and unusual hardship, S. 1258 leaves it to the discretion of \nthe Department of Transportation to provide a waiver to the \nineligibility that is otherwise applicable. In addition, rights to \ncompensation that an illegal alien may have under other Federal or \nState laws are not affected.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that a letter from the Congressional \nBudget Office be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I encourage Senate adoption of this necessary measure.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                   Congressional Budget Office\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 3, 1997.\n     Hon. John H. Chafee,\n     Chairman, Committee on Environment and Public Works, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 1258, a bill to \n     amend the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property \n     Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 to prohibit an alien who is \n     not lawfully present in the United States from receiving \n     assistance under that Act.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contacts for this \n     estimate are Deborah Reis (for federal costs), who can be \n     reached at 226-2860, and Kristen Layman (for the state and \n     local impact), who can be reached at 225-3220.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        June E. O'Neill, Director.\n       Enclosure.\n\n\n               congressional budget office, cost estimate\n\n     S. 1258.--A bill to amend the Uniform Relocation Assistance \n         and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 to \n         prohibit an alien who is not lawfully present in the \n         United States from receiving assistance under that Act\n       CBO estimates that implementing S. 1258 would cost the \n     federal government less than $500,000 over the next year or \n     two, assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts. The \n     bill would not affect direct spending or receipts; therefore, \n     pay-as-you-go procedures would not apply. S. 1258 would \n     impose no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as \n     defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 and would \n     impose no significant costs on state, local, or tribal \n     governments.\n       S. 1258 would prevent persons who are not lawfully present \n     in the United States from receiving relocation payments or \n     other assistance when real property they occupy is acquired \n     by a federal agency or with federal financing. The bill would \n     require the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to \n     promulgate regulations within one year of enactment to \n     implement the new law, including rules for determining \n     whether a displaced person is lawfully present in the country \n     and standards for judging when exceptions should be made for \n     unusual hardship.

We expect that the bill would have little or no \n     effect on total property acquisition costs because so few \n     transactions are likely to involve aliens who reside \n     illegally in this country.\n       The bill would place a new requirement on state, local, and \n     in some circumstances, tribal entities carrying out programs \n     or projects with federal financial assistance that result in \n     the displacement of persons. As a condition of receiving such \n     assistance, the affected entities would have to determine \n     whether displaced persons are lawfully present in the United \n     States. Based on discussions with the U.S. Departments of \n     Transportation and Housing and Urban Development, the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service, and affected state \n     and local agencies, CBO estimates that the additional \n     administrative costs to state, local, and tribal governments \n     would be minimal.\n       On June 20, 1997, CBO prepared a cost estimate for H.R. \n     849, as ordered reported by the House Committee on \n     Transportation and Infrastructure on June 11, 1997.

Mr. President, Senator Bennett has an amendment at the \ndesk, and I ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho (Mr. Craig), for Mr. Bennett, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1617.\n\n       On page 2, line 3, strike ``(a)''.\n       On page 3, line 4, strike ``, under this Act,''.\n       On page 3, beginning on line 5, strike ``on the basis of \n     race, color, or national origin''.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to make a brief statement \nregarding S. 1258, a bill I introduced on October 6, 1997. This \nlegislation will amend the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real \nProperty Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 to prohibit an alien not \nlawfully present in the United States from receiving assistance under \nthat act. The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works has \nreviewed this bill and approved it for Senate floor action.\n  My purpose in bringing this bill before the Senate is to address a \nloophole that was inadvertently created when immigration and welfare \nreform bills were recently enacted. In part, these bills were crafted \nto prevent illegal immigrants from entering the United States by \ndenying Federal taxpayer paid benefits to illegal aliens. Currently, \nillegal aliens are still eligible to receive relocation assistance. \nOften, this assistance turns out to be a significant sum of money.\n  This legislation was originally introduced in the other body \nfollowing an incident in California in which an illegal immigrant was \nawarded $12,000 because her legal status in this country made her \nineligible to be moved into section 8 housing. In other instances, \nrelocation assistance is being awarded to illegal aliens who then use \nthe money to buy homes in their countries of origin.\n  This legislation simply closes a loophole which was overlooked in \nprevious legislation and fully complies with the intent of Congress \nwhen it enacted immigration and welfare reform laws. I note that this \nlegislation will not affect foreign nationals residing in the\n\n[[Page S12208]]\n\nUnited States as legal residents or under the legal protection of a \nvalid visa. In addition, the bill provides Federal agencies the ability \nto waive the provisions of this act in case of an exceptional and \nextremely unusual hardship.\n  I have one technical amendment to bring the bill into conformance \nwith the legislation already passed by the other body. This amendment \ndoes not change the substance of the bill and I ask that it be \nconsidered with the bill. I have worked closely with the Senate \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works in bringing this bill to the \nfloor. I appreciate their support and the help of committee staff in \nmoving this legislation toward enactment.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering S. 1258, a \nbill introduced by Senator Bennett to amend the Uniform Relocation \nAssistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970 to \nprohibit an alien who is not lawfully present in the United States from \nreceiving assistance under that act. The Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works unanimously approved this bill on Wednesday, October 29, \n1997.\n  S. 1258 includes several features, in addition to the general \nprovision prohibiting illegal aliens from receiving Federal assistance, \nto ensure that the act is carried out in a fair manner. In cases of \nextreme and unusual hardship, S. 1258 leaves it to the discretion of \nthe Department of Transportation to provide a waiver to the \nineligibility that is otherwise applicable. In addition, rights to \ncompensation that an illegal alien may have under other Federal or \nState laws are not affected.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that a letter from the Congressional \nBudget Office be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I encourage Senate adoption of this necessary measure.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                   Congressional Budget Office\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 3, 1997.\n     Hon.

Hurtgen, of Florida, to be a Member of the \n     National Labor Relations Board for the term of five years \n     expiring August 27, 2001.\n       Wilma B. Liebman, of the District of Columbia, to be a \n     Member of the National Labor Relations Board for the \n     remainder of the term expiring December 16, 1997.\n       Wilma B. Liebman, of the District of Columbia, to be a \n     Member of the National Labor Relations Board for the term of \n     five years expiring December 16, 2002.\n       Joseph Robert Brame, III, of Virginia, to be a Member of \n     the National Labor Relations Board for the term of five years \n     expiring August 27, 2000.\n       Sarah McCracken Fox, of New York, to be a Member of the \n     National Labor Relations Board for the term of five years \n     expiring December 16, 1999.\n\n\n                     national labor relations board\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the long impasse over the membership of \nthe National Labor Relations Board is finally broken. For the first \ntime since August 1995, the Board will have a full complement of five \nconfirmed members. As a result, the Board will have additional \nresources to handle the many important cases on its docket. There will \nbe greater certainly in industrial relations, which is good for labor, \ngood for management, and good for the country.\n  The nominees to be confirmed represent a balanced and fair package. \nThe two Republican nominees, Peter Huertgen of Miami and J. Robert Bram \nIII of Charlottesville, VA, are distinguished management lawyers, with \nmany years of experience in Federal court in the NLRB litigation, and I \nknow they will make a significant contribution as members of that \nBoard.\n  There are also two Democratic nominees, Wilma Liebman and Sarah Fox, \nboth of Washington, DC. Ms. Liebman has served as Deputy Director of \nthe Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service since 1994, and she has \ndone an outstanding job. She helped to resolve dozens of disputes \nbetween labor and management, and worked effectively to administer the \noperations of the FMCS. Ms. Liebman also has extensive experience \nrepresenting labor unions and their members. She brings a wealth of \nknowledge of labor-management relations to this position. and I am \nconfident she will serve with great distinction on the Board.\n  I am particularly pleased that the Senate will finally confirm the \nnomination of Sarah Fox, who is well known to many of us in the Senate. \nFrom 1990 until January 1996, she served as counsel on the Labor \nCommittee staff, and she did an extraordinary job on issues of vital \nimportance to working families, especially in areas such as job safety \nand health, pension rights, fair wages, and reform of job training \nprograms and the Davis-Bacon Act. She worked well with Senators on both \nsides of the aisle, and has been serving as a recess appointee on the \nBoard. I have great respect to Sarah's ability an commitment to public \nservice, and I'm delighted by her confirmation.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nconsider the following nominations on the Executive Calendar. Calendar \nitems 180, 181, 248, 252, 332, 375, 384, 455, 457, 464, 467, 468, 469 \nthrough 483 and all other military nominations reported by the Armed \nServices Committee today.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that the nominations be confirmed, \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, any statements \nrelating to the nominations be printed in the Record, the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's actions, and the Senate return to \nlegislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to express my strong support \nfor legislation we considered this evening, the Promotion of Adoption, \nSafety, and Support for Abused and Neglected Children, the so-called \nPASS Act. This bill, which I introduced along with Senators Craig, \nRockefeller, DeWine, Coats, Jeffords, and others, will make some \ncritical changes to the child welfare system, changes which will vastly \nimprove the lives of hundreds of thousands of children currently in \nfoster care and waiting for adoptive homes.\n  We have been working on this legislation for the past year, and I am \nvery pleased we were able to work out a proposal that everyone could \nsupport. The primary goal of this so-called PASS Act is to ensure that \nabused and neglected children are in safe, permanent settings. About a \nhalf a million children who have been abused or neglected currently \nlive outside their homes, either in foster care or with relatives. In \nRhode Island, there are nearly 1,500 children who have been removed \nfrom their homes and are in foster care. Many of these children will be \nable to return to their parents, but others will not.\n  Under the current system, children remain in foster care an average \nof 3 years. Mr. President, I call to your attention and that of \neveryone who may be interested in this subject, a child in foster care \non the average remains there 3 years before any decision is\n\n[[Page S12211]]\n\nmade about that child's future. And in some cases the wait is even \nlonger. It is time we put a stop to this, and our bill does that.\n  The PASS Act directs States to shorten this time, all the while \nensuring that the child's health and safety are guaranteed. Our bill \nremoves unnecessary geographic barriers to adoption, and requires \ncriminal record checks for all prospective foster and adoptive parents, \nand other adults living in the household. It allows children to be \nfreed for adoption more quickly in extreme cases, such as when the \nparents have murdered another child, and requires States to document \nefforts to move children into safe adoptive homes.\n  The PASS Act also contains some important provisions that will go a \nlong way toward helping to find homes for so-called special needs \nchildren. Lack of medical coverage is a huge barrier to families who \nwant to adopt special needs children. Many of these children have \nsignificant physical and mental health problems due to years of abuse, \nneglect, or foster care. Parents who adopt these children are taking \nhuge financial risks. If these children are not guaranteed health \ninsurance, there will be great reluctance in many cases for the \nprospective parents to adopt these children. Our bill ensures that \nspecial needs children who are going to be adopted will have medical \ncoverage. We also ensure that children whose adopted parents die, or \nwhose adoptions are disrupted in some fashion, will continue to receive \nFederal subsidies when they are adopted by new parents.\n  Finally, our bill reauthorizes and provides a modest increase for the \nFamily Preservation and Support Program, which is a worthwhile program \nthat prevents children from having to be removed from their homes.\n  This is a good bill. The sponsors have worked long and hard to come \nup with this compromise. We have talked with the House about the minor \ndifferences between our bills and it appears we will be able to quickly \nconference and pass this bill, hopefully before the Senate goes out \nthis year.\n  In closing, let me thank and congratulate the Members of the PASS \ncoalition who worked so tirelessly on the measure. Senators Craig, \nRockefeller, DeWine, Coats, Jeffords, and others have made enormous \ncontributions toward this initiative. This would not have happened \nwithout their dedication to the children who we are trying to move from \nfoster care into adoptive homes.\n  I also thank Chairman Roth of the Finance Committee for helping us to \nmove quickly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I also want to congratulate this body \nfor the passage of the adoption bill. It is a good step forward. I hope \nwhen we work out the differences between the House and Senate, they can \nbe worked out amicably. I hope there is not a watering down of the \nSenate provisions.\n  I would also like to have legislation passed yet this year. If it \ncan't be worked out that way, obviously it is going to have to be put \noff until next year until it can be conferenced, but I hope we can work \nout these differences yet this year.\n  A pioneer in the adoption field wrote ``when a child of the streets \nstands before you in rags, with tear-stained face, you cannot easily \nforget him, and yet you are perplexed what to do. The human soul is \ndifficult to interfere with. You hesitate how far you should go.''\n  Congress has been considering adoption and foster care reform this \nyear that has caused all of us involved to ask, how far should we go?'' \nBut after extensive research into the failure of the foster care \nsystem, I ask how far can we go?\n  Confronting the issues for children in foster care is uncomfortable--\nalmost painful. But the foster care system is in crisis and children \nare suffering. We are compelled to confront these problems.\n  Foster care is a complicated entitlement program. Meaningful reform \ncan only happen when Congress recognizes the seriousness of the problem \nand begins taking the measured steps toward reform.\n  While the issues are complex, so are the solutions.\n  Today we are getting what we pay for, long-term foster care. Twenty-\none States are under consent decrees because they failed to take proper \ncare of their children who had been abused or neglected by their \nparents.\n  Set up to serve as a temporary, emergency situation for children, the \nfoster care system is now a lifestyle for many kids.\n  The Federal Government continues to pour billions of dollars into a \nsystem that lacks genuine accountability.\n  Instead of encouraging States to increase adoptions, the current \nsystem rewards long-term foster care arrangements.\n  Jennifer Toth described in her book ``Orphans of the Living,'' \nchildren are ``consigned to the substitute child care system, a \nchaotic, prison-like system intended to raise children whose parents \nand relatives cannot or will not care for them.''\n  She also wrote, ``the children in substitute child care today have \nall suffered trauma. They are all at greater risk than the general \nchild population. Yet they are given less care, when they need more \ncare. Many thousands of children are lost and millions of dollars are \nwasted each year because no one--not the caseworker, not the foster \nhome--takes full responsibility for them. Instead, each is passed from \none caseload and placement to another, with too many kids and too \nlittle attention to go around. When these children look to adults for \nhelp, no one is there. Only when their situation becomes desperate, \nwhen they also fail, are they awarded the attention they crave.''\n\n  One organization said that ``foster care has been a black hole for \nmany of America's neediest and most neglected children.''\n  ``I have a poster in my office that inspires me to work for real \nreform. The Iowa Citizen Foster Care Review Board asked children who \nwere waiting to be adopted what they would like to tell us and this is \nwhat the children said: ``Don't leave us in foster care so long.'' ``It \nis scary to move from home to home, find us one good family where we \ncan feel like a real member of the family.'' ``Check on us frequently \nwhile we're in foster care to ask us how we're doing and make sure we \nare safe.'' ``Tell us what's going on so we don't have to guess. Tell \nus how long it will be before we're adopted and why things seem to take \nso long.''\n  Dave Thomas of Wendy's challenged me and others to make sure kids \nhave a happy childhood. For those who have had a happy childhood it is \nhard to understand why. For those who did not have a happy childhood--\nyou know why, he said.\n  Children need to know that they have a permanency--which means \nsuccessful, healthy reunification with their birth families or \npermanency in an adoptive home.\n  My wife, Barbara, and I, have been blessed as the parents of five \nchildren. Today, we get to watch our sons and daughters enjoy their own \nfamilies and the happiness found through parenthood. These experiences \nhave made me appreciate the importance of a family unit. A happy, \npermanent home life provides more than a safe haven for kids. It gives \nchildren confidence to grow into positive contributors in our society.\n  In the United States, at least a half million children are not living \nin permanent homes. While waiting for adoption or a safe return to \ntheir natural families, many kids may live out their childhoods in the \nfoster care system. Sadly, it often turns into a lonely, even futile \ntransition. If the ``window of opportunity'' is missed, a child can \nleave the system a legal orphan, as an adult.\n  These children leave foster care and enter onto the welfare rolls or \ninto prison. Only 17 percent of those who emancipate from the system \nbecome completely self-supporting. Barely half finish high school, a \nlittle less than half are gainfully employed as adults. And, almost 60 \npercent of the girls give birth within a few years of leaving the \nsystem.\n  Since 1982, about 20,000 children a year are adopted from foster \ncare. Obviously, that leaves tens of thousands of kids in limbo every \nyear.\n  Reform is needed to help place more children in a safe, permanent \nhome. Improvements should limit the time a child legally can spend in \nfoster care;\n\n[[Page S12212]]\n\nremove financial incentives to keep kids in foster care; and, provide \nincentives for successful family reunifications or adoptions, not \nattempts.\n  More needs to be done to dispel the myth that some kids are \nunadoptable. I say that no child is unadoptable, we just havent't found \na home for them yet. And, most children want the permanency provided \nthrough adoption.\n  I support the promotion of adoption, safety, and support for the \nAbused and Neglected Children Act, or Pass Act, because it takes the \ninitial, necessary steps toward real reform.\n  For the first time, in 17 years, this body has strived to address the \npain and suffering of these children. A cornerstone is laid upon which \nfuture reforms can be built.\n  The Pass Act will ensure health care coverage for adopted special \nneeds children; break down geographic restrictions facing adoptive \nfamilies; and, encourage creative adoptive efforts and outreach.\n  Thanks to Senator DeWine's vision and efforts we have strengthened \nthe reasonable efforts statute. Senator DeWine raised our awareness on \nthis issue and has been a champion for these children.\n  One of the problems we as legislators have experienced has been the \ninadequate statistics to understand the performance of the States. The \ndata is sparse and many States can't tell us how many children they \nactually have in their care or how long they have been there. The Pass \nAct will require States to report critical statistics. No longer will \nchildren languish without being identified, their lives will be \npersonalized to those responsible for them. We will know who they are, \nwhere they are, and how long they have been in the system. And, the \nstatus quo will not be able to hide behind the lack of information \nexcuse.\n  Currently, the Federal Government does not require that States \nactively seek adoptive homes for all free-to-be-adopted children, who \noften are assigned to long-term foster care. This bill, however, will \ncompel States to make reasonable efforts to place a child in an \nadoptive home. Long-term foster care should never be a solution for a \nchild.\n  The Federal Government plays a significant role in child welfare, by \nproviding funds to States and attaching conditions to these funds. The \nsingle largest category of Federal expenditure under the child welfare \nprograms is for maintaining low-income children in foster care.\n  To receive Federal funds, States must comply with requirements \ndesigned so that children can remain safely with their families or \nreturn home after they have been placed in foster care. States will be \npenalized for not complying with the Pass Act.\n  In most States, children are being denied permanency because of the \nartificial barrier of geography. The Senate bill contains a provision \nthat will break down the geographic barriers to adoption.\n  An adoption organization in a northeastern State shared with me a \nreal life example of why this provision is necessary.\n  Allison, Beth, Jimmy, and Jarod are siblings, ages 6, 8, 10, and 11. \nThey were freed for adoption in October 1996.\n  Because the siblings had regular visits and a close relationship with \neach other, their caseworker hoped to find a family that could adopt \nall four children. Our agency was able to send the caseworker the home \nstudies of four out-of-State families who were interested in, and had \nspace to adopt, all four children. However, the State child welfare \nagency pressured the worker to select in-State families for the \nchildren.\n  Over a period of 6 months, there were no appropriate in-State \nfamilies who could adopt all four children, so it was decided to split \nthe sibling group. Jimmy and Jarod were placed with one family, and a \ndifferent family has been identified for Allison and Beth.\n  It is the intent of this legislation to remove the geographic \nbarriers that keep children from appropriate adoptive families.\n  I recognize the Members for their efforts on this issue and \ncongratulate the authors of this monumental piece of legislation.\n  They understood the complexity of this issue and pushed for reform. \nIt was a very unique coalition, and I was glad to be part of it.\n  Under Senator Craig's leadership, a successful consensus was formed \nand bipartisan, incremental steps were taken.\n  Senator Roth was also instrumental in forging an agreement with \nMembers so that this bill could pass with an overwhelming majority. His \nguidance and insight were critical to the bill's success.\n  Today we begin to change the culture surrounding adoption. Children \ndeserve permanent homes. All children are valuable and adoptable.\n  I have been impressed by the compassion of those who adopt these \nspecial children. They are gifted and should inspire us all.\n  We know that more families are willing to adopt children, including \nthose with the most challenging of circumstances.\n  We have always had a class of children considered unadoptable.\n  Several decades ago many said that minority children were \nunadoptable. We know now that is not true.\n  Many once thought that children with AIDS were unadoptable. We know \nnow that is not true.\n  Adoption organizations are finding homes for children and have \nwaiting lists of parents all over the country anxious to adopt children \ndespite their special circumstances. One adoption agency has a waiting \nlist of a hundred families, willing to adopt a child with Down's \nsyndrome.\n  A family in Texas adopted 8 drug-exposed siblings ranging in age from \n2 to 10.\n  Susan Badeau, a witness before the Senate Finance Committee, shared \nher story about adopting 19 children out of the foster care system--\nvirtually rescuing them from a lifetime in foster care.\n  The Pass Act will encourage permanency for the children who cannot \nreturn to their original homes.\n  To ensure that these new adoptive families are healthy and stay \ntogether they will need postadoption services and respite care.\n  Postadoptive services are crucial for the success of these families \nbecause many of these children will have long-term service needs.\n  In States where postadoption services are offered, the number of \nadoptive families that disrupt is significantly lower.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service the following Federal \nprograms could be used to provide postadoption services to adoptive \nfamilies. Although none of these programs is exclusively intended to \nprovide such services, they are among a number of allowable activities. \nThey include the following: The Adoption Opportunities Program; the \nFamily Preservation Program; Child Welfare Services; Child Abuse \nPrevention and Treatment Act; Community-Based Family Resource and \nSupport; Child Care and Development Block Grant; and the Social \nServices Block Grant.\n  I was pleased with the provision in the Pass Act which emphasizes \nadoption promotion and support services in the Family Preservation and \nSupport Service Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an explanation of the \nservices provided under these programs.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       1. The Adoption Opportunities Program authorizes \n     appropriations for the Department of Health and Human \n     Services to conduct a number of adoption-related activities, \n     including provision of post-legal adoption services for \n     families that have adopted special needs children. These \n     services may be provided either directly or by grant or \n     contract with States, local governments, public or private \n     nonprofit licensed child welfare or adoption agencies, or \n     adoptive family groups. Services must supplement, and not \n     supplant, activities funded through other sources with the \n     same general purpose, including individual, group or family \n     counseling, case management, training, assistance to adoptive \n     parent organizations, and assistance to support groups for \n     adoptive parents, adopted children or siblings of adopted \n     children.\n       2. Family Preservation Program. The Social Security Act \n     authorizes entitlement grants to States, which are used for \n     two types of services: family preservation, and community-\n     based family support. ``Family preservation'' services are \n     intended for children and families (including adoptive \n     families) that are at risk or in crisis, and may include \n     respite care of children to provide temporary relief for \n     parents or other care givers,\n\n[[Page S12213]]\n\n     and services designed to improve parenting skills in such \n     areas as child development, family budgeting, coping with \n     stress, health and nutrition.\n       3. Child Welfare Services. Under subpart 1 of title IV-B, \n     the Social Security Act also authorizes appropriations for \n     grants to states for child welfare services, which are \n     defined broadly to include public social services directed \n     toward protection and promotion of the welfare of children. \n     These funds are typically used to support State children \n     protective service and child welfare systems. However, while \n     post-adoption services are not specifically identified in the \n     statute, they could be allowable activities at State option.\n       4. Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. Title I of the \n     Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) authorizes \n     funds for HHS to conduct a variety of discretionary \n     activities, including grants to mutual support and self-help \n     groups for strengthening families, respite and crisis nursery \n     programs provided by community-based organizations, and \n     hospital-based information and referral services for parents \n     of children with disabilities and children who have been \n     victims of abuse or neglect.\n       5. Community-Based Family Resource and Support. Title II of \n     CAPTA authorizes HHS to make grants to Stats to develop, \n     operate, and expand statewide networks of community-based \n     family resource and support programs. These programs provide \n     various forms of support for families, including respite care \n     for adoptive families.\n       6. Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG). This \n     program authorizes both discretionary and mandatory funding \n     for States to help subsidize the cost of child care for low-\n     income families, including both working families and families \n     receiving welfare. Adoptive families in need of child care \n     could potentially receive assistance under this program, \n     assuming they met income and other eligibility criteria.\n       7. Social Services Block Grant (SSBG). Title XX of the \n     Social Security Act authorizes entitlement grants to States \n     that may be used for a wide variety of social services at the \n     states' discretion. Although services for adoptive families \n     are not specified in the law, States could opt to use SSBG \n     funds for this purpose.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, let's build upon the cornerstone of this \nmonumental bill. Congress has a chance to continue to press on for \nmeaningful reform. In spite of this legislation, some children will \nstill remain hostages in an inefficient system.\n  Any future reforms must: First, strive to dramatically limit the time \na child can legally spend in foster care. According to the available \nstatistics, the national average length of stay in foster care is three \nyears--three birthdays, three christmases, first, second and third \ngrade. Second, remove financial incentives to keep children in foster \ncare; and provide incentives for success not for attempts. Currently \nthe system pays the same rate per child per month without limitation. \nThe Federal Government is entitled to pay for performance.\n  Senator Brownback plans to hold hearings next year as chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Oversight of the District of Columbia to determine what \nthe Federal Government can do to address the crumbling foster care \nsystem in the District.\n  These children are the most vulnerable of all--their little lives \nbegin with abuse and neglect by their own parents and, for many, they \nexperience systemic abuse by languishing in long term foster care.\n  CRS stated that ``children are vulnerable and their well-being is \naffected by conditions beyond their control.'' But is not beyond our \ncontrol.\n  Those on the front lines, on whom we rely to make this policy work \ninclude: the court appointed special advocates, volunteers who advocate \nin the courts on the children's behalf; juvenile judges--an Illinois \njudge told me she requires each of the children's pictures to be \nattached to the front of their files so that those who come in contact \nwith the case know that these are children, not a caseload number; the \nfoster and adoptive parent associations; the citizen foster care review \nboards; special needs adoption organizations, Governors, the human \nservices departments and social workers.\n  We are all responsible for these children who depend on us. Foster \ncare is a poor parent. A loving, committed family is the best gift to \ngive any child. Passage of this bill is one way to encourage this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Alabama \nwill be recognized for however much time he may consume.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  First, I would like to say how much I appreciate the excellent \ncomments of the Senator from Iowa, Senator Grassley. He believes deeply \nin improving the life and health of children, as you do, Mr. President, \nand have worked toward that end.\n  I salute the work that has been done. It is a major step forward in \nimproving foster care and the ability to adopt children in America, \nwhich is something this Congress, I think, will be able to take real \npride in.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12210-5", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12213-S12214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CLAY COUNTY VETERANS MEMORIAL PARK DEDICATION\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise this evening to speak about a \ndedication ceremony that will take place tomorrow afternoon in the city \nof Lineville in Clay County, AL. Mr. President, I would first like to \ntake this opportunity to express my deep regret for not having been \nable to be in Lineville this afternoon with those who have gathered for \nthe dedication of the Clay County Veterans Memorial Park. I would be \nremiss if I did not also take this opportunity to offer my sincerest \nthanks to Alabama State Senator Gerald Dial and the other members of \nthe Veterans Memorial Board for working hard to make the Clay County \nVeterans Memorial Park a reality and for extending an invitation to me \nto participate in their dedication ceremony.\n  Mr. President, I make these remarks tonight for one reason. Simply, \nIt is about honor. Certainly, not personal honor. That is one variety \nwe are all familiar with. No, the type of honor to which I am referring \nis the uncommon variety. It is the variety that we bestow as a tribute \non special occasions for veterans and other heros in our society who \nmade the supreme sacrifice.\n  In less than 24 hours, my constituents will gather to honor all the \nmen and women who, over the years, left their homes and loved ones, \ntheir jobs, friends and neighbors all over Clay County to answer a \nspecial calling. The veterans they honor might have grown up in Delta, \nin Ashland, in Cragford, in Hollins, in Millerville, in Barfield, in \nLineville or anywhere in between, but even though they may have been \nseparated by the miles and the years between them, a common thread ran \nthrough each of their lives. They were all connected by their love for \nthis land and this country.\n  We should take a moment to reflect on that for a minute--connected by \na distinguishable act of love of country and a willingness to serve \nthat country where ever it directed. Hence, Mr. President, I stand here \ntonight to join them in paying homage, to show our respect, and our \nsincerest appreciation for the sacrifices that these patriots made for \nour country. Sacrifices that ensured the freedom you and I enjoy today \nand our children's children will enjoy years from now. With the \ndedication of this memorial park they are simply saying thank you to \nall those who have gone before, those who believed enough in freedom to \nrisk their lives.\n  In commemorating the memory of these friends and loved ones, we are \nreflecting on a glorious past, but we are also pausing, I think, for a \nmoment to look forward in time with a hopeful spirit and a pledge of \nunwavering support to the young men and women in communities all around \nthis great Nation that we will unconditionally support them just as we \nsupported those we honor today.\n  The Clay County Veterans Memorial Park will be as much an emblem of \nthe courageous spirit and bravery of patriots from yesteryear, as it \nwill be a beacon of hope and source of strength for future generations. \nI pledge to do my part to make sure that we remain the strongest and \ngreatest country in the world, and we defend our just national \ninterest.\n  Mr. President, ours is both an important and a unique moment in \nhistory. We no longer live in the bipolar world that shaped our lives \nand our political consciousness over the last half century. The \nmonolithic presence of the Soviet Union has been replaced by new \nthreats. We live in a rapidly changing world where our ability to adapt \nand our commitment to remain a world leader will be tested by both the \ncunning and the strong. The veterans being honored today defeated Nazi \nFascism, brought Soviet Communism to its knees, were victorious against \ntyranny, and protected democracy and\n\n[[Page S12214]]\n\nfreedom around the world. They led our country through times of \nconflict and war to the edge of the 21st century.\n  Had I been able to be with my constituents today, I would have \nreminded them that as our Nation moves forward we will face new \nnational defense considerations. We must maintain a strong military, \nand I will give my full support to our men and women in uniform. The \nmilitary must, I believe, be capable of protecting our interests and \nthe lives of our soldiers in places like Bosnia, Korea, and the Middle \nEast when asked to do so. We must therefore provide our service men and \nwomen with the best training, the best equipment, the best information, \nand the best overall opportunity for success under any circumstance, so \nthat when they are called to perform, they will emerge victorious.\n  We have approached a time of major historical significance in the \narea of foreign policy and international cooperation. We have new and \nexciting opportunities to promote peace and prosperity throughout the \nworld that many of us may never have thought possible. The winds of \ndemocracy and economic prosperity now blow in Eastern Europe precisely \nbecause of the sacrifices of those being honored today. Mr. President, \npatriots from Clay County, AL fought and died to make this prosperity \npossible. The overwhelming desire on the part of counties around the \nworld to emulate us--to be like America is a testament to our proud \npast and an example of fairness that is the hallmark of our society.\n  We are, I truly believe, standing on the brink of a change of \nhistoric proportions. It represents a step forward for peace and \ncooperation that will surely carry us well into the 21st century. We \nmust always remember those who made this possible. I am reminded of a \nquote by Gen. Douglas MacArthur on April 19, 1951, as he spoke before \nCongress. He said that, ``Old soldiers never die, they just fade \naway.'' Tomorrow will be a great day for Clay County. Memorial Park is \nfor the veterans, living and dead, who fought so that freedom, our \nfreedom, would never perish. It also represents that community's \ncommitment to a memory of sacrifices made, and promises kept.\n  Mr. President, I thank the citizens of Clay County for their \nindividual sacrifices, and hope that they will find solace in this \nplace they gather to dedicate today. It is also my hope that they will \nfind solace in the knowledge that their sacrifices are honorable too, \nand as lasting and worthy as the sacrifices of those who have gone on \nbefore them.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/08/senate-section/article/S12213-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 1 P.M.
