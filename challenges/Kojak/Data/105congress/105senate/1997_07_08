It was just about 1 year ago, Mr. President, last June, \nwhen I stood here on the Senate floor with the senior Senator from \nArizona, Senator McCain, and others, and participated in a somewhat \nabbreviated debate on the need for meaningful, bipartisan campaign \nreform.\n  We discussed several issues during that debate, Mr. President. We \ntalked about the 1994 elections and the resulting record amount of \ncampaign spending in that election.\n  We had a chance to talk briefly about how one candidate for the U.S. \nSenate had spent $30 million of his own money to try and win a \nCalifornia Senate seat.\n  We talked about how the average amount of money spent by a winning \n1994 Senate candidate had, unfortunately, reached over $4.6 million. We \ntalked about the damaging effect that the unabated flow of campaign \ncash had on our political system as well as on the public perceptions \nof this institution.\n  In response to all of that, interestingly, we were told by opponents \nof reform that all was well, that spiraling campaign spending would \nsomehow strengthen our democracy, and that our system was far from \ncrying out for reform.\n  And then, on a quiet Tuesday afternoon, after a few paltry hours of \ndebate\n\n[[Page S6956]]\n\nand absolutely no opportunity for Senators to offer amendments, the \nbipartisan McCain-Feingold reform bill fell six votes short of breaking \na filibuster, and that was done effectively by the guardians of the \nstatus quo.\n  That was a year ago, Mr. President. Although our opponents continue \nto proclaim that all is well and reform is not a priority, the evidence \nfrom the 1996 campaign stands in stark contrast to the declarations of \nthose who are trying to defend the indefensible.\n  Last year, according to the Washington Post, candidates and parties \nspent a record amount of money on Federal elections--$2.7 billion. Mr. \nPresident, $2.7 billion was spent on those elections, which is an all-\ntime record. This record amount of campaign spending, I assume, is \nexactly what the opponents of reform, including the Speaker of the \nother body and the junior Senator from Kentucky had really hoped would \nhappen.\n  Recall Speaker Gingrich's words from the last Congress:\n\n       One of the greatest myths in modern politics is that \n     campaigns are too expensive. The political process, in fact, \n     is not overfunded, but underfunded.\n\n  My distinguished colleague from Kentucky, referring to the 1996 \nelection said:\n\n       I look on all that election activity as a healthy sign of a \n     vibrant democracy.\n\n  Well, Mr. President, back here on planet Earth, and back home in my \nState of Wisconsin, the American people have a very different view. \nThey are disgusted by our current campaign finance system. They are \nappalled at the insane amount of money that is being spent on \ndemocratic elections. And not surprisingly, they told us how appalled \nthey are by staying home in huge numbers last November. In fact, fewer \nAmericans turned out to vote in 1996 than in any Presidential election \nyear in the last 72 years.\n  There are mountains of evidence demonstrating the failure of current \nelection laws. Poll after poll demonstrates the mistrust and cynicism \nthe public feels toward this institution as a result of large campaign \ncontributions.\n  The newspapers and nightly news programs are brimming with reports of \nelection scandals, with charges and countercharges of abuse and \nillegality filling the headlines every day.\n  Scores of candidates--including many current officeholders--are \nchoosing not to run for office principally because of the millions of \ndollars needed for a campaign for the U.S. Senate. In fact, the theory \nthat unlimited campaign spending produces competitive elections has \nbeen completely discredited, as the average margin of victory in Senate \nelections last year was 17 percent.\n  Let me repeat that, Mr. President. Not only did 95 percent of \nincumbent Senators win reelection last November, most of these \nelections weren't even close. On average, 17 percentage points \nseparated the winners from the losers.\n  Mr. President, while Rome burns and our campaign finance system \ncrumbles all around us, the junior Senator from Kentucky characterizes \nthe chaos of the 1996 elections as a healthy sign of a vibrant \ndemocracy.\n  Mr. President, as the U.S. Senate continues to duck and weave and \ndodge around the issue of campaign finance reform, the American people \nare becoming more and more convinced that we here in this body do not \nhave the courage or the will to reform a system that has provided \nMembers of this institution with a consistent reelection rate of well \nover 90 percent.\n\n  As we all know, Mr. President, this week hearings will begin in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee on the abuses and possible illegalities \nthat occurred in the last election. I can think of no better time for \nus to make a major step forward to fundamentally overhaul our failed \nelection laws.\n  Opponents of reform will surely assert that we should wait until the \nconclusion of these hearings before we consider reform legislation, so \nwe can adequately identify the loopholes and the gaps and holes in our \ncampaign finance system. But, Mr. President, in the last 10 years on \nthis issue alone, we have had 15 reports by 6 different congressional \ncommittees, over 1,000 pages of committee reports, 29 sets of hearings, \n49 days of testimony, over 6,700 pages of hearings, 522 witnesses, 446 \ndifferent legislative proposals, more than 3,300 floor speeches, 76 CRS \nreports, 113 Senate votes, and 17 different filibusters.\n  So I think it is safe to assume that we have probably reviewed this \nissue more than almost any other issue pending before this body.\n  So, Mr. President, it is time now for serious consideration of reform \nlegislation. I have joined with the senior Senator from Arizona, and \nothers, in authoring the only comprehensive, bipartisan plan to be \nintroduced in the Senate this year.\n  Mr. President, we are very aware that this bill is not perfect. Some \nhave voiced their concerns or objections about this or that provision, \nor have criticized the legislation for not addressing particular areas. \nAs we have said--and I think as we have shown all along--this \nlegislation is primarily a vehicle for reform, and we are more than \nwilling to consider additions, deletions, or modifications to the \npackage.\n  We do have some bottom lines, though. First, we should have a full \nand robust debate on the issue, with all Senators having the \nopportunity both to debate the many complicated issues involved here \nand, also, to have the opportunity they didn't have last year to offer \namendments.\n  Second, it is imperative that any legislative vehicle ban on so-\ncalled party soft money. These are the monstrous, unlimited and \nunregulated contributions that have poured in from labor unions, \ncorporations, and wealthy individuals to the political parties.\n  It is these multihundred-thousand-dollar campaign contributions that \nwere, more than anything else, at the root of the abuses and outrage \nstemming from the 1996 elections. Individuals and organizations \ncertainly should have the opportunity to contribute to their parties \nwith funds that can be used for Federal elections. But all of those \nfunds, Mr. President, should be raised and spent within the scope and \ncontext of Federal election law.\n  Finally, Mr. President, we must have provisions in this reform \nlegislation that encourage candidates to spend less money on their \ncampaigns and, if we can, to encourage them to raise most of their \ncampaign funds from the people they intend to represent in their \ndistrict or State.\n  We have to provide candidates, and particularly challengers who have \nless access to large financial resources, with the tools and means to \neffectively convey their message, without having to raise and spend \nmillions of dollars.\n  Unless we take fundamental steps to change the 90 to 95 percent \nreelection rates for incumbents that are seemingly enshrined under \ncurrent election laws, the American people will justifiably perceive \nsuch reform as little more than one more incumbent protection plan.\n  Mr. President, the senior Senator from Arizona and I have waited \nquite patiently for the opportunity to have this historic debate. It is \nmy hope that we can sit down with the majority leader in the coming \ndays and begin the process of bringing such a meaningful discussion to \nthe Senate floor in the next few weeks.\n  I look forward to that discussion, and I hope that it will eventually \nlead to passage of bipartisan reform legislation that will result in \nwhat I like to call moderate, mutual disarmament.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I think we have 30 minutes set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized. Under \na previous order, the majority leader or his designee is to be \nrecognized to speak for 30 minutes.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS.

Mr. President, I want to take this time--and I am sure \nsome of my colleagues will join me--to talk a little bit about one of \nthe items that has been before us and will continue to be before us \nthat I think is probably the premier legislature, and that is tax \nrelief.\n  I hope, as we move toward the conference committee agreement and as \nwe move toward voting again in the Senate and in the House on tax \nrelief, that we will keep in mind the big picture; the idea that \nAmerican taxpayers are working harder than ever before, and the concept \nand the fact that the typical family is now paying more in taxes than \nthey do for food, shelter, and clothing. Too many families have to rely \non two incomes, partially because of the burden of taxes. The typical \nworker faces nearly 3 hours of an 8-hour day to pay their taxes.\n  So that is what we are talking about. Of course, it is appropriate to \ntalk about and of course it is appropriate to debate how this tax \nrelief is designed. But we ought to keep in mind that we are talking \nabout for the first time in 10 years significant reductions in taxes--\ntax relief for American families.\n  What are we talking about? First of all, a child tax credit; $500 per \nchild tax credit, so the families can use their own money to spend in \ntheir own way to support their own children.\n  We are talking about educational tax incentives; tax credits so that \ntuition for higher education can be offset with tax credits. We are \ntalking about the reduction so that families can send their kids to \ncollege.\n  We are talking about retirement savings; IRA's to encourage savings \nto cause people to prepare for their old age, to be able to put away \nmoney and have incentive to do that by the incentive of providing for \ntax-free savings.\n  Capital gains reduction; taxes on capital gains to be reduced in \norder to encourage investment so that we could create jobs and so we \ncreate an economy that is healthy and robust.\n  Estate and gift tax relief. I happen to come from a State where there \nare a large number of small businesses, where we have lots of farmers \nand ranches, and families work their entire lives to put together a \nbusiness or put together a farm or ranch, and when the time comes when \nthere is a death in the family, they often have to sell these assets to \npay 50 percent in taxes. That ought to be changed.\n  So I hope we can focus on those things that are beneficial and those \nthings that are useful. I hope we don't allow this idea to be \npoliticized. I hope we don't allow ourselves to enter into this \npolitical class conflict which, frankly, the administration is moving \ntoward.\n  I was disappointed that the Secretary of the Treasury has gotten into \nsort of political class warfare. It seems to me if there is one office \nin the Cabinet that ought to be one that you can sort of depend on for \nfacts, that it ought to be the person who is in charge of monetary \npolicy, who is in charge of our money. Unfortunately, that has not been \nthe case. I hope that it changes. The idea that some opposition, those \nwho really do not want tax relief has been to make it a class warfare \nthing. And indeed it isn't.\n  According to Robert Novak, in his article, economist Gary Robbins \nshowed that 75 percent of the tax cuts go to people who make $57,000 or \nless in adjusted income. I think that is interesting. Those are the \npeople who pay 38 percent of the total taxes. Taxpayers who get more \nthan $200,000 in income would get but one dime of relief for every $100 \nin total taxes.\n  This is not a tax break for the rich. Interestingly enough, in the \nsame article he indicates--this is a congressional Joint Economic \nCommittee using Treasury data--that the upper fifth of income now pays \n63 percent of all income taxes. After the proposed tax cuts, the figure \nremains exactly 63 percent.\n  Similarly, the share paid by the bottom two-fifths of the income \nearners remains unchanged.\n  This is not a tax break for the rich.\n  We will hear some things about the tax cuts for the rich. Actually, \n75 percent of the taxes, as I said, go to families who make less than \n$75,000. Families with two kids making $30,000 a year, their tax bill \nwill be cut in half; less than half.\n  So, Mr. President, we have the first opportunity since early in the \n1980's to have some tax relief for people who are heavily burdened with \ntaxes.\n  If in fact the era of big Government is over, then we need to have \nbig taxes to be over as well. We have the highest percentage of gross \nnational product paid now in taxes in history --the highest percentage.\n  So, as we move away from big Government, we ought to allow American \nfamilies to spend more of their own money.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my friend from Nebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nWyoming for an opportunity to speak this morning about something that \nis rather important to Americans, all Americans, Americans who pay the \nbill, the forgotten American, I think, as we enter this next phase of \ndebate in this country about tax relief. Make no mistake, Mr. \nPresident, this is what it is about. This is not about social \ntinkering. It is not about environmental policy. It is about tax \nrelief--tax relief for those people who pay taxes, those people who \nhave been footing the bill in this country for a long time. So, let's \nfirst of all put this in perspective.\n  I say that especially in light of the news conference that I saw \nyesterday and again this morning held by the Vice President and \nSecretary Rubin. I have the highest regard for Vice President Gore and \nSecretary Rubin, but I was astounded that much of the focus in that \nnews conference was not about tax relief for the average middle-class \nAmerican. It was about brownfields. It was about inner cities. It was \nabout other policies.\n  This policy is about providing Americans tax relief, providing relief \nfor the forgotten American.\n  The bill that we passed in this body 2 weeks ago, and the bill that \nwas passed in the House 2 weeks ago, is not perfect, but it is a very \nsignificant first step. As my friend and colleague from Wyoming just \nsaid, it is the first significant tax relief legislation in 16 years.\n  We are here to do the Nation's business. We are here to focus on the \naverage man and woman who pay their taxes, raise their family, and need \nto keep more of their income. You heard all of the numbers. You heard \nthe statistics. But I think it is worth noting that we talk a little \nbit about what is in fact--in fact, not theory, not fabrication, not \nimputed income, not phony economic tax models that we are hearing from \nsome corners--but in fact what is in this bill. Let's just take a \nmoment to review some of this.\n  This is about helping the 6 in 10 Americans who must file Federal tax \nreturns, the people who work hard to make a good life for themselves, \ntheir families, and their communities.\n  It is about helping the 3 in 4 Americans who file tax returns and \nearn less than $50,000 a year. Three-fourths of all taxpayers make less \nthan $50,000 a year. In fact, three-fourths of all the tax cuts in the \nTaxpayer Relief Act that the Senate and the House passed overwhelmingly \nin a very strong, bipartisan way go to people making less than $75,000 \na year.\n  This act has a number of provisions that will help families, small \nbusinesses, students, farmers, ranchers, and single parents who earn \nless than $75,000 a year. Couples earning less than $110,000 will get \nthe full benefit of the family tax relief in this bill.\n  Parents with children age 12 and under get a $500 per child tax \ncredit against their taxes--keeping more of their money. Parents with \nchildren ages 13 to 16 also get a tax credit. The Taxpayer Relief Act \nallows parents to set up special tax-deferred savings accounts to help \nwith their children's education. It allows single people with incomes \nunder $50,000 and couples with incomes under a $100,000 a tax credit \nfor part of their children's college expenses.\n  Mr. President, come on. This is not a rich person's tax bill. This is \na middle-class, average-American tax bill. And anyone who says to the \ncontrary doesn't understand what we are doing here.\n  This also allows recent college graduates who are struggling to get \nestablished to deduct up to $2,500 in student\n\n[[Page S6958]]\n\nloan interest payments during each of their first few years after \ngraduation.\n  Capital gains tax cuts will help anyone who owns property--not rich \npeople. Come on. Anyone who owns property is affected by the capital \ngains tax in this country. A capital gains tax cut helps middle-class \nAmericans. Fifty-six percent of all tax returns reporting capital gains \ncome from taxpayers with total incomes below $50,000. We move in this \nbill capital gains taxes from 28 percent to 20 percent.\n  Estate tax cuts will help millions of Americans. Both the House and \nSenate bills raised the estate tax exemptions to $1 million. It is not \nperfect. We need more. Of course, we do. But it is a good, strong \nbeginning. It is a start. We need to phase these out. These estate \ntaxes are not only unfair but they are un-American. You work all of \nyour life. You work hard. You pay taxes. And at the end automatically \nthe Government comes in and takes half of your estate.\n\n  You tell me, Mr. President, where that is fair. Some people think it \nis. I don't. I don't think most Americans think it is fair.\n  There are many, many other tax provisions in this bill to help \nfarmers with livestock killed by severe weather and farmers hurt by \nunwarranted IRS rulings regarding the alternative minimum tax. Truckers \nare restored with the business meal deduction to 80 percent.\n  These are not rich people.\n  This bill helps small businesses by delaying a new, burdensome \nrequirement that they file their income tax returns on anything other \nthan electronic payroll tax means.\n  It helps universities and other researchers by extending the research \nand experimentation tax credit.\n  It helps people suffering from rare diseases by permanently extending \nthe orphan drug tax credit.\n  This is real America. This is for real Americans.\n  We need to pass this tax relief bill. None of us likes everything in \nthis bill. But we can either squabble ourselves into total stalemate or \nwe can pass this bill and get the first real tax cuts since 1981.\n  Congress needs to reconcile this, move ahead in our conference, and \nsend it to the President. He needs to sign it. America expects us to do \nthis business. Mr. President, we have a responsibility and an \nobligation to do America's business.\n  I encourage my colleagues in the U.S. Senate and in the House to do \nthe right thing and vote for a conference report and bring real tax \nrelief to the American public.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THOMAS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I think it is interesting that new \nMembers, such as the Senator from Nebraska, who come from the private \nsector come here and feel very passionate about this and come more \nrecently talking in behalf of people who are paying taxes. That is \ngreat. I appreciate it.\n  Another Senator who has worked most diligently on tax relief since he \nhas been in the Senate is the Senator from Minnesota. I yield 5 minutes \nto him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized to \nspeak for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, Washington has undergone a remarkable transformation \nsince the people of Minnesota first sent me here in 1993. Back then, no \none was talking about tax relief. Certainly no one was talking about \nfamily tax relief. And with both the White House and Congress under \nDemocratic control, the chances were slim that we would ever have an \nopportunity to give working Americans the tax relief they so \ndesperately need.\n  My good friend and colleague from Arkansas, Senator Hutchinson, and I \nwere freshman Members of the House in 1993 when we came together to \ndevelop a budget proposal that could serve as the taxpayers' \nalternative to the higher taxes and bigger government plan offered by \nPresident Clinton. The key component of our legislation at that time \nwas family tax relief, and that was through the $500-per-child tax \ncredit.\n  We were able to convince the House and the Senate leadership to make \nour families-first bill--with the $500-per-child tax credit as its \ncenterpiece--the Republican budget alternative back in 1994. That \nNovember it became known as the crown jewel of the Contract With \nAmerica. The Washington crowd was finally beginning to listen to the \npeople and to talk about tax relief. In 1995, the $500-per-child tax \ncredit seemed certain to finally be passed into law, with a Republican \ncongressional majority and a President who had campaigned at that time \non family tax relief. Unfortunately, however, it never made it past the \nPresident's desk.\n\n  In 1996, the voters again asked us to enact the taxpayers' agenda, \nbut this time they wanted Congress and the President to come together \nto complete the work that we started in the 104th Congress. So this \nMay, both President Clinton and the congressional leadership agreed on \na number of tax-cutting measures built around the $500-per-child tax \ncredit. The House and Senate passed them in a reconciliation package \njust before the Fourth of July recess.\n  Mr. President, working families need tax relief today more than ever, \nand Minnesotans have asked me to make it a top priority because taxes \ndominate the family budget. In fact, a survey just released in \nMinnesota last week showed that the main concern of Minnesota families \nwas taxes.\n  Now, you factor in State and local taxes and also those hidden taxes \nthat result from the high cost of Government regulation, and a family \ntoday gives up more than 50 percent--50 percent--of its annual income \nto the Government.\n  So all we are saying is let us allow the working people of this \nNation to keep a little bit more of their own money in their pockets.\n  It is hard to believe that there are some who say we are offering too \nmuch in the way of tax relief in our Senate budget plan, and that is \njust plain wrong. Working families are not getting nearly the amount of \ntax relief we promised them.\n  Over the next 5 years, as we know, the Federal Government will take \nin about $8.7 trillion in taxes from the American people. What we are \nasking in this bill is just that 1 cent of every dollar the Government \nplans to take from the taxpayer be left in their hands.\n  That is what the $500-per-child tax credit and other tax cuts are all \nabout, and that is making sure that a penny earned by working Americans \nwould be a penny kept.\n  Unfortunately, by imposing severe restrictions on who can receive it, \nthe $500-per-child tax credit proposal passed by the Senate falls still \nwell short of delivering meaningful tax relief to working families that \nare trying to raise children.\n  The $500-per-child tax credit that I introduced originally says \nfamilies are eligible for the credit as long as their children are \nunder the age of 18. The bill passed by the Senate, however, cuts the \ntax credit once a child reaches the age of 13. If your children are \nbetween the ages of 13 and 16, the Senate bill says we will give you a \ntax credit but only if you spend it the way Washington thinks it should \nbe spent. In this case, it would have to be spent on education.\n  I applaud the parents who take the $500-per-child tax credit and \ndedicate it to their child's college education fund, but that is a \ndecision that belongs with parents, not with Washington.\n  It is not our place to tell families what they can and what they \ncannot do with their own money. Some may elect to spend that $500 on \nbraces for their child or groceries or maybe health insurance, and that \nis fine because it is their money. An unrestricted $500-per-child tax \ncredit takes the power out of the hands of Washington's big spenders, \nand it would put it back where it could do the most good, and that is \nwith families.\n  The second unreasonable restriction in the Senate bill was to deny \nthe child tax credit to families with children at the age of 17. \nAccording to the Agriculture Department, this age group is the most \nexpensive one in the typical middle-income household, and it makes no \nsense to cut off the tax relief just when working families need it \nmost.\n  The hard-working families of Minnesota and the Nation have been \nwaiting far too long since Congress last cut\n\n[[Page S6959]]\n\ntheir taxes--16 years ago. And we have yet to prove to them that we \nunderstand and, more importantly, we appreciate the hardships they face \nevery day. I know we cannot increase the level of tax relief we are \noffering in the fiscal 1998 budget, but I urge my colleagues, the \nconferees, to take whatever steps they can to repair the $500-per-child \ntax credit so that it benefits the maximum number of Americans.\n  This debate will be revisited many times in the months ahead and the \nyears ahead, and I look forward to working again with my fellow \nSenators to finally deliver on the tax relief promise that we made to \nthe people.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to thank you and \nthose who are participating in this discussion for bringing this up. \nThis is a very difficult and frustrating time for all of us, and I \nthink the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Hagel, gave a pretty good outline \nof what this is all about, what we want to accomplish, and what we have \noffered. And when I say ``we,'' I am not talking about the Republican \nParty. I am talking about Congress.\n  To put it in perspective, the House passed the tax cut bill on June \n26--just June 26--and it passed by a fairly substantial margin, 253 to \n179. There was a substitute that was offered by Congressman Rangel that \nhas come in the nature of what the President is announcing now, and it \nwas rejected by 197 to 235. Then the Senate, on the following day, June \n27, passed a tax cut bill 80 to 18. When the minority leader, Senator \nDaschle, offered a substitute, it was rejected 38 to 61.\n  So we went through a long and arduous process of having 29 \namendments. We finally came up with a product, and we went out for the \nFourth of July recess. And after we were out, the President announced a \ndifferent, totally different tax cut plan while Congress was out of \ntown, when we did not have any chance to react to it, and now he is \nsaying that he wants his plan. His plan doesn't really provide tax cuts \nthat are meaningful and will have a positive effect on our economy.\n  I have to ask the question, Mr. President, what has happened to the \nDemocrats in their philosophy? The whole idea that we can cut taxes and \nincrease revenue is not a Republican idea, and yet it is totally \nrejected by this administration. I can remember when President Clinton \nwas first elected. His chief financial adviser, Laura Tyson, was quoted \nas having said there is no relationship between the level of taxes that \na country pays and its economic productivity.\n  I suggest that if that is true, if you carry that to its logical \nextreme, you could tax everybody 100 percent and they will work just as \nhard, but we know that does not happen. And up until this \nadministration, the Democrats knew that that could not happen.\n  I have to credit a Democrat with the whole idea that you can increase \nrevenue by cutting taxes, exactly what we are trying to do, looking at \ntaxes in general. President Kennedy said in 1962, and this is a direct \nquote:\n\n       It is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today \n     and tax revenues are too low, and the soundest way to raise \n     the revenues in the long run is to cut rates now.\n\n  The soundest way to raise revenues is to cut rates now. That is \nexactly what we are trying to do. And we remember what happened during \nthe Kennedy administration. The first year he was in office, the total \nrevenues that came in to support government, that we used to spend on \ngovernment, amounted to $79 billion. After he went through his series \nof tax reductions, it had grown to $112 billion. We remember what \nhappened during the Reagan administration. And we always hear from the \nother side that the Reagan administration came up with tax cuts and the \ndeficits went up.\n  Well, sure, the deficits went up--not because of the tax cuts but \nbecause the liberals who dominated the Congress at that time voted for \nmore government spending. And so in 1980, the total revenues that came \nin to run Government amounted to $517 billion. In 1990, the total \nrevenues that came in were $1.03 trillion. It exactly doubled during \nthat 10-year period.\n  Now, what happened during that 10-year period? During that 10-year \nperiod, we had the largest tax reductions in contemporary history. It \nhas been shown--in fact, if you look at marginal tax rates, the \nrevenues developed in 1980 were $244 billion; in 1990, it was $466 \nbillion. And that happened during the time the tax rates were cut. So \nwe know that we can increase revenues by reducing taxes and also \nrelieve the burden on the American people to allow them to have more \nmoney--and not the rich. We know better than that. We have been playing \nthat game and demagoging it for so long now that I think the American \npeople are aware we are not talking about the rich.\n  With just a couple minutes remaining, I want to be more specific as \nto one of the particular tax cuts I feel very strongly about. In fact, \nMr. President, you had made a comment about some of the farms in \nWyoming. I had the same experience over the break. I was down in \nLawton, OK, and I had a guy come up to me saying they were selling \ntheir family farm to a corporate farm because they could not get the \nprice for some of their acreage in order to pay the estate taxes, and \nthat's happening all over the country. They say, what is happening to \nthe family-owned farm? That is what is happening.\n  I remember in our history, when this country was first founded and \nthe pilgrims came over here and risked their lives--half of them did \ndie--they came over for economic and for religious freedom. When they \ngot over here, they established a system where each one had a plot of \nland to do with as he wanted and to be able to pass that wealth on from \ngeneration to generation. And it was so great, the wealth that was \naccumulated as a result of that, that in one of his letters back home \nJohn Smith said, now 1 farmer can grow more corn than 10 could before--\nbecause of that freedom that they had to be able to pass it on. It is \ncalled productivity, motivation, knowing the Government is not going to \ncome in and take the money away from you that you have worked so hard \nto pass on to future generations.\n\n  Mr. President, I have six grandchildren, four children. I quit \nworking for me. The motivation is for the future generations. When the \nestate tax was first formed, it was formed as a temporary tax. The \nmaximum rate was 10 percent, and it was supposed to be dropped down.\n  I conclude by reading something that I found, an excerpt from a 1996 \nHeritage Foundation study that said if the estate tax were repealed, \nover the next 9 years the Nation's economy would average as much as \n$1.1 billion per year in extra output and an average of 145,000 \nadditional jobs would be created, personal income would rise by an \naverage of $8 billion per year above current projections, and the \ndeficit would actually decline due to the growth generated by its \nabolishment.\n  So I think we need to reject the failed notion that has been proposed \nand stated over and over again by members of this administration, \nincluding Laura Tyson and the President himself, that we need to raise \ntaxes and not lower taxes. We could actually raise revenues by lowering \ntax rates, and that is exactly what we intend to do and should do for \nourselves, for the American people and for our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/08/senate-section/article/S6957-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6959-S6960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FUNDING ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as a country we have congratulated \nourselves time and time again on our enormous victory in winning the \ncold war. But today I want to remind my colleagues that the cold war \nwas won at a cost, a very steep cost, and one of the biggest debts owed \nremains unpaid: the environmental devastation created at places like \nHanford Nuclear Reservation in south-central Washington State.\n  Later today, the Energy and Water Development Appropriations \nSubcommittee will mark up its fiscal year 1998 appropriations bill. We \nwill have a lot of work to do to make up the shortfalls found in both \nthe Senate Armed Services defense authorization bill and the House \nnational defense authorization bill. Rather than funding the cleanup \nbills, the authorizing committees have taken nearly $1 billion--\nbillion--from the defense environmental\n\n[[Page S6960]]\n\nmanagement accounts of the Department of Energy and moved them into \nprocurement and other Department of Defense accounts.\n  Let me tell you the effect this move will have on one place in my \nState. Probably the single biggest environmental problem on any of our \nformer defense nuclear weapons sites is the 177 storage tanks filled \nwith chemical and high-level radioactive waste at Hanford. Each of \nthese tanks contains from a half million to a million gallons of toxic \nwaste. Some of that waste is rock solid, some of it is soupy sludge, \nsome of it is liquid, and some is poisonous gas. Several tanks have \n``burped'' their noxious gases.\n  We have only recently begun making real progress in learning what \nchemicals and radioactive waste were put into these tanks and what \nsubstances have now been created through indiscriminate mixing of \nwastes.\n  The most troubling aspect of these tanks is that they are leaking, \nmoving these vile substances into ground water and toward the Columbia \nRiver.\n  Let me say it again. These tanks are leaking, and they are located \nnext to one of this Nation's greatest rivers. They are upstream from \nRichland, Kennewick, Pasco, Portland, and many smaller communities in \nWashington and Oregon. And their toxic waste is slowly migrating toward \nthe Columbia River, which many view as the lifeblood of the Pacific \nNorthwest because it provides fish, irrigation, power generation, \nrecreation, and much more.\n\n  In this year's budget, the Department of Energy requested $427 \nmillion in budget authority to continue a privatization initiative, \ncalled the tank waste remediation system, and another $500 million plus \nfor other environmental management privatization efforts. My colleague \nin the Washington delegation, Representative Adam Smith, was successful \nin getting the House National Security Committee to place $70 million \nin the defense authorization bill for tank waste, nearly $350 million \nshort of the budget request, but the House gave no other sites any \nfunds. Our Senate Armed Services Committee bill provides $215 million \nfor four privatization projects, including $109 million targeted to \ntank waste. This is simply not adequate.\n  Yesterday, I submitted an amendment to the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill that would increase these privatization accounts by \nabout $250 million. Most of that money goes toward solving the tank \nwaste problem which almost everyone familiar with this issue agrees \nmust be our top priority, but money is also added at Savannah River, \nOak Ridge, Idaho Falls, and Fernald.\n  In addition, my amendment would facilitate the riskiest part of this \nprivatization venture by helping to ensure DOE is able to meet its time \nlines for delivery of this toxic waste to a private company for \nvitrification or immobilization. I added $50 million for this initial \nstage of characterization and remediation of the tank waste. The \noffsets come from noncleanup programs and another privatization effort \nwithin the Departments of Energy and Defense.\n  Mr. President, I am talking about deadly risks to human health and \nthe environment, and so far, this Congress is choosing to ignore them. \nSimply wishing that these enormously costly projects will go away will \nnot make them disappear. It will only make them worse and more costly \nto clean up later.\n  The Department of Energy has proposed an innovative method of solving \nthese problems by privatizing them and letting some of the best, most \nestablished companies in the world use their expertise to clean up \nthese sites. In order for industry to succeed, this Congress must \ndemonstrate its commitment to the privatization program by funding it. \nGoing from a Presidential request of $1 billion to $70 million in the \nHouse and $215 million in the Senate will not give the capital markets \nor private industry the confidence they need to make this work.\n  We need more money for the tank waste remediation system and other \ncleanup priorities. Let me remind my colleagues that even if my \namendment prevails, this authorization bill will still contain about \n$500 million less than was agreed upon by the President and Congress in \nthe recent historic budget agreement. The President finds this funding \nshortfall so serious that he has issued veto threats on both defense \nauthorization bills, citing this as one of his primary concerns.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand with me as we work to get our former \ndefense nuclear weapons sites restored or at least stop them from \ncausing further harm to our rivers, our air and our land. We cannot \nturn our backs on the nearby communities that have sacrificed so much \nfor this Nation in the past. Let's make our victory of the cold war \ncomplete by leaving our children and our grandchildren a safe, healthy \nenvironment, not a contaminated wasteland that sites, like Hanford, \nwill become without sufficient Federal cleanup dollars.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nHutchison of Texas, D'Amato, and Murray be added as cosponsors to the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this amendment refines legislation enacted \nlast year to transition the uniformed services treatment facilities \n[USTF's] into the DOD's new health care program called TRICARE.\n  I hope that the managers of the bill, Senator Thurmond, chairman of \nthe committee, and Senator Kempthorne, chairman of the operative \nsubcommittee, will accept it.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to have been associated with the USTF's \nsince the program's inception over 15 years ago. I was an original \ncosponsor of the amendment offered on this floor in 1981 by the late \nSenator Henry M. ``Scoop'' Jackson that transitioned these former \npublic health service hospitals and clinics to facilities of the \nuniformed services to provide health care to dependents of active duty \npersonnel as well as military retirees and their dependents. Most \nrecently last summer on this floor, I sponsored the amendment that \nprovided the future authority for the USTF's to continue providing care \nto military beneficiaries through the integration of their facilities \ninto DOD's military health care delivery system.\n  The USTF's currently serve about 120,000 beneficiaries at facilities \nlocated in seven States: Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, \nOhio, Texas, and Washington. The facilities provide high-quality care \nthat has been judged by every major study done to date as cost-\neffective when compared to CHAMPUS and other DOD health care \nalternatives. The USTF's pioneered managed care principles such as \nenrollment and capitation that have become the hallmarks of the new \nTRICARE program.\n  The USTF's are very popular with the beneficiaries, many of whom \nwould never consider receiving their health care from any other \nprovider. Satisfaction surveys just completed by an independent firm \nconclude that the USTF's as a whole have a 91 percent satisfaction \nrate, 7 percentage points higher than the norm for civilian HMO's. The \nUSTF in my State, Pacific Medical Center, enjoys the highest overall \nsatisfaction rate of nearly 95 percent. I doubt that any DOD health \ncare provider program can match the USTF's for satisfying the medical \nneeds of military personnel and their families.\n  The introduction of TRICARE, however, has brought the USTF program to \na crossroads. TRICARE has been operating in my State of Washington for \nover 2 years and started in Texas in November 1995. Its introduction \nhas heightened interest within DOD to integrate the USTF's into TRICARE \nto ensure consistent application of the so-called uniform benefit. The \namendment I offered last year which was enacted as part of the fiscal \nyear 1997 National Defense Authorization Act set out the process for \nthis integration of the USTF's into TRICARE to protect the beneficiary \ninterests as well as to preserve the separate designated status of the \nUSTF's. My amendment, which reflected the position passed by the House, \ncalled for an orderly process for negotiation of new agreements so \nPacific Medical Center and the other USTF's could continue offering \nhigh-quality and cost-effective health care to military beneficiaries.\n  Despite my earlier amendment's good intentions, unforeseen problems \nhave developed, largely because of institutional delays and the Defense \nDepartment's unconventional interpretation of some of the key \nprovisions. Accordingly, I feel compelled to offer an amendment today \nthat updates and perfects last year's language.\n\n[[Page S6962]]\n\n  In a similar fashion to last year, my amendment today includes four \nstraight-forward provisions already contained in the House-passed \nfiscal year 1998 Defense authorization bill. It is important to note \nthat these four provisions are in every way substantively identical to \nsubtitle C of title VII of the House-passed bill.\n  The first House-passed provision provides authority for a 6-month \ntransition period in the implementation of the new USTF program to \nallow adequate time to educate the beneficiaries. The 6-month \ntransition is entirely reasonable given that new TRICARE contracts \nprovide at least 7 months for a proper transition. As we learned from \nthe TRICARE transition in Washington, a compressed time period for \ntransition will cause confusion and frustration for the beneficiaries.\n  The second House-passed provision provides authority to continue the \nexisting USTF agreements during the transition period. The Seattle and \nTexas USTF's technically lose their statutory designation effective \nOctober 1 unless they have new agreements executed. But because of \ndelays in commencing the negotiations with DOD, these two USTF's will \nnot have new agreements implemented by October. An extension of the \ncurrent agreement and all its provisions until the transition period is \ncomplete seems fair and appropriate.\n  The third House provision clarifies that the ceiling for capitation \npayments provided to the USTF's takes into account the health status of \nthe enrolled beneficiaries who are under age 65. This reflects last \nyear's clear intent that the actuarial benchmark for developing rates \nto reimburse the USTF's should be the health status of the actual USTF \nenrollees, not a national average of military health care patients.\n  The fourth and final House provision clarifies last year's provision \nso that USTF's still qualify to purchase pharmaceuticals under the \npreferred pricing levels applicable to military health care providers. \nAll parties agree that last year's legislation was not intended to take \naway the right to continued acquisition of these reduced-cost drugs.\n  In addition to these four House-passed provisions, my amendment \nincludes three other items to ensure that DOD negotiates fairly with \nthe USTF's on the new agreements. These provisions would not be \nnecessary if the Defense Department were earnestly negotiating in good \nfaith with Pacific Medical Center and the Houston, TX, USTF. These two \nfacilities are on the firing line because TRICARE is already in their \nregions and they are therefore required by law to have a new agreement \nexecuted by October 1, 1997. DOD, however, has chosen to negotiate \nfirst with three other USTF's that will not see TRICARE in their \nregions until mid-1998 at the earliest and consequently do not face the \nsame immediacy faced by Seattle and Texas.\n  The first new provision tries to prod the negotiations with DOD with \na requirement for binding arbitration for up to 90 days if DOD and the \nWashington and Texas USTF's do not reach an agreement with DOD by \nOctober 1, 1997. This arbitration amendment encourages both sides to \nwork out their differences without giving extra leverage to either \nside. Without arbitration, DOD has no incentive to negotiate because it \ncan literally run the clock out and present the Washington and Texas \nUSTF's with a ``take-or-leave-it'' contract in late September just \nbefore the October 1 deadline arrives.\n  Binding arbitration is an eminently fair device to break an impasse \nand push the negotiations to completion by a date certain. The Seattle \nand Houston USTF's are fully prepared to accept the judgment of an \nindependent arbiter. If DOD wants to avoid arbitration, the \nDepartment's Health Affairs Division should commence immediately good-\nfaith negotiations with Seattle and Houston leading toward a fair \nagreement.\n  This was the result the last time Congress threatened to impose \narbitration to push DOD and the USTF to an agreement. The conference \nreport language accompanying the fiscal year 1991 National Defense \nAuthorization Act stressed that Congress was prepared to require \nmandatory arbitration if the managed care model was not negotiated by \nDOD and the USTF's by a statutory deadline. This threat of arbitration \nwas instrumental in pushing DOD back to the negotiating table.\n  The second new provision contained in my amendment clarifies how the \nUSTF's can contract out their physician services. The clarification \npermits contracting out to primary care physicians provided the USTF's \nretain all risk and don't exceed their enrollment cap and their \nhistorical service area. The provision serves the beneficiary interest \nby allowing the USTF's to place primary care physicians where they are \nneeded to enhance the convenience and accessibility of care. This \nchange will also level the playing field with the TRICARE contractors \nthat can contract out their primary care services.\n  The third and last new provision in my amendment is a conforming \nchange that applies to the uniform benefit, with the accompanying \nhigher enrollment fee and higher cost shares, when the new USTF \nagreements are fully implemented. This clarification is needed to \nensure consistency with the 6-month transition of the arbitration \nperiod.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I implore DOD to respond favorably to the \nrequest of Pacific Medical Center and the other USTF's for open \nenrollment season so that military retirees can sign up this summer for \nthe USTF program. Since DOD did not permit Pacific Medical Center to \nconduct an open season last year, if there is no open enrollment this \nsummer the effect will be to deny military retirees a chance to enroll \nin this program for 2 consecutive years. The result is substantial \npent-up demand and frustration by retirees who are simply looking for \nanother choice in meeting their military health care needs. I urge DOD \nto adhere to the request in a recent Washington State congressional \ndelegation letter to permit an open season, as clearly provided for in \nthe USTF contracts.\n  Overall, Mr. President, this set of legislative refinements, as well \nas providing for an open season, should enable the USTF program to \ncontinue to serve the health care needs of its military beneficiaries. \nI appreciate the committee's understanding and hope it will soon be \nable to accept this amendment. Of course, I urge the full Senate to \npass it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent we lay aside \nthe pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 669\n\n  (Purpose: To provide $500,000 for the bioassay testing of veterans \n         exposed to ionizing radiation during military service)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have two amendments I will discuss. \nThe first is an amendment numbered 669.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself and \n     Mr. Rockefeller, proposes an amendment numbered 669.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 46, between lines 6 and 7, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 220. BIOASSAY TESTING OF VETERANS EXPOSED TO IONIZING \n                   RADIATION DURING MILITARY SERVICE.\n\n       (a) Nuclear Test Personnel Program.--Of the amount provided \n     in section 201(4), $50,000 shall be available for testing \n     described in subsection (b) at the Brookhaven National \n     Laboratory in support of the Nuclear Test Personnel Program \n     conducted by the Defense Special Weapons Agency.\n       (b) Covered Testing.--Subsection (a) applies to the third \n     phase of bioassay testing of individuals who are radiation-\n     exposed veterans (as defined in section 1112(c)(3) of title \n     38, United States Code) who participated in radiation-risk \n     activities (as defined in such paragraph).\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will be relatively brief and take \njust several hours--just take a few minutes to speak about this. I \nwanted to see if everyone was awake today.\n  This is an amendment that would assist atomic veterans. Mr. \nPresident, I\n\n[[Page S6963]]\n\nactually could talk for several hours about the atomic veterans. But I \nwould just say that I think the most moving and most emotional times \nfor me as a Senator has been time spent with atomic veterans in \nMinnesota. These are veterans who were asked to go to ground zero \nduring the atomic testing in States like Nevada and were put in harm's \nway by our Government, and no one told them what they might be facing, \nand no one gave them protective gear.\n  For many of these atomic veterans it has been a nightmare. This all \nstarted in the 1950's, and for decades many of them have had a pattern \nof illness in their families. I could go on for hours talking about \nwhat has happened to them, including high incidences of cancer for the \natomic veterans themselves, and all sorts of problems of cancer and \ndeformities with children and grandchildren.\n  And to this day they still wait for adequate compensation. They wait \nfor justice. I think it is one of the most shameful things that has \nhappened in our country. These are veterans.\n  I actually want to focus on just one small piece of this amendment. I \nam hoping to be able to receive good support from both Democrats and \nRepublicans, and I am hoping this amendment may indeed be accepted. I \nknow Congressman Lane Evans has worked on this in the House, and I \nbelieve this provision has been accepted in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  This amendment would authorize $500,000 for the third and final phase \nof a Defense Special Weapons Agency program at Brookhaven National \nLaboratory to conduct--this will sound technical, Mr. President, but it \nis actually pretty important--to conduct internal dose reconstructions \nof veterans exposed to ionizing radiation while serving in the Armed \nForces. DSWA is responsible for providing dose reconstructions for most \natomic veterans filing claims with the VA. Out of the funding provided \nto DSWA--this, again, is the Defense Special Weapons Agency--for R \nunder section 201(4), $500,000 would be available for bioassay testing \nat Brookhaven National Laboratory for the purpose of conducting \ninternal dose reconstructions of atomic veterans to find out what has \nhappened to them.\n  That is what this is all about. This program is crucial to atomic \nveterans because it provides the means, I say to my colleague from \nSouth Carolina, who has been so supportive of veterans, for more \naccurate reconstruction of radiation dosage. This is a vital step in \nensuring that atomic veterans receive the compensation they deserve and \nin reassuring veterans who did not inhale or ingest radioactive \nparticles in quantities sufficient to cause cancer. In other words, \nthey need to know where they stand. This is a terribly important test. \nWe do not want to eliminate the funding for this. Many veterans who \nhave radiogenic diseases have been denied compensation often based on \nflawed dose reconstructions.\n  Mr. President, out of the hundreds of thousands of atomic veterans--I \nwould like my colleagues to hear this, even if they are not on the \nfloor now as they consider how to vote on this--out of the hundreds of \nthousands of atomic veterans, merely 15,000 have filed claims for \nservice-connected compensation with the VA based on disability stemming \nfrom radiogenic diseases. Of these, only 1,438 have been approved, or \nless than 10 percent. Just imagine this, hundreds of thousands of \natomic veterans, only 15,000 claims, and only a little over 1,000 have \nbeen approved. Of this low percentage, an indeterminate percentage may \nhave had their claims granted for diseases unrelated to radiation \nexposure.\n  Mr. President, we have to make sure that we provide funding, a small \namount of funding within the Department of Defense--that is where we \nhave been doing this funding--to make sure that we continue this very \ncritical test undertaken for atomic veterans.\n  The White House Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments \nfound ``that the Government did not create or maintain adequate records \nregarding the exposure of all participants [in nuclear weapons tests \nand] the identity and test locales of all participants.'' This finding \ncalls into question the current capability of the Government to come up \nwith accurate dose reconstructions on which the approval of claims for \nVA compensation for many atomic veterans depend. Again, the advisory \ncommittee has said we do not have adequate data. We have not been able \nto keep the records. If we do not have this dose reconstruction done \nwell, then a lot of the atomic veterans who deserve compensation for \nthe terrible illnesses that have been inflicted upon them or their \nfamily members are not going to have the chance to get the \ncompensation.\n\n  The DSWA program at Brookhaven uses a technology called fission \ntracking analysis. It analyzes the results of urine samples from atomic \nveterans to arrive at internal dose reconstructions. The program seeks \nto improve the technique first used to establish the Marshall \nIslanders' exposure to ionizing radiation from atmospheric nuclear \ntesting, the same tests that we have been using with Marshall \nIslanders. During the third and final phase of the program, Brookhaven \nplans to conduct bioassays of atomic veterans and provide technical \nassistance to DSWA in internal dose reconstruction.\n  Here is what has happened, here is the reason for this amendment, \ncolleagues. Unfortunately, a conflict has now taken place between DOD \nand VA, and it has developed on funding the final phase of the program. \nDSWA declines to continue funding the program because it contends that \nit is not in the business of medical testing, even though the agency \nhas performed medical testing for Marshall Islanders. The VA simply \nclaims it lacks the necessary funding. In the interests of the atomic \nveterans who served this country bravely and unquestionably, we need to \nend the bickering and ensure the program is carried out to fruition. \nThe VFW, the National Association of Atomic Veterans, and the Disabled \nAmerican Veterans agree and strongly back this amendment. It is a \nlittle bit outrageous that we have this bickering going on and at the \nsame time you have these veterans for whom this test is the only way \nthat they are ever going to be able to get any compensation.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I note that for many years the cover of \nthe Atomic Veterans Newsletter, the official publication of the \nNational Association of Atomic Veterans, contained the simple but \neloquent statement: ``The atomic veteran seeks no special favor, simply \njustice.'' Their fight for justice has been too long, it has been too \nhard, and it has been too frustrating. But these patriotic and \ndeserving veterans have persevered and they retain their faith in \nAmerica.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in helping atomic veterans \nwith their struggle for justice and supporting my amendment. It is a \nmatter of simple justice. Mr. President, Congressman Lane Evans, who \nhas been such a strong advocate for atomic veterans, has done this on \nthe House side. I think the Senate should join in this effort. I think \nit would be absolutely unconscionable if we eliminated this funding for \nthis small but very, very important program where we can have adequate \ndata as to what kind of radiation dosage these atomic veterans were, in \nfact, vulnerable to, affected by, and what this means for them now. \nThat, Mr. President, is the meaning of this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent this amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 668\n\n(Purpose: To require the Secretary of Defense to transfer $400,000,000 \n to the Secretary of Veterans' Affairs to provide funds for veterans' \n                    health care and other purposes)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I call up amendment number 668.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 668.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC.  . TRANSFER FOR VETERANS' HEALTH CARE AND OTHER \n                   PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Transfer Required.--The Secretary of Defense shall \n     transfer to the Secretary of\n\n[[Page S6964]]\n\n     Veterans' Affairs $400,000,000 of the funds appropriated for \n     the Department of Defense for fiscal year 1998.\n       (b) Use of Transferred Funds.--Funds transferred to the \n     Secretary of Veterans' Affairs shall be for the purpose of \n     providing benefits under the laws administered by the \n     Secretary of Veterans' Affairs, other than compensation and \n     pension benefits provided under Chapters 11 and 13 of title \n     38, United States Code.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment would not be subject to \nany point of order. It authorizes the Secretary of Defense to transfer \nsome $400 million to the VA budget for the health care for veterans.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is an effort to ameliorate some damage \nthat was done in the budget resolution that--I say to my colleagues, I \ndo not think any Senator was really familiar with--made significant \ncuts in VA health care.\n  My amendment to the Department of Defense authorization bill would, \nagain, authorize the Secretary of Defense to transfer $400 million from \nthe DOD budget to restore cuts in VA discretionary health care \nspending. This amendment responds to the health care needs of veterans \nby restoring some badly needed funding for programs to the fiscal year \n1997 level.\n  Mr. President, even with this restoration, chances are remote that \nthe VA health care funding for fiscal year 1998 will exceed fiscal year \n1997. We all know--I just want to make this clear to my colleagues--\nthat we have an aging veteran population. We all know that as more \nveterans live to be over 65 and over 85, there is more of a strain on \nthe health care budget. We want to be sure that the cut that took place \nin the budget resolution--which I don't think hardly any Senator was \naware of, although all of the veterans organizations were aware, and \nthere is a fair amount of indignation around the country on this \nquestion--we want to make sure that these cuts in veterans health care \ndon't end up forcing veterans who were either disabled, ill, or poor to \nhave to shift from VA health care to other health care. That would be a \ntravesty for the veterans and their families, and it would also have \nnegative consequences for VA health care in our country.\n  Mr. President, it has become clear that the cuts in the veterans' \ndiscretionary programs that were agreed to as part of the budget \nresolution are going to have some severe, if not devastating, \nconsequences on the quality and availability of VA health care for \ndisabled and needy veterans. The fiscal year 1998 cuts will limit VA's \nability to serve all patients entitled to VA health care. If veterans \nhealth care benefits are delayed because of reduced staffing--you have \nto make your cuts somewhere--or a longer waiting period, then we are \ngoing to be shortchanging men and women who have risked their lives for \nour country.\n  Let me give you some sense of the impact of the $400 million \nreduction in VA discretionary spending in fiscal year 1998. Mr. \nPresident, to give you some idea about it, a $400 million reduction in \nVA discretionary spending in fiscal year 1998 is roughly equivalent to \nthe cost of operating one of the smaller of the VA's 22 integrated \nservice networks.\n  I held a forum, I say to my colleagues, in May. It was unbelievable. \nWe had a huge turnout of veterans representing, I think, all of the \nveterans organizations that I can think of--Vietnam Veterans of \nAmerica, Disabled Americans, Paralyzed Veterans, Military for the \nPurple Heart, American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, atomic \nveterans, you name it.\n  The Minnesota veterans were unanimous in denouncing the cuts in some \nreally essential VA health care resources. Like my colleagues, I \nsupported the sense-of-the-Senate amendment that was introduced by \nSenators Daschle, Domenici and Rockefeller on May 21, which called for \nfull funding of the VA discretionary programs, including medical care \nfor fiscal year 1998. I supported it for two reasons. First, I don't \nthink many of us were aware that in the budget resolution there were \ngoing to be cuts in our investment in resources for VA health care. \nSecond, I think it is simply the wrong thing to do. I think there is a \nsacred contract with our veterans, and if we are going to be making \ncuts and do deficit reduction, we ought not to be doing it on their \nbacks.\n  So, Mr. President, I am convinced that this amendment is appropriate. \nI am convinced that it is really quite appropriate to pass an amendment \nthat gives the Secretary of Defense the authorization to authorize this \ntransfer of funding because, after all, these veterans were fighting \nfor the defense of the Nation. That is what it was all about. I think \nit is critically important that we live up to this commitment.\n  Mr. President, let me just finish up again and say to colleagues that \nI am just introducing these amendments because, as I understand this \nprocess, we are going to have a cloture vote this afternoon and we may \nnot have votes for about a day and there will be more time to discuss \nthese amendments. At least, that is my understanding. I do want \ncolleagues to be familiar with each of them.\n  I think that the atomic veterans, unfortunately, have been out of \nsight and out of mind for all too many people in the country. This is a \ncritically important amendment to those veterans so that they can know \nwhat happened to them. That is the very least we can do for those \nveterans, their children and grandchildren.\n  On the second amendment, I am absolutely convinced that very few \nSenators were aware of the fact that the budget resolution made these \ncuts. It was all done in good conscience. Some of my closest friends \nworked on the budget resolution and supported it. My amendment simply \nsays that we should take $400 million and heal these cuts. My amendment \nauthorizes the Secretary of Defense to do that. I know Dr. Ken Kaiser \ncame out to Minnesota and met with veterans, and he wasn't aware of \nthese cuts. I have not met one person in charge of delivering health \ncare for veterans who believes that this can be done in such a way that \nit will not seriously damage the quality of health care. I am not just \ngiving some kind of trump speech on the floor of the Senate. This is \nvery important. We ought to, at the very least, be able to transfer \nthis small amount of money and restore this funding for our VA health \ncare.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. I see my colleague from \nGeorgia.\n  Mr. CLELAND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 712\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress reaffirming the commitment \n   of the United States to provide quality health care for military \n                               retirees)\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Cleland] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 712.\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of title VII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 708. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING QUALITY HEALTH CARE FOR \n                   RETIREES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Many retired military personnel believe that they were \n     promised lifetime health care in exchange for 20 or more \n     years of service.\n       (2) Military retirees are the only Federal Government \n     personnel who have been prevented from using their employer-\n     provided health care at or after 65 years of age.\n       (3) Military health care has become increasingly difficult \n     to obtain for military retirees as the Department of Defense \n     reduces its health care infrastructure.\n       (4) Military retirees deserve to have a health care program \n     at least comparable with that of retirees from civilian \n     employment by the Federal Government.\n       (5) The availability of quality, lifetime health care is a \n     critical recruiting incentive for the Armed Forces.\n       (6) Quality health care is a critical aspect of the quality \n     of life of the men and women serving in the Armed Forces.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the United States has incurred a moral obligation to \n     provide health care to retirees from service in the Armed \n     Forces;\n       (2) it is, therefore, necessary to provide quality, \n     affordable health care to such retirees; and\n\n[[Page S6965]]\n\n       (3) Congress and the President should take steps to address \n     the problems associated with health care for such retirees \n     within two years after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, one of the reasons I sought membership on \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee is my commitment to supporting our \nmen and women in the Armed Forces. I am particularly pleased to be the \nranking Democratic member of the Personnel Subcommittee.\n  My focus on that committee has been and will be to improve the \noverall quality of life of our military personnel. Where possible, the \nlevel of the compensation they receive, improve military health care, \nand expand access to educational benefits.\n  One of the areas that I am most concerned about is the availability \nand adequacy of military health care. In particular, I believe this \nNation has incurred a fundamental responsibility to provide for the \nhealth care of military retirees. We must adhere to this commitment.\n  I am especially concerned about what happens to retirees when they \nreach the age of 65. They are ineligible to participate in TRICARE. In \naddition, as the military begins to close and downsize its military \ntreatment facilities, retirees over 65 are unable to seek and obtain \ntreatment on a space available basis. Medicare does not currently \nreimburse the Department of Defense for health care services. The \nretirees over 65 are, in effect, being shut out of the medical \nfacilities promised to them.\n  I am reminded of the quote from one of Wellington's troops: ``In time \nof war and not before, God and soldier men a adore. But in time of \npeace with all things righted, God is forgotten and the soldier \nslighted.''\n  I know we live in an environment in which resources are constrained. \nWe are going to have to make some tough choices between people, \nmodernization, and procurement while maintaining readiness. We are \ngoing to have to strike a balance between these competing priorities. \nBut we must not allow budget constraints to force us to slight our \nsoldiers. This is morally wrong. We have a sacred responsibility to \ntake care of those who took care of us. We have incurred a moral \nobligation to attempt to provide health care to military retirees who \nbelieved they were promised lifetime health care in exchange for a \nlifetime of military service.\n  One alternative is Medicare subvention. It would appear that \nsubvention would be fiscally beneficial to Medicare and would improve \nthe ability of the Department to provide health care to military \nretirees over 65. However, I have several questions regarding possible \nshortcomings of subvention:\n  First, does subvention meet the needs of military retirees over 65 \nwho do not live near military treatment facilities?\n  Second, as the Department continues to reduce its health care \ninfrastructure, will maintaining access to all beneficiaries increase \nin difficulty?\n  I understand the Department has expressed concern that, under certain \ncircumstances, Medicare subvention could result in diminished access to \nmilitary treatment facilities for other DOD health care beneficiaries. \nThat raises my third question. Will subvention increase access to some \nbeneficiaries at the expense of others? If so, is this what we really \nwant?\n  Another option that has been discussed is the idea of allowing \nretirees over 65 the option of enrolling in the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefit Program [FEHBP].\n  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the cost of \nenrolling Medicare-eligible military retirees in the FEHBP is between \n$3.7 and $4.2 billion. The primary advantage to FEHBP enrollment is the \nability of beneficiaries to seek and obtain healthcare anywhere in the \nNation that insurers in the FEHBP provide service. I am concerned about \nadditional cost this program would incur especially if offered in \naddition to the benefits currently available to retirees over 65. My \nquestion: Is there a better way to provide similar levels of service \nwhile not adding significantly high levels of cost to the Department of \nDefense?\n  A third option would be to allow military retirees over 65 to enroll \nin TRICARE. This would require additional resources to be made \navailable to military treatment facilities to ensure that all TRICARE \nbeneficiaries were guaranteed access. The Armed Services Committee was \npresented with an estimated $274 million shortfall in the budget \nrequest to fund the Military Health Service System. Frankly, without \ncorresponding changes in the TRICARE system, continued enrollment in \nTRICARE will only exacerbate the current difficulties TRICARE faces in \nmeeting all the needs of Military Health Service System beneficiaries. \nUnder this option, we might also face the prospect of providing new \naccess to some at the expense of those presently in the system.\n  Mr. President, I know there are significant difficulties involved \nwith choosing the optimal approach to addressing military health care \nconcerns. We have to deal with this problem. It is one of the highest \npriorities listed by the men and women in the armed forces. It is also \nthe highest priority of those who represent the retired military \npopulation in this nation.\n  I believe that a comprehensive approach to reforming the DOD health \ncare system is required. In addition to ensuring access to health care \ncoverage, it is also necessary to ensure that health care is available \nto beneficiaries wherever they serve or retire.\n  In 1995, the Congressional Budget Office prepared a report entitled \n``Restructuring Military Medical Care.'' The report estimated that the \ntotal cost to the Department of Defense of providing the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefit Program for all non-active duty beneficiaries \nranged between $5.9 billion and $10.7 billion annually depending upon \nthe percentage the Government pays for the average premium. The report \nalso estimated the total cost of maintaining a wartime combat medicine \ncapability for active duty personnel at $6.5 billion. Some have asked \nif it would be feasible to replace the bulk of the Department of \nDefense Health service system with FEHBP while maintaining a combat \nmedicine capability given that the Department of Defense spends \napproximately $16 billion per year for health care.\n  I sponsored language in the Senate Armed Services Committee report \nthat directed the Department of Defense to conduct a study of this \nissue. I believe this is an important step toward gathering the \nnecessary information we need to make an intelligent decision which \nhonors our commitment to the personnel in the military. We need to know \nwhat impact this would have on the entire medical infrastructure in the \nmilitary. I hope we can begin to find the answers that will allow us to \nresolve this matter. Our men and women in uniform and those who have \nserved deserve nothing less.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues here in the Senate, \nespecially my good friend Senator Kempthorne, who is the chairman of \nthe Personnel Subcommittee, on this most important matter.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are on the defense authorization bill. \nI have been privileged to listen to a number of presentations. They \ndeal with, in many instances, very significant and very important \nissues for the future of this country.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to talk about two issues. One is an \namendment that I intend to offer later in the consideration of this \nbill. The second is to support an amendment that is to be offered by \nSenator Lugar and, I believe, cosponsored by Senator Bingaman and a \ngroup of others, dealing with the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program \nand the funding for it.\n  Before I discuss those two, let me indicate, however, that it is \ncurious to see a cloture motion filed on a bill like the defense \nauthorization bill this early in the process. A cloture motion suggests \nsomehow that we should have a vote cutting off debate when debate has \nhardly begun on this defense authorization bill. This is a very \nsignificant piece of legislation. There needs\n\n[[Page S6966]]\n\nto be time for significant debate on issues that are very substantial.\n  I hope this is not going to be habit forming--filing cloture motions \nvirtually at the same pace when a piece of legislation like this comes \nto the floor of the Senate. A desire to shut off debate ought not be \ninitiated before there is some demonstration that debate is going to go \non forever. If a bill is moving at a reasonable pace, there is no \nreason, in my judgment, for anyone to be offering cloture motions or \nshut off debate. I just say that is a curious thing to have happen on \nthis bill right at the start of the legislation. I hope that won't be a \nhabit.\n  Now to the issue of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, Mr. \nPresident, folks in my hometown, in most cases, won't know much about \nthis program because the American people have not been given much \ninformation about the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. It is kind \nof a foreign title to a program that in most cases benefits the lives \nof every American citizen.\n  I want to describe what it is and why it is important and why I \nsupport the amendment that was offered, I believe, by Senator Lugar, \nalong with many other distinguished colleagues, and is now pending \nbefore the Senate.\n  The Cooperative Threat Reduction Program is a program by which we \nengage with our resources under an arms control agreement to help a \nformer adversary, the former Soviet Union, now Russia, and its \nsurrounding States to reduce the number of nuclear weapons and warheads \nthat were previously in place aimed at the United States of America. \nDoing so reduces the threat against our country. I think it makes \neminent good sense to see a missile destroyed in its silo rather than \nhaving a missile fired and have to deal with a missile that is flying \ntoward a target of the United States.\n  Obviously, things have changed dramatically with the Soviet Union now \nbeing gone, and we now have Russia and other independent States. We are \ndealing with a new world, and we have a cold war that is largely ended. \nWe have a circumstance in which we want to work with what had been a \nformer adversary to reduce the amount of nuclear weapons that that \nadversary now possesses in concert with the arms control agreements \nthat we have already had with them and that we have negotiated and \nsigned with that former adversary.\n  Mr. President, let me ask unanimous consent to have an object on the \nfloor that I might use to demonstrate to my colleagues that this, in \nfact, works.\n  Mr. President, I want to show my colleagues a picture. This is a \npicture of some workers in Russia with power saws sawing the wings off \nRussian bombers. These folks are bent over a wing of a bomber sawing \nthe wings off Russian bombers. Why are they sawing the wings off \nRussian bombers and sending these bombers, now unable to fly, to the \nboneyard? Because of arms control agreements. They are required under \narms control agreements to reduce the number of bombers they possess in \ntheir arsenal.\n  A smaller picture shows former Secretary of Defense Perry inspecting \nan SS-24 silo. This is a missile silo in the Ukraine. This silo had \n550-kiloton warheads on top of a missile--nuclear warheads capable of \nbeing delivered over 6,200 miles. This silo is now empty of warheads. \nThere are no nuclear warheads in that silo. And our former Secretary of \nDefense Perry is inspecting a silo that is now cleared of its missile \nand its nuclear warheads.\n  Finally, this picture. This is a picture of silo No. 110 near \nPervomaisk in the Ukraine which held an SS-19 missile. As you can see, \nit is now only a hole. And, in fact, if you saw a later picture you \nwould see sunflowers planted where missiles were previously planted \npoised and aimed at the United States of America. This is a hole. The \nhole is now covered up. There is no missile, no warhead. And, in fact, \nsunflowers are now planted there.\n\n  Mr. President, this piece of metal comes from that missile and the \nmissile silo. This piece of metal was removed from this missile silo in \nthe Ukraine. This little piece of metal is a demonstration of the \nsuccess of the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program. This was part of \nan armament in the ground on an intercontinental ballistic missile with \nnuclear warheads aimed at the United States of America. Now it is here \nin this Chamber. And where this silo and missile with a warhead used to \nsit there is now planted sunflowers.\n  Why? Why at silo 110 near Pervomaisk in the Ukraine is there now a \nplanting of sunflowers rather than a nuclear missile or an \nintercontinental ballistic missile with a nuclear warhead aimed at the \nUnited States? Because this program works. This program makes sense. \nThis program reduces the number of missiles, the number of bombers, and \nthe number of nuclear warheads in an arms control agreement. It reduces \nthe number of those weapons that previously had been poised to strike \nat the United States of America.\n  Let me describe the facts about how this program has worked. We have \nseen the elimination of 212 submarine launchers, 378 intercontinental \nballistic missile silos, 25 heavy bombers, more than 500 ICBM's.\n  Fiscal year 1997: 131 additional ICBM silos--70 of them in Russia, 61 \nof them Kazakhstan--and 43 heavy bombers gone under this program; and \n80 submarine launchers, all in Russia, gone; 84 missiles--48 in \nUkraine, 36 in Russia--gone under this program. In effect, we helped a \nformer adversary destroy weapons that had previously been poised and \naimed at us.\n  I can't think of anything that makes more sense than to destroy a \nmissile by dismantling its silo, the missile and the warhead, and it is \ngone.\n  That is exactly what the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program has \ndone. Senators Lugar and Nunn were the authors of this program. Many \nothers in the Chamber have worked hard on this program.\n  There is an amendment pending that will restore the money for this \nprogram which is necessary to continue the progress to reduce the \nnumber of nuclear arms in Russia and the independent states under this \nprogram. It is a bargain by any stretch. It makes eminent good sense \nfor this country to do it.\n  I am proud to say that I support the amendment. I commend Senator \nLugar, Senator Bingaman, and so many others for offering the amendment \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, let me turn then to one other item. We will in the \ncontext of debating this piece of legislation also discuss whether we \nwish to authorize two additional rounds of military base closings or \nwhether we want, to say it another way, create a base realignment and \nclosing commission that would recommend, in two rounds, closing certain \nmilitary installations in our country.\n  I am not here to support having more capability in military bases \nthan we need. That would be wasteful. I understand that. On the other \nhand, we have had three full rounds of base closings and one \nabbreviated round. In the three rounds of closing military \ninstallations, we have ordered the closure of over 100 military \ninstallations in this country. My understanding is that only 50 of them \nhave been finally and completely closed. We have no accounting at all--\nnone--of what the costs and the benefits have been from the closings \nthat have occurred so far.\n  I think it is far better for us to decide that we should finish the \njob on the previous rounds of base closings before we authorize two \nadditional rounds.\n  I have another motive, obviously. I am concerned about what the \nrounds of base closings that are authorized do to communities in our \ncountry. We have had a couple of Air Force bases put on the list and \ntaken off the list, put on the list and taken off the list. What \nhappens in communities when you have a base closing round is that the \nminute your community or your facility is remotely involved in that \nround of base closings, economic growth is stunted and new investment \nis stopped.\n  There isn't anyone who will come to Cheyenne, WY, or to Grand Forks, \nND, or Minot, ND, or Rapid City, SD, or you name it, where they have \nmilitary installations, and say, ``Oh, by the way, there are going to \nbe new rounds of base closings here.''\n  So what we want to do is make a new investment in the community of \napartment buildings or commercial property, or a plant here or a plant \nthere. That is not the way it works. What they say is, ``Gee, we do not \nknow what the future is going to bring.'' You\n\n[[Page S6967]]\n\nmight have 30 percent unemployment in that region 2 years from now \nbecause they might close that military installation, and if they do, \nthe last thing I want to have done is to have made an investment in \nthat community and find that investment going belly up. It terribly \nstunts economic growth in these communities while you have these base \nclosing rounds.\n  In fact, at the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee hearing, the \nsubcommittee of which I am a member, General Fogleman, who indicated in \nresponse to a question of mine that he would not likely be here when we \nhave additional base closing rounds and said he would not recommend \nthat we have two additional rounds. If we have additional rounds, and \nhe indicated that he felt there would be some overcapacity, we should \nhave only one, he said. That would be his recommendation. But I believe \nvery strongly that we should not authorize two additional base closing \nrounds in this defense authorization bill for a number of reasons.\n\n  The Congressional Budget Office stated the following. The \nCongressional Budget Office said:\n\n       The Congress could consider authorizing an additional round \n     of base closures if DOD believes there are surplus military \n     capacity after all rounds of BRAC have been carried out. That \n     consideration, however, should follow an interval during \n     which DOD and independent analysts examine the actual impact \n     of measures that have been taken thus far. Such a pause would \n     allow DOD to collect the data necessary to evaluate the \n     effectiveness of initiatives and to determine the actual \n     costs incurred and savings achieved.\n\n  The Congressional Budget Office thinks it would be unwise to initiate \nadditional base closing rounds without having the information available \nabout what have been the costs and the benefits of the previous three \nrounds. I think we would be wise to heed the admonition of the \nCongressional Budget Office on this issue.\n  A good many Senators have expressed an interest in this amendment on \nboth sides of the aisle--Senator Daschle, Senator Conrad, Senator Lott, \nSenator Domenici, Senator Feinstein, Senator Dodd, and others. I know \nwe will likely have a significant and robust debate when this occurs.\n  I simply wanted to alert my colleagues that some of us feel very \nstrongly that we should not initiate additional base closing rounds in \nthis defense authorization bill until we receive the information that \nwe think we should have about costs and benefits on previous rounds.\n  Let me close with a word about the subject that I originally \ndiscussed; that is, the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program.\n  There are those who are critical of the political process, and I \nsuppose in many cases justifiably, because there are a lot of things \nthat are done in the democratic process that are not efficient, some \nnot effective. It is not a very efficient form of government--the best \nform of government but not the most efficient form of government. But I \nsay to all of those who question the effectiveness or the efficiency of \nGovernment that the program called the Cooperative Threat Reduction \nProgram in which we help finance the destruction of weapons--bombers, \nmissiles, and nuclear warheads--that previously were aimed at the \nUnited States of America is a program that is a bargain by any standard \nof measure. That makes this world safer; it makes it a better world; \nand to the extent that we can continue this program and fund it the way \nit should be funded, I want to be a part of that. I hope very much we \ncan get a vote on the amendment that is now pending, and when we do I \nhope very much the amendment will prevail.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 670\n\n(Purpose: To require the Secretary of Defense to transfer $5,000,000 to \nthe Secretary of Agriculture to provide funds for outreach and startup \n                   for the school breakfast program)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

Mr. President, before I go any further, I ask \nunanimous consent that Justin Page, who is an intern, be allowed to be \nin the Chamber during the duration of this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to introduce some amendments so that my \ncolleagues have some knowledge of them. We will get back to them when \nthere is more time to debate these amendments.\n  The School Breakfast Program was established back in 1966 as a pilot \nprogram. It was primarily located in rural districts. The idea was that \nchildren who lived in rural areas with long bus rides might not be able \nto have time to eat breakfast at home. Since then, the School Breakfast \nProgram has really become a wonderful program upon which parents and \nstudents heavily rely. In many families, a single parent is working or \nboth parents are working, and school breakfasts are recognized as one \nof the most beneficial nutrition programs we have.\n  Let me make it clear that a hungry child cannot learn and will likely \ngrow up to be an adult who cannot earn. We are talking about a very \nwise investment. One more time. Sometimes we debate in this Chamber and \nwe make issues out to be so complex. This is simple. A hungry child \ncannot learn and later on that child is quite likely to end up being an \nadult who cannot earn.\n  To give some context, we still have some 27,000 schools that are not \nable to make breakfast available or that do not make breakfast \navailable to eligible students, and 8 million low-income children who \nneed breakfast but do not participate. What my amendment does is \ncorrect an action that we as Congress took which was egregious. In the \nwelfare bill that we passed, we eliminated a $5 million fund which was \nan outreach and start-up grant for school breakfast programs. It was \ncreated in 1990, and it was made permanent in 1994. These outreach \ngrants are one-time grants that help States develop school breakfast \nprograms.\n  Let me be crystal clear as to what is going on here. Every low-income \nstudent who is eligible for a free lunch is eligible for breakfast as \nwell but only 40 percent of those students are able to get the \nassistance they need for a healthy and nutritious breakfast. The $5 \nmillion grant program was eliminated because it was an effective \ncatalyst toward school districts expanding both their School Breakfast \nPrograms. The welfare bill eliminated it because it was a success.\n  Now, why in the world do we want to eliminate a small grant program \nwhich was such an important tool in providing a nutritious breakfast \nfor low-income children in America? What this amendment does is to \npoint out that in the budget plan we have $2.6 billion for the Pentagon \nabove and beyond what the President requested. Can we not authorize the \nSecretary of Defense to take $5 million out of $2.6 billion more than \nthe President even requested and put that into a grant program for \nStates and local school districts so they can start up school breakfast \nprograms?\n  I submit that part of our definition of national security has to be \nthe security of local communities--where every child is able to reach \nher and his full potential--because when our children do well, we do \nwell. It is unconscionable that we eliminated an effective, crucial $5 \nmillion grant program when so many low-income children who need a \nnutritious and healthy breakfast are not able to have it.\n  So this is an amendment which gives the Secretary of Defense the \nauthority to transfer to the Secretary of Agriculture $5 million from \nthe $2.6 billion above and beyond what the President requested for the \nPentagon. Is that too much to ask, $5 million to help State and local \nschool districts expand the School Breakfast Program so more of the \nvulnerable children in this country can at least have a nutritious \nbreakfast? That is what this amendment speaks to. This is amendment \n670.\n  Mr. President, I now would ask unanimous consent that this amendment \nbe laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 666\n\n         (Purpose: To increase funding for Federal Pell Grants)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I call up amendment 666.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 666.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   . TRANSFER OF FUNDS FOR FEDERAL PELL GRANTS.\n\n       (a) Transfer Required.--The Secretary of Defense shall \n     transfer to the Secretary of Education $2,600,000,000 of the \n     funds appropriated for the Department of Defense for fiscal \n     year 1998.\n       (b) Use of Transferred Funds.--Funds transferred to the \n     Secretary of Education pursuant to subsection (a) shall be \n     available to carry out subpart 1 of part A of title IV of the \n     Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070a) for fiscal \n     year 1998.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, we have a budget plan that provides an \nexcess $2.6 billion to the Pentagon above and beyond what the President \nrequested. This amendment would authorize the Secretary of Defense to \ninvest that $2.6 billion in Pell grants instead of $2.6 billion into \nthe Pentagon budget.\n  If this amendment passes, we would see the maximum Pell grant go up \nto $3,800, and Pell grants stretch to reach 4,278,000 students.\n  This would make a huge difference. There was an excellent piece by \nLarry Gladieux in Monday's New York Times. Gladieux made the argument \nthat what is now being proposed--and by the way, I am trying to provide \na rigorous, if you will, critique of both Republicans' and Democrats' \nplans on this--both the President's plan and what is being done here in \nthe Congress through tax deductions and tax credits does not reach \nthose families for whom higher education really has not been \nattainable. He pointed out, for example, that if a tax credit program \nis not refundable, many families with incomes under $28,000 and many \ncommunity college students are not going to benefit at all.\n  Talk to your financial aid offices. Talk to your students. Talk to \npeople in your States. I know this is the case in New Mexico as well. I \nknow that Senator Bingaman has been a huge advocate of the Pell Grant \nProgram. You talk to many in these community college programs, many of \nwhom are older and going back to school, and they will tell you that \nthe Pell Grant Program is the most effective, efficient way of meeting \ntheir needs.\n  Mr. President, I do not remember exactly the statistics, but there \nhas been something like a flat 8 percent graduation rate for women and \nmen coming\n\n[[Page S6969]]\n\nfrom families with incomes under $20,000 a year since the late 1970's. \nThat is a disgrace. We know higher education is key to economic \nsuccess. All of us wish that higher education will be there for our \nchildren and our grandchildren, but still we have a lot of families for \nwhom it is not affordable. The best way to make sure they have the \nassistance they need, the best way to make sure the Pell Grant Program \ncan help working families, moderate-income families, even reach into \nthe middle-income range, is to expand the Pell Grant Program. I suggest \nthat when we have all sorts of reports that there are tens of billions \nof dollars the Pentagon cannot even account for in its expenditures--\nSenator Grassley from Iowa has done an excellent job in continuing to \nfocus on this issue--and when you have a situation where the Pentagon \nin the budget resolution receives more money than the President even \nrequested, it would seem to me we could take that $2.6 billion in \nexcess of what is needed or has been requested and instead put it into \na very successful higher education program which is all about our \nnational defense.\n  We do not do well as a nation unless we have a skilled work force. As \nwe look to the next millennium, when so many of the industries are \ngoing to be womenmade and manmade--and many of them, Mr. President, \nsince you are a strong advocate of small business, are small \nbusinesses--let us make sure that higher education is affordable. Let \nus do something that will make a huge difference. And one of the things \nwe do is take a small amount of money--it is a small amount of money in \nthe context of the Pentagon budget--and put it into expanding the Pell \nGrant Program.\n  There is not one of my colleagues, Democrat or Republican, who is \ngoing to hear from the higher education community, the students or \ntheir families that more of an investment in the Pell Grant Program is \nnot extremely important to them. It is very important to the families \nwe represent. It is very important to the future of our States. It is \nvery important to the future of our country. I look forward to a full \ndebate about our priorities as we go forward with this defense \nauthorization bill and get back to debate on each of these amendments.\n  With that, Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their \ngraciousness in letting me introduce these amendments today and I will \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the amendment \noffered by Senator Wellstone to reduce defense spending. The budget \nagreement represents what is available for defense spending, not what \nis required. This amendment reduces defense funding below the amount \nthat was agreed to by both the congressional and administrative budget \nnegotiators.\n  Mr. President, we have been down this road before, but it seems that \nsome of my colleagues have forgotten where it leads. Those who oppose a \nstrong defense often attempt to justify their position by reminding us \nthat the cold war is over. They conclude that defense spending should \nbe lower because we do not face an obvious danger from a threat like \nthe Soviet Union. They make a simple argument. This argument is \nappealing because it provides an easy solution to our funding \nproblems--but the argument is wrong and dangerous.\n  While our Nation no longer faces a cold war danger, the world is \nstill a dangerous place. The belief that continual reductions to \ndefense are in order is not only ignoring reality, it also overlooks \nrequirements for both present and future force readiness. We ask our \nmen and women in uniform to respond to crises all over the world every \nday. Right now, we have United States troops on duty in Bosnia, in the \nskies over Iraq, and on ships at sea near any actual or potential \ntrouble spot in the world.\n  The Chief of Staff of the Army, General Reimer, testified that,\n\n       Requirements have risen 300 percent. . . . Excessive time \n     away from home is often cited by quality professionals as the \n     reason for their decision to leave the military. It is common \n     to find soldiers that have been away from home . . . for 140, \n     160 or 190 days of this past year.\n\n  The Secretary of the Air Force, Dr. Widnall, testified that,\n\n       Since Desert Storm, we have averaged three to four times \n     the level of overseas deployment as we did during the Cold \n     War.\n\n  The problem remains that we will not require less of our servicemen \nand women. At the same time, some of my colleagues seek to continue to \nreduce defense spending. This is not right. Deployments to trouble \nspots have not slowed down. We have not stopped sending our young \nservice people all over the world.\n  Arguments are made that the Pentagon could find all the money it \nneeds by eliminating wasteful spending. Mr. President, this is probably \ntrue of many programs, not just defense. No one supports wasteful \nspending. But concerning the Defense Department, Secretary Cohen is \ntaking action. He has just finished and delivered the Department's \nreport on the Quadrennial Defense Review [QDR], a review of the \nnational military strategy, force structure, and assets necessary to \ncarry out it out. He has recently established another panel to push the \nDefense Department toward more business-like operations. The Armed \nServices Committee has already held one hearing concerning the QDR. \nMore hearings will be held.\n  Mr. President we must remember that the QDR is an attempt to define \nour military requirements for our future military security, but we must \ndeter wars with ships, planes, and tanks today. There is a price for \nfreedom. This is the price for world leadership. As Secretary Cohen \nstated:\n\n       Having highly ready forces that can go anywhere at any time \n     really spells the difference between victory and defeat and \n     it also spells the difference between being a superpower and \n     not being one.\n\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge all of my colleagues to oppose this \namendment that would intend to cut defense spending. It is absolutely \nnecessary that we maintain defense for the security of this Nation. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, just a very brief response. I \nappreciate the comments of my colleague from South Carolina. I always \nappreciate what he has to say.\n  I do want to point out that one of my amendments--and I am hoping we \ncan have some agreement on it--just says we should really follow the \naction of the House and do not eliminate a program within DOD which is \na critical testing program for atomic veterans to find out what \nhappened to them.\n  The second amendment I have has a lot to do with defense. It has to \ndo with veterans who found out after the fact that in the budget \nresolution we essentially put into effect cuts in veterans' health \ncare. I just have to say to all my colleagues, these veterans are very \nmuch about our national defense. I don't think it is too much out of a \n$2.6 billion excess of what the President and Pentagon even asked for \nto say, look, let's take $400 million and put that into the VA health \ncare budget. These veterans are all about our national defense. I think \nthis is going to be a critically important vote, and I look forward to \nthe debate on it.\n  The third amendment I offered was an amendment which dealt with the \nSchool Breakfast Program. I again have to say, it would seem to me when \nwe are talking about $2.6 billion more than what the President asked \nfor, it is not so much to take $5 million which is so critical to \nenabling States to start up school breakfast programs and put it \ntowards making sure that children have a nutritious breakfast before \nthey go to school. This is all about priorities. It is not a question, \nI say to other Senators, of not wanting a strong defense. This is a \nsmall amount of money we are saying the Secretary might be authorized \nto transfer, a small amount of money with a very big bang.\n  I just finished talking about how my Pell grant amendment, too, \nimpacts our national defense.\n  So, again, these amendments all focus on the $2.6 billion above and \nbeyond what the President requested for the Pentagon. These amendments \nsay we ought to at least give the Secretary the authority to transfer \nsome of the small amount of funding to make sure veterans get the \nhealth care that they need or to make sure that we re-establish startup \ngrants for the School Breakfast Program, to make sure we keep the \nprogram that we have had for the atomic veterans, and, finally, I\n\n[[Page S6970]]\n\nhave raised questions about an investment in education, but it is all \ndone within the framework of an excess $2.6 billion. This is a debate \nabout priorities, it is not a debate about who is for a strong defense.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, since there is no other Senator wishing \nto speak right now, let me say a word about the procedure that we seem \nto be agreed upon of having a cloture vote this afternoon at 3 o'clock. \nI know the majority leader has requested unanimous consent to do that \nand has been granted unanimous consent to do that. I certainly did not \nobject. But I have to say, Mr. President, that the procedures in the \nSenate, as is said in Alice in Wonderland, get curiouser and curiouser. \nHaving a cloture vote at this stage in our deliberations on this \nDefense authorization bill seems to me the most curious of any \nprocedure I can recall.\n  We are, as I understand it, being advised by the leadership, the \nmajority leadership, Senator Lott, that we do not want any votes on \nthis bill until at least 6 o'clock tomorrow evening when the absent \nMembers who are in Madrid with the President attending the meeting on \nNATO return. I understand that is a very important meeting, and I \ncertainly commend them for being there to attend that. I do not object \nto postponing votes on this important defense authorization bill until \nthey return.\n\n  But for us to be, on one hand, being told that we should not vote \nbecause Members are absent and, on the other hand, being told that we \nshould invoke cloture because someone is delaying the Senate in \nconcluding action on this bill, the only people delaying the Senate in \nconcluding action are the absent Senators or the leadership in trying \nto protect them from votes. So I have great difficulty understanding \nwhy we are having this cloture vote today.\n  Obviously, if that is the majority leader's will or desire, he has \nthat right under Senate rules. But for people who try to understand the \nproceedings around the Senate, I think they need to understand that \ninvoking cloture does cut off debate. That is the purpose of it. It \nlimits the number of amendments each Senator can offer. It limits the \nlength of time each Senator can speak. It prevents us from seriously \nconsidering legitimate proposals that may be made to improve or alter \nthis bill.\n  So I think it would be a big mistake for us to invoke cloture. As I \nsaid in my early comment, I think it is really very confusing to this \nSenator to understand why we are having the vote at all. I hope that \nthe majority leader will reconsider and vitiate the yeas and nays and \nput off any votes on cloture until such time as there is some evidence \nat least that some Senator is trying to delay action on the bill. I see \nno evidence of that at the present time. I think all of the Senators \nwho have come to the floor this morning to offer amendments have had \nthose amendments set aside because of their agreement with the majority \nleader's position that we should postpone votes until tomorrow evening \nafter our colleagues return from Madrid.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to make that statement because I have great \ndifficulty understanding myself the procedure that is being followed.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the \ncloture vote scheduled for today will occur at 3 p.m. It is my hope \nthat cloture will be invoked so that the Senate can complete action on \nthis very important Department of Defense authorization bill this week.\n  It is my understanding that perhaps as many as 150 first-degree \namendments have been filed to the bill. Needless to say, there remains \na tremendous amount of work to be done in order to complete action this \nweek.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/08/senate-section/article/S6960-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SENATOR ENZI RECEIVES GOLDEN GAVEL AWARD\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, the Senate pauses to recognize a \ncolleague who has now presided over the Senate for 100 hours during \nthis session of Congress. It has been a longstanding tradition in the \nU.S. Senate to honor those Senators who preside 100 hours in a single \nsession. To those individuals who achieve this height, we bestow the \nGolden Gavel Award.\n  While many Senators have won this prestigious honor, few have done so \nas swiftly as Senator Mike Enzi of Wyoming. Indeed, Senator Enzi has \nsurpassed all other records that have been set by Republican Senators \nin the history of the Golden Gavel Award. Today he completes his 100th \npresiding hour. The Senate has been in session this year for \napproximately 615 hours, and the freshman Senator from Wyoming, as \nPresiding Officer, has filled 100 of those hours with matchless \nenthusiasm and dedication.\n  So, on behalf of my colleagues, I extend my congratulations to the \nfirst Golden Gavel recipient of the 105th Congress, Senator Mike Enzi, \nwho is presiding at this time.\n  Congratulations, Senator Enzi. Thank you for all the time that you \nhave spent in the chair. The week before the Fourth of July recess \nperiod I had noted what an excellent job you had been doing as a \nPresiding Officer, having been in the chair late, I think it was, on \nThursday night and back in the chair through a long, extended period of \ntime on Friday morning.\n  We appreciate your good work. Now that you have reached this \nmilestone, we hope you will continue on.

Mr. President, late on Wednesday, July 2, the State of \nMichigan was the recipient of an uninvited guest for the holiday \nweekend: Namely, a series of intense thunderstorms which ripped through \nthe south-central and south-eastern portions of our State.\n  Heavy rains, accompanied by 13 confirmed tornado touchdowns, and \npowerful straight line winds in excess of 70 to 100 miles per hour \ncaused extensive damage, injury and some deaths in our State. I have \nhad the chance since then to tour a number of the damaged sites in our \nState, and I know that Senator Levin has likewise been visiting some of \nthese communities. I can attest to the level of destruction which has \ntaken place in Michigan.\n  Just to put some statistics to the descriptions, all told we had 13 \npeople who were killed as a result of the storms, approximately 117 \nothers as of this morning who were injured, and some 1,482 people are \nhomeless today as a result of the storm. Public damage estimates at \nthis point are now close to $135 million, and are expected to rise.\n  To put it in even a more personal perspective, in Grosse Pointe \nFarms, MI, winds in excess of 75 miles per hour caused the collapse of \nan occupied picnic pavilion gazebo. It actually swept the gazebo across \nthe park, lifted it and those in it through a fence and into Lake St. \nClair. Five people, including several very young children, were killed \nas a result. In Wayne and Macomb, Counties, flooding caused by the \nintense rainfalls resulted in nearly 52 million dollars' worth of \ndamage to the public water and sewer systems. In the city of Detroit, \nthe headquarters of Focus:HOPE, a volunteer organization that feeds \nover 50,000 people a month in Michigan, sustained $10 million in \ndamages when a tornado tore the roof off several of its buildings and \nblew out dozens of windows. In the city of Hamtramck, another community \nI visited, the scene was reminiscent of a Hollywood set, with cars up-\nended, houses destroyed, and roofs ripped off buildings. It was an \nincredible act of nature which, at one point, left approximately \n325,000 people in our State without power.\n  I appear today, really, just to give the Senate an update. Michigan \nis a resilient place and the people in all of these communities have \nrisen to this challenge. People have been volunteering, helping \nneighbors, and coming from all over our State to lend a hand in places \nsuch as Chesaning, a city in Saginaw County, and in Genesee, Wayne, \nMacomb and Oakland Counties. I am very proud of those people, Mr. \nPresident. I appear today to thank all of those who have stepped up to \nthis challenge.\n  Government officials, led by our Governor John Engler, Detroit Mayor \nDennis Archer, Mayor Kozaren of Hamtramck, Mayor Danaher of Grosse \nPointe Farms, Supervisor Kirsh of Washington Township, Supervisor \nDePalma of Groveland Township, Supervisor Walls of Springfield \nTownship, Mayor Jester of East Lansing, Supervisor Miesle of Cohoctah \nTownship, Supervisor Kingsley of Conway Township, Supervisor Wendling \nof Maple Grove Township, Village President Mahoney of Chesaning and \nnumerous other local officials have pulled together the State and local \nresource teams to get out and help distressed folks. The Michigan State \nemergency personnel, the State police, and FEMA have already begun the \npublic damage assessments and they have been stalwarts in addressing \nthese problems. I want to commend them, but I especially want to \ncommend the volunteers from all over our State who have joined together \nto provide these first few days the kind of neighbor-to-neighbor help \nthat truly makes the difference when crises of this type occur.\n  Our office is very actively involved, along with the other \ncongressional offices, in trying to provide assistance. We have made it \nclear to those in need, if there is anything we can do we will be there \nto help. We also intend to continue the efforts to work with our State \nand with FEMA to provide whatever assistance we can, and if a decision \nto seek Federal aid is made, certainly I urge the President to move \nquickly to approve it. My wife, today, in fact, is in the State working \nwith the Red Cross in a number of the shelters that have been provided. \nPeople from our staff and other congressional staffs, I know, are \nlikewise performing various volunteer services.\n  So, Mr. President, I want to send a heartfelt thanks to those in our \nState who have donated their time and energy. To the families of those \nwho have lost loved ones, we send our prayers and condolences. And to \nthe many others who have been affected by this, we want you to know \nthat people are committed to working to do everything we can to return \nthings to normal and to overcome this tragedy. It was an incredible \nstorm, but Michigan is an incredible State, and I know we will \nsuccessfully rebuild and put things back on track in a very short \nperiod of time.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/08/senate-section/article/S6971-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6971-S6972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ARE POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS VOLUNTARY?\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, on behalf of Mr. David Stewart and \nmillions of workers like him, who hold their political freedoms in this \ncountry in the highest regard, I send the June 25, 1997 Rules Committee \ntestimony of Mr. David Stewart of Owasso, Oklahoma to the desk and ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the testimony was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Testimony of David Stewart, Transport Workers Union of America-Local \n      514, regarding Senate Bill S. 9, the Paycheck Protection Act\n\n       My name is David Stewart, I am a member of the Transport \n     Workers Union of America, Local 514 located in Tulsa, \n     Oklahoma. I am here today to support changes in legislation \n     that will protect the hard earned money of myself, and my co-\n     workers. We are tired of funding political agendas and/or \n     candidates that we do not endorse or vote for. I want to \n     first make the point that I am not anti-union, I have \n     received decent wages and benefits as a result of my \n     membership with the T.W.U. and believe that union membership \n     is beneficial and would recommend that all working men and \n     women of the United States join in a union.\n       Let me submit a brief overview of my history in Organized \n     Labor. I became a union member (Transport Workers Union of \n     America) in September 1983, when I was hired as a welder at \n     American Airlines Inc. I was very interested in the affairs \n     of the union and attended all union meetings and quickly \n     became a Shop Steward around December 1983. As my interest \n     continued, I was offered Labor Study classes in the evenings \n     at Tulsa Junior College in 1984. I accepted and attended the \n     following courses: History, Organization, and Functions of \n     Unions, Labor and Politics, Labor Laws, and Grievance \n     Handling and Arbitration.\n       In 1985-86 I was elected Vice-President of the Northeastern \n     Oklahoma Labor Council. This was a very short lived position \n     as I am the father of three boys and the time needed to \n     perform these duties conflicted with my requirements as a \n     father and resigned this position after about eight months. \n     In any event, my involvement with the union continued as a \n     member. I continued my duties as Shop Steward and was very \n     involved with the Political Wing of the Union. This Political \n     Wing has a ``sign factory'' behind the Union Hall where \n     volunteers print, assemble, and distribute yard signs for \n     political campaigns. I spent many hours in this building \n     learning of political issues and candidates that the union \n     supported.\n       In 1991, I transferred to a newly created local in Fort \n     Worth, Texas. As I spent time away from Tulsa and the strong \n     political wing of the Tulsa local union, my personal\n\n[[Page S6972]]\n\n     political views began to change toward a more conservative \n     position and I began to realize that I really do not agree \n     with some of the agendas and the candidates that the union \n     endorses. Yet, we are all required to fund these agendas and \n     campaigns just by virtue of our membership in the union. As I \n     searched for relief from this unjust requirement, I found out \n     about the ``Beck Supreme Court Decision'' which in effect \n     gives a union member the right to a refund of the non-\n     bargaining expenditures of the union. The problem is, I must \n     relinquish my union membership and the rights associated with \n     that membership to seek this refund. It is absurd to require \n     me to fund the contract bargaining, contract enforcement and \n     administration of the Local, yet require me to forfeit my \n     rights to a voice in these affairs, only because I oppose the \n     political expenditures of the union. I still attend the union \n     meetings and enjoy having a voice in the affairs of the union \n     and my career, I am not willing to give up this activity to \n     receive the refund afforded me by the ``Beck Decision.''\n       In September of 1996, I transferred back to Tulsa as a Crew \n     Chief. I have duties and responsibilities covering the \n     assignments of 20 mechanics and welders. I have attended \n     about six union meetings in the past eight months, I have had \n     no conflicts with the union that would influence my decision \n     to come to Washington and testify. I would like to believe \n     that my status as a union member of the T.W.U. will not be \n     affected by my testimony before this committee.\n       My options under current law are best described as follows:\n       Option A:\n       During the month of January, of any given year I can send a \n     notice of my objection to the International Secretary \n     Treasurer. I must first assume non-member status in my union. \n     I am required to renew this objection in January of each year \n     to object for the subsequent twelve months. As an objector, I \n     shall have neither a voice nor a vote in the internal affairs \n     of the Local Union or of the International Union; nor shall I \n     have a voice or a vote in the ratification of or in any \n     matter connected with the collective bargaining agreement, \n     whether or not it covers my employment. My paycheck shall \n     continue to have a fee equal to full union dues deducted by \n     my employer and transmitted to the union. The Local and the \n     International, place these fees in an interest bearing escrow \n     account. After completion of an audit, I will receive a \n     rebate equal to an amount ascribed by the audit to non-\n     chargeable activities. This rebate of course does not \n     include any portion of the interest applied to the escrow \n     account. I can at my own expense challenge the validity of \n     the audit. This procedure is very cumbersome and probably \n     cost more than the challenge would change the audit \n     report.\n       Option B:\n       I can continue to fund all of the non-germane and political \n     expenditures of my union. This option allows me to maintain \n     the very important voice and vote in the affairs of the Local \n     and International Union. More importantly, as a bonus for \n     funding these activities, I have a voice and a vote in the \n     ratification of the collective bargaining agreement. It \n     should be pointed out here, that I will fund the collective \n     bargaining process regardless of which option I choose. I \n     only get a voice and a vote as a reward for funding the other \n     non-germane expenses.\n       Option C:\n       Seek assistance from my government representatives and \n     attempt to get the laws changed that hold my voice and vote \n     hostage as a result of the Supreme Court Beck Decision of \n     1988. The bottom line is this, I continue to fund the non-\n     germane expenditures so that I can receive the reward for \n     voice and vote in the union business associated with the \n     germane.\n       I am currently a participant for Option B, and I appear \n     before this committee today to exercise Option C.\n       It is my understanding that Organized Labor will oppose \n     this legislation. I find this to be an interesting position, \n     because it will not outlaw expenditures, only require consent \n     from each member. If Labor is convinced that the membership \n     supports their non-germane spending, they should also be \n     convinced that the consent to continue, and even an increase \n     in this spending should be very easy to obtain. I have no \n     pride in the 35 Million Dollar attack on members of Congress \n     in the election of last fall. I was disgusted to watch the \n     misleading television ads attacking decent members of \n     Congress, and I know many of my co-workers feel the same. On \n     the other hand, an active campaign has begun to garner \n     support for changes to the Federal Aviation Regulations, a \n     bill to equalize regulations between domestic and foreign \n     Aviation Repair Stations, this is a political expenditure \n     that myself, and my co-workers must spend whatever it takes \n     to seek support, this is one issue I should not oppose \n     expenditures and volunteer funds for. This is where I stop \n     and think to myself . . . why does everything require \n     political funding for passage? Or, why don't we just do the \n     right thing for the voter anymore? However, these hearings \n     are not about Federal Aviation Regulation changes, Republican \n     vs. Democrat, Pro-Union vs. Anti-Union, Right-to-Work Laws \n     vs. Union Security Agreements. The issue is about allowing \n     a union member to object to political expenditures and \n     retain the right to vote on issues associated with the \n     germane expenditures of the union that he will fund \n     regardless of which option described above is exercised.\n       I feel privileged to sit before this committee today, as \n     the debate over the campaign finance becomes the focus of our \n     government. Very few Americans today believe that a single \n     voter as myself without a huge bankroll of cash to fund the \n     next campaign could ever reach this level of participation. I \n     have already, and will continue to spread the word that \n     indeed with persistence and knowledge of the issue, a \n     constituent is still welcome on the hill.\n       I believe very strongly that the Paycheck Protection Act \n     introduced by Senator Nickles is the answer to my woe as a \n     union member. I can object to the collection by intimidation \n     of my hard earned money for political views and agendas I \n     oppose, yet continue to have involvement and support those \n     affairs of my union that I have no opposition to. It is \n     refreshing to see that my Senator, has the insight and \n     courage to help the union members of this country by \n     authoring ``the Paycheck Protection Act'' Senate Bill No. 9.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent that Tom Perez on my staff be \ngiven floor privileges.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/08/senate-section/article/S6971-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6972-S6973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          PRESIDENTIAL RACE INITIATIVE AND AFFIRMATIVE ACTION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend President Clinton for his \nimpressive Presidential initiative on race, which he announced in his \nrecent commencement address at the University of California, San Diego.\n  This initiative combines constructive dialog, study and action. It \ncarries forward the President's longstanding concern that the country \nmust remain One America, and that all Americans must have an \nopportunity to share in the American dream.\n  Too often, the race issue is used as a wedge to divide America.\n  President Clinton's goal is to unite America by examining where we \nhave been, and where we need to go, in order to achieve lasting racial \nreconciliation. President Clinton correctly recognizes that our \nNation's diversity is our greatest strength, and that we must improve \nthe ability of all Americans to realize their full potential.\n  Civil rights is still the unfinished business of America. We have \ncome a long way toward the goal of equal justice and opportunity. But \nas the church arson epidemic, the Texaco debacle, the O.J. Simpson \ntrial and the Good Ol' Boys Roundup demonstrate, we are not there yet.\n  Incredibly, there appear to be some who believe that discrimination \nis a thing of the past, and that the playing field is now level for \nwomen, for people of color, and for other victims of discrimination. \nThe facts clearly belie this claim.\n  The unemployment rate for African-Americans is twice that of whites. \nWomen still earn only 72 percent as much as men.\n  The average income of a Latina woman with a college degree is far \nless than that of a white man with a high school degree. The Glass \nCeiling Commission reported that 97 percent of the top executive \npositions in Fortune 500 companies are held by white men, although they \nare just 43 percent of the work force. In the Nation's largest \ncompanies, only 1 percent--1 percent--of senior management positions \nare held by Latinos or African-Americans.\n  Hate crimes continue to occur at alarming rates.\n  The scales of justice are supposed to be blind, but these figures \ndemonstrate that race and gender discrimination are distorting the \nbalance.\n  Yet, there are those who want to eliminate all affirmative action \nprograms, claiming that they have outlived their usefulness. It's time \nto dispel the barrage of misinformation about affirmative action.\n  Affirmative action is not about promoting or hiring unqualified women \nand minorities, admitting unqualified students, or awarding contracts \nto unqualified businesses.\n  Affirmative action has clearly worked in the Armed Forces. Does \nanybody doubt the qualifications of Gen. Colin Powell?\n  Affirmative action has clearly worked in education. College \nadmissions practices that allow universities to consider race as a \nfactor--not the main factor or the controlling factor--have a positive \nimpact on the ability of minorities to escape the cycle of poverty \nthrough education.\n  The overwhelming majority of educators feel that colleges and \nuniversities are failing in their mission if\n\n[[Page S6973]]\n\nthey ignore the diversity that is the essence of the American \nexperience.\n  Done right, affirmative action works. President Clinton's impressive \nand exhaustive review concluded that affirmative action is still an \neffective tool to expand economic and educational opportunities, and to \ncombat bigotry, exclusion and ignorance. I strongly support President \nClinton's ``mend it, don't end it'' prescription for affirmative \naction.\n  There has always been bipartisan support for affirmative action. From \nPresident Kennedy to President Nixon to President Clinton, there has \nbeen bipartisan support in the White House and Congress, because no one \ncan say with a straight face that the playing field is level for women \nand minorities.\n  In addition, President Clinton's nomination of Bill Lee to head the \nCivil Rights Division is also significant step in ensuring equal \njustice for all Americans. Bill Lee has dedicated his entire career to \nfinding real-life solutions to real life problems of discrimination. \nThe son of Chinese immigrants, Bill Lee grew up dirt poor in New York \nCity. His parents operated a laundry in a poor section of New York. \nBill Lee and his family suffered discrimination first hand, and know \nhow it feels to be taunted and excluded simply because of one's \nappearance.\n  But he overcame their barriers and graduated from Yale University and \nColumbia Law School with honors.\n  For the past 22 years, he has worked on behalf of all victims of \ndiscrimination --African Americans, Asian Americans, Latinos, women, \nand the poor. He has won remedies that have aided them financially, and \ngiven them hope that they too can be part of America.\n  His ability to forge consensus has earned him the respect of all \nAmericans. Republicans and Democrats alike, including Mayor Richard \nRiordan, and Senators Warner and Thurmond, have written letters of \nsupport on his behalf. I hope that he will be confirmed expeditiously \nso that he can help lead the effort to ensure that civil rights \nguarantees do not remain hollow promises.\n  The issue of discrimination is too important to become a political \nfootball in Congress. As we continue the discussion of race and gender, \nI urge my colleagues to support President Clinton's initiative, and \ncontinue the tradition of bipartisan support that has served this \ncountry well in recent decades. Our goal is still to guarantee equal \nopportunity for all Americans. Let us be sure that when we say ``all,'' \nwe mean ``all.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/08/senate-section/article/S6972-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6973-S6974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SUPPORT FOR THE ARTS ENDOWMENT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this week the House of Representatives \nwill take up the Department of Interior appropriations bill, which \nincludes funding for the National Endowment for the Arts.\n  It will be a watershed debate in Congress, because Republican \nextremists in the House are trying to eliminate Federal support for \nthis important agency. The House Appropriations Committee has \nrecommended only $10 million for the Endowment, and these funds would \nbe used only to phase out the agency. The misguided Republican goal is \nto eliminate direct Federal support for music, dance, symphonies, and \nother arts in communities across America.\n  The Republican position is so weak on the merits that the House \nleadership is attempting to use the parliamentary rules to block an up-\nor-down vote on the merits of this important issue.\n  Clearly, this unacceptable attack on the Arts Endowment deserves to \nbe rejected. The Endowment has raised the quality of the arts in \nAmerica. It has also strengthened support for the arts and interest in \nthe arts by Americans in all walks of life in cities, towns, and \nvillages in all parts of America.\n  For example, under the Endowment's tenure the number of orchestras in \nAmerica has doubled and the number of dance companies has increased \ntenfold. Other arts have witnessed similar expansions and earned broad \npublic approval.\n  An eloquent op-ed article in today's New York Times by the renowned \nactor, Alec Baldwin and Robert Lynch discusses the extraordinary record \nof achievement by the Arts Endowment. The article reminds each of us \nhow much is at risk in the current debate, and the cynical Republicans \nstrategy to prevent a vote on the merits. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe article may be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 8, 1997]\n\n                        Tyranny of the Minority\n\n                   (By Alec Baldwin and Robert Lynch)\n\n       Whether or not you believe the National Endowment for the \n     Arts should be eliminated, there is one basic principle upon \n     which we should all agree: Congress should at least vote on \n     the matter, and the majority should prevail.\n       This notion may seem obvious, but it is the very principle \n     that the House leadership is undermining. The House \n     Appropriations Committee recommended giving the endowment $10 \n     million for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1--only enough to \n     shut it down.\n       We believe that a clear majority of House members want to \n     reject this scheme. After all, poll after poll shows that the \n     public supports the endowment. The Senate leadership has \n     indicated that it is willing to continue the N.E.A.'s current \n     level of financing, and the White House has threatened to \n     veto any bill eliminating the agency altogether.\n       Despite these clear signals, House leaders are using \n     parliamentary rules to block an open and fair vote. The \n     leadership is requiring advocates for the N.E.A. to win a \n     procedural vote--before the bill can even be debated on the \n     House floor. If this sounds unfair, that's because it is.\n       Why does the House leadership want to drive this train into \n     a head-on collision? If Congress can't eliminate a small \n     agency like the N.E.A., conservatives argue, it can never cut \n     big-ticket items that will help balance the budget and reduce \n     the deficit. As Representative John Doolittle of California \n     put it, ``It is gut-check time for the entire House.''\n       This statement sounds compelling, but it's a red herring. \n     If anything, the N.E.A. actually helps balance the budget. \n     The endowment has helped a booming nonprofit arts industry, \n     which each year generates $36.8 billion in revenue and pays \n     $3.4 billion in Federal income taxes.\n       Every argument for elimination of the endowment crumbles \n     under scrutiny. Conservatives say the agency is elitist, but \n     the facts show that the N.E.A. actually helps average \n     American families gain more access to the arts. When \n     extremists argue that the Government should not be deciding \n     what is good art, the facts show that it is not the \n     Government, but panels of everyday citizens with working \n     knowledge and expertise in the arts who are the ones making \n     grant recommendations.\n       And although the agency is depicted as nothing but the \n     purveyor of pornography, the reality is far different. The \n     N.E.A. has made more than 112,000 grants supporting \n     everything from the design competition for the Vietnam \n     Memorial in Washington, to gospel music in Lyon, Miss. Fewer \n     than 40 grants have caused controversy--that means 99.96 \n     percent of the endowment's grants have been an unquestioned \n     success. Moreover, two years ago Congress tightened the rules \n     for N.E.A. grants to prevent further controversy.\n       Facts, however, no longer seem relevant when it comes to \n     the N.E.A. Some members of Congress continue to invent one \n     myth after another as a pretext for eliminating the N.E.A., \n     just so they can claim victory in some form, any form.\n       Dick Armey, the House majority leader, claims that a \n     handful of Republicans worked out a budget agreement two \n     years ago that pledged partial financing for the N.E.A. in \n     exchange for a phase-out of the agency over two years. As a \n     result, he is now calling for this new Congress to uphold \n     this alleged deal.\n       But Mr. Armey doesn't point out that this agreement was \n     specifically excluded in the final appropriations bill two \n     years ago. In fact, it was never included in any bill enacted \n     into law.\n       Even if the agreement were valid, Mr. Armey himself \n     provides a reason not to support it. Explaining why he was \n     not bound by the recent balanced budget agreement, he \n     recently said: ``The basic rule around this town is that if \n     you're not in the room and you don't make the agreement, \n     you're not bound by it.''\n       Mr. Armey makes an excellent point. He and other House \n     leaders should stop bullying rank-and-file members to \n     eliminate the N.E.A. After all, will Americans think that \n     using arcane parliamentary rules to eliminate the endowment \n     is an achievement worthy of the 105th Congress?\n\n  Mr COCHRAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S6974]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/08/senate-section/article/S6973-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6973-S6974]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SUPPORT FOR THE ARTS ENDOWMENT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

The House \n     Appropriations Committee recommended giving the endowment $10 \n     million for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1--only enough to \n     shut it down.\n       We believe that a clear majority of House members want to \n     reject this scheme. After all, poll after poll shows that the \n     public supports the endowment. The Senate leadership has \n     indicated that it is willing to continue the N.E.A.'s current \n     level of financing, and the White House has threatened to \n     veto any bill eliminating the agency altogether.\n       Despite these clear signals, House leaders are using \n     parliamentary rules to block an open and fair vote. The \n     leadership is requiring advocates for the N.E.A. to win a \n     procedural vote--before the bill can even be debated on the \n     House floor. If this sounds unfair, that's because it is.\n       Why does the House leadership want to drive this train into \n     a head-on collision? If Congress can't eliminate a small \n     agency like the N.E.A., conservatives argue, it can never cut \n     big-ticket items that will help balance the budget and reduce \n     the deficit. As Representative John Doolittle of California \n     put it, ``It is gut-check time for the entire House.''\n       This statement sounds compelling, but it's a red herring. \n     If anything, the N.E.A. actually helps balance the budget. \n     The endowment has helped a booming nonprofit arts industry, \n     which each year generates $36.8 billion in revenue and pays \n     $3.4 billion in Federal income taxes.\n       Every argument for elimination of the endowment crumbles \n     under scrutiny. Conservatives say the agency is elitist, but \n     the facts show that the N.E.A. actually helps average \n     American families gain more access to the arts. When \n     extremists argue that the Government should not be deciding \n     what is good art, the facts show that it is not the \n     Government, but panels of everyday citizens with working \n     knowledge and expertise in the arts who are the ones making \n     grant recommendations.\n       And although the agency is depicted as nothing but the \n     purveyor of pornography, the reality is far different. The \n     N.E.A. has made more than 112,000 grants supporting \n     everything from the design competition for the Vietnam \n     Memorial in Washington, to gospel music in Lyon, Miss. Fewer \n     than 40 grants have caused controversy--that means 99.96 \n     percent of the endowment's grants have been an unquestioned \n     success. Moreover, two years ago Congress tightened the rules \n     for N.E.A. grants to prevent further controversy.\n       Facts, however, no longer seem relevant when it comes to \n     the N.E.A. Some members of Congress continue to invent one \n     myth after another as a pretext for eliminating the N.E.A., \n     just so they can claim victory in some form, any form.\n       Dick Armey, the House majority leader, claims that a \n     handful of Republicans worked out a budget agreement two \n     years ago that pledged partial financing for the N.E.A. in \n     exchange for a phase-out of the agency over two years. As a \n     result, he is now calling for this new Congress to uphold \n     this alleged deal.\n       But Mr. Armey doesn't point out that this agreement was \n     specifically excluded in the final appropriations bill two \n     years ago. In fact, it was never included in any bill enacted \n     into law.\n       Even if the agreement were valid, Mr. Armey himself \n     provides a reason not to support it. Explaining why he was \n     not bound by the recent balanced budget agreement, he \n     recently said: ``The basic rule around this town is that if \n     you're not in the room and you don't make the agreement, \n     you're not bound by it.''\n       Mr. Armey makes an excellent point. He and other House \n     leaders should stop bullying rank-and-file members to \n     eliminate the N.E.A. After all, will Americans think that \n     using arcane parliamentary rules to eliminate the endowment \n     is an achievement worthy of the 105th Congress?\n\n  Mr COCHRAN.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 658, As Modified\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to and will speak briefly on \nan issue that I think is of significance and importance as we are \naddressing the defense authorization bill, and that is the amendment of \nthe Senator from Indiana, Senator Lugar.\n  I urge that the Senate support his amendment to restore the cuts made \nin the Nunn-Lugar cooperative threat reduction programs in the \nDepartment of Defense and related nuclear material security programs in \nthe Department of Energy. The funds spent on these programs are the \nmost important cost-effective contribution to our national security \nthat we can make.\n  Today, and for the foreseeable future, the greatest threat to \nnational security involves potential terrorist acts using weapons of \nmass destruction. And it is ironic that after living for 40 years under \nthe specter of a cold war nuclear holocaust, the prospect of a nuclear \nexplosion taking place within the United States has actually increased \nsince the dissolution of the former Soviet Union. This is the ominous \nview of both the intelligence community and the Department of Defense. \nAny defense bill we enact must deal responsibly with this threat.\n  We have taken significant steps to do so in recent years. In 1991, \nSenator Nunn and Senator Lugar initiated the Cooperative Threat \nReduction Program. The basic concept of that program and the nuclear \nmaterials safety programs at the Department of Energy is that paying \nfor the destruction and safeguarding of nuclear weapons in the states \nof the former Soviet Union increases the security of America itself.\n  The accomplishments of these programs offer convincing evidence that \nthe Nunn-Lugar program works. The Defense Department has already helped \nto fund the elimination of 6,000 nuclear warheads in nations of the \nformer Soviet Union. Never again will these weapons threaten the United \nStates.\n  The funds for the Nunn-Lugar and related programs are the most cost-\neffective dollars spent in the entire defense budget.\n  They support the complete destruction of nuclear weapons in the \nnations of the former Soviet Union.\n  They strengthen border controls to prevent the illegal transport of \nnuclear bomb-making materials.\n  They support efforts to protect these materials from theft at their \nstorage sites or during transport.\n  They provide employment and economic incentives for former Soviet \nweapons scientists to avoid the temptation that they will sell their \nknow-how to buyers from nations and organizations that support \ninternational terrorism.\n  They fund cooperative efforts to match U.S. commercial applications \nwith the Russian defense industry.\n  Since these programs began, Congress has fully funded the \nadministration's budget requests until this year. The current committee \nbill reduces the President's request by $135 million. The bill takes \n$60 million from the Defense Department's Cooperative Threat Reduction \nProgram, which the department intended to use to help Ukraine destroy \nits SS-24 intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n  We specifically encouraged the new Government of Ukraine to take this \nstep because these missiles pose a clear and present danger to our \nnational security. It is a costly operation, but few are more \nworthwhile. It is imperative that we maintain fully funded and well-\nstructured programs to deal with all aspects of this serious threat.\n  The initiatives undertaken in this area by the Department of Energy \nare equally essential. The International Nuclear Safety Program \nupgrades safety devices on Chernobyl-era nuclear reactors. Yet, its \nfunding has been cut by $50 million.\n  The Materials Protection, Control, and Accounting Program supports \nefforts to identify and store the nuclear materials that are most \nlikely to be stolen. Yet, its funding is cut by $25 million.\n  Under these two programs, the Department of Energy has succeeded in \nmaking tons of nuclear weapons materials secure, primarily plutonium \nand highly enriched uranium. Previously, these materials had not been \nprotected by even the most elementary security precautions. These \nmaterials posed grave threats to our national security, and they still \ndo.\n  Alarming public reports in recent years have mentioned cases where \nnuclear materials were intercepted at border crossings. We can only \nwonder how many shipments have gone undetected at border crossings and \nwhether terrorists even now have custody of these materials.\n  The National Research Council released a report this spring on U.S. \nproliferation policy and the former Soviet Union. Its first and \nstrongest recommendation is full funding for the Materials Protection, \nControl, and Accounting Program.\n\n[[Page S6975]]\n\n  The report goes on to express strong support for the overall \nDepartments of Defense and Energy CTR Programs. But the material \nprotection program was specifically singled out as the most important \narea for additional funding.\n\n  The reason is clear. Bomb-grade nuclear weapon material poses so \ngreat a threat to national security that the United States should do \nall we can to work with Russia to guarantee these materials are safely \nstored--no ifs, ands, or buts. There is no margin for error, none \nwhatsoever.\n  The design and manufacture of a crude homemade nuclear weapon is a \nrelatively easy task if the needed uranium or plutonium is available. \nIt takes just 10 pounds of plutonium--about a single handful--to \nutterly destroy any American city.\n  Without a major ongoing effort to identify, catalog, transport, \nstore, and eventually reprocess or destroy Russia's nuclear material, \nit is just a matter of time before some terrorist group becomes a \nnuclear power. That is why these programs are so important. That is \nwhat restoring these funds is all about. The last thing we need is to \nlook the other way as the next Timothy McVeigh prepares to destroy an \nentire American city.\n  Over the years we have spent billions of dollars building our nuclear \nweapons and implementing strategies to prevent nuclear war. Now when a \nrelatively small sum of money can deal with this current threat, how \ncan we afford not to? If a terrorist explodes a nuclear weapon in the \nUnited States, we may well never know who to retaliate against.\n  It may already be too late. But we hope and pray it is not. We must \ndo more--much more--to see that the current loose controls over nuclear \nweapons and bomb-making materials in the nations of the former Soviet \nUnion do not result in a nuclear terrorist attack on the United States \nor any other nation.\n  There will be no comfort in saying the morning after, ``If only we \nhad done more.'' Now is the time to do more. Restoring these funds is \nthe indispensable first step toward doing more, doing it, and doing it \nas soon as possible.\n  I commend the Senator from Indiana for his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kyl \nand Senator Coverdell be added as cosponsors to amendment No. 420 \noffered by Senator Cochran.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand, and I have been briefed that \nthere will be an amendment proposed on behalf of several Senators to \nincrease the amount for National Guard Civilian Youth Opportunity \nProgram to $48 million and to provide a substitute for the provision \nextending and revising the authority of the program.\n  Mr. President, I strongly object to this amendment. It is already at \n$20 million. The fundamental question here arises when we are \ncomplaining about the fact that there is not enough money for flying \ntime, there is not enough money for pay raises, there is not enough \nmoney for quality of life for men and women who are in the military who \nare serving, and there is not enough money for modernization of the \nforce--and every military leader will tell you that--and now we want to \nadd $28 million to a program which, really, the National Guard has no \nbusiness being in. It has no business being in a Civilian Youth \nOpportunity Program.\n  Oftentimes we refer to the job and role of our Founding Fathers, Mr. \nPresident. Who in our Founding Fathers thought that the job of the \nNational Guard was to administer Civilian Youth Opportunity Programs?\n  The National Guard, I am told by my colleagues who are in areas where \nthere have been floods, devastation, and other disasters, has its hands \nfull. The National Guard has a great deal of difficulty in maintaining \ntraining levels of efficiency. We found that out during Operation \nDesert Storm. Now we want to add $28 million to a program that the \nNational Guard has no business being in.\n  Mr. President, I am sure when we have a recorded vote on this--and I \nwill demand a recorded vote--that it will carry overwhelmingly, just \nlike the military construction appropriations bill that is coming \nbefore us will carry overwhelmingly that has billions of dollars of \nwasteful and pork barrel spending, but sooner or later, sooner or \nlater, Mr. President, the American people are going to be fed up. They \nare going to stop supporting spending for national defense and they \nwill stop because they see this kind of unnecessary and wasteful and \npork barrel spending.\n  I read in the newspaper today the military construction bill has some \n$900 million additional for projects that the administration or the \nDepartment of Defense could not find anywhere on their priority list--\nnowhere to be found on their priority list as being necessary, but they \nalso happen to match up to districts of powerful Members of the other \nbody's committee.\n  It has to stop, Mr. President. A lot of people are getting tired of \nit. I am sure, as has happened on many other occasions, that when we \nhave a recorded vote on this, it will carry overwhelmingly, but sooner \nor later we will ask ourselves the question, When are we going to spend \nthe money where the priorities are, according to the leaders of the \nmilitary, both military and civilian? It certainly isn't in this \nprogram. Is $28 million a lot of money? Certainly not in this entire \nbill. But it is symptomatic of the problem that has afflicted defense \nspending for too long and is becoming epidemic. The House \noverwhelmingly wants to spend what potentially would be $27 billion \nadditionally for B-2 bombers that they can't find a military leader who \nwill say we need. $27 billion. We hear time after time that we are not \nmodernizing the force, that we are losing quality men and women out of \nthe military, we are having to lower our recruitment standards in order \nto meet our quotas. What are we going to do to solve it? Spend $27 \nbillion on B-2 bombers, add $28 million to the National Guard, and the \npork barrel list goes on and on and on.\n\n  I am telling you, from talking to my constituents, people are getting \na little weary of it, Mr. President. So when this amendment comes up, I \ntell the chairman and the Democrat manager, I will want to talk again \non it, not because it is a lot of money--$28 million is not a lot of \nmoney in a defense bill--but it is the wrong thing to do. It is wrong \nwhat we are doing in military construction in the bill and wrong what \nwe are doing authorizing projects and programs that we don't need, when \nat the same time there are severe and fundamental problems in the \nmilitary that are not being addressed, which means that the Congress of \nthe United States isn't performing its responsibilities in a mature \nfashion and in a way that will provide for the national security of \nthis country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I offer an amendment that would extend \nthe Chiropractic Health Care Demonstration Project for 2 years.\n  Mr. President, I believe this amendment has been cleared by the other \nside.\n  Mr. President, I urge that the Senate adopt this amendment.\n\n[[Page S6976]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I propose an amendment that would extend \nthe Chiropractic Health Care Demonstration Program for 2 years and \nwould include the National Capitol region as a demonstration site.\n  In the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1995, \nCongress directed the Secretary of Defense to conduct a demonstration \nprogram to determine whether chiropractic health care should be \nprovided as part of the military health care system. The legislation \nrequires a comprehensive evaluation of the program. Representatives of \nthe chiropractic health care community are required to be included in \nthe evaluation process.\n  The National Capitol region was not one of the 10 sites selected to \nbe part of the demonstration. My amendment would expand the \ndemonstration to include the National Capitol region. In order to \ninclude the experiences of chiropractic care in the National Capitol \nregion in the evaluation, I propose to extend the demonstration program \nfor 2 additional years. I am confident that this amendment will result \nin a better evaluation of the chiropractic care demonstration.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the amendment has been cleared on this \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, without \nobjection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 744) was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND.

However, the donee shall defray \n     any expense for shipping or other transportation of property \n     donated under this section from the location of the property \n     when donated to any other location.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, when the Pilgrims boarded the Mayflower and \nset sail for a new world, they were searching for a land where they \nwould be free to worship God as they wished. Our Founding Fathers, \ninspired by their example, incorporated the principle of religious \nfreedom into our national fabric. The importance of this principle to \nour national character is emphasized by its honored place in the first \nclause of our Bill of Rights which reads ``Congress shall make no law \nrespecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free \nexercise thereof.''\n  In spite of this protection, some citizens have, at times, sought to \ndeny others the right to worship. In extreme cases, this intolerance \nhas turned to violence as houses of worship were desecrated by fire or \nvandalism. Last month, the National Church Arson Task Force released a \nreport that found no evidence of a nationwide conspiracy behind the \nfires. I never believed there was a conspiracy but that finding does \nnot diminish the suffering of the congregations in my home State and \nacross the United States who have been victimized in these incidents.\n  Let there be no doubt, Mr. President, no act is more despicable than \nthe desecration of a house of worship. It is fitting that the \nperpetrators of such a heinous crime be apprehended and prosecuted to \nthe full extent of the law, I commend the Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement officials who work diligently to investigate these \nshameless acts and to prevent their recurrence.\n  Mr. President, while stories of church burnings are no longer on the \nfront page of every newspaper or the lead story on the evening news, \nthe victims remain. The pastor of one of those congregations, Pastor \nBrenda Stevenson of the New Outreach Christian Center in Charlotte, \nwhich was destroyed by an arsonist in 1995, recently wrote me about her \nchurch's effort to rebuild. She informed me that her congregation was \nable to rebuild with the help of the Christian Coalition's Samaritan \nproject and the Save the Churches fund but that further help was \nneeded. Specifically, Pastor Stevenson requested that excess religious \nproperty, formerly used in closed military chapels, be made available \nto churches that have suffered these terrible acts.\n  I am told that precisely such property has been found at Fort Bragg, \nNC, where several old wooden chapels were closed as part of a \nconsolidation. The approximately $25,000 worth of property, including \n65 oak pews, 3 altars, 2 pulpits, communion sets, and other religious \nproperty, has been declared excess to the needs of Fort Bragg and would \nordinarily be sold at auction to the highest bidder. Similar property \nmay also be available at other Army installations.\n  I agree with Pastor Stevenson that the Army should be allowed to \ndonate this surplus property to some of the churches damaged or \ndestroyed as a result of arson or terrorism. The amendment I am \nintroducing gives the Secretary of the Army authority to donate such \nproperty as it becomes available at Army installations.\n  Mr. President, I know this matter may seem of little consequence to \nsome considering that Congress is considering a budget in excess of \n$1.7 trillion dollars. However, the gift of this furniture and \nreligious property can mean a very great deal to congregations such as \nthe New Outreach Christian Center that are struggling to rebuild.\n  Moreover, it is appropriate that Fort Bragg, home of the XVIII \nAirborne Corps, 82d Airborne Division, and special operations force, \nwhich have done so much to protect our liberties abroad, be permitted \nto contribute to the defense of those liberties at home. I invite my \ncolleagues to join in support of this bill so that some small measure \nof relief can be provided to these victims.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Pastor \nStevenson's letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                New Outreach Christian Center,\n\n                                      Charlotte, NC, June 6, 1997.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Helms: The New Outreach Christian Center was \n     desecrated by an arson March 14, 1995. This horrific act \n     shocked our community and the county. With the assistance of \n     the ``Save the Churches Fund'' grant of the Christian \n     Coalition we were able to rebuild our house of worship.\n       The Samaritan Project, an outgrowth of the ``Save the \n     Churches Fund'' has notified us that the military may have \n     furniture, materials and equipment which could be of further \n     help to our church. I ask that legislation be initiated that \n     would allow churches that have been harmed by acts of \n     violence to receive the items from these closed chapels. This \n     could assist my church and others throughout the country.\n       Please move forward on this issue. As a country we cannot \n     accept violence against any house of worship, and must unite \n     to help rebuild them. If there are any questions please call \n     Pastor Brenda Stevenson.\n           Thank you and God Bless,\n                                                 Brenda Stevenson,\n                                                           Pastor.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Secretary shall submit such \n     certification, if at all, not later than January 1, 2003.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, more than 20 years ago Congress passed \nthe Resource Conservation and Recovery Act to promote Government \npurchases of products made from recycled materials. Since then, State \nand local governments throughout the country have enacted similar \npolicies. Ten years ago, only 13 States and a handful of local \ngovernments had buy recycled laws. Today, at least 45 States and more \nthan 500 local governments have established legal requirements to \npurchase recycled content products. In 1993, the administration issued \nExecutive Order 12873 which reinforced the principle of increasing the \nFederal Government's use of recycled-content products, especially paper \nproducts.\n  Yet in 1996, the Department of Defense, the single largest consumer \nof copy paper in the world, had a compliance record of only 14 percent \nregarding its procurement of copy paper. Although DOD should be \ncomplimented for recently volunteering to buy only recycled-content \ncopy paper, its decision was due to the General Services \nAdministration's initiative to set the price of recycled paper at 5 \ncents cheaper than virgin paper. History leads us to assume that DOD \nwill revert to the policy of buying virgin paper should the price shift \na nickel.\n  Well, Mr. President, price is important, but it is only one factor in \nthe equation. As the largest user, DOD must be the role model for other \nGovernment agencies and comply with the intent of Congress and the \nadministration. This amendment affords DOD the flexibility of buying \nnonrecycled paper if the price differential is unreasonable compared to \nvirgin paper, while defining the term ``unreasonable'' as ``greater \nthan 7 percent''.\n  Additionally, the intent of this amendment is to cause Defense \nDepartment procurement offices to buy copy paper in an environmentally \nresponsible manner and is not meant to place unreasonable constraints \non the process. It, therefore, contains provisions which allow \nprocuring agencies to choose not to buy the recycled paper if the \nproduct is unavailable within a reasonable period of time, or if the \nproduct does not meet reasonable performance standards.\n  Finally, this amendment builds on the intent of the executive order \nand extends it into the 21st century. Under this amendment, the \nrequired postconsumer content will rise to 50 percent in 2004. This \ninitiative is based upon ongoing technological advances within the \npaper industry and the expectation that they will push down the cost of \nrecycled paper in future years. If DOD cannot meet this requirement, a \nprovision is included in the amendment which will allow them to report \nto Congress for purposes of gaining a deferment.\n  Mr. President, only through legislative action can we ensure that DOD \nwill continue to shoulder its environmental responsibilities and serve \nas the role model it must be.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 746) was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 747\n\n (Purpose: To improve the provisions on depot inventory, and financial \n                           management reform)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Harkin and Durbin, I \noffer an amendment which would modify language in the bill addressing \ninventory management, depot management, and financial management \nissues.\n  I understand this amendment has been cleared on the other side.\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 59, after line 14, add the following new paragraph \n     (3):\n       ``(3) The Secretary of a military department may conduct a \n     pilot program, consistent with applicable requirements of \n     law, to test any practices referred to in paragraph (2) that \n     the Secretary determines could improve the efficiency and \n     effectiveness of depot-level operations, improve the support \n     provided by depot-level activities for the armed forces user \n     of the services of such activities for the armed forces user \n     of the services of such activities, and enhance readiness by \n     reducing the time that it takes to repair equipment.''\n       On page 101, between lines 21 and 22, insert the following:\n       ``(3) For the purposes of this section, the term `best \n     commercial inventory practice' includes a so-called prime \n     vendor arrangement and any other practice that the Director \n     determines will enable the Defense Logistics Agency to reduce \n     inventory levels and holding costs while improving the \n     responsiveness of the supply system to user needs.''\n       On page 268, line 8, strike out ``(L)'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof the following:\n       ``(L) Actions that can be taken to ensure that each \n     comptroller position and each comparable position in the \n     Department of Defense, whether filled by a member of the\n\n[[Page S6979]]\n\n     Armed Forces or a civilian employee, is filled by a person \n     who, by reason of education, technical competence, and \n     experience, has the core competencies for financial \n     management.\n       ``(M)''.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I offer an amendment with Senator Richard \nDurbin regarding some much needed reforms in the way the Department of \nDefense manages its inventory of goods, as well as its financial \nmanagement systems. Our amendment modifies some very useful language \nthat is included in the Senate Armed Services Committee version of the \nDefense Authorization bill.\n  I first would like to applaud the members of the Armed Services \nCommittee for including provisions in the bill that moves the DOD \ntoward better management of its finances and inventories. These \nprovisions are important steps toward fixing some critical problems. We \nbelieve that our amendment adds a few simple improvements to the \ncommittee provisions.\n  One element of our amendment requires that the DOD take actions to \nensure that its comptrollers are adequately trained. Afterall, the \ncomptroller is the key technical expert who overseas and manages the \nday-to-day financial operations. For example, the comptroller of the \nPacific Fleet, billeted for a Navy captain, is responsible for the \nfinancial management and financial reporting of an annual budget of \nabout $5 billion, comparable in size to a Fortune 500 corporation.\n  Earlier this year, I released a General Accounting Office report, \nentitled ``Financial Management: Opportunities to Improve Experience \nand Training of Key Navy Comptrollers.'' The GAO report states that the \nNavy's financial and accounting systems have been substantially \nhampered by the fact that the Navy has no specific career path for \nfinancial officers, has inadequate financial management and accounting \neducation standards for comptroller jobs, and has a policy of rotating \nofficers too often through key accounting positions. In the report, GAO \npointed to these personnel practices as one cause of GAO findings of \nmisstatements in almost all of the Navy's major accounts.\n  The GAO report recommended that the Secretary of Defense ensure that \nthe following steps are taken by the Navy, all of which are applicable \nto the other Armed Services:\n  Identify which key military comptroller positions can be converted to \ncivilian status in order to gain greater continuity, technical \ncompetency, and cost savings.\n  For those comptroller positions identified for conversion to civilian \nstatus, ensure that those positions are filled by individuals who \npossess both the proper education and experience.\n  For those comptroller positions that should remain in military \nbillets, establish a career path in the financial management and \nensures that military officers are prepared, both in terms of education \nand experience, for comptrollership responsibilities.\n  This year, I also released, along with Senator Durbin, Congressman \nPeter DeFazio and Congresswoman Maloney, a second GAO report that \naddressed some critical problems with the DOD's inventory practices. \n``Defense Logistics: Much of the Inventory Exceeds Current Needs'' \ndetailed billions of dollars in unneeded supplies and equipment within \nthe DOD's inventory. Although DOD has made some progress in reducing \nthe overstock in its inventory, much more needs to be done. This is \nespecially true in its overstock of spare parts and hardware items.\n  I agree with the committee's attempt to institutionalize best \ncommercial practices in the management of DOD's inventory, especially \nfor the inventory of spare parts. Our amendment simply requires the DOD \nto implement pilot programs when needed. It also clarifies the \ndefinition of best commercial practices to include the so-called prime \nvendor arrangements which have proven very successful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 747) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 748\n\n(Purpose: To streamline electronic commerce requirements and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Thompson and \nGlenn, I offer an amendment which would amend the requirements in the \nFederal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 to allow electronic \ncommerce at DOD and other Federal agencies to be implemented in a cost-\neffective manner consistent with commercial practices.\n  The amendment would also make changes to current procurement law to \nconform civilian agency statutes to DOD statutes regarding the \nperformance-based contracting and to revise a pilot program for the \npurchase of information technology to make it more competitive by \nallowing more than one vendor to participate in the program.\n  Mr. President, I believe this amendment has been cleared by the other \nside, and I urge that the Senate adopt this amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the amendment has been cleared on this \nside. It is a good amendment. We support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Thurmond], for Mr. \n     Thompson, for himself, and Mr. Glenn, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 748.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself as chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee and Senator \nGlenn, the committee's ranking minority member. We thank the chairman \nand ranking member of the Armed Services Committee for their \ncooperation and assistance in preparing this amendment which will \nbenefit not only the procurement process within the Department of \nDefense, but other agencies across the Federal Government as well.\n  The amendment which we offer today began as a request from the \nadministration to include additional procurement-related reforms to \nthose enacted over the last 4 years and those already included in S. \n936. Our amendment includes the following provisions:\n  First, it would amend current Governmentwide procurement law which \nrequires the development and implementation of a Governmentwide Federal \nAcquisition Computer Network architecture--called FACNET and enacted as \npart of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 [FASA]. At the \ntime, Congress intended to require the Government to evolve its \nacquisition process from a paper-based process to an electronic \nprocess. The specific intent of FACNET was to provide a common \narchitecture to implement electronic commerce within the Governmentwide \nprocurement system.\n  However, GAO recently reviewed the Government's progress in \ndeveloping and implementing FACNET, and concluded that, in the short \ntime since passage of FASA, alternative electronic purchasing methods \nhave become readily available to the Government and its vendors. Given \nthese advances in technology, the overly proscriptive requirements of \nFASA and problems with implementation by the agencies, GAO questioned \nwhether and to what extent FACNET makes good business sense. GAO \nrecommended that if the FACNET requirements were an impediment to the \nimplementation of a Governmentwide electronic commerce strategy, then \nlegislative changes should be enacted. This amendment would provide \nthose changes to give flexibility to implement electronic commerce at \nDOD and other Federal agencies in an efficient and cost-effective \nmanner consistent with commercial practice.\n  Further, the amendment would make technical changes to current \nprocurement law to: First, conform civilian agency statutes to DOD \nstatues regarding performance-based contracting; and second, revise a \npilot program for the purchase of information technology to make it \nmore competitive by allowing more than one vendor in the pilot.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 748) was agreed to.\n\n[[Page S6980]]\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

SELECTION PROCESS FOR DONATION OF THE USS MISSOURI\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The USS Missouri is a ship of historical significance \n     that commands considerable public interest.\n       (2) The Navy has undertaken to donate the USS Missouri to a \n     recipient that would memorialize the ship's historical \n     significance appropriately and has selected a recipient \n     pursuant to that undertaking.\n       (3) More than one year after the applicants for selection \n     began working on their proposals in accordance with \n     requirements previously specified by the Navy, the Navy \n     imposed two additional requirements and afforded the \n     applicants only two weeks to respond to the new requirements, \n     requirement, never previously used in any previous donation \n     process.\n       (4) Despite the inadequacy of the opportunity afforded \n     applicants to comply with the two new requirements, and \n     without informing the applicants of the intent to do so, the \n     Navy officials gave three times as much weight to the new \n     requirements than they did to their own original requirements \n     in evaluating the applications.\n       (5) Moreover, Navy officials revised the evaluation \n     subcriteria for the ``public benefits'' requirements after \n     all applications had been submitted and reviewed, thereby \n     never giving applicants an opportunity to address their \n     applications to the revised subcriteria.\n       (6) The General Accounting Office criticized the revised \n     process for inadequate notice and causing all applications to \n     include inadequate information.\n       (7) In spite of the GAO critria, the Navy has refused to \n     reopen its donations process for the Missouri\n       (b) New Donee Selection Process.--(1) the Secretary of the \n     Navy shall--\n       (A) set aside the selection of a recipient for donation of \n     the USS Missouri;\n       (B) initiate a new opportunity for application and \n     selection of a recipient for donation of the USS Missouri \n     that opens not later than 30 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act; and\n       (C) in the new application of selection effort--\n       (i) disregard all applications received, and evaluations \n     made of those applications, before the new opportunity is \n     opened;\n       (ii) permit any interested party to apply for selection as \n     the donee of the USS Missouri; and\n       (iii) ensure that all requirements, criteria, and \n     evaluation methods, including the relative importance of each \n     requirement and criterion, are clearly communicated to each \n     applicant.\n       (2) After the date on which the new opportunity for \n     application and selection for donation of the USS Missouri is \n     opened, the navy may not add to or revise the requirements \n     and evaluation criteria that are applicable in the selection \n     process on that date.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nFeinstein be added as a cosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the U.S.S. Missouri, the battleship on \nwhich the Japanese surrender was signed in 1945, was decommissioned, \nmothballed and home ported in Bremerton, WA, from 1954 until it was \nrecommissioned in 1986. It was during that period of time, of course, a \nmajor and treasured tourist attraction located relatively conveniently \nin the continental United States.\n  In 1995, the Missouri was decommissioned for a second time and \nreturned to Bremerton. The U.S. Navy then made the Missouri available \nfor donation to a community willing and able to transform the ship into \na world class maritime museum honoring the men and women who served in \nWorld War II.\n  The Save the Missouri Committee in Bremerton competed with four other \napplicants in Hawaii and California under the same rules that had been \napplied to all previous Navy donations.\n  I want to emphasize that once again, Mr. President. These were \ngeneral Navy donation rules under which Bremerton and the other four \ncities competed.\n\n[[Page S6982]]\n\n  At the last minute, however, when it was likely that Bremerton would \nbe chosen under those rules, the Navy added two new requirements, \nfailing to tell any of the applicants that the two new requirements \nwould count for 75 percent of the ultimate decision and that the \nearlier rules were only 25 percent.\n  The applicants had 2 weeks to respond. None of the applicants, \naccording to the Navy's own evaluation team, responded adequately. \nNevertheless, the Navy awarded the Missouri to Honolulu based \nexclusively on those new requirements.\n  The General Accounting Office then reviewed the Navy process. It \ncriticized it on just the grounds that I have outlined. The Navy \nnevertheless has refused to reopen the process for the four losing \napplicants, Bremerton and the three in California.\n  Mr. President, during this entire process, I never interfered and \ntold the Navy what answer it should come up with. I simply assumed that \nthe Navy would do so on an objective and on a nonpolitical basis.\n  Now, however, I must say that, based on my own experience and the \nreport of the General Accounting Office, I am outraged at the Navy's \nlack of objectivity and its indifference to fairness.\n  This amendment, therefore, sponsored by myself, my colleague from \nWashington, and Senator Feinstein from California, will not decide the \nquestion in favor of one of our cities. It simply requires the Navy to \nreopen the question and to treat all five applicants fairly and under \nthe same rules that were imposed at the beginning of the process rather \nthan being added at the end. It is as simple as that. Mr. President, \nsomething that the Navy should have done in the first place it would be \nrequired to do by this amendment.\n  Obviously, the location of the Missouri, given its historic nature, \nis a matter of significance to all of the applicants and, I think, to \nall Americans and most especially to those who served in World War II.\n  Obviously, I would prefer the ultimate location to be in my own \nState. But I have not demanded in the past, nor do I demand now, that \nthe Navy decide in my favor. I simply ask that it make this decision \nobjectively--nothing more and nothing less.\n  For that reason, I ask for the support of my colleagues for this \nmodest proposal.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my Washington State \ncolleague in offering this amendment to require the Navy to revisit the \nawarding of the U.S.S. Missouri. I have followed closely the Navy's \nhandling of the Missouri; working with Senator Gorton, Congressman Norm \nDicks, the Washington congressional delegation, and my constituents. I \nam also pleased that California Senators have joined this effort to \nquestion the Navy's Missouri decision.\n  The history of the ``Mighty Mo'' is known all across our country and \nthroughout the world. This is a relic of immense importance and \nhistorical significance. It was on the decks of this great battleship \nthat World War II came to a welcome end. The Missouri is particularly \nvalued by the residents of my State where she has been berthed for most \nof the last 40 years in Bremerton. She is a source of great pride to \nveterans in my State; many of whom served in World War II including in \nthe Pacific theater and aboard the ``Mighty Mo.''\n  Following the Navy's decision to remove the Missouri from the Naval \nVessel Register, five proposals were submitted to the Navy from \ncommunities interested in taking ownership of the famed battleship. \nBremerton, WA was among the five applicants seeking to display and \nhonor the Missouri. San Diego, San Francisco and Honolulu all submitted \nproposals.\n  Each community vying for the Missouri submitted voluminous \napplications to the Navy responding within a year's time to a set of \nNavy criteria previously used in the disposition of the U.S.S. \nLexington. While I cannot speak for the other applicants, I know of the \ncare, the time, and the commitment demonstrated by the Bremerton \ncommunity in preparing its proposal to the Navy. Bremerton's proposal \nto permanently display the Missouri was delivered to the Navy in \nOctober 1995.\n  Last August, the Secretary of the Navy announced the decision to \naward the Missouri to Honolulu, HI. Following the Navy's decision, \nsignificant questions were raised regarding the Navy's process in \nawarding the battleship. Congressman Norm Dicks in his capacity as a \nsenior member of the House Appropriations Committee requested a General \nAccounting Office study on the Navy's donation process of the Missouri.\n  It is the results of this GAO study that bring us here today. Since \ncoming to the Congress, I have sought to let the Sun shine on the \npolitical process--to share with the public the great decisions before \nthis body. The GAO study demonstrates that the Navy also needs a little \nsunshine.\n  Here's what the GAO found in reviewing the Navy process. Following \nthe review of applications, the Navy added new and previously unused \ncriteria to the selection process. And, according to the GAO, the Navy \ndid not do a good job communicating the relative importance of the new \nevaluation criteria. According to the GAO, several of the applicants \nreported that the Navy gave them the mistaken impression that the \nadditional requirements were not that significant.\n  Shockingly, these new criteria were actually given 75 percent of the \ndonation award weight. After more than 1 year of discussion among the \ninterested communities, the Navy changed the rules and failed to \nexplain the importance of the new rules. Then the Navy gave the \ncompeting communities 12 days to respond to the new rules which turned \nout to be decisive in awarding the battleship.\n  Clearly, the Navy bungled the process--either innocently or with \nother motives in mind. I am not here to accuse either the Navy or \nanother applicant of behaving inappropriately. Rather, I do believe the \nfacts of the case as established by the GAO argue for our amendment.\n  Let me state clearly what our amendment seeks to accomplish today. We \nsimply seek the Senate's support to instruct the Navy to conduct a new \ndonee selection process. We do not seek to influence or prejudge that \nselection process. We only want a fair competition, administered by the \nNavy in a manner worthy of this great battleship.\n  Like all of my colleagues interested in displaying the Missouri, I \nhave every confidence in the proposal from my home State. Bremerton \ncontinues to host the Missouri today and the community is devoted to \nremaining the steward of this unique historic monument. The Missouri is \na passion for the residents of Bremerton, Kitsap County, and indeed all \nof Washington State.\n  I recognize that the interests of Washington State may not be enough \nto sway the Senate to overturn the Navy's decision. However, I do want \nmy colleagues to know that this is not a small, regional competition. \nVeterans all across this country care about the Missouri. Those who \nserved aboard this great battleship live in every State in the country; \nmany are now elderly and incapable of traveling great distances to \ncommemorate their service. It is for our veterans and particularly for \nthose that served aboard the ``Mighty Mo'' that we must ensure that the \nprocess is fair to all.\n  All World War II vets recognize and revere the ``Mighty Mo.'' Just \nrecently, Bremerton hosted a group of 110 families and survivors from \nthe Death March of Bataan and Corregidor. These veterans, many in poor \nhealth, could travel to Bremerton. And they wanted to see the ``Mighty \nMo.'' This reverence for the battleship demands that the Senate stand \nfor a process fair to all.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Gorton-Murray amendment.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER [Ms. Snowe]. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, briefly, it displeases me to be standing \nhere speaking in opposition to my distinguished friend from Washington. \nBut I think it should be remembered by all of us that under current \nlaw, the law that is in place, the Secretary of the Navy is authorized \nto donate any stricken vessel to any organization which can demonstrate \nits financial means to support it.\n  The Navy is not required to hold a competition nor is it required to \nselect a winning proposal. However, as my\n\n[[Page S6983]]\n\nfriend from Washington noted, when it became apparent that there were \nseveral cities vying for the Missouri, such as San Francisco, \nBremerton, and Pearl Harbor, the Secretary determined that he would \nvery carefully examine how he would dispose of the ship.\n  In a lengthy competition, the Navy kept all participants equally \ninformed. Nowhere in the GAO report does it say that any city got \nfavorable treatment. They were equally informed of how it would judge \nthe applicants.\n  It determined that in the unique situation at hand it should ensure \nthat this historic ship should be located where it would best serve the \nNavy and the Nation. Those were the two additional criteria.\n  I think that even without stating that, that should be the first \ncriteria: How best can the interests of this Nation be served? How will \nthe Navy's interests be served?\n  The Secretary issued these new requirements to all of the applicants. \nAccording to the GAO, no one received favorable or preferential \ntreatment. The Navy Secretary then had his staff evaluate the criteria. \nHe chose the best proposal as the winning location. Under the current \nlaw the Secretary could have selected the losing proposal, but he did \nnot. He chose the winning proposal. And the winner was Pearl Harbor.\n  Now, those that lost say that is not fair. If one would objectively \nlook at the GAO report, it does not suggest that it was not fair. All \napplicants operated under the same rules. We did not know that the Navy \nwould change the interests which best served their interests.\n  They argue that the competition should be reopened. What is the basis \nof this argument? The GAO did not recommend that the competition be \nreopened, nor did the Secretary recommend that the competition be \nreopened. Instead, they believe, since none of the parties had enough \ntime to consider how their location was the best location for the ship, \nthat we should go back and redo the competition.\n  Madam President, I believe that is completely unfair to the winning \nteam. We have made countless--hundreds--of decisions of this nature. \nDid we go back to MacDonnell Douglas and say we are going to reopen the \ncompetition for the joint strike fighter because they lost to Boeing? \nNo. Did the Navy reopen the competition of the sealift ship contracts \nwhen Newport News and Ingalls lost to Avondale? No.\n  Madam President, the amendment by the Senator from Washington, I \nbelieve, is unfair and it is bad for all of us. Each of us has had \nconstituents which won and also lost competitions. If we are to go back \nand reconsider awards even when the GAO does not recommend reopening \nmatters, then I believe we will be in very serious trouble.\n  I believe that the Pearl Harbor applicants won the contest and \ncompetition for one simple reason: The Pearl Harbor applicants did not \nlook upon the Missouri as a mere tourist attraction. We have a very \nsacred ship in Pearl Harbor at this moment, the Arizona. There are over \n1,700 men who are still in the ship. It is a memorial. And it happens \nthat more tourists visit the Arizona than they do the Tomb of the \nUnknown Soldier. But it was not built, Madam President, as a tourist \nattraction. It was built as a memorial to remind all of us that on this \ndark morning of December 7, 1941, we were suddenly thrust into a bloody \nand terrible war.\n  The battleship Missouri is a ship upon which the surrender terms were \nsigned by the representatives of the Imperial Government of Japan. The \nmost logical spot for the location is Pearl Harbor. On one hand, you \nwill see the Arizona where the war began, and down Battleship Row you \nwill see the U.S.S. Missouri where the war ended. It would constantly \nremind us of the many sacrifices that men and women of the United \nStates were called upon to make during that terrible war.\n  I have visited Bremerton. It is a nice place. But I am certain that \nmy colleagues realize that Bremerton is also looked upon by Navy \npersonnel, and others, as the graveyard of ships, where dozens upon \ndozens of destroyers and cruisers are parked and put in cover hoping \nthat someday they can be used.\n  The Missouri deserves much more than a graveyard, Madam President. \nThe Missouri should be respected with dignity; it should be revered as \na memorial.\n  So, Madam President, I hope that my colleagues will follow the \nsuggestions of the GAO. The GAO said it should stand as is. The \nSecretary of the Navy said his decision stands. Why go through the \nmisery again of spending countless dollars to come up with the same \nresult?\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, with almost all of the factual \nstatements about how the selection process was made, I agree with my \nfriend and colleague from Hawaii. With his unwarranted characterization \nof Bremerton and, by implication, of San Francisco and of the \nCalifornia applicants, I most decidedly do not.\n  Pearl Harbor is in fact a memorial to World War II and to its \nbeginning. But Pearl Harbor, no more than Bremerton or San Francisco, \nwas the location of the surrender of the Japanese on board the Missouri \nat the end of the war.\n  Under the logic of the Senator from Hawaii, the Missouri should be \nsent to Tokyo Bay and be a memorial and a reminder there. Obviously, \nthat is not going to be the case. But from the point of view of its \navailability to primarily American tourists, it is obviously more \nconveniently located in one of the west coast ports than it is \nHonolulu.\n  But, Madam President, the true difference between the Senator from \nHawaii and myself is not that. The Senator from Hawaii, as apparently \nhe did to the Navy himself, is making the case for his location. I \nsimply depended on the Navy to make that decision objectively.\n\n  The Navy, of course, can set up whatever criteria it wishes for \nmaking a donation of a ship or any other artifact to a community, but \nthe Navy, like every other American institution, should do so fairly \nand on the basis of rules that are not changed at the beginning of the \ngame without telling the participants in the game what the new rules \nmean or what weight they will be given. Had the Navy followed its \noriginal rules, the rules it applied itself to all previous donations, \nBremerton was the most likely winner by reason of the deep concern on \nthe part of the community for what had been a part of its history for \nmore than 40 years. But at the very end, the Navy comes up with two \nother criteria, informs no one of their importance, gives them 75 \npercent of the weight in making its decision, and comes out, I presume, \nwhere someone in the Navy wanted to come out in the first place but \ncould not without changing those rules.\n  My amendment does not even require that those rules be changed, \nthough I think they should be, Madam President. It simply requires the \nNavy to treat the citizens of the five communities that applied to be \nthe permanent home of the Missouri on the basis of the same rules at \nthe end of the process that it had at the beginning of the process and \nto inform those communities of what the rules are and what their \nrelative weight is. That is asking for the most minimal fairness, Madam \nPresident, the most minimal fairness in the world.\n  The General Accounting Office did not take a position one way or the \nother on whether or not the process should be reopened, said that none \nof the communities were adequately informed about the nature and the \nweight of the new criteria. That is the fundamental answer that should \nhave caused the Navy to reopen this process on its own.\n  Madam President, it is interesting to note that the fairness of this \nrequest, the request I am making in this amendment, is recognized even \nby the Honolulu Advertiser. Now, the Honolulu newspaper, a month ago \ntomorrow, wrote an editorial on the subject which, of course, takes \nSenator Inouye's position on the merits, that Pearl Harbor is \npractically the only logical place and certainly the most logical place \nfor the location of the Missouri. But it does say, in part,\n\n       Officials from Bremerton, WA, cite a General Accounting \n     Office report that says there were a number of last minute \n     changes in the Navy's selection process that skewed it in\n\n[[Page S6984]]\n\n     favor of Honolulu. They want the selection process reopened. \n     Hawaii Senator Dan Inouye, whose enthusiasm was very obvious \n     in the effort to get the Missouri at Pearl Harbor, says the \n     GAO report in itself is skewed. He promises the great \n     battleship will come to Pearl. Let's hope so. But if the \n     proposed Pearl Harbor resting place makes so much sense, as \n     we believe, then there should be no problem in reopening the \n     selection process so that all questions are answered.\n\n  It concludes, ``And no one can claim Hawaii stole it. We can proudly \nsay we earned the right to host the Missouri.''\n  I am not sure that would be the result. I hope that would not be the \nresult. The very newspaper in Honolulu itself acknowledges that this \ncompetition should be a fair one and carries the implication that it \nwas an unfair one. We ask no more than that. This is not a tremendously \ncomplicated process. It will not take a long time to do justice. But \njustice has not been done, Madam President, and it can only be done by \nthe acceptance of this amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I suggest that to call upon the Navy as \nbeing unfair and not objective is not fair. There is nothing in the \nrecord to suggest that they have been less than objective or less than \nfair.\n  I think it should be pointed out that the GAO report stated that no \none received preferential treatment, no one received advance notice. It \nwas objective, it was fair to all, and the Secretary of the Navy just \nrecently stated he stands by his decision, and the GAO report itself \nsays the decision should be left where it is. It should not be \nreopened.\n  So I hope my colleagues will defeat this amendment.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, one correction. The GAO makes no \nrecommendation with respect to whether or not this question should be \nreopened whatever. It does say the Navy should change its donation \nprocedures in the future, but it does not say that the selection should \nstand.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I oppose the amendment to reopen the \nNavy's decision to donate the U.S.S. Missouri to Pearl Harbor.\n  These are obviously very difficult decisions for all of us to make \nbecause of the friendships with the Senators from the States involved. \nI do believe, under these circumstances, the GAO found that the Navy's \ndonation process was impartially applied, to use their words. They are \ncritical of some aspects of the process and many of these processes are \nnot perfect in their application. But to me, the key words of the GAO \nreport are that the Navy's donation process appears to have been \nimpartially applied, and the GAO's statement on page 10 where they say \nthat on June 5, 1996, each of the five applicants was notified for the \nfirst time that ``In addition to the financial and technical \ninformation that you've provided, your application will also be \nevaluated in terms of its overall public benefit to the Navy and to the \nhistorical significance associated with each location to include the \nmanner in which the ship will be used as a naval museum or memorial.'' \nNotification was made in writing, with telephone confirmation.\n\n  The GAO also reports on page 12 that none of the applicants requested \nclarification of the June 5 letter or expressed concern about the \nadditional requirements at the time, and all responded to the letter.\n  That, to me, is a very critical fact, that when the additional \nrequirements were spelled out in that June 5 notification, that all the \napplicants responded to the letter with the additional requirements and \nnone requested clarification or expressed concern.\n  Was this a perfect process? It was not. The GAO acknowledges that, \nand indeed, the Navy acknowledges that. Was this process sufficiently \nfair so that we should not reopen the Navy's decision to donate the \nMissouri to Pearl Harbor? It seems to me that it does meet that test.\n  I will oppose the amendment and vote against reopening the Navy's \nselection process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter \ndated June 10, 1997, from the Secretary of the Navy to the Honorable \nNorman D. Dicks, a Member of the House of Representatives, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           Department of the Navy,\n\n\n                                      Office of the Secretary,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, 10 June 1997.\n     Hon. Norman D. Dicks,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Dicks: Thank you for your letter of June 3, 1997, \n     regarding the General Accounting Office report concerning the \n     Navy's donation selection process for the battleship ex-\n     MISSOURI.\n       I have reviewed the General Accounting Office report you \n     enclosed, and I find that it contains nothing that would \n     warrant reopening the process. The General Accounting Office \n     stated that the Navy ``impartially applied'' the donation \n     selection process, and that all applicants received the same \n     information at the same time. The report's chronology \n     documents that scoring for the financial, technical, \n     historical and public affairs evaluation of each application \n     did not begin until after all criteria weighting was \n     established and all information was received from the \n     applicants. The initial evaluation scores developed by each \n     of the three independent scoring teams were maintained \n     throughout the process. I remain confident that my selection \n     of Pearl Harbor was in the best interest of the Navy and our \n     Nation, based on the impartial review of the relative merits \n     of the four acceptable applications.\n       The General Accounting Office found the initial phase of \n     the donation selection process was well-handled, but that the \n     Navy could have done a better job of communicating \n     information about the two additional evaluation criteria of \n     Public Affairs Benefit and Historical Significance. The \n     General Accounting Office also noted, however, that none of \n     the applicants requested clarification on any aspect of these \n     two criteria. When the General Accounting Office forwards \n     their report to me, I will consider and provide a written \n     response to any specific recommendations they make regarding \n     how to improve the process for future competitive donation \n     selections.\n       I am sensitive to the concerns of those American veterans \n     who have expressed their desire to keep ex-MISSOURI on the \n     mainland. Others, including the American Legion's Department \n     of Missouri, have endorsed the Pearl Harbor site. I regret \n     that it is not possible to accommodate all groups who are \n     interested in the location of the ex-MISSOURI display. As I \n     said at the time my selection was announced last summer, this \n     was a very tough decision since all the proposals were so \n     impressive. I hope that other groups interested in displaying \n     a Navy ship will consider that there are several other ships \n     currently available for donation.\n       As always, if I can be of any further assistance, please \n     let me know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   John H. Dalton,\n                                            Secretary of the Navy.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered by Senator Gorton.\n  The ``Mighty Mo'' is a historical icon of World War II in the \nPacific. It began its service in World War II by providing gunfire \nsupport during the battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa. The U.S.S. Missouri \ntook its place in world history when it became the site for the formal \nsigning of Japan's surrender.\n  Continuing its auspicious beginnings, the Missouri participated in \nthe Korean war, was decommissioned, then recommissioned, and saw its \nfinal battles during the Persian Gulf conflict. She was finally \ndecommissioned on March 31, 1992.\n  In January 1995, the Department of the Navy declared Iowa class \nbattleships in excess to its requirements. The people of Hawaii have \nalways believed that the Missouri's home is Hawaii. We supported having \nher homeported in Hawaii before she was decommissioned in 1992. Since \nthen, our community has been diligently working to bring the Missouri \nto Hawaii to fulfill its final mission--as a memorial museum in the \nPacific. It is a fitting tribute to those we honor at the Arizona \nMemorial to have the Missouri become a part of our memorial in the \nPacific.\n  The Senator from Washington believes that the Navy's evaluation \nprocess was unfair because the criteria were changed during the \nevaluation stage. However, the General Accounting Office found that the \nNavy provided all applicants the same information on the additional \ncriteria at the same time. Although all interested parties were \nprovided the same information, none of the applicants requested \nclarification of the additional requirement.\n  The Navy conducted an impartial and fair review in determining the \nsite location for the Missouri. There is no reason to reopen the \nselection process. I\n\n[[Page S6985]]\n\nurge my colleagues to reject the amendment offered by the Senator from \nWashington, and let us move forward in establishing a memorial to those \nwho so gallantly fought in the Pacific.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be temporarily set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 753\n\n (Purpose: To require a report on options for the disposal of chemical \n                          weapons and agents)\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Murkowski] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 753.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At an appropriate place in title III, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . REPORT ON OPTIONS FOR THE DISPOSAL OF CHEMICAL \n                   WEAPONS AND AGENTS.\n\n       (a) Requirement.--Not later than March 15, 1998, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a report on the \n     options available to the Department of Defense for the \n     disposal of chemical weapons and agents in order to \n     facilitate the disposal of such weapons and agents without \n     the construction of additional chemical weapons disposal \n     facilities in the continental United States.\n       (b) Elements.--The report shall include the following:\n       (1) a description of each option evaluated;\n       (2) an assessment of the lifecycle costs and risks \n     associated with each option evaluated;\n       (3) a statement of any technical, regulatory, or other \n     requirements or obstacles with respect to each option, \n     including with respect to any transportation of weapons or \n     agents that is required for the option;\n       (4) an assessment of incentives required for sites to \n     accept munitions or agents from outside their own locales, as \n     well as incentives to enable transportation of these items \n     across state lines;\n       (5) an assessment of the cost savings that could be \n     achieved through either the application of uniform federal \n     transportation or safety requirements and any other \n     initiatives consistent with the transportation and safe \n     disposal of stockpile and nonstockpile chemical weapons and \n     agents; and\n       (6) proposed legislative language necessary to implement \n     options determined by the Secretary to be worthy of \n     consideration by the Congress.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, let me explain very briefly the \namendment that I put before the Senate. This amendment would direct the \nDepartment of Defense to conduct a study of alternatives to our present \napproach to chemical weapons disposal. Depending on the conclusion of \nthis study and its evaluation, there is a potential savings to the \ntaxpayer, somewhere in the area of $3 billion to $5 billion, and \nperhaps much more, in the costs of disposing of these weapons.\n  The Chair might wonder why the chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee is interested and involved with this issue, and to \nwhat degree does he have expertise in this area that falls under the \nauspices of the Department of Defense and under the Defense \nauthorization bill. The Chairman would respond, Madam President, by \nnoting that, as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nI spend a great deal of time and energy in the area of nuclear waste \nand nuclear waste disposal and the transportation of nuclear waste.\n  I might add that there has been moved globally about 25,000 tons of \nhigh-level nuclear waste throughout the world. We have, currently, in \nsome 80 reactors in 31 sites in the United States, high-level nuclear \nwaste that we are contemplating at some time moving to Yucca Mountain \nin Nevada. So I think the qualifications for a contribution to the area \nof disposing of chemical weapons is appropriate in the body of the \namendment. This amendment simply calls for a study. It does not mandate \nchanges in the program at this time, but will provide the Congress with \nan important and needed opportunity to responsibly evaluate \nalternatives to our chemical weapons disposal program in the future.\n  Surprisingly enough, there is no authority to evaluate alternatives \nat this time for the Department of Defense. It was my hope this \namendment would be accepted by the floor managers.\n  I think it is noteworthy, Madam President, that prior to the Senate's \nratification of the Chemical Weapons Treaty, the United States did \nadopt the policy that we would dispose of our chemical weapons in a \nsafe and environmentally responsible manner. As most of my colleagues \nknow, the disposal process is now underway, but it is becoming clear \nthat we cannot afford to continue this program as it is currently \nconstructed because of the costs.\n  According to the General Accounting Office, the costs of the \nstockpile disposal program have escalated seven-fold, from an initial \nestimate of $1.7 billion to a current estimate of $12.4 billion. The \ncosts of the nonstockpile program, which consists of the location and \ndestruction of chemical weapons ordinance that was disposed of through \nburial or other means in the past, could cost an additional $15.1 \nbillion and take up to 40 years to complete.\n  Well, that is a total of about $27.5 billion to dispose of our \nchemical weapons. However, the GAO indicates that both the costs and \nthe disposal schedules are highly uncertain and that it will likely \ntake more time and likely take more money to get this job done.\n  Well, as a consequence of that dilemma, Madam President, I think the \nprogram needs a fresh look, a new comprehensive evaluation by the \nprogram managers in the Department of Defense.\n  Today, we have stockpiled chemical weapons stored at 9 locations. On \nthe chart on my right, one can see that we start out with the Johnston \nAtoll, an island in the Pacific, roughly 700 miles southwest of Hawaii. \nWe have another in Tooele, UT. Umatilla, OR; Pueblo, CO; Pine Bluff, \nAR; Anniston, AL; Blue Grass, KY; Aberdeen, MD, and Newport, IN.\n  The chemical consistencies of the weapons stored there are \nabbreviated here by GB, which is a sarin nerve agent, and HD, which is \na mustard blister agent, and VX, which is a nerve gas agent.\n  Now, I have had the opportunity to visit the facility at Johnston \nIsland on two occasions in the last 3 years. The chemical weapons are \nstored in capsules that look like hundred pound bombs. And within the \nbomb itself, or the casing, we have two components. One is an agent \nthat is separate and distinct from the other nerve gas agents, and \nthere is a triggering mechanism. Of course, the chemical reaction takes \nplace when the two are mixed, or the exterior shell is punctured or \nbroken. It is rather revealing to contemplate the terrible consequences \nof this type of weaponry, Madam President. It was explained that these \ncan be fired from a Howitzer in ground activity, exploding perhaps 300 \nor 400 feet in the air, and the mist of the vapors, upon contact with \nthe skin, will take a life within 30 seconds. Now, when you see this \nstored, you come to grips with the reality of the devastation of this \ntype of weaponry and the necessity of proper disposal.\n  It is also important to recognize how it got there because this stuff \nwasn't made at Johnston Island. It was shipped there from Europe, and \nsome was shipped from some of our bases in the Pacific. It was shipped \nunder the observation of the Army Corps of Engineers. It was shipped \nsafely and met the criteria for shipment, which was evaluated to ensure \nits safety.\n  So it is important to keep in mind in this discussion that these \nweapons we are now disposing of at Johnston Island, for the most part, \nwere weapons that were part of the NATO capability, shipped from \nGermany, and have been safely transported to Johnston Island and are \nunder the process of being destroyed.\n  Now, at Johnston island, we have this capability for weapons \ndemilitarization and incineration. This complies, as it must, with all \napplicable environmental laws, including the Resource Conservation and \nRecovery Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Toxic \nSubstances Control Act. It is a superbly safe, state-of-the-art \nfacility. It is also very expensive. This plant cost approximately $1 \nbillion.\n  What they have there are chambers where they take these things that \nlook like bombs with the chemical in them and they actually take, in \nparts, the Chamber--that is, the inner Chamber,\n\n[[Page S6986]]\n\nremove that, and put it in an area where they are able to dispose, \nthrough heat, of the volatility of the particular chemical agent. The \nother part goes in another Chamber and is burned at a very high \ntemperature in an enclosed cycle process. So there is nothing that gets \ninto the atmosphere.\n  Now, we have recently opened another $1 billion facility in Tooele, \nUT. The theory is that we are going to have to build some seven more of \nthese plants, capable of disposing of this chemical waste at each of \nthe locations where stockpiled chemical weapons are stored. So while we \nhave operational facilities at Johnston Atoll and Tooele, UT, we are \nprepared to put in seven more at a billion dollars each, simply because \nwe are prohibited from even considering shipping this to safe disposal \nsites already on line.\n  As I said, we have a perfectly functioning facility on Johnston \nIsland, which has been operational for a number of years. Should we \nmove or even consider moving chemical weapons to Johnston Island and \ndispose of all of them in that plant we have already built? The answer \nclearly is no. There are objections from California and objections from \nHawaii. Nobody wants this to happen in their own backyard. These States \nthat have the chemical weapons stored are in kind of a catch-22. They \ndon't want them there anymore. If they want to get rid of them, they \nhave to build a plant at a cost of over a billion dollars, as opposed \nto the alternative of shipping them to one or two sites.\n\n  Well, the answer to this $5 billion question is simple. Under current \nlaw, the Department of Defense cannot move chemical weapons across \nState lines. In fact, they can't even study the concept of transporting \nthe munitions to an existing plant and thus build fewer plants. So if \nyou look at the practicality of where we are, we are of one mind set. \nReality: If we want to get rid of this stuff, we have to build seven \nplants rather than move the stuff because we have a law that prohibits \nus from moving these agents across State lines for disposal at one or \ntwo plants.\n  In other words, the Department of Defense can't even think about \nsaving money by having this process occur in just a couple of plants \ninstead of--well, it would be a total of nine. My amendment is designed \nto allow the Department of Defense to study the transportation issue, \nas well as whatever other approaches might be available to help bring \ndown program costs consistent with the safe disposal of these chemical \nweapons.\n  My amendment does not repeal the provision in the 1995 defense \nauthorization bill that prohibits the movement of chemical weapons \nmunitions across the State lines.\n  At this time, we are only seeking a study to identify and evaluate \noptions. This study will assess lifecycle costs as well as risks. We \nare not moving beyond the study phase because I, for one, will await \nthe results of the study before reaching any firm conclusions.\n  But I have a hunch--and it is more than a hunch--that we can save \nmoney by reassessing this process. I am not suggesting it should go to \nany one place. But the reality is that we are designing a framework \nhere for disposal in seven new additional sites which still need to be \nbuilt. Given that we have two state of the art, fully operational \nfacilities at Johnston Island and Tooele, UT, is it really necessary \nthat we need to build seven additional sites? Or can we consolidate \nthis process, perhaps with one site on the east coast and one site in \nthe middle of the country? Our technical people have proven the \ncompetency of disposing of this, as we have had this process underway \nat Johnston Island and Tooele for some time. We seem to be so paranoid \nover the fact that we have this stuff and we are caught, if you will, \nin a dilemma of, well, if we want to get rid of it, we have to build a \nplant where it is stationed because nobody wants to see it moved across \nto someplace else where it can be disposed of. But nobody addresses \nwhat the experts tell us relative to the ability to move this stuff \nsafely. We moved it safely from Germany to Johnston Island, it can be \ndone and has been done. To suggest that we can't move it 400 or 500 \nmiles by putting it in the type of containers that will alleviate \nvirtually any exposure associated with an accident, I think, sells \nAmerican technology and ingenuity short. We can move chemical weapons \nin a safe and environmentally responsible manner, and we can save a lot \nof money by reducing the number of facilities that we are committed to \nbuild.\n  So I urge the Senate to adopt my amendment. Again, I urge my \ncolleagues to reflect on the reality that this amendment does not \nmandate any changes in the program. It will not mandate the movement of \nany chemical weapons from one place to another or remove the \nprohibitions to move weapons across State lines. It would merely allow \nthe Department of Defense to study alternatives and report back to \nCongress by March 15, 1998. I know of the sensitivity of Members whose \nStates are affected. But I ask them to consider the merits of a study \nto evaluate, indeed, whether we can move some of this to some places \nand reduce the number of facilities that we are going to build at a \nbillion dollars a crack. What are we going to do with these facilities \nwhen the weapons have been deactivated and destroyed? We are going to \ndestroy the facilities. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Madam President, if I may, it is my intention to ask for the yeas and \nnays on my amendment at the appropriate time. The floor managers can \naddress it at their convenience.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator withhold on that for a moment?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Madam President, I am not sure whether the \nParliamentarian recorded my request for the yeas and nays. I would like \nto withdraw asking for the yeas and nays on my amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle E of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1075. LIMITATION ON USE OF COOPERATIVE THREAT REDUCTION \n                   FUNDS FOR DESTRUCTION OF CHEMICAL WEAPONS.\n\n       (a) Limitation.--No funds authorized to be appropriated \n     under this or any other Act for fiscal year 1998 for \n     Cooperative Threat Reduction programs may be obligated or \n     expended for chemical weapons destruction activities, \n     including for the planning, design, or construction of a \n     chemical weapons destruction facility or for the \n     dismantlement of an existing chemical weapons production \n     facility, until the date that is 15 days after a \n     certification is made under subsection (b).\n       (b) Presidential Certification.--A certification under this \n     subsection is a certification by the President to Congress \n     that--\n       (1) Russia is making reasonable progress toward the \n     implementation of the Bilateral Destruction Agreement;\n       (2) the United States and Russia have resolved, to the \n     satisfaction of the United States, outstanding compliance \n     issues under the Wyoming Memorandum of Understanding and the \n     Bilateral Destruction Agreement;\n       (3) Russia has fully and accurately declared all \n     information regarding its unitary and binary chemical \n     weapons, chemical weapons facilities, and other facilities \n     associated with chemical weapons;\n       (4) Russia has deposited its instrument of ratification of \n     the Chemical Weapons Convention; and\n       (5) Russia and the United States have concluded an \n     agreement that--\n       (A) provides for a limitation on the United States \n     financial contribution for the chemical weapons destruction \n     activities; and\n       (B) commits Russia to pay a portion of the cost for a \n     chemical weapons destruction facility in an amount that \n     demonstrates that Russia has a substantial stake in financing \n     the implementation of both the Bilateral Destruction \n     Agreement and the Chemical Weapons Convention, as called for \n     in the condition provided in section 2(14) of the Senate \n     Resolution entitled ``A resolution to advise and consent to \n     the ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention, subject \n     to certain conditions'', agreed to by the Senate on April 24, \n     1997.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) The term ``Bilateral Destruction Agreement'' means the \n     Agreement Between the United States of America and the Union \n     of Soviet Socialist Republics on Destruction and \n     Nonproduction of Chemical Weapons and on Measures to \n     Facilitate the Multilateral Convention on Banning Chemical \n     Weapons, signed on June 1, 1990.\n       (2) The term ``Chemical Weapons Convention'' means the \n     Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, \n     Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their \n     Destruction, opened for signature on January 13, 1993.\n       (3) The term ``Cooperative Threat Reduction program'' means \n     a program specified in section 1501(b) of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 (Public Law \n     104-201: 110 Stat. 2731; 50 U.S.C. 2362 note).\n       (4) The term ``Wyoming Memorandum of Understanding'' means \n     the Memorandum of Understanding Between the Government of the \n     United States of America and the Government of the Union of \n     Soviet Socialist Republics Regarding a Bilateral Verification \n     Experiment and Data Exchange Related to Prohibition on \n     Chemical Weapons, signed at Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on \n     September 23, 1989.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me briefly describe what this amendment \ndoes. Then I will discuss it in further detail later.\n  In summary, this amendment establishes five conditions for the \nassistance that is to be provided to Russia for destruction of its \nchemical weapons, the so-called Nunn-Lugar funding. Very briefly, this \nresolution is called for because the funding that we have provided to \nRussia to date does not appear to be adequately supported by the \nGovernment of Russia for its part of its own chemical weapons \ndestruction program. If one could view this in the nature of matching \nfunds, I think it is easy to understand. We have provided a great deal \nof money, of Nunn-Lugar funding, to Russia, much of it for destruction \nof their chemical weapons. They have not reciprocated by allocating or \nspending any of their own money for the destruction of their chemical \nweapons.\n  In addition, they have not ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention. \nThey have not complied with the terms of the so-called Wyoming \nMemoranda, which is one of the methods by which we exchange information \nabout our chemical stocks in furtherance of an agreement to destroy \nthem. They have backed out of the bilateral destruction agreement, \nwhich was our bilateral agreement to destroy our mutual stocks of \nchemical weapons. They have not advanced a penny toward the development \nof the facilities for the destruction of their weapons that are \ncurrently being designed with U.S. Government money. In effect, they \nhave not shown any willingness to join us in the destruction of those \nweapons which pose the most threat to the United States and other \npeople around the world.\n  As a result, partially in conformance with the terms of the chemical \nweapons treaty, which was earlier adopted, and in conformance with S. \n495, which had other specific requirements, and consistent with \nrequirements that the House of Representatives placed on the House-\npassed version of the defense authorization bill, we provide five \nspecific requirements that the Russian Government will have to meet in \norder to receive this funding.\n  First, that they show reasonable progress toward implementation of \nthe 1990 Bilateral Destruction Agreement; second, that resolution of \noutstanding compliance issues related to the Wyoming Memorandum of \nUnderstanding and the BDA, that be resolved--at least that there be \nprogress toward that; third, a full and accurate Russian accounting of \nits own CW program, as required by those previously mentioned \nagreements; fourth, Russian ratification of the Chemical Weapons \nConvention; and, fifth, bilateral agreement to cap the United States CW \ndestruction assistance and Russian commitment to pay for a portion of \ntheir part of their own CW destruction costs.\n  As I said, these are reasonable requirements to be attached to U.S. \ntaxpayer dollars going to the country of Russia for the destruction of \ntheir chemical weapons. I will discuss it in\n\n[[Page S6988]]\n\nfurther detail later, but it seems to me to be more than reasonable for \nus to attach these conditions. If we do not, then additional taxpayer \nmoney is going to be sent to Russia with no indication whatsoever that \nRussia will ever support the program funded with U.S. taxpayer dollars \nto support their chemical weapons destruction program.\n  Perhaps most important, the most that it appears right now that \nRussia is inclined to do is to destroy those old chemical weapons that \npose an environmental concern to Russia with United States dollars at \nthe same time that they are using Russian dollars to continue a covert \ndevelopment and production program of new chemical weapons. So it makes \nno sense for us to be spending U.S. taxpayer dollars to help them \ndestroy the stocks of the old environmentally unsafe weapons that they \nwould like to get rid of anyway, at the same time they are using their \nmoney to develop new chemical weapons and produce those new chemical \nweapons that could someday be used against the United States--all in \nviolation of the chemical weapons treaty, I might add.\n  So that is the nature of the first amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 605\n\n  (Purpose: To ensure the President and Congress receive unencumbered \nadvice from the directors of the national laboratories, the members of \n  the Nuclear Weapons Council, and the commander of the United States \n Strategic Command regarding the safety, security, and reliability of \n              the United States nuclear weapons stockpile)\n\n  Mr. KYL. If there is no objection, the second amendment is amendment \nNo. 605. I call up that amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 605.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 347, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1075. ADVICE TO THE PRESIDENT AND CONGRESS REGARDING THE \n                   SAFETY, SECURITY, AND RELIABILITY OF UNITED \n                   STATES NUCLEAR WEAPONS STOCKPILE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Nuclear weapons are the most destructive weapons on \n     earth. The United States and its allies continue to rely on \n     nuclear weapons to deter potential adversaries from using \n     weapons of mass destruction. The safety and reliability of \n     the nuclear stockpile are essential to ensure its credibility \n     as a deterrent.\n       (2) On September 24, 1996, President Clinton signed the \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\n       (3) Effective as of September 30, 1996, the United States \n     is prohibited by relevant provisions of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 (Public Law 102-377) \n     from conducting underground nuclear tests ``unless a foreign \n     state conducts a nuclear test after this date, at which time \n     the prohibition on United States nuclear testing is lifted''.\n       (4) Section 1436(b) of the National Defense Authorization \n     Act, Fiscal Year 1989 (Public Law 100-456; 42 U.S.C. 2121 \n     note) requires the Secretary of Energy to ``establish and \n     support a program to assure that the United States is in a \n     position to maintain the reliability, safety, and continued \n     deterrent effect of its stockpile of existing nuclear weapons \n     designs in the event that a low-threshold or comprehensive \n     test ban on nuclear explosive testing is negotiated and \n     ratified.''.\n       (5) Section 3138(d) of the National Defense Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 1994 requires the President to submit an \n     annual report to Congress which sets forth ``any concerns \n     with respect to the safety, security, effectiveness, or \n     reliability of existing United States nuclear weapons raised \n     by the Stockpile Stewardship Program of the Department of \n     Energy''.\n       (6) President Clinton declared in July 1993 that ``to \n     assure that our nuclear deterrent remains unquestioned under \n     a test ban, we will explore other means of maintaining our \n     confidence in the safety, reliability, and the performance of \n     our weapons''. This decision was codified in a Presidential \n     Directive.\n       (7) Section 3138 of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 1994 also requires that the Secretary of \n     Energy establish a ``stewardship program to ensure the \n     preservation of the core intellectual and technical \n     competencies of the United States in nuclear weapons''.\n       (8) The plan of the Department of Energy to maintain the \n     safety and reliability of the United States nuclear stockpile \n     is known as the Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program. \n     This approach is yet unproven. The ability of the United \n     States to maintain warheads without testing will require \n     development of new and sophisticated diagnostic technologies, \n     methods, and procedures. Current diagnostic technologies and \n     laboratory testing techniques are insufficient to certify the \n     future safety and reliability of the United States nuclear \n     stockpile. In the past these laboratory and diagnostic tools \n     were used in conjunction with nuclear testing.\n       (9) On August 11, 1995, President Clinton directed ``the \n     establishment of a new annual reporting and certification \n     requirement [to] ensure that our nuclear weapons remain safe \n     and reliable under a comprehensive test ban''.\n       (10) On the same day, the President noted that the \n     Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy have the \n     responsibility, after being ``advised by the Nuclear Weapons \n     Council, the Directors of DOE's nuclear weapons laboratories, \n     and the Commander of United States Strategic Command'', to \n     provide the President with the information to make the \n     certification referred to in paragraph (9).\n       (11) The Joint Nuclear Weapons Council established by \n     section 179 of title 10, United States Code, is responsible \n     for providing advice to the Secretary of Energy and Secretary \n     of Defense regarding nuclear weapons issues, including \n     ``considering safety, security, and control issues for \n     existing weapons''. The Council plays a critical role in \n     advising Congress in matters relating to nuclear weapons.\n       (12) It is essential that the President receive well-\n     informed, objective, and honest opinions from his advisors \n     and technical experts regarding the safety, security, and \n     reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile.\n       (b) Policy.--\n       (1) In general.--It is the policy of the United States--\n       (A) to maintain a safe, secure, and reliable nuclear \n     weapons stockpile; and\n       (B) as long as other nations covet or control nuclear \n     weapons or other weapons of mass destruction, to retain a \n     credible nuclear deterrent.\n       (2) Nuclear weapons stockpile.--It is in the security \n     interest of the United States to sustain the United States \n     nuclear weapons stockpile through programs relating to \n     stockpile stewardship, subcritical experiments, maintenance \n     of the weapons laboratories, and protection of the \n     infrastructure of the weapons complex.\n       (3) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (A) the United States should retain a triad of strategic \n     nuclear forces sufficient to deter any future hostile foreign \n     leadership with access to strategic nuclear forces from \n     acting against our vital interests;\n       (B) the United States should continue to maintain nuclear \n     forces of sufficient size and capability to hold at risk a \n     broad range of assets valued by such political and military \n     leaders; and\n       (C) the advice of the persons required to provide the \n     President and Congress with assurances of the safety, \n     security and reliability of the nuclear weapons force should \n     be scientifically based, without regard for politics, and of \n     the highest quality and integrity.\n       (c) Advice and Opinions Regarding Nuclear Weapons \n     Stockpile.--Any director of a nuclear weapons laboratory or \n     member of the Joint Nuclear Weapons Council, or the Commander \n     of United States Strategic Command, may submit to the \n     President or Congress advice or opinion in disagreement with, \n     or in addition to, the advice presented by the Secretary of \n     Energy or Secretary of Defense to the President, the National \n     Security Council, or Congress, as the case may be, regarding \n     the safety, security, and reliability of the nuclear weapons \n     stockpile.\n       (d) Expression of Individual Views.--No representative of a \n     government agency or managing contractor for a nuclear \n     weapons laboratory may in any way constrain a director of a \n     nuclear weapons laboratory, a member of the Joint Nuclear \n     Weapons Council, or the Commander of United States Strategic \n     Command from presenting individual views to the President, \n     the National Security Council, or Congress regarding the \n     safety, security, and reliability of the nuclear weapons \n     stockpile.\n       (e) Prohibited Personnel Actions.--No representative of a \n     government agency or managing contractor may take any \n     administrative or personnel action against a director of a \n     nuclear weapons laboratory, a member of the Joint Nuclear \n     Weapons Council, or the Commander of the United States \n     Strategic Command, in order to prevent such individual from \n     expressing views under subsection (c) or (d) or as \n     retribution for expressing such views.\n       (f) Definitions.--\n       (1) Representative of a government agency.--The term \n     ``representative of a government agency'' means any person \n     employed by, or receiving compensation from, any department \n     or agency of the Federal Government.\n       (2) Managing contractor.--The term ``managing contractor'' \n     means the non-government entity specified by contract to \n     carry out the administrative functions of a nuclear weapons \n     laboratory.\n       (3) Nuclear weapons laboratory.--The term ``nuclear weapons \n     laboratory'' means any of the following:\n       (A) Los Alamos National Laboratory.\n       (B) Livermore National Laboratory.\n       (C) Sandia National Laboratories.\n\n\n[[Page S6989]]\n\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the purpose of this amendment--and this is \nreally a very simple amendment that I think specific language will be \nworked out on with members of the committee and hopefully could be \nincluded as part of the managers' amendment--is simply to ensure that \nthe President of the United States receives direct and objective and \nunencumbered advice regarding the safety and reliability and security \nof the U.S. nuclear force from the directors of the national \nlaboratories and the members of the Nuclear Weapons Council.\n  Just one bit of background here. Both the national laboratories and \nthe Nuclear Weapons Council are supposed to give the President advice \nabout the safety, reliability, and security of our nuclear force. For \nthem to be able to do that in an objective way, they obviously need to \ntell it as it is, ``tell it like it is,'' without any fear that they \nare not adhering to any party line with respect to those issues.\n  This, in effect, extends the Goldwater-Nichols-like protection that \nhas previously been provided to members of the armed services, the \nJoint Chiefs, for example, to the lab directors and the members of the \nNuclear Weapons Council so they can give the President unvarnished, \nobjective, accurate information, and that information can also come to \nthe Congress, all for the purpose of enabling us to set proper national \npolicy with respect to our nuclear weapons.\n  Mr. President, I will have more to say about this later. As I said, I \nhope the amendment can be worked on and included as part of the \nmanagers' amendment. We will discuss this amendment further later.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 9 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on Calendar No. 88, \n     S. 936, the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal \n     year 1998:\n         Trent Lott, Strom Thurmond, Jesse Helms, Pete V. \n           Domenici, R.F. Bennett, Dan Coats, John Warner, Spencer \n           Abraham, Thad Cochran, Larry E. Craig, Ted Stevens, Tim \n           Hutchinson, Jon Kyl, Rick Santorum, Mike DeWine, Phil \n           Gramm.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Would the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished manager of the \nbill on that side of the aisle.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I want to thank the majority leader for yielding. I have \nhad a brief conversation with the majority leader because we are in a \nrather unusual situation where there will be no rollcall votes, further \nrollcall votes, until late tomorrow, and that we will be then having a \nwhole series of rollcall votes that could occur I believe as early as 5 \no'clock tomorrow afternoon, or whatever the UC reads.\n  But in my conversation with the majority leader, I was led to \nbelieve--and I think this would be very helpful--that if we are making \ngood progress on getting rollcall votes late tomorrow and the next day, \nthat there is a possibility at least that there will be no need to \nproceed with the cloture vote on Thursday. And I want to thank him for \nthat.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond.\n  Of course you always have the option of vitiating a cloture vote. My \nonly goal is trying to get this very important legislation moved \nthrough to completion this week. I know that that is the desire on both \nsides of the aisle. I am concerned about the number of amendments that \nhave been suggested, as many as 150 first-degree amendments. I know a \nlot of those will fall very quickly once we start moving through the \nprocess and getting to the end of the week. But I certainly will \nconsult with the Democratic leader, with the Senator from Michigan, and \nSenator Thurmond, to see how we are doing. And we can take that into \nconsideration when we get to Thursday and see what the prospects are at \nthat time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. This cloture vote will occur sometime Thursday unless it is \nvitiated. I will consult with the Democratic leader for the exact time \nof the vote.\n  I do ask unanimous consent that the mandatory quorum under rule XXII \nbe waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/08/senate-section/article/S6989-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

A bill to amend chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code, \nto increase the maximum term of imprisonment for offenses involving \nstolen firearms; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n             the stolen gun penalty enhancement act of 1997\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, many crimes in our country are being \ncommitted with stolen guns. The extent of this problem is reflected in \na number of recent studies and news reports. Therefore, today I am \nintroducing the Stolen Gun Penalty Enhancement Act of 1997 to increase \nthe maximum prison sentences for violating existing stolen gun laws.\n  Reports indicate almost half a million guns are stolen each year. As \nof March 1995, there were over 2 million reports in the stolen gun file \nof the FBI's National Crime Information Center including 7,700 reports \nof stolen machine guns and submachine guns. In a 5 year period between \n1987 and 1992, the National Crime Victimization Survey notes that there \nwere over 300,000 incidents of guns stolen from private citizens.\n   Studies conducted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms \nnote that felons steal firearms to avoid background checks. A 1991 \nBureau of Justice Statistics survey of State prison inmates notes that \nalmost 10 percent had stolen a handgun, and over 10 percent of all \ninmates had traded or sold a stolen firearm.\n  This problem is especially alarming among young people. A Justice \nDepartment study of juvenile inmates in four States shows that over 50 \npercent of those inmates had stolen a gun.\n  In my home State of Colorado, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation \nreceives over 500 reports of stolen guns each month. As of this month, \nthe Bureau has a total of 34,825 firearms on its unrecovered firearms \nlist.\n  All of these studies and statistics show the extent of the problem of \nstolen guns. Therefore, the bill I am introducing today will increase \nthe maximum prison sentences for violating existing stolen gun laws.\n  Specifically, my bill increases the maximum penalty for violating \nfour provisions of the firearms laws. Under section 922(i) of title 18 \nof the United States Code, it is illegal to knowingly transport or ship \na stolen firearm or stolen ammunition. Under section 922(j) of title \n18, it is illegal to knowingly receive, possess, conceal, store, sell, \nor otherwise dispose of a stolen firearm or stolen ammunition.\n  The penalty for violating either of these provisions, as provided by \nsection 924(a)(2) of title 18, is a fine, a maximum term of \nimprisonment of 10 years, or both. My bill increases the maximum prison \nsentence to 15 years.\n  The third provision, set forth in section 922(u) of title 18, makes \nit illegal to steal a firearm from a licensed dealer, importer, or \nmanufacturer. For violating this provision, the maximum term of \nimprisonment set forth in 18 U.S.C. 924(i)(1) would be increased to a \nmaximum 15 years under my bill.\n  And the fourth provision, section 924(l) of title 18, makes it \nillegal to steal a firearm from any person, including a licensed \nfirearms collector. This provision also imposes a maximum penalty of 10 \nyears imprisonment. As with the other three provisions, my bill \nincreases this maximum penalty to 15 years.\n  In addition to these amendments to title 18 of the United States \nCode, the bill I introduce today directs the United States Sentencing \nCommission to revise the Federal sentencing guidelines with respect to \nthese firearms offenses.\n  Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of the rights of law-abiding \ngun owners. However, I firmly believe we need tough penalties for the \nillegal use of firearms.\n  The ``Stolen Gun Penalty Enhancement Act of 1997'' will send a strong \nsignal to criminals who are even thinking about stealing a firearm. \nAnd, I urge my colleagues to join in support of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 992\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. STOLEN FIREARMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 924 of title 18, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)--\n       (A) in paragraph (2), by striking ``(i), (j),''; and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(7) Whoever knowingly violates subsection (i) or (j) of \n     section 922 shall be fined as provided in this title, \n     imprisoned not more than 15 years, or both.'';\n       (2) in subsection (i)(1), by striking ``10 years'' and \n     inserting ``15 years''; and\n       (3) in subsection (l), by striking ``10 years'' and \n     inserting ``15 years''.\n       (b) Sentencing Commission.--The United States Sentencing \n     Commission shall amend the Federal sentencing guidelines to \n     reflect the amendments made by subsection (a).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself and Mr. Dodd) (by request):\n  S. 993. A bill to assist States and secondary and postsecondary \nschools to develop, implement, and improve career preparation education \nso that every student has an opportunity to acquire academic and \ntechnical knowledge and skills needed for postsecondary education, \nfurther learning, and a wide range of opportunities in high-skill, \nhigh-wage careers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources.\n\n\n                the career education reform act of 1997\n\n  S. 994. A bill to provide assistance to States and local communities \nto improve adult education and literacy, to help achieve the national \neducational goals for all citizens, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\nthe adult basic education and literacy for the twenty-first century act\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, I am introducing two important \neducation bills on behalf of Secretary Riley and the administration. \nOne is designed to meet the changing needs of students in vocational \neducation programs. The other outlines a comprehensive strategy for \nenhancing adult education and literacy services. Creating effective \neducational opportunities for these two student populations is \nessential if we are to make the American dream a reality for all our \ncitizens.\n  The Career Preparation Education Reform Act restructures Perkins Act \nprograms to promote student achievement in academic and technical \nskills. Only with both a strong academic background and training in an \nemployable skill will students be fully prepared to compete in the \n21st-century job market. Recognizing this core principle, the \nlegislation supports broad-based career preparation education which \nmeets high academic standards and links vocational education with wider \neducational reform efforts. It encourages learning in both classroom \nand workplace settings. This proposal also contains strong \naccountability provisions to ensure that local programs are actually \nachieving these goals.\n  The Adult Basic Education and Literacy for the Twenty-First Century \nAct recognizes that adult education is an integral component of our \nwork force development system. Nearly 27 percent of the adult \npopulation has not earned a high school diploma or its equivalent. \nTheir chances for career success are increasingly limited. Adult \neducation programs open doors for those who successfully participate in \nthem. They help participants to advance in the working world and to \nfully participate in every aspect of community life. This legislation \nstreamlines existing adult education and literacy programs to maximize \nboth access to educational opportunities and to enhance the quality of \nservices. It seeks to target resources on those areas where the \ngreatest need exists.\n  One of the highest priorities for the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee this year is the development of a comprehensive work force \ndevelopment strategy for our Nation. Effective vocational education and \nadult education programs must be major components of such a plan. These \ninnovative proposals put forth by Secretary Riley should help us to \nachieve that goal.\n\n[[Page S6994]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that each bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 993\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled, That this Act may be cited as the ``Center \n     Preparation Education Reform Act of 1997''.\n\n   TITLE I--AMENDMENTS TO THE CARL D.

The success of State and local educational \n     reforms supported by the Goals 2000: Educate America Act and \n     other programs that State and local communities are \n     implementing requires that parents be well educated and \n     possess the ability to be a child's first and most continuous \n     teacher.\n       ``(5) There is a strong relationship between literacy and \n     poverty. Data from the 1993 National Adult Literacy Survey \n     show that adults with very low levels of literacy are ten \n     times as likely to be poor as those with high levels of \n     literacy.\n       ``(6) Studies, including the National Adult Literacy \n     Survey, have found that more than one-fifth of American \n     adults demonstrate very low literacy skills that make it \n     difficult for them to be economically self-sufficient, much \n     less enter high-skill, high-wage jobs, or to assist \n     effectively in their children's education.\n       ``(7) Many Americans desire English instruction to help \n     them exercise their rights and responsibilities as citizens.\n       ``(8) National studies have also shown that existing \n     federally supported adult education programs have assisted \n     many adults in acquiring basic literacy skills, learning \n     English, or acquiring a high school diploma (or its \n     equivalent), and that family literacy programs have shown \n     great potential for breaking the intergenerational cycle of \n     low literacy and having a positive effect on later school \n     performance and high school completion, especially for \n     children from low-income families.\n       ``(9) Currently, the Adult Education Act lacks adequate \n     accountability requirements, and contains set-asides and \n     categorical programs that are often narrowly focused on \n     specific populations or methods of service delivery, thus \n     inhibiting the capacity of State and local officials to \n     implement programs that meet the needs of individual States \n     and localities.\n       ``(10) The Federal Government, in partnership with States \n     and localities, can assist States and localities to improve \n     and expand their adult education and literacy programs \n     through provision of clear performance goals and indicators, \n     increased State and local flexibility, improved \n     accountability, and incentives for performance.\n       ``(11) The Federal Government can also assist States and \n     localities by supporting research, development, \n     demonstration, dissemination, evaluation, capacity-building, \n     data collection, professional development, and technical \n     assistance activities that further State and local efforts to \n     improve student achievement in adult education and literacy \n     programs.\n       ``(b) Purpose.--(1) It is the purpose of this title to \n     create a performance partnership that includes the Federal \n     government, States, and localities to help provide for adult \n     education and literacy services so that, as called for in the \n     National Education Goals, all adults who need such services \n     will, as appropriate, be able to--\n       ``(A) become literate and obtain the knowledge and skills \n     needed to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights \n     and responsibilities of citizenship;\n       ``(B) complete a high school education; and\n       ``(C) become their children's first teacher and remain \n     actively involved in their children's education in order to \n     ensure their children's readiness for, and success in, \n     school.\n       ``(2) This purpose shall be pursued by--\n       ``(A) building on State and local education reforms \n     supported by the Goals 2000: Educate America Act and other \n     Federal and State legislation;\n       ``(B) consolidating numerous Federal adult education and \n     literacy programs into a single, flexible State grant \n     program;\n       ``(C) tying local programs to challenging State-developed \n     performance goals that are consistent with the purpose of \n     this Act;\n       ``(D) holding States and localities accountable for \n     achieving such goals;\n       ``(E) building program quality through such measures as \n     improving instruction, encouraging greater use of technology \n     in adult\n\n[[Page S7006]]\n\n     education and literacy programs, and improving the \n     professional development of educators working in those \n     programs;\n       ``(F) integrating adult education and literacy programs \n     with States' school-to-work opportunities systems, secondary \n     and postsecondary education systems, job training programs, \n     welfare programs, early childhood and elementary school \n     programs, and other related activities;\n       ``(G) supporting State leadership and program improvement \n     efforts; and\n       (H) supporting the improvement of State and local \n     activities through nationally significant efforts in \n     research, development, demonstration, dissemination, \n     evaluation, capacity-building, data collection, professional \n     development, and technical assistance.\n\n\n                   ``authorization of appropriations\n\n       ``Sec. 303.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit \ncertain interstate conduct relating to exotic animals; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n            THE CAPTIVE EXOTIC ANIMAL PROTECTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nprevent the cruel and unsporting practice of ``canned'' hunting, or \ncaged kills. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Graham, Kennedy, \nBoxer, Moynihan, Torricelli, and Murray.\n  In a canned hunt, a customer pays to shoot a captive exotic animal on \na small game ranch where the animal typically is trapped inside a \nfenced-in enclosure. The enclosed space prevents the animal from \nescaping and making it an easy prey. The so-called hunter returns home \nwith the animal's head to mount on his or her wall and the ranch owner \ncollects a large fee. No hunting, tracking or shooting skills are \nrequired. The animals are easy targets because they typically are \nfriendly to humans, having spent years in captivity, and having been \ncared for and fed by the canned hunt ranch owners.\n  There are reported to be more than 1,000 canned hunting operations in \nthe United States. At these ranches, a customer can, for example, \n``hunt'' a Dama gazelle for $3,500, a Cape Buffalo for $6,000 or a Red \nDeer for $6,000. The rarer the animal, the higher the price.\n  My bill is similar to legislation I introduced in the 104th Congress, \nS. 1493.\n\n[[Page S7011]]\n\nIt is directed only at true canned hunts. It does not affect cattle \nranching, the hunting or breeding of any animals that live in the wild \nin the United States, rodeos, livestock shows, petting zoos, or horse \nor dog racing. It merely bans the procuring and transport of non-\nnative, exotic mammals for the purpose of shooting them for \nentertainment, or to collect a trophy. The bill would not affect larger \nranches, where animals have some opportunity to escape hunters. Nor \ndoes the bill affect the hunting of any animals that live in the wild \nin the United States.\n  Many hunters believe that canned hunts are unethical and make a \nmockery of their sport. For example, the Boone and Crockett Club, a \nhunting organization founded by Teddy Roosevelt, has called canned \nhunts ``unfair'' and ``unsportsmanlike.'' Bill Burton, the former \noutdoors writer for the Baltimore Sun and a hunter, testifying last \nyear in support of this legislation, stated, ``There is a common belief \nthat the hunting of creatures which have no reasonable avenue to escape \nis not up to traditional standards. Shooting game in confinement is not \nwithin these standards.''\n  Canned hunts also are strongly opposed by animal protection groups. \nAs the Humane Society of the United States has said about animals in \ncanned hunts, ``the instinct to flee, their greatest natural defense, \nhas been replaced by trust--trust that is rewarded with a cruel and \nbrutal death.'' Indeed, many animals killed in canned hunts suffer \nimmeasurably as they receive shot after shot to non-vital organs. This \npractice is intended to preserve the head and chest regions intact so \nthat the animals will make more attractive trophies.\n  The practice of keeping captive animals for canned hunts may also \npose a danger to native wildlife or livestock if the captive animals \nescape. John Talbott, acting director of the Wyoming Department of Fish \nand Game, stated that ``Tuberculosis and other disease documented among \ngame ranch animals in surrounding States'' pose ``an extremely serious \nthreat to Wyoming's native big game.'' This is one reason why Wyoming \nhas banned canned hunts. Other States that have banned these hunts \ninclude California, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, \nNevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin.\n  Unfortunately, in most States, canned hunts are largely unregulated. \nThe lack of State laws, and the fact that many of these animals move in \ninterstate commerce, make Federal legislation necessary.\n  I urge my colleagues who want to understand the cruelty involved in a \ncanned hunt to visit my office and view a videotape of an actual canned \nhunt. You will witness a defenseless Corsican ram, cornered near a \nfence, being shot over and again with arrows, and clearly experiencing \nan agonizing death, then only to be dealt a final blow by a firearm. \nThen I urge you to join me in support of this legislation which will \nput an end to this needless suffering.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 995\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the authorization of appropriations in \neach fiscal year for arbitration in U.S. district courts; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n       By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 997. A bill to amend chapter 44 of title 28, United States Code, \nto authorize the use of certain arbitration procedures in all district \ncourts, to modify the damage limitation applicable to cases referred to \narbitration, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                        Arbitration Legislation\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise at this time to introduce two \nbills. Both bills are designed to encourage what is known in the legal \nworld as arbitration, which is a type of alternative dispute resolution \nand a means of settling differences instead of litigating them in the \ncostly environment and adversarial environment of the courts.\n  Our great American leader, Abraham Lincoln, wrote over 140 years ago, \nin 1840: ``Discourage litigation. Persuade your neighbors to compromise \nwhenever you can.'' That is exactly what these two bills are designed \nto do.\n  For over 20 years now, all three branches have looked for ways to \nalleviate the courts' crowded docket and to enable a civil litigant to \nhave his complaint heard in a more expedient fashion. In 1976, in \nsearch of alternatives, Chief Justice Burger convened the Pound \nConference on the Causes of Popular Dissatisfaction with the \nAdministration of Justice and asked its members: ``Isn't there a better \nway?''\n  There is, and that way is called alternative dispute resolution. Most \nState and Federal bar associations now have alternative dispute \nresolution committees. Some have even elevated consideration of ADR \napproaches to a matter of professional ethics or its equivalent. Almost \nall law schools across the country now offer their students classes in \nADR. Many graduate programs, especially business schools, have added \nADR courses to their curriculum. And numerous legal and business \npublications are committed exclusively to the topic of alternative \ndispute resolution.\n  Contracts, be they between nations, major corporations, or even \nprivate individuals, now more often than not include arbitration \nclauses. There are numerous professional and trade associations under \nthe umbrella of alternative dispute resolution. ADR is not a legal \nvogue, nor is it second-class justice. ADR is an intelligent and \nefficient alternative to litigation, and it is a way to ensure that \ncivil matters can be handled as quickly as possible with low cost to \nthe parties and with an outstanding settlement and satisfaction rate \namong all entities involved. Arbitration in particular combines \nprocedural protections with the informality necessary for parties to \ndiscuss their positions in a manner that promotes settlement and allows \nfor a detailed exploration of the issues.\n  In 1990, Congress enacted bills to authorize implementation of ADR \nprograms throughout the administrative agency apparatus and to ask \nFederal courts to consider ADR as a means to reduce cost. For example, \non November 15, 1990, President Bush signed into law a bill which I \nintroduced called the Administrative Dispute Resolutions Act. This act \nauthorized and promoted the use of alternative dispute resolution by \nFederal Government agencies.\n  Almost immediately, the success of the bill became evident. In 1992, \nfor example, agencies reported that over 70 percent of the disputes \nsubmitted to ADR reached settlement. Often mere discussion of what ADR \ntechniques to apply led to agreement between the parties. Last year, in \na unified showing of support for the idea of ADR, including \narbitration, we permanently reauthorized that 1990 act. 1990 also saw \nthe passage of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act, which authorized the use \nof negotiated rulemaking as an alternative to\n\n[[Page S7012]]\n\nadversarial rulemaking in Federal agencies, and the Civil Justice \nReform Act, which required every Federal district court to develop a \ncivil justice expense and delay reduction plan.\n  To test the ADR waters in the article III courts, in 1988, Congress \namended the Judiciary and Judicial Procedure Act and authorized pilot \nprograms in 20 Federal district courts. The amendment made court-\nannexed, nonbinding arbitration mandatory in 10 districts and voluntary \nin the other 10. The results are in, and they are more than \nencouraging. Therefore, the first bill I am introducing today will \npermanently extend authorization of these pilot programs so that these \ncourts can continue to provide litigants with efficient and successful \nalternatives to trial. Senator Specter, whose own home State of \nPennsylvania has participated in this program, is joining me in this \neffort.\n  Over half of the Nation's 94 districts currently offer some type of \nalternative dispute resolution. This number seems low, and the reason \nfor that is because many districts are not sure whether courts other \nthan those authorized by statute may offer ADR. Therefore, to eliminate \nthis uncertainty, the second bill I am introducing not only authorizes \ndistrict courts across the Nation to implement arbitration programs and \nprocedures, it demands such implementation. It will then be left to the \ndiscretion of each judge, however, whether to make use of the \nimplemented programs and procedures.\n  The major goal of arbitration is to encourage litigants to settle \ntheir disputes without going through the lengthy and costly process of \na full-blown trial. This will not only lessen the burden on the \njudicial branch, but also enable people who feel they have been wronged \nto get a decision without waiting months for the usual verdict and \nwithout spending tons of money on attorney's fees.\n  Let me just give an example, and this is according to the National \nLaw Journal. It was an article that was published last year. It has \nbeen determined that out of every dollar spent in asbestos litigation, \nonly 39 cents goes to victims, with approximately 33 to 50 percent of \nthe awards collected allocated as attorney's fees.\n\n  My arbitration bills are designed to curb exactly this type of \n``plaintiff-milking.'' In the pilot program districts, the majority of \narbitration cases closed before even reaching the arbitration hearing \nlevel and over two-thirds did not return to the court's regular \ncalendar, thus saving not only the litigants, but also the courts and, \ntherefore, the public both time and money. In the New Jersey program, \nabout 20 percent of the civil case filings qualified for mandatory \narbitration over the 8-year period which the program operated. Less \nthan 2 percent of those cases required trial; in other words, 98 \npercent of those cases could be settled via arbitration.\n  A majority of the attorneys involved in arbitration cases agreed that \nreferring the case to the program directly resulted in earlier \nsettlement discussions and, most important, in avoiding litigation. For \nthe parties involved, that means their issues were resolved from 2 to \n18 months sooner than if the case had gone to trial. In the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania, as an example, the median time until a \ndispute is resolved through ADR is 5 months. Only 7 percent of the \ndistrict's arbitration cases lasted beyond 9 months and the percentage \nof cases tried de novo is less than 10 percent.\n  Litigants, attorneys, and judges all are more than laudatory of the \nprogram's results. As a matter of fact, positive reaction could be \ndocumented almost as soon as the program was implemented. A 1990 report \nby the Federal Judicial Center illustrates this point. Over 80 percent \nof the litigants surveyed praised the fairness of the ADR process; 84 \npercent of attorneys surveyed said that they approved of arbitration \nboth as a concept and, more important, as implemented in their specific \ndistricts.\n  Also, an overwhelming 97 percent of the judges involved in the \nprogram agreed that their civil caseload was reduced since less than a \nthird of the arbitration caseload returns to the regular trial \ncalendar. The resounding consensus was that other districts should also \nadopt this outstanding program as a result of this experiment.\n  Let me give you another example of the success of ADR. A November \n1996 study of the Judicial Council of California, on California's Civil \nAction Mediation Act, showed that litigant satisfaction for arbitration \nin the Los Angeles County Superior Court was 84 percent and that 94 \npercent of the overall respondents would use arbitration again.\n  Incidentally, that same study showed that the program's mediation \nprocess within 2 years produced savings five times higher than what the \nCalifornia Legislature had targeted for 5 years. In other words, \nCalifornia had targeted $250,000 after 5 years to consider the \nmediation program a success. ADR saved the courts a total of $1.3 \nmillion in just 2 years. Whether it is mediation, arbitration, or any \nother of the ADR techniques, alternative dispute resolution undoubtedly \nis successful in creating huge savings for both the public and the \nlitigants.\n  The benefits of arbitration, not only to the judicial branch, but, \nmore important, to the litigants, are impossible to ignore. Skeptics \nargue that the litigant will feel he is being subjected to second-class \njustice, but, quite frankly, the opposite is the case. Litigants feel \nthat they are much more closely involved in the process than would be \nthe case if there was formal adjudication. Litigants can participate \nmuch more actively and have much more control over what is decided and \nhow it is decided. Negotiation, rather than adjudication, is the goal. \nAnd when all is said and done, unlike after a trial, the parties on \nopposite sides of the table often still have some type of positive \nrelationship.\n  On top of that, the process is private, unlike the public trial. In \nsuch a private, somewhat informal setting, the parties involved have \nmuch more flexibility, not only regarding procedure but also remedies. \nGenerally, as we know, an article III court in a civil matter will \nlimit remedies to a dollar figure. Arbitration can go beyond that. \nOften all a plaintiff wants might be an apology, or the injured worker \nwho can't perform his job any more just wants another job. Arbitration \ncan give a party those results.\n  Arbitration is a legal concept that makes sense, saves time, and \nsaves money. As a matter of fact, the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, \none of the pilot programs, estimates that arbitration has produced a 5-\nto-1 savings in private and public costs.\n  So the two bills that I am introducing today will, therefore, help \ngive the public efficient and expedient access to the Federal courts \nand will help alleviate the caseload burden on the judicial branch.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that my two bills be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 996\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

This new law, P.L. 104-\n     333, the Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of \n     1996, included over 100 titles. With many individual bills \n     being included in this package, a number of cross-references \n     need changing, along with some spelling and grammatical \n     errors. The attached draft bill would make these corrections.\n\n[[Page S6993]]\n\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection to the enactment of the enclosed draft \n     legislation from the standpoint of the Administration's \n     program.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Jane Lyder,\n\n                                    Legislative Counsel, Office of\n                            Congressional and Legislative Affairs.\n       Enclosures.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 992. A bill to amend chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code, \nto increase the maximum term of imprisonment for offenses involving \nstolen firearms; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n             the stolen gun penalty enhancement act of 1997\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, many crimes in our country are being \ncommitted with stolen guns. The extent of this problem is reflected in \na number of recent studies and news reports. Therefore, today I am \nintroducing the Stolen Gun Penalty Enhancement Act of 1997 to increase \nthe maximum prison sentences for violating existing stolen gun laws.\n  Reports indicate almost half a million guns are stolen each year. As \nof March 1995, there were over 2 million reports in the stolen gun file \nof the FBI's National Crime Information Center including 7,700 reports \nof stolen machine guns and submachine guns. In a 5 year period between \n1987 and 1992, the National Crime Victimization Survey notes that there \nwere over 300,000 incidents of guns stolen from private citizens.\n   Studies conducted by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms \nnote that felons steal firearms to avoid background checks. A 1991 \nBureau of Justice Statistics survey of State prison inmates notes that \nalmost 10 percent had stolen a handgun, and over 10 percent of all \ninmates had traded or sold a stolen firearm.\n  This problem is especially alarming among young people. A Justice \nDepartment study of juvenile inmates in four States shows that over 50 \npercent of those inmates had stolen a gun.\n  In my home State of Colorado, the Colorado Bureau of Investigation \nreceives over 500 reports of stolen guns each month. As of this month, \nthe Bureau has a total of 34,825 firearms on its unrecovered firearms \nlist.\n  All of these studies and statistics show the extent of the problem of \nstolen guns. Therefore, the bill I am introducing today will increase \nthe maximum prison sentences for violating existing stolen gun laws.\n  Specifically, my bill increases the maximum penalty for violating \nfour provisions of the firearms laws. Under section 922(i) of title 18 \nof the United States Code, it is illegal to knowingly transport or ship \na stolen firearm or stolen ammunition. Under section 922(j) of title \n18, it is illegal to knowingly receive, possess, conceal, store, sell, \nor otherwise dispose of a stolen firearm or stolen ammunition.\n  The penalty for violating either of these provisions, as provided by \nsection 924(a)(2) of title 18, is a fine, a maximum term of \nimprisonment of 10 years, or both. My bill increases the maximum prison \nsentence to 15 years.\n  The third provision, set forth in section 922(u) of title 18, makes \nit illegal to steal a firearm from a licensed dealer, importer, or \nmanufacturer. For violating this provision, the maximum term of \nimprisonment set forth in 18 U.S.C. 924(i)(1) would be increased to a \nmaximum 15 years under my bill.\n  And the fourth provision, section 924(l) of title 18, makes it \nillegal to steal a firearm from any person, including a licensed \nfirearms collector. This provision also imposes a maximum penalty of 10 \nyears imprisonment. As with the other three provisions, my bill \nincreases this maximum penalty to 15 years.\n  In addition to these amendments to title 18 of the United States \nCode, the bill I introduce today directs the United States Sentencing \nCommission to revise the Federal sentencing guidelines with respect to \nthese firearms offenses.\n  Mr. President, I am a strong supporter of the rights of law-abiding \ngun owners. However, I firmly believe we need tough penalties for the \nillegal use of firearms.\n  The ``Stolen Gun Penalty Enhancement Act of 1997'' will send a strong \nsignal to criminals who are even thinking about stealing a firearm. \nAnd, I urge my colleagues to join in support of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 992\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to assist States and secondary and postsecondary \nschools to develop, implement, and improve career preparation education \nso that every student has an opportunity to acquire academic and \ntechnical knowledge and skills needed for postsecondary education, \nfurther learning, and a wide range of opportunities in high-skill, \nhigh-wage careers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor \nand Human Resources.\n\n\n                the career education reform act of 1997\n\n  S. 994. A bill to provide assistance to States and local communities \nto improve adult education and literacy, to help achieve the national \neducational goals for all citizens, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\nthe adult basic education and literacy for the twenty-first century act\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, I am introducing two important \neducation bills on behalf of Secretary Riley and the administration. \nOne is designed to meet the changing needs of students in vocational \neducation programs. The other outlines a comprehensive strategy for \nenhancing adult education and literacy services. Creating effective \neducational opportunities for these two student populations is \nessential if we are to make the American dream a reality for all our \ncitizens.\n  The Career Preparation Education Reform Act restructures Perkins Act \nprograms to promote student achievement in academic and technical \nskills. Only with both a strong academic background and training in an \nemployable skill will students be fully prepared to compete in the \n21st-century job market. Recognizing this core principle, the \nlegislation supports broad-based career preparation education which \nmeets high academic standards and links vocational education with wider \neducational reform efforts. It encourages learning in both classroom \nand workplace settings. This proposal also contains strong \naccountability provisions to ensure that local programs are actually \nachieving these goals.\n  The Adult Basic Education and Literacy for the Twenty-First Century \nAct recognizes that adult education is an integral component of our \nwork force development system. Nearly 27 percent of the adult \npopulation has not earned a high school diploma or its equivalent. \nTheir chances for career success are increasingly limited. Adult \neducation programs open doors for those who successfully participate in \nthem. They help participants to advance in the working world and to \nfully participate in every aspect of community life. This legislation \nstreamlines existing adult education and literacy programs to maximize \nboth access to educational opportunities and to enhance the quality of \nservices. It seeks to target resources on those areas where the \ngreatest need exists.\n  One of the highest priorities for the Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee this year is the development of a comprehensive work force \ndevelopment strategy for our Nation. Effective vocational education and \nadult education programs must be major components of such a plan. These \ninnovative proposals put forth by Secretary Riley should help us to \nachieve that goal.\n\n[[Page S6994]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that each bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 993\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled, That this Act may be cited as the ``Center \n     Preparation Education Reform Act of 1997''.\n\n   TITLE I--AMENDMENTS TO THE CARL D.

The success of State and local educational \n     reforms supported by the Goals 2000: Educate America Act and \n     other programs that State and local communities are \n     implementing requires that parents be well educated and \n     possess the ability to be a child's first and most continuous \n     teacher.\n       ``(5) There is a strong relationship between literacy and \n     poverty. Data from the 1993 National Adult Literacy Survey \n     show that adults with very low levels of literacy are ten \n     times as likely to be poor as those with high levels of \n     literacy.\n       ``(6) Studies, including the National Adult Literacy \n     Survey, have found that more than one-fifth of American \n     adults demonstrate very low literacy skills that make it \n     difficult for them to be economically self-sufficient, much \n     less enter high-skill, high-wage jobs, or to assist \n     effectively in their children's education.\n       ``(7) Many Americans desire English instruction to help \n     them exercise their rights and responsibilities as citizens.\n       ``(8) National studies have also shown that existing \n     federally supported adult education programs have assisted \n     many adults in acquiring basic literacy skills, learning \n     English, or acquiring a high school diploma (or its \n     equivalent), and that family literacy programs have shown \n     great potential for breaking the intergenerational cycle of \n     low literacy and having a positive effect on later school \n     performance and high school completion, especially for \n     children from low-income families.\n       ``(9) Currently, the Adult Education Act lacks adequate \n     accountability requirements, and contains set-asides and \n     categorical programs that are often narrowly focused on \n     specific populations or methods of service delivery, thus \n     inhibiting the capacity of State and local officials to \n     implement programs that meet the needs of individual States \n     and localities.\n       ``(10) The Federal Government, in partnership with States \n     and localities, can assist States and localities to improve \n     and expand their adult education and literacy programs \n     through provision of clear performance goals and indicators, \n     increased State and local flexibility, improved \n     accountability, and incentives for performance.\n       ``(11) The Federal Government can also assist States and \n     localities by supporting research, development, \n     demonstration, dissemination, evaluation, capacity-building, \n     data collection, professional development, and technical \n     assistance activities that further State and local efforts to \n     improve student achievement in adult education and literacy \n     programs.\n       ``(b) Purpose.--(1) It is the purpose of this title to \n     create a performance partnership that includes the Federal \n     government, States, and localities to help provide for adult \n     education and literacy services so that, as called for in the \n     National Education Goals, all adults who need such services \n     will, as appropriate, be able to--\n       ``(A) become literate and obtain the knowledge and skills \n     needed to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights \n     and responsibilities of citizenship;\n       ``(B) complete a high school education; and\n       ``(C) become their children's first teacher and remain \n     actively involved in their children's education in order to \n     ensure their children's readiness for, and success in, \n     school.\n       ``(2) This purpose shall be pursued by--\n       ``(A) building on State and local education reforms \n     supported by the Goals 2000: Educate America Act and other \n     Federal and State legislation;\n       ``(B) consolidating numerous Federal adult education and \n     literacy programs into a single, flexible State grant \n     program;\n       ``(C) tying local programs to challenging State-developed \n     performance goals that are consistent with the purpose of \n     this Act;\n       ``(D) holding States and localities accountable for \n     achieving such goals;\n       ``(E) building program quality through such measures as \n     improving instruction, encouraging greater use of technology \n     in adult\n\n[[Page S7006]]\n\n     education and literacy programs, and improving the \n     professional development of educators working in those \n     programs;\n       ``(F) integrating adult education and literacy programs \n     with States' school-to-work opportunities systems, secondary \n     and postsecondary education systems, job training programs, \n     welfare programs, early childhood and elementary school \n     programs, and other related activities;\n       ``(G) supporting State leadership and program improvement \n     efforts; and\n       (H) supporting the improvement of State and local \n     activities through nationally significant efforts in \n     research, development, demonstration, dissemination, \n     evaluation, capacity-building, data collection, professional \n     development, and technical assistance.\n\n\n                   ``authorization of appropriations\n\n       ``Sec. 303.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit \ncertain interstate conduct relating to exotic animals; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n            THE CAPTIVE EXOTIC ANIMAL PROTECTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nprevent the cruel and unsporting practice of ``canned'' hunting, or \ncaged kills. I am pleased to be joined by Senators Graham, Kennedy, \nBoxer, Moynihan, Torricelli, and Murray.\n  In a canned hunt, a customer pays to shoot a captive exotic animal on \na small game ranch where the animal typically is trapped inside a \nfenced-in enclosure. The enclosed space prevents the animal from \nescaping and making it an easy prey. The so-called hunter returns home \nwith the animal's head to mount on his or her wall and the ranch owner \ncollects a large fee. No hunting, tracking or shooting skills are \nrequired. The animals are easy targets because they typically are \nfriendly to humans, having spent years in captivity, and having been \ncared for and fed by the canned hunt ranch owners.\n  There are reported to be more than 1,000 canned hunting operations in \nthe United States. At these ranches, a customer can, for example, \n``hunt'' a Dama gazelle for $3,500, a Cape Buffalo for $6,000 or a Red \nDeer for $6,000. The rarer the animal, the higher the price.\n  My bill is similar to legislation I introduced in the 104th Congress, \nS. 1493.\n\n[[Page S7011]]\n\nIt is directed only at true canned hunts. It does not affect cattle \nranching, the hunting or breeding of any animals that live in the wild \nin the United States, rodeos, livestock shows, petting zoos, or horse \nor dog racing. It merely bans the procuring and transport of non-\nnative, exotic mammals for the purpose of shooting them for \nentertainment, or to collect a trophy. The bill would not affect larger \nranches, where animals have some opportunity to escape hunters. Nor \ndoes the bill affect the hunting of any animals that live in the wild \nin the United States.\n  Many hunters believe that canned hunts are unethical and make a \nmockery of their sport. For example, the Boone and Crockett Club, a \nhunting organization founded by Teddy Roosevelt, has called canned \nhunts ``unfair'' and ``unsportsmanlike.'' Bill Burton, the former \noutdoors writer for the Baltimore Sun and a hunter, testifying last \nyear in support of this legislation, stated, ``There is a common belief \nthat the hunting of creatures which have no reasonable avenue to escape \nis not up to traditional standards. Shooting game in confinement is not \nwithin these standards.''\n  Canned hunts also are strongly opposed by animal protection groups. \nAs the Humane Society of the United States has said about animals in \ncanned hunts, ``the instinct to flee, their greatest natural defense, \nhas been replaced by trust--trust that is rewarded with a cruel and \nbrutal death.'' Indeed, many animals killed in canned hunts suffer \nimmeasurably as they receive shot after shot to non-vital organs. This \npractice is intended to preserve the head and chest regions intact so \nthat the animals will make more attractive trophies.\n  The practice of keeping captive animals for canned hunts may also \npose a danger to native wildlife or livestock if the captive animals \nescape. John Talbott, acting director of the Wyoming Department of Fish \nand Game, stated that ``Tuberculosis and other disease documented among \ngame ranch animals in surrounding States'' pose ``an extremely serious \nthreat to Wyoming's native big game.'' This is one reason why Wyoming \nhas banned canned hunts. Other States that have banned these hunts \ninclude California, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, \nNevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin.\n  Unfortunately, in most States, canned hunts are largely unregulated. \nThe lack of State laws, and the fact that many of these animals move in \ninterstate commerce, make Federal legislation necessary.\n  I urge my colleagues who want to understand the cruelty involved in a \ncanned hunt to visit my office and view a videotape of an actual canned \nhunt. You will witness a defenseless Corsican ram, cornered near a \nfence, being shot over and again with arrows, and clearly experiencing \nan agonizing death, then only to be dealt a final blow by a firearm. \nThen I urge you to join me in support of this legislation which will \nput an end to this needless suffering.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 995\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Captive Exotic Animal \n     Protection Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to provide for the authorization of appropriations in \neach fiscal year for arbitration in U.S. district courts; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n       By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 997. A bill to amend chapter 44 of title 28, United States Code, \nto authorize the use of certain arbitration procedures in all district \ncourts, to modify the damage limitation applicable to cases referred to \narbitration, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                        Arbitration Legislation\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise at this time to introduce two \nbills. Both bills are designed to encourage what is known in the legal \nworld as arbitration, which is a type of alternative dispute resolution \nand a means of settling differences instead of litigating them in the \ncostly environment and adversarial environment of the courts.\n  Our great American leader, Abraham Lincoln, wrote over 140 years ago, \nin 1840: ``Discourage litigation. Persuade your neighbors to compromise \nwhenever you can.'' That is exactly what these two bills are designed \nto do.\n  For over 20 years now, all three branches have looked for ways to \nalleviate the courts' crowded docket and to enable a civil litigant to \nhave his complaint heard in a more expedient fashion. In 1976, in \nsearch of alternatives, Chief Justice Burger convened the Pound \nConference on the Causes of Popular Dissatisfaction with the \nAdministration of Justice and asked its members: ``Isn't there a better \nway?''\n  There is, and that way is called alternative dispute resolution. Most \nState and Federal bar associations now have alternative dispute \nresolution committees. Some have even elevated consideration of ADR \napproaches to a matter of professional ethics or its equivalent. Almost \nall law schools across the country now offer their students classes in \nADR. Many graduate programs, especially business schools, have added \nADR courses to their curriculum. And numerous legal and business \npublications are committed exclusively to the topic of alternative \ndispute resolution.\n  Contracts, be they between nations, major corporations, or even \nprivate individuals, now more often than not include arbitration \nclauses. There are numerous professional and trade associations under \nthe umbrella of alternative dispute resolution. ADR is not a legal \nvogue, nor is it second-class justice. ADR is an intelligent and \nefficient alternative to litigation, and it is a way to ensure that \ncivil matters can be handled as quickly as possible with low cost to \nthe parties and with an outstanding settlement and satisfaction rate \namong all entities involved. Arbitration in particular combines \nprocedural protections with the informality necessary for parties to \ndiscuss their positions in a manner that promotes settlement and allows \nfor a detailed exploration of the issues.\n  In 1990, Congress enacted bills to authorize implementation of ADR \nprograms throughout the administrative agency apparatus and to ask \nFederal courts to consider ADR as a means to reduce cost. For example, \non November 15, 1990, President Bush signed into law a bill which I \nintroduced called the Administrative Dispute Resolutions Act. This act \nauthorized and promoted the use of alternative dispute resolution by \nFederal Government agencies.\n  Almost immediately, the success of the bill became evident. In 1992, \nfor example, agencies reported that over 70 percent of the disputes \nsubmitted to ADR reached settlement. Often mere discussion of what ADR \ntechniques to apply led to agreement between the parties. Last year, in \na unified showing of support for the idea of ADR, including \narbitration, we permanently reauthorized that 1990 act. 1990 also saw \nthe passage of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act, which authorized the use \nof negotiated rulemaking as an alternative to\n\n[[Page S7012]]\n\nadversarial rulemaking in Federal agencies, and the Civil Justice \nReform Act, which required every Federal district court to develop a \ncivil justice expense and delay reduction plan.\n  To test the ADR waters in the article III courts, in 1988, Congress \namended the Judiciary and Judicial Procedure Act and authorized pilot \nprograms in 20 Federal district courts. The amendment made court-\nannexed, nonbinding arbitration mandatory in 10 districts and voluntary \nin the other 10. The results are in, and they are more than \nencouraging. Therefore, the first bill I am introducing today will \npermanently extend authorization of these pilot programs so that these \ncourts can continue to provide litigants with efficient and successful \nalternatives to trial. Senator Specter, whose own home State of \nPennsylvania has participated in this program, is joining me in this \neffort.\n  Over half of the Nation's 94 districts currently offer some type of \nalternative dispute resolution. This number seems low, and the reason \nfor that is because many districts are not sure whether courts other \nthan those authorized by statute may offer ADR. Therefore, to eliminate \nthis uncertainty, the second bill I am introducing not only authorizes \ndistrict courts across the Nation to implement arbitration programs and \nprocedures, it demands such implementation. It will then be left to the \ndiscretion of each judge, however, whether to make use of the \nimplemented programs and procedures.\n  The major goal of arbitration is to encourage litigants to settle \ntheir disputes without going through the lengthy and costly process of \na full-blown trial. This will not only lessen the burden on the \njudicial branch, but also enable people who feel they have been wronged \nto get a decision without waiting months for the usual verdict and \nwithout spending tons of money on attorney's fees.\n  Let me just give an example, and this is according to the National \nLaw Journal. It was an article that was published last year. It has \nbeen determined that out of every dollar spent in asbestos litigation, \nonly 39 cents goes to victims, with approximately 33 to 50 percent of \nthe awards collected allocated as attorney's fees.\n\n  My arbitration bills are designed to curb exactly this type of \n``plaintiff-milking.'' In the pilot program districts, the majority of \narbitration cases closed before even reaching the arbitration hearing \nlevel and over two-thirds did not return to the court's regular \ncalendar, thus saving not only the litigants, but also the courts and, \ntherefore, the public both time and money. In the New Jersey program, \nabout 20 percent of the civil case filings qualified for mandatory \narbitration over the 8-year period which the program operated. Less \nthan 2 percent of those cases required trial; in other words, 98 \npercent of those cases could be settled via arbitration.\n  A majority of the attorneys involved in arbitration cases agreed that \nreferring the case to the program directly resulted in earlier \nsettlement discussions and, most important, in avoiding litigation. For \nthe parties involved, that means their issues were resolved from 2 to \n18 months sooner than if the case had gone to trial. In the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania, as an example, the median time until a \ndispute is resolved through ADR is 5 months. Only 7 percent of the \ndistrict's arbitration cases lasted beyond 9 months and the percentage \nof cases tried de novo is less than 10 percent.\n  Litigants, attorneys, and judges all are more than laudatory of the \nprogram's results. As a matter of fact, positive reaction could be \ndocumented almost as soon as the program was implemented. A 1990 report \nby the Federal Judicial Center illustrates this point. Over 80 percent \nof the litigants surveyed praised the fairness of the ADR process; 84 \npercent of attorneys surveyed said that they approved of arbitration \nboth as a concept and, more important, as implemented in their specific \ndistricts.\n  Also, an overwhelming 97 percent of the judges involved in the \nprogram agreed that their civil caseload was reduced since less than a \nthird of the arbitration caseload returns to the regular trial \ncalendar. The resounding consensus was that other districts should also \nadopt this outstanding program as a result of this experiment.\n  Let me give you another example of the success of ADR. A November \n1996 study of the Judicial Council of California, on California's Civil \nAction Mediation Act, showed that litigant satisfaction for arbitration \nin the Los Angeles County Superior Court was 84 percent and that 94 \npercent of the overall respondents would use arbitration again.\n  Incidentally, that same study showed that the program's mediation \nprocess within 2 years produced savings five times higher than what the \nCalifornia Legislature had targeted for 5 years. In other words, \nCalifornia had targeted $250,000 after 5 years to consider the \nmediation program a success. ADR saved the courts a total of $1.3 \nmillion in just 2 years. Whether it is mediation, arbitration, or any \nother of the ADR techniques, alternative dispute resolution undoubtedly \nis successful in creating huge savings for both the public and the \nlitigants.\n  The benefits of arbitration, not only to the judicial branch, but, \nmore important, to the litigants, are impossible to ignore. Skeptics \nargue that the litigant will feel he is being subjected to second-class \njustice, but, quite frankly, the opposite is the case. Litigants feel \nthat they are much more closely involved in the process than would be \nthe case if there was formal adjudication. Litigants can participate \nmuch more actively and have much more control over what is decided and \nhow it is decided. Negotiation, rather than adjudication, is the goal. \nAnd when all is said and done, unlike after a trial, the parties on \nopposite sides of the table often still have some type of positive \nrelationship.\n  On top of that, the process is private, unlike the public trial. In \nsuch a private, somewhat informal setting, the parties involved have \nmuch more flexibility, not only regarding procedure but also remedies. \nGenerally, as we know, an article III court in a civil matter will \nlimit remedies to a dollar figure. Arbitration can go beyond that. \nOften all a plaintiff wants might be an apology, or the injured worker \nwho can't perform his job any more just wants another job. Arbitration \ncan give a party those results.\n  Arbitration is a legal concept that makes sense, saves time, and \nsaves money. As a matter of fact, the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, \none of the pilot programs, estimates that arbitration has produced a 5-\nto-1 savings in private and public costs.\n  So the two bills that I am introducing today will, therefore, help \ngive the public efficient and expedient access to the Federal courts \nand will help alleviate the caseload burden on the judicial branch.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that my two bills be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 996\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

OF PHILADELPHIA\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I would like to take a few \nmoments of Senate business to give a special word of thanks to the \nTasty Baking Co. for\n\n[[Page S7021]]\n\nits generosity to some very special inner-city children.\n  As many of my colleagues may recall, the Philadelphia Flyers recently \nfaced the Detroit Red Wings in the Stanley Cup Finals. To make the game \na bit more interesting, Senator Abraham and I placed a friendly wager \non the outcome. Unlike most interests in this series, the junior \nSenator from Michigan and I each picked a food donor and an inner-city \nschool that would receive a complimentary party. If the Flyers lost, \nthe Tasty Bakery agreed to donate 800 Tastykakes--400 to Warren G. \nHarding Elementary School in Detroit and 400 to William Penn High \nSchool in Philadelphia. If the Red Wings lost, Little Caesars Pizza \nwould give a pizza party to both schools. Regardless of the outcome, \nthe children stood to win.\n  Mr. President, I'm sorry to say that the Flyers did not bring the \nStanley Cup back home to Pennsylvania. So, on June 16, the students of \nWilliam Penn enjoyed their complimentary Tastykakes and Crazy Bread--\nwhich Little Caesars graciously donated despite the Red Wings' victory. \nRecently, the children of Warren G. Harding Elementary celebrated their \nvictory party.\n  In closing, I would like to thank Little Caesars and the men and \nwomen at the Tasty Bakery for making these parties possible. I would \nparticularly like to thank Kathleen Grim, Tasty Bakery's manager of \ncommunity affairs, for coordinating this effort. I ask my colleagues to \njoin me in extending the Senate's best wishes for continued success to \nthe Tasty Bakery in Philadelphia, PA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/08/senate-section/article/S7020-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       SAFER SCHOOLS ACT OF 1997\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my \ncolleagues to support legislation introduced by Senator Byron Dorgan \nand myself--the Safer Schools Act of 1997--which will ensure that \nstudents who bring guns to school can be suspended.\n  This legislation was originally introduced late last session in \nreaction to a startling ruling by an appellate court in New York that \nsaid a student should not have been suspended from school because the \nweapon he was carrying was uncovered during a search without a warrant.\n  We have reached a crisis in this country--a crisis which makes it \ndifficult for parents to see their children off to school in the \nmorning, for fear they will never see them again.\n  Each day in America, it is estimated that 100,000 guns are brought \ninto American schools. According to the Centers for Disease Control, 2 \nin 25 high school students, or 7.9 percent, report having carried a gun \nin the last 30 days. In Los Angeles, according to an ACLU survey \nconducted earlier this year, 49 percent of high school students said \nthey have seen a weapon in school, many of them guns.\n  In response to these types of alarming figures, Senator Dorgan and I \nintroduced the Gun Free Schools Act in 1994 to set a zero-tolerance \npolicy to keep America's schools gun-free. The goal of this legislation \nwas to remove firearms from all public schools in the United States.\n  Although we still have a way to go to make all schools gun-free, this \nzero-tolerance policy is working to make our schools safer. A \npreliminary report recently released from the U.S. Department of \nEducation provides irrefutable proof that this law is well on its way \ntoward meeting this important goal. I am told that a full report on all \nthe States will be due out sometime later this summer.\n  The Gun Free Schools Act has been responsible for the expulsions of \nmore than 6,276 students in 29 States caught during the 1995-96 school \nyear for trying to carry guns to school. This means there were 6,276 \nfewer opportunities for a child to be killed or injured by gunfire at \nschool in the United States. According to the California Department of \nEducation, there were 1,039 firearms-related expulsions in public \nschools in California during this same period. The entire State of \nCalifornia has 1,043 school districts. Amazingly, this translates into \nan average of one expulsion for every district in my State.\n  Today, each and every one of the 50 States and the District of \nColumbia have complied with the Gun Free Schools Act by passing laws \nrequiring schools to expel--for at least 1 year --students who are \ncaught carrying a gun.\n  But the ruling of an appellate court in New York threatens to \nundermine the progress we have made in setting a zero-tolerance policy \nfor guns in schools.\n  The appellate court in this particular case applied the same \nevidentiary standards that apply to criminal proceedings in what was a \nschool disciplinary action. The school, however, refused to lift the \nstudent's suspension and as a result, their action was upheld by the \nState Court of Appeals.\n  Mr. President, I believe that common sense was cast aside with the \nappellate court ruling. Incredibly, what the appellate court's decision \nsaid was that this student should not have been expelled from school \nand that his record should be expunged from any wrongdoing in the case.\n  Our legislation states very clearly that the exclusionary rule should \nnot be applied in school disciplinary proceedings. What the legislation \nsays is that you cannot exclude a gun as evidence in a disciplinary \naction in school.\n  This common-sense legislation does not violate the constitutional \nrights of children. This bill does not exonerate school officials who \nconduct unreasonable or unlawful searches and persons who have been \naggrieved will have every right to pursue judicial or statutory \nremedies available.\n  The Safer Schools Act of 1997 will prevent kids who do bring a gun to \nschool from slipping through a school's reasonable disciplinary \nprocess.\n  Fortunately, last September's court ruling that a gun can be excluded \nfrom use as evidence in an internal school disciplinary proceeding was \nultimately reversed. But a similar ruling could be made in another \nState.\n  This legislation would send a clear signal that guns have no place in \nthe hands of our children or in the hallways and classrooms of their \nschools. All children should be able to go to school without fearing \nfor their safety.\n  This legislation also would say to school administrators throughout \nthe Nation that it is perfectly legitimate to conduct a disciplinary \nproceeding in cases where a student has brought a gun to school. The \nschools can conduct a fair and reasonable proceeding that allows them \nto ensure the safety of their school grounds.\n  The bottom line is that the Gun Free Schools Act has helped reduce \nthe threat of guns from our Nation's schools. With the Safer Schools \nAct of 1997, we give school officials and teachers much needed \nflexibility to ensure that America's schools are safe havens so that \nchildren can escape the violence that engulfs so many of their lives.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/08/senate-section/article/S7021-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7021-S7022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO NEW HAMPSHIRE'S 368TH ENGINEER BATTALION ON THEIR 50TH \n                              ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to New Hampshire's 368th Engineer Battalion as they celebrate \ntheir 50th anniversary at a gala celebration in Manchester on July \n19th.\n  Mr. President, I wish to honor the nearly 1,000 men and women of New \nHampshire's 368th Engineer Battalion who are known as much for their \nefforts in international peace building campaigns as their wartime \nreadiness. They have earned an enviable reputation from their community \naction projects that include building roads, bridges, schools, \nhospitals to disaster relief projects.\n  The 368th Engineer Battalion was formed in 1947 from engineer and \nheavy maintenance units. The battalion has been headquartered in \nConcord and Manchester and they have also had units in Laconia, \nRochester, Gilford, West Lebanon, NH, as well as White River Junction, \nVT, and Attleboro and Danvers, MA.\n  The 368th Battalion has made a substantial contribution to the \nquality of life for residents of the Granite State. The Engineer \nBattalion has developed disaster relief models for such disasters as \nthe recent Alton, NH dam breach where the unit played a critical role \nin clearing flood debris, stabilizing erosion and restoring local \ntransportation facilities for the residents of the small\n\n[[Page S7022]]\n\nLakes Region community, which I and the citizens of Alton are very \nthankful for their exceptional work in that time of crisis. Helping \nothers is the cornerstone of the 368th Engineer Battalion, making the \nGranite State a safer place to live and raise a family.\n  The 368th has seen their share of service on foreign soils in their \n50-year history, where they have lived and cooperated with the civilian \ncommunity including the countries of Italy, Germany, Honduras, \nGuatemala, Korea, and Kenya. They have continued their community action \nprojects in building clinics, roads, and sanitation facilities which \nhave had long term impact on the quality of civilian life and health \nfor the people of the world.\n  The decision by the U.S. Government to invest $17 million to create a \nnew joint service reserve center at Manchester Airport is a testament \nto the professionalism and commitment to excellence embodied in the \n368th. The facility will enable the 368th to continue serving our \nNation with distinction well into the next century.\n  I commend New Hampshire's 368th Engineer Battalion for their \ndedication to the community which is the embodiment of the American \nideal. People like the members of the 368th are the backbone of their \ncommunities and our Nation. I am proud to represent them in the U.S. \nSenate. Happy 50th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/08/senate-section/article/S7021-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO NEW JERSEY WORLD WAR II HEROES\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge the \ncourage and sacrifice of 2d Lt. George A. Ward, of Hoboken, and S. Sgt. \nWilliam Drager, of Hackettstown, NJ. Lieutenant Ward was the bombadier \nand Sergeant Drager the gunner on a B-24J airplane during World War II \nflying missions out of a base near Liuzhou, China.\n  On August 31, 1944, Lieutenant Ward, Sergeant Drager and eight other \ncrewmen off for what would be their second and final mission. The \nbomber successfully attacked Japanese ships and dropped mines near \nTaiwan before heading back to base. However, the plane was diverted \nbecause their base was under attack, and bad weather at the alternate \nlanding site resulted in orders to circle while awaiting clearance to \nland.\n  They never made it. Their B-24 crashed into a cliff 6,000 feet up the \nside of Maoer Mountain, southern China's highest peak, where dense \nbamboo and grotto-like slashes in the granite face swallowed the \nwreckage and the bodies of all 10 crewmen.\n  The crash site lay undisturbed for 52 years until two Chinese farmers \nhunting for wild herbs found it last October. The discovery finally \nsolved the mystery of what happened to the crew, and brought both some \ncomfort and renewed heartache to the families of the airmen.\n  As we approach the 221st anniversary of our Nation's independence, it \nis appropriate that we remember the bravery and commitment of \nindividuals like Lieutenant Ward and Sergeant Drager. We continue to \nenjoy the freedoms that we have cherished since the founding of the \nRepublic because of the sacrifice of millions of courageous men and \nwomen who heeded the call to duty when our Nation needed them.\n  America is profoundly thankful for the patriotism of these men, and \nfor this reason I stand today to recognize them for their \naccomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/08/senate-section/article/S7022-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. RUTH WRIGHT HAYRE\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Dr. Ruth \nWright Hayre upon her retirement as president of the Philadelphia \nSchool District's Board of Education.\n  Dr. Hayre is a remarkable woman whose successful career was built on \nthe strong work ethic she developed early in life. At the age of 15, \nDr. Hayre graduated with honors from West Philadelphia High School. \nAfter winning the mayor's scholarship to the University of \nPennsylvania, she earned both her undergraduate and graduate degrees.\n  Once Ruth completed her studies, she began a distinguished career in \nthe field of education. Dr. Hayre's teaching career began at Arkansas \nState College, but eventually, Ruth returned to Philadelphia to teach \nEnglish at Sulzberger Junior High School. At William Penn High School, \nshe was promoted from teacher to vice principal and then to principal. \nDr. Hayre's achievements are even more impressive considering that she \nwas the very first African-American teacher in the Philadelphia school \nsystem, the first African-American high school teacher, and the first \nAfrican-American principal of a Philadelphia senior high school. Still, \nthis was only the beginning. Ruth rose to the position of \nsuperintendent of district four. Once again, her list of firsts grew, \nsince she was the first African-American superintendent of a \nPhiladelphia public school. On December 2, 1985, she received an \nappointment to the Philadelphia Board of Education. Five years later, \nDr. Hayre was unanimously elected president of the board--becoming the \nfirst female to hold this position. In 1991, she was reelected as \npresident of the board. Moreover, she has taught a course in urban \neducation and administration at the University of Pennsylvania. After \nyears of dedication to the children of Philadelphia, she is retiring \nthis year.\n  In addition to her commitment to education, Ruth has served her \ncommunity in numerous other ways. She has served on the boards of many \nprestigious organizations including Blue Cross, the Philadelphia \nCouncil of Boy Scouts, the Afro-American Historical and Cultural \nMuseum, the Educational Alumni of the University of Pennsylvania, and \nmost currently, the Dr. Ruth W. Hayre Scholarship Fund. Dr. Hayre is \nalso actively involved in religious, civic, and community service \norganizations such as the Northeasterners, the Coalition of 100 Black \nWomen, and the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority.\n  Dr. Hayre has received numerous awards and commendations for her \ncontributions to the field of education. For instance, the Governor of \nPennsylvania honored her as a Distinguished Daughter of Pennsylvania \nfor establishing the Wings to Excellence Program at William Penn High \nSchool. Likewise, she received the Philadelphia Award for her efforts \nto provide quality education for all. The University of Pennsylvania \nand Temple University have each granted her honorary doctoral degrees. \nSimilarly, she received national recognition for establishing a fund at \nTemple University to provide college tuition for 119 graduates of the \nsixth grade classes of the Kenderton and Wright Schools who complete \nhigh school and are admitted to an accredited college. All of her \nachievements notwithstanding, Dr. Hayre once remarked that her greatest \naccomplishment was, ``Being a wife, a mother, and a grandmother.''\n  Mr. President, Dr. Hayre is truly a great American. She has dedicated \nher life to one of the single most important vocations--educating young \npeople. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Dr. Ruth W. Hayre \nfor her life-long accomplishments and in extending the Senate's best \nwishes for continued happiness as she retires.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/08/senate-section/article/S7022-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7022-S7023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REV. ROSCOE C. WILSON\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \none of South Carolina's finest citizens, Rev. Roscoe C. Wilson, pastor \nof Saint John Baptist Church in Columbia. For the past 50 years, \nReverend Wilson has presided over the same church and during this time, \nthe congregation has increased from 150 to over 800 members.\n  Roscoe Wilson began his career of public service very early. In 1942, \nafter graduation from high school, he joined the U.S. Army where he \nserved for the next 4\\1/2\\ years. Upon his discharge in 1946, young \nRoscoe moved to Columbia, SC, and entered Benedict College where he \nearned his bachelor of arts and bachelor of divinity degrees. It was \nthere that he met his future wife, the late Ethel Celeste Williams.\n  In 1948, at an unusually tender age, Roscoe Wilson was appointed \npastor of Saint John Baptist Church. Together Roscoe and Ethel Wilson \nbuilt a strong parish and became part of the tightly knit Benedict \nCollege community. Ethel Wilson worked at the college and was fondly \nnamed ``Ma'' by the students. The Wilsons often provided housing for \nout-of-town students who were unable to afford a room on campus. \nReverend Wilson still refers to them as his foster children. The \nWilsons raised two of their own, Roscoe,\n\n[[Page S7023]]\n\nJr., and Preston. Roscoe, Jr., director of the Midlands Marine \nInstitute, a foundation for troubled youth, is married to the former \nEva Rakes, and has two children, Renaldo and Asia. Preston is a well-\nknown carpenter in the Columbia area, most noted for his woodwork.\n  Social activism has appropriately been the hallmark of Reverend \nWilson's pastoral career. During the early civil rights movement, he \nworked to peacefully integrate public health facilities such as the \nCrafts-Farrow Mental Hospital and the Bryan S. Dorn Veterans Hospital. \nSaint John Baptist Church, which has a large outreach ministry, runs a \nprogressive preschool serving approximately 100 children between the \nages of 3 and 5 years old. This preschool program has been an enormous \nsuccess. Its pupils begin first grade with strong skills and high \nconfidence.\n  In the little free time he has, Reverend Wilson enjoys the outdoors. \nHe loves to hunt and fish and occasionally returns to Texas to visit \nfamily. It is at home in Columbia, though, where he indulges his true \npassion, gardening. He says that tending his roses helps him to focus \non the important things. It is this care and focus which has made him \nsuch a successful pastor. He tends his congregation like his rose bed. \nSaint John Baptist Church will dearly miss Reverend Wilson though his \nwork with the church and the community will undoubtedly continue. All \nof us in South Carolina are very grateful for this Texas transplant. We \nwish him the very best in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/08/senate-section/article/S7022-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RURAL CREDIT NEEDS\n\n Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I address today an issue of \nsignificant importance to my home State of Utah. As you know, the State \nof Utah is largely rural. Of 29 counties in the State of Utah, 25 are \nclassified as rural by the U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA]. For \nthis reason, I have a keen interest in rural issues in general and, as \na member of the banking committee, rural credit issues in particular.\n  I have read with interest the recent reports from the Rural Policy \nResearch Institute [RUPRI], the General Accounting Office [GAO], and \nthe USDA on rural credit needs. I have also reviewed the proceedings of \nthe Kansas City Fed's conference on ``Financing Rural America.'' These \ndocuments present no surprises for those of us who represent rural \nareas. While each study approaches its task in a unique manner, all of \nthese reports are similar in their conclusions. They note that while \nrural financial markets work reasonably well, not all market segments \nare equally well served. They all agree that small businesses from \nrural areas can have a difficult time obtaining financing, have fewer \ncredit options, and may well pay more for their credit than comparable \nurban enterprises. At a time when small businesses are being recognized \nfor their valuable contributions to our economic growth and stability, \nsmall businesses are facing increasing demands for credit, and Small \nBusiness Administration funding is frequently being challenged.\n  Historically, rural economic activity has been synonymous with \nagricultural production. Today, this is no longer the case. The number \nof farms in the United States has declined dramatically from about 6 \nmillion in the first half of this century, to about 2 million farms in \n1990. While agriculture is still an important component of rural \nAmerica and its credit needs are reasonably well addressed; the \nfinancial needs of rural nonagricultural business require attention now \nmore than ever.\n  While government sponsored enterprises [GSE's] have contributed to \nthe successes of agriculture and rural housing by providing competitive \nand reliable credit, there has been no GSE financing for rural \nnonagricultural businesses. As all of these reports point out, credit \noptions for nonagricultural business are relatively scarce, expensive, \nand sometimes nonexistent. Yet, as the GAO and the Fed reports point \nout, economic development in these areas is actually hindered by these \nborrowers' difficulties in obtaining capital.\n  The facts are worrisome. As the RUPRI study points out, many rural \nareas were bypassed by recent employment growth. Existing rural \nemployment is concentrated in slow-growth or declining industries. Job \ngrowth in rural areas, particularly rural areas that are not adjacent \nto metropolitan areas, is biased toward low-skill, low-wage activities. \nUSDA has stated that ``Rural economies are characterized by a \npreponderance of small businesses, fewer and smaller local sources of \nfinancial capital, less diversification of business and industry, and \nfewer ties to non-local economic activity.''\n  Rural nonagricultural businessmen seek to be contributing members of \nour economic society. They do not seek a Federal hand out. They look \nfor equal credit opportunities and an opportunity to participate fully \nin the same business activities of their urban counterparts.\n  As a political body, we need to consider the plight of rural \nnonagricultural businesses and the great potential that they offer our \neconomy. I bring this issue to the attention of my colleagues in the \nhope we can work together and review constructive solutions to this \nprogram.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/08/senate-section/article/S7023-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 GUYANA\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize \nGuyana as it celebrates the thirty-first anniversary of its \nindependence. The Guyanese American community has a great deal of \nhistory to celebrate, and I wish to recognize the changes and \nadvancements that have been made in Guyana in the past 31 years.\n  For 32 years, the country of Guyana has worked to improve its \nstanding within the international community and establish itself as a \nwell-respected democracy. I am sure you will agree that Guyana has \nsucceeded in these two goals. Participation in both the United Nations \nand the Caribbean Free Trade Area have meant better relations with the \nrest of the world. In addition, the smooth transition of power between \nPresident Hoyte and President Jagan in 1992 signify the end of \npolitical oppression in Guyana.\n  I have been pleased with the United States' decision to reinstate the \neconomic assistance to Guyana it had suspended in 1982 because it \nrepresents our willingness to take an active interest in Guyana. I hope \nthat this partnership between Guyana and the United States will \ncontinue to flourish as Guyana capitalizes on the progress that \nindependence has encouraged. Privatization, growth and decreased \ninflation are only a few of the ways in which the quality of life in \nGuyana has improved. These reforms can and must continue.\n  The Guyanese have made tremendous achievements so far. With the \ncontinued commitment of its population, ongoing growth can be a \nreality. I look forward to 32 more years of positive news from this \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/08/senate-section/article/S7023-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM F.

Mr. President, as Americans across the United \nStates celebrated Independence Day this past weekend, many enjoyed the \nsummer\n\n[[Page S7024]]\n\ndelight of a red, juicy watermelon. I rise today to recognize \nwatermelon farmers, the people who make this Fourth of July tradition \npossible.\n  All day yesterday and today, my staff, along with the staffs of \nRepresentative John Spratt and Representative Jim Clyburn, will be \ndelivering South Carolina watermelons to offices throughout the Senate \nand House of Representatives. Thanks to South Carolina watermelon \nfarmers such as Jim Williams of Lodge in Colleton County, those of us \nhere in Washington will be able to cool off from the summer heat with a \ndelicious South Carolina watermelon.\n  This year, farmers across South Carolina planted more than 11,000 \nacres of watermelons. These are some of the finest watermelons produced \nanywhere in the United States. Watermelons of all varieties--Jubilees, \nSangrias, Allsweets, Star Brites, Crimson Sweets, red seedless, yellow \nseedlesss, and other hybrids are produced in South Carolina and \nmarketed across the Nation.\n  Through the end of this month, farmers in Allendale, Bamberg, \nBarnwell, Colleton, Hampton, and other southern South Carolina counties \nwill harvest hundreds of thousands of watermelons. In the Pee Dee areas \naround Chesterfield, Darlington, and Florence counties, the harvest \nwill continue until about August 20.\n  Mr. President, as we savor the taste of these watermelons, we should \nremember the work and labor that goes into producing such a delicious \nfruit. While Americans enjoyed watermelons at the beach and at backyard \nbarbecues all over the Nation this past weekend, most did not stop to \nconsider where they came from. Farmers will be laboring all summer in \nthe heat and humidity to bring us what we call Mother Nature's perfect \ncandy. These remarkable watermelons are sweet, succulent and, most \nimportantly, nutritious and fat free. The truth is, Mr. President, that \nour farmers are too often the forgotten workers in our country. Through \ntheir dedication and commitment, our Nation is able to enjoy a \nwonderful selection of fresh fruit, vegetables and other foods. In \nfact, our agricultural system is the envy of the world.\n  South Carolina farmers lead the way in the production of watermelons. \nFor example, my State was a leader in the development of black plastic \nand irrigation to expand the watermelon growing season. By covering the \nearth in the spring with black plastic, farmers are able to speed up \nthe melons' growth by raising soil temperatures. In addition, the \nplastic allows farmers to shut out much of the visible light, which \ninhibits weed growth. In addition, I am pleased to note that the \nscientists at the USDA Vegetable Laboratory in my hometown of \nCharleston continue to strive to find even more efficient and effective \nways to produce one of our State's most popular fruits.\n  Therefore, as Congressmen and their staffs feast on watermelons this \nweek, I hope they all will remember the folks in South Carolina who \nmade this endeavor possible: Jim Williams of Williams Farms in Lodge; \nLes Tindal, our State agriculture commissioner; Martin Eubanks and \nMinta Wade of the South Carolina Department of Agriculture; Randy \nCockrell and the members of the South Carolina Watermelon Association; \nand finally, Bennie Hughes and the South Carolina Watermelon Board in \nColumbia. They all have worked extremely hard to ensure that \nCongressmen can get a taste of South Carolina.\n  So, I hope everyone in our Nation's Capital will be smiling as they \nenjoy the pleasure of a South Carolina watermelon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/08/senate-section/article/S7023-4", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7024-S7025]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              NATO ENLARGEMENT AT THE SUMMIT OF THE EIGHT\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to call to my \ncolleagues' attention a column by Jim Hoagland of the Washington Post \nthat was published in today's edition on page A19. This column is \nentitled ``'Diktat' From Washington,'' and discusses what happened \nafter the announcement that the United States would support only the \nadmission of Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary into NATO.\n  As Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, \nbetter known as the Helsinki Commission, I held a series of hearings on \nhuman rights and NATO enlargement, and last week released a Commission \nreport assessing the readiness of candidate states to join the \nAlliance, based upon our evaluation of their human rights compliance. \nIn the course of these hearings, I expressed my support for the \ninclusion of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland, Hungary, the Czech \nRepublic, Slovenia, and Romania in the first round of NATO expansion.\n  Now, Mr. Hoagland has recounted how the U.S. policy choice was \nconveyed to our allies and how they received it, both before and at the \nSummit of the Eight, just concluded in Denver. I commend this account \nto my colleagues and suggest that they consider what Hoagland calls the \ncreation of at least a temporary line dividing nations that suffered \nequally under Soviet rule, and its probable consequences in central and \neastern Europe.\n  While I do not believe that equality of suffering is the standard by \nwhich candidate NATO members should be judged, I am afraid that \nomitting Slovenia, Romania, and the Baltic states could cause future \nproblems that could be avoided if we admitted them now. I will have \nmore to say on this subject as we approach the Madrid Summit.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the aforementioned Jim Hoagland column be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The column follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, June 25, 1997]\n\n                         Diktat From Washington\n\n                           (By Jim Hoagland)\n\n       NEW YORK--The devil that always lurks in the details of \n     cosmic feats of diplomacy has suddenly emerged to jab \n     President Clinton's plans for NATO expansion with several \n     sharp pitchforks.\n       The pitchforks will not derail the administration's rush \n     for expansion of the Atlantic alliance. But they could \n     tarnish an event Clinton had confidently expected to be a \n     crown jewel in his presidential legacy--the NATO summit in \n     Madrid two weeks away.\n       That meeting now will be approached without great \n     enthusiasm by many of America's European allies, who are \n     disturbed by what some see as an American attempt to \n     ``dictate'' to them who will be admitted as new members of \n     the alliance.\n       France and a half-dozen other countries will continue to \n     press at the Madrid summit to add Romania and Slovenia to the \n     list of approved candidates, French President Jacques Chirac \n     told Clinton in Denver last weekend during the Summit of \n     the Eight, according to a senior French official aware of \n     the contents of the conversation.\n       The French do not expect to shake America's insistence that \n     only the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland will be issued \n     invitations at Madrid on July 7. All 16 members accept those \n     three candidates; nine of the 16 favor expanding expansion to \n     five.\n       But Chirac's remarks represent a rebuff for an American \n     attempt to shut off debate on the numbers game. Deputy \n     Secretary of State Strobe Talbott convoked the ambassadors \n     from NATO states on June 12 and delivered what diplomats from \n     three of America's closest allies described to me later as a \n     ``Diktat'' that stunned them. The normally elegantly mannered \n     Talbott's demand for silence would have done justice to Ring \n     Lardner's great line: ``Shut up,'' he explained.''\n       The tone between Clinton and Chirac in Denver was far more \n     cordial, but their failure to agree was clear: ``Each one \n     spoke as if disappointed that he had not been able to \n     convince the other of a very good argument,'' a French \n     official said.\n       The Clintonites feel they minimize the initial problems of \n     expansion by sticking to three clearly qualified candidates. \n     Chirac argues that rejection of Romania is unfair, immoral \n     and certain to further destabilize NATO's troubled southern \n     flank.\n       The bilateral French-U.S. meeting at the economic summit \n     also failed, as expected, to resolve differences between \n     Paris and Washington on internal NATO command arrangements. \n     This means that the original U.S. hope that France would \n     formally rejoin NATO's military command at the Madrid \n     gathering and make it an even more glittering celebration has \n     to be abandoned.\n       A third maximum U.S. goal got hooked by gremlins at Denver \n     when President Boris Yeltsin made it clear that Russia would \n     not treat the Madrid summit as a high-level celebration of \n     unity and harmony.\n       Yeltsin curtly rejected a suggestion that he attend the \n     gathering, saying pointedly that he would send his ambassador \n     in Madrid instead. Later he was inveigled to upgrade Russia's \n     representation to a deputy prime minister.\n       Chirac, who worked hard to persuade Washington not to back \n     Yeltsin into a corner on NATO expansion, finds Yeltsin much \n     more at ease now that NATO and Moscow have signed an \n     agreement establishing a NATO-Russia Council. Russian \n     participation in the Denver summit provided Yeltsin with good \n     arguments to use to explain NATO expansion to the Russian \n     public, Chirac believes.\n\n[[Page S7025]]\n\n       Yeltsin, Chirac and other Europeans seem to fear that the \n     Clintonites will attempt to turn Madrid into an event that \n     combines holding a beauty contest for potential members and a \n     crowning of the American president as king of NATO.\n       The Czechs, Poles and Hungarians could hardly be blamed for \n     using Madrid and its invitation to NATO as a seal of approval \n     by the world's most important capitalist powers. They will \n     advertise their NATO-approved stability to potential \n     investors considering putting money into investment-hungry \n     Central and Eastern Europe, widening the gap between them and \n     Romania, Bulgaria, et al.\n       That situation draws at least a temporary line dividing \n     nations that suffered equally under Soviet rule. But the \n     administration is unwilling to discuss publicly and frankly \n     the consequences of that line-drawing. Nor does it squarely \n     address the existential questions that its vague promises of \n     future NATO expansion raise for the Baltics, Ukraine and \n     other former Soviet republics want into the organization.\n       Those questions will be forced on the administration in the \n     U.S. Senate when it comes time to amend the alliance treaty \n     and discuss U.S. responsibilities in Europe. Madrid, with all \n     its devilish but surmountable details, is the beginning of a \n     grand debate, not the end.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/08/senate-section/article/S7024-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7025-S7027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     ECONOMISTS ENDORSE RAISING TOBACCO TAXES TO CURB YOUTH SMOKING\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as Congress considers an increase \nin the Federal cigarette tax in the budget reconciliation bill, I urge \nmy coleagues to read an excellent article by economists Michael \nGrossman and Frank J. Chaloupka, both of whom have written extensively \non the impact of tobacco taxes on teenage smoking.\n  The article is entitled ``Cigarette Taxes: The Straw to Break the \nCamel's Back,'' and is published in the July/August 1997 edition of \nPublic Health Reports. It finds that raising tobacco taxes would be a \npowerful weapon against youth smoking, since children have less income \nto spend on cigarettes than adults. According to Grossman and \nChaloupka, the 43 cents per pack cigarette tax increase in the \nlegislation that Senator Hatch and I introduced earlier this year would \nreduce teenage smoking by 16 percent, saving the lives of over 830,000 \nchildren. In addition, the proceeds from the tobacco tax increase would \nbe used to provide health insurance for millions of American children \nwho are uninsured today.\n  It's time for Congress to say ``no'' to Joe Camel, the Marlboro Man, \nand the tobacco lobby, and say ``yes'' to the Nation's children. I ask \nthat the Public Health Reports article be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n           [From the Public Health Reports, July/August 1997]\n\n          Cigarette Taxes: The Straw to Break the Camel's Back\n\n       (By Michael Grossman, Ph.D. and Frank J. Chaloupka, Ph.D.)\n\n\n                                synopsis\n\n       Teenage cigarette smoking is sensitive to the price of \n     cigarettes. The most recent research suggests that a 10% \n     increase in price would reduce the number of teenagers who \n     smoke by 7%. If the proposed 43-cent hike in the Federal \n     excise tax rate on cigarettes contained in the Hatch-Kennedy \n     Bill were enacted, the number of teenage smokers would fall \n     by approximately 16%. This translates into more than 2.6 \n     million fewer smokers and more than 850,000 fewer smoking \n     related premature deaths in the current cohort of 0 to 17-\n     year-olds. Adjusted for inflation, the current 24-cent-a-pack \n     tax costs the buyer about half of the original cigarette tax \n     of 8 cents imposed in 1951. A substantial tax hike would curb \n     youth smoking; this strategy should move to the forefront of \n     the antismoking campaign.\n       These are not good times for the U.S. cigarette industry. \n     For decades, policy makers and consumer activists have \n     unsuccessfully attempted to rein in the tobacco industry. \n     Now, new legal strategies are bearing fruit, more stringent \n     regulations regarding the marketing and sales of cigarettes \n     are being implemented, and a bill to significantly increase \n     cigarette taxes has been put before the Senate. A large \n     cigarette tax complements the gains made on other fronts by \n     making cigarettes less desirable to teenagers, the next \n     generation of addicts.\n       Numerous studies have shown that roughly 90% of smokers \n     begin the habit as teenagers. Each day, approximately 6000 \n     youths try a cigarette for the first time, and about half of \n     them become daily smokers. Among people who have ever smoked \n     daily, 82% began smoking before age 18. Thus, cigarette \n     control policies that discourage smoking by teenagers may be \n     the most effective way of achieving long-run reductions in \n     smoking in all segments of the population.\n       The upward trend in teenage smoking in the 1990s is \n     alarming to public health advocates. Between 1993 and 1996 \n     the number of high school seniors who smoke grew by 14%. At \n     the same time the number of tenth grade smokers rose by 23%, \n     and the number of eighth grade smokers rose by 26%.\n       The FDA regulations approach the problem of youth smoking \n     by curtailing access to cigarettes and attempting to reduce \n     the appeal of cigarettes by putting limits on cigarette \n     advertising. Increased taxation, which results in higher \n     prices, is another means to accomplish the goal of \n     discouraging young people from smoking. Unfortunately, \n     increases in the Federal excise tax rate on cigarettes have \n     not been motivated by a desire to curtail smoking. The \n     purpose of each of the three tax increases since 1951 was to \n     raise tax revenue or reduce the Federal deficit rather than \n     to discourage smoking. The tax was fixed at 8 cents per pack \n     between November 1, 1951, and the end of 1982. It rose to 16 \n     cents per pack effective January 1, 1983, as part of the Tax \n     Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982. The tax was \n     increased further to 20 cents per pack effective January \n     1, 1991, and to 24-cents per pack effective January 1, \n     1992, part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of \n     1990. But if the tax had simply been adjusted for \n     inflation each year since 1951, it would be 47 cents per \n     pack today: therefore, in effect today tax is much lower \n     than the 1951.\n       A 43-cent tax hike is proposed in a bill introduced by \n     Senators Orrin G. Hatch and Edward M. Kennedy in this \n     Congress. As with past tax increases, the primary focus is \n     not to discourage teenage smoking. The goal of the tax \n     increase in the Hatch-Kennedy Bill is to finance health \n     insurance for low-income children who are currently \n     uninsured. Two-thirds of the estimated annual $6 billion \n     increase in tax revenue would be allocated for grants to the \n     states to provide health insurance for children below the age \n     of 15 whose low-income working parents do not qualify for \n     Medicaid. The remaining one-third would be applied to \n     reducing the Federal deficit.\n       The industry has known and public health advocates have \n     come to realize, however, that an increase in the cigarette \n     tax can influence the behavior of smokers. The American \n     Cancer Society, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and other \n     members of the antismoking lobby are supporting a proposal to \n     raise state cigarette tax rates to a uniform 32 per pack \n     nationwide in the next few years, from the current range of \n     2.5 cents in Virginia to 92.5 cents in Washington State. \n     According to John D. Giglio, manager of tobacco control \n     advocacy for the American Cancer Society: Raising tobacco \n     taxes is our number one strategy to damage the tobacco \n     industry. The . . . industry has found ways around everything \n     else we have done, but they can't repeal the laws of \n     economics.\n       The cigarette industry's recognition of the potency of \n     excise tax hikes as a tool to discourage teenage smoking is \n     reflected in a September 1991 Philip Morris internal \n     memorandum written by Myron Johnson, a company economist, to \n     his boss, Harry G. Daniel, manager of research on smoking by \n     teenagers. The memo was written in reaction to a Natural \n     Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) report authored by Michael \n     Grossman, Eugene M. Lewit, and Douglas Coate, which was later \n     published in the Journal of Law and Economics. In the memo \n     Johnson wrote: ``Because of the quality of the work, the \n     prestige (and objectivity) of the NBER, and the fact that the \n     excise tax on cigarettes has not changed in nearly 30 years \n     we need to take seriously their statement that . . . if \n     future reductions in youth smoking are desired, an increase \n     in the Federal excise tax is a potent policy to accomplish \n     this goal. (Grossman et al.) calculate that . . . a 10% \n     increase in the price of cigarettes would lead to a decline \n     of 12% in the number of teenagers who would otherwise smoke.\n\n\n                             why taxes work\n\n       There are strong logical reasons for expecting teenagers to \n     be more responsive to the price of cigarettes than adults. \n     First, the proportion of disposable income that a youthful \n     smoker spends on cigarettes is likely to exceed the \n     corresponding proportion of an adult smoker's income. Second, \n     peer pressure effects are much more important in the case of \n     youth smoking than in the case of adult smoking. \n     Interestingly, peer pressure has a positive multiplying \n     effect when applied to teenage smokers: a rise in price \n     curtails youth consumption directly and then again indirectly \n     through its impact on peer consumption (if fewer teenagers \n     are smoking, fewer other teenagers will want to emulate \n     them). Third, young people have a greater tendency than \n     adults to discount the future.\n       The ``full'' price to an individual of a harmful smoking \n     addiction is the price of cigarettes plus the monetary and \n     emotional costs to the individual of future adverse health \n     effects. The importance and value placed on these future \n     health effects varies among individuals and especially with \n     age. Becker, Grossman, and Murphy have shown that young \n     people are more responsive to the price of cigarettes than \n     adults because they give little weight to the future, while \n     adults are more sensitive to perceived or known future \n     consequences. Young people may underestimate the health \n     hazards of and the likelihood that initiation of this \n     behavior leads to long-term dependency. And, even when fully \n     informed, teenagers have a tendency to give a great deal of \n     weight to present satisfaction and very little weight to the \n     future consequences of their actions.\n       Becker and Mulligan argue that children become more future \n     oriented as the result of\n\n[[Page S7026]]\n\n     an investment process. Many of the activities of parents and \n     schools can be understood as attempts to make children care \n     more about the future. Some parents and schools succeed in \n     these efforts; but others do not. These failures are \n     particularly troublesome because of the two-way causality \n     between addiction and lack of a future orientation. People \n     who discount the future more heavily are more likely to \n     become addicted to nicotine and other substances. And the \n     advance health consequences of these substances make a future \n     orientation even less appealing.\n       Consumers are not unaware of the dangers of smoking. A \n     survey of Viscusi suggests that both smokers and nonsmokers \n     overestimate, not underestimate, the possibility of death and \n     illness from lung cancer due to tobacco. Teenagers, who have \n     less information than adults, actually attach much higher \n     risks to smoking than the rest of the population. Other risks \n     of cigarette smoking, including the risk of becoming \n     addicted, may, however, be underestimated.\n       Cigarette smokers harm others (external costs) in addition \n     to harming themselves (internal costs). The ignored internal \n     costs of smoking can interact with the external costs. A \n     striking example is smoking by pregnant teenage women, who \n     may engage in this behavior because they heavily discount the \n     future consequences of their current actions. Pregnant women \n     who smoke impose large external costs on their fetuses. \n     Numerous studies show that these women are more likely to \n     miscarry and to give birth to low birth weight infants. Some \n     of these infants die within the first month of life. More \n     require extensive neonatal intensive care and suffer long-\n     term impairments to physical and intellectual development.\n       The conventional wisdom argues that people who are addicted \n     to nicotine are less sensitive to price than others. \n     Therefore, adults should be less responsive to price than \n     young people because adult smokers are more likely to be \n     addicted to nicotine and if so, are likely to be more heavily \n     addicted or to have been addicted for longer periods of time. \n     The conventional wisdom that addicted smokers are less \n     sensitive to price has been challenged in a formal economic \n     model of addictive behavior developed by Becker and Murphy, \n     which shows that a price increase can have a cumulative \n     effect over time.\n       Since cigarettes are addictive, current consumption depends \n     on past consumption. A current price increase has no \n     retroactive effect on ``past consumption'' and therefore \n     reduces the amount smoked by an addicted smoker by a very \n     small amount in the short run. But the size of the effect \n     would grow over time because even a small reduction in \n     smoking during the first year after a price increase would \n     also mean a reduction in smoking in all subsequent years. So, \n     for example, 10 years after a price hike, ``past \n     consumption'' would have varied over a 10-year period.\n       Changes in the total number of young people who smoke are \n     due primarily to changes in the number of new smokers \n     (starts). Among adults, changes in the total number of \n     smokers occur primarily because current smokers quit (quits). \n     Clearly, quits are inversely related to past consumption--\n     there are more quitters among those who have smoked the \n     least--while starts are independent of past consumption. \n     Thus, the effect of price on choosing whether to smoke should \n     be larger for young people than for adults.\n\n\n                              the evidence\n\n       Suggestive evidence of the responsiveness of teenage \n     smoking to the price of cigarettes can be found in recent \n     upward trends in smoking. In April 1993, the Philip Morris \n     Companies cut the price of Marlboro cigarettes by 40 cents. \n     Competitors followed suit. Marlboros are popular among \n     teenagers: 60% reported that Marlboro was their brand of \n     choice in 1993, while Marlboro had an overall market share of \n     23.5% in the same year. In 1993, 23.5% of teenagers in the \n     eighth, tenth, and twelfth grades smoked. In 1996, 28.0% of \n     the students in these grades smoked; this represented a 19% \n     increase over a three-year period. Yet during this period, \n     the number of smokers ages 18 years and older remained the \n     same. Some attribute this increase in teenage smoking to a \n     broad range of social forces thought to be associated with \n     increases in other risky behaviors by teenagers, especially \n     the use of marijuana. But we attribute it to a fall in \n     cigarette prices: between 1993 and 1996 the real price of a \n     pack of cigarettes (the cost of a pack of cigarettes in a \n     given year divided by the Consumer Price Index for all goods \n     for that year) fell by 13%.\n       More definitive evidence of the price sensitivity of \n     teenage smoking can be found in two NBER studies that used \n     large nationally representative samples of thousands of young \n     people between the ages of 12 and 17. These studies \n     capitalized both on the substantial variation in cigarette \n     prices across states (primarily because of different state \n     excise tax rates on this good) and on other state-specified \n     factors such as parents' education and labor market status \n     that may affect the decision to smoke and the quantity of \n     cigarettes consumed. The findings of a 1981 study by \n     Grossman, Lewit, and Coate--the subject of the 1981 Philip \n     Morris internal memoradum--were used by the news media \n     throughout the 1980s and early 1990s to project the effects \n     of Federal excise tax hikes. The authors' 1996 study has been \n     cited by Senators Hatch and Kennedy as evidence that a major \n     benefit of the tax increase in their health insurance bill \n     would be to discourage youth smoking.\n       The Grossman et al. 1981 study used data from Cycle III of \n     the U.S. Health Examination Survey, a survey of almost 7000 \n     young people between the ages of 12 and 17 conducted between \n     1966 and 1970 by the National Center for Health Statistics. \n     The authors found that a 10% increase in the price of \n     cigarettes would reduce the total number of youth smokers by \n     12%. Yet teenagers who already smoked proved much less \n     sensitive to price: a 10% increase in price would cause daily \n     consumption to fall by only 2%.\n       In our 1996 study, we used data from the 1992, 1993, and \n     1994 surveys of eighth, tenth, and twelfth grade students \n     conducted by the Institute for Social Research at the \n     University of Michigan as part of the Monitoring the Future \n     Project. Taken together, these three nationally \n     representative samples included approximately 150,000 young \n     people. We found that a 10% increase in price would lower the \n     number of youthful smokers by 7%, a somewhat smaller effect \n     than the 12% projected in the 1981 study. Consumption among \n     smokers, however, would decline by 6%, which is three times \n     larger than the decline projected in the 1981 study.\n       Comparable studies of adults have found smaller effects of \n     a projected 10% price increase. In a 1982 study of people age \n     20 years and older, Lewit and Coate reported that a 10% rise \n     in price would cause the number of adults who smoke to fall \n     by 3% and a decline of 1% in the number of cigarettes smoked \n     per day by those who smoke. In a 1991 study of adult smokers, \n     Wasserman et al. found that a 10% increase in price would \n     cause the number who smoked to fall by 2% and the number of \n     cigarettes smoked per day to fall by 1% while in a 1995 study \n     Evans and Farrelly found declines of 1% in both categories. \n     Based on the most recent estimates, a 10% increase in the \n     price of cigarettes would reduce the number of teenagers who \n     smoke by 7%, while it would reduce the number of adults who \n     smoke by only 1%. Daily consumption of teenage smokers would \n     fall by 6%, while daily consumption of adult smokers would \n     fall by 1%.\n\n\n                    price increases as a policy tool\n\n       The proposed 43-cent cigarette tax hike in the Hatch-\n     Kennedy Bill would, if fully passed on to consumers, raise \n     the price of a pack of cigarettes by approximately 23%. \n     According to our 1996 study, the number of teenage smokers \n     would fall by approximately 16% and the number of cigarettes \n     consumed by teenage smokers would decline by approximately \n     14%. Some of these smokers might compensate for a reduction \n     in the number of cigarettes smoked by switching to higher \n     nicotine and tar brands, inhaling more deeply, or reducing \n     idle burn time. These factors, while representing a public \n     health concern, are not relevant in evaluating the effect of \n     an excise tax hike on whether an individual chooses to smoke \n     at all.\n       Since very few smokers begin smoking after the ages of 20, \n     these relatively large reductions in this total number of \n     teenage smokers imply that excise tax increases are very \n     effective ways to prevent the onset of a habitual behavior \n     with serious future health consequences. A 16% decline in the \n     number of young smokers associated with a 43-cent tax hike \n     translates into over 2.6 million fewer smokers in the current \n     cohort of 0 to 17-year-olds. Using a common estimate that one \n     in three smokers dies prematurely from smoking-related \n     illnesses, we can calculate that over time a real (adjusted \n     for inflation) 43-cent tax increase would reduce smoking-\n     related premature deaths in this cohort by over $50,000. And \n     larger tax increases would result in even bigger reductions \n     in the number of young smokers and the number of premature \n     deaths.\n       A tax hike would continue to discourage smoking for \n     successive generations of young people and would gradually \n     affect the smoking levels of older age groups as the smoking-\n     discouraged cohorts move through the age spectrum. Over a \n     period of several decades, aggregate smoking and its \n     associated detrimental health effects would decline \n     substantially.\n       The effect of a price or tax hike also grows over time \n     because of the addictive nature of smoking; a small reduction \n     in current cigarette consumption by smokers due to a tax hike \n     would decrease consumption in all future years to follow: \n     Becker, Grossman, and Murphy have estimated that each 10% \n     rise in price causes the number of cigarettes consumed by a \n     fixed population (number of smokers multiplied by cigarettes \n     consumed per smoker) to fall by 4% after one year and by as \n     much as 8% after approximately 20 years.\n       Caveats. Several caveats are required in evaluating the \n     benefits of a tax hike. First, for a cigarette tax increase \n     to continue at the same level in real terms, it would have to \n     be indexed to the rate of inflation. The same objective could \n     hypothetically be accomplished by converting to an ad valorem \n     cigarette excise tax system under which the cigarette tax is \n     expressed as a fixed percentage of the manufacturer's price. \n     The latter approach has one limitation: the Congressional \n     Budget Office points out that it might induce manufacturers \n     to lower sales prices to company-controlled wholesalers to \n     avoid part of the tax.\n       Second, Ohsfeldt, Boyle, and Capilouto have reported that \n     the number of males between the ages of 16 and 24 who use \n     smokeless tobacco would rise by approximately 12% if a state \n     excise tax rate on cigarettes\n\n[[Page S7027]]\n\n     rose by 10%. Some would view such an increase with alarm \n     because smokeless tobacco increases the risks of oral cancer \n     and other oral diseases. On the other hand, Rodu argues that \n     these elevated risks are very small and are more than offset \n     by reductions in cigarette-related cancers and heart disease. \n     The substitution of smokeless tobacco for cigarettes could be \n     discouraged by raising the Federal excise tax on smokeless \n     tobacco. But this would raise the cost of a safer nicotine \n     delivery system than cigarettes and could be viewed as an \n     unfair penalty on those who cannot give up their addiction.\n       Third, in strictly financial terms, we would expect a tax \n     hike to yield higher rates of return in the short run than in \n     the long run because of its cumulative effect in reducing \n     smoking. The Becker et al. study implies that a Federal \n     excise tax rate on cigarettes of approximately $1.00 a pack \n     would maximize long-run Federal revenue from the tax at \n     roughly $13.3 billion annually approximately 10 to 20 years \n     after the new rate is in effect--only $7.6 billion more than \n     the revenue from today's 24-cent tax. Clearly, the 67-cent \n     tax in the Hatch-Kennedy Bill, which is expected to yield an \n     additional $6 billion annually for the next few years, will \n     have a much smaller yield in the long run.\n       The gap between long-run and short-run tax yields \n     highlights a danger of justifying a cigarette tax increase to \n     achieve goals other than reductions in smoking. For a while, \n     public health advocates can have their cake and eat it too. \n     But after a number of years, the large cumulative reduction \n     in smoking would take a big bite out of the tax revenues \n     initially generated by the tax hike. One would hardly like to \n     see the development of a situation in which fiscal needs \n     create pressure on the governments to encourage smoking or at \n     least not discourage it. The extensive advertising campaigns \n     conducted by state-run lotteries are examples of the danger \n     of the government becoming too dependent on revenue from a \n     harmful addiction.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       We would like to see politicians and public health \n     advocates focus discussions of the appropriate Federal \n     cigarette excise tax rate squarely on the issue of reducing \n     smoking. Both external costs and ignored internal costs \n     justify the adoption of government policies that interfere \n     with private decisions regarding the consumption of \n     cigarettes.\n       Taxing cigarettes to reduce smoking by teenagers is a \n     rather blunt instrument because it imposes costs on other \n     smokers. But an excise tax hike is a very effective policy \n     with regard to teenagers because they are so sensitive to \n     price. The current Federal excise tax of 24 cents on a pack \n     of cigarettes is worth about half in real terms of the 8-cent \n     tax in effect in 1951. A substantial real tax hike to curb \n     youth smoking should move to the forefront of the antismoking \n     campaign.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/08/senate-section/article/S7025-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DAVID SUSSMAN\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.
