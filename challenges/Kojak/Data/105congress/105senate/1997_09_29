Mr. President, today the Senate will resume consideration \nof S. 25, the pending campaign finance reform bill.\n  As a reminder to all Senators, no votes will occur during today's \nsession of the Senate. The next vote will occur 11 a.m. on Tuesday, \nSeptember 30, on the motion to invoke cloture on the Coats amendment \nregarding scholarships. That amendment is to the District of Columbia \nappropriations bill, which is the last appropriations bill that we need \nto pass through the Senate for this fiscal year. It is hoped that the \nSenate will be able to complete action on the D.C. appropriations bill \non Tuesday, although there are still some amendments that are being \nnegotiated that could require more time, maybe even another cloture \nvote. I hope it will be worked out, though. Also during Tuesday's \nsession of the Senate, the Senate will consider the continuing \nresolution. As Members are aware, we have been able to make good \nprogress on the appropriations bills, so it is hoped that the \ncontinuing resolution and the remaining appropriations conference \nreports can be acted upon in a timely manner. We don't know of any \nproblem with the continuing resolution. We think and we hope that it \nwill be a clean CR, with a limited amount of time for debate, although \nwe have not worked out those details yet. I will discuss it with the \nminority leader and we will advise the Members as to how much time \nwould be required there.\n  With those things in mind, Members can anticipate votes throughout \nthe day on Tuesday. With regard to the pending campaign finance reform \nbill, I encourage all Members to come to the floor and participate in \nthis important debate. We will have time throughout this week, even \nthough we will, of course, be affected, regarding how much time we can \nuse toward the end of the week on this debate, by the Jewish religious \nholiday. We still need to work with those that would be needing leave \nto go to their respective States, as to how we will deal with that on \nThursday and Friday. We will work that out.\n  As I announced last week, there will be no votes after 1 p.m. on \nWednesday in observance of the Jewish holiday. However, the Senate will \nremain in session as is necessary in order for Members to fully debate \nS. 25. Still, we will need to talk about exactly how we will do that to \nmake sure we are not inconveniencing any Senator that would need to be \naway for the Jewish holiday who would also like to be involved in that \ndebate. We will work that through as the week goes on.\n  Mr. President, I believe now we are ready for the reporting of S. 25 \nby the clerk and the modification by Senator McCain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/29/senate-section/article/S10103-4", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10103-S10151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 BIPARTISAN CAMPAIGN REFORM ACT OF 1997\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kyl). Under the previous order, the Senate \nwill now resume consideration of S. 25 which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 25) to reform the financing of Federal \n     elections.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to ask the majority leader a \nquestion before I send a modification to the desk. Maybe I can discuss \nthis with him on the floor.\n  It is not clear to me as to what his plans are for the following \nweek. I understand tomorrow is taken up with conference reports and \nother business. As he said, we would go back on Wednesday to debate S. \n25 with the modification. And then would it be his intention to begin \nvotes later this week, or the following week? I know it is a little \nhard to tell, but I wonder if maybe we should have some discussion off \nthe floor on this issue.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield so that I may make \na comment on that, I hope, first, that we will have some time on \nTuesday of this week, before or after, during some of the votes that \nmay be occurring on the continuing resolution, as well as the\n\n[[Page S10104]]\n\nappropriations conference reports. I hope that most of those won't take \na lot of time. We will have some time for debate tomorrow. But until we \nsee exactly what will be available and how much time is needed on the \nCR, we won't know for sure. But we will find that out, hopefully, today \nand we will confer with the leadership on both sides of the aisle, as \nwell as the Senators interested in this bill.\n  I had hoped that we could also have some debate on Wednesday \nafternoon, even though we would not have any votes after 1 o'clock. But \nwe would still have debate up until about 4 o'clock, and then Thursday \nis open. We don't want to, in any way, infringe on the religious \nholiday. So we will need to talk that through. We could have some \ndebate on Thursday and, of course, we can, and I assume will, have some \ndebate Friday. We want to talk that through to make sure everybody is \ncomfortable with that.\n  My hope is that we could continue debate on Monday the 6th and begin \nhaving votes on Tuesday, and the possibility also on Wednesday. But, \nagain, we need to go and get started with debate and see how that is \ngoing to stack up, and we will talk about that. It is a little bit \nbroken up because of the religious holiday, but we want to have full \ntime for debate, and we will start votes after that. That was my \nthinking.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the majority leader. I think that clarifies a \ngreat deal. I also appreciate his sensitivity to those who have to be \nhome at this holiday season. I know my colleague from Wisconsin and \nother Senators who need to be involved in this issue. I want to thank \nthe majority leader for what seems to me to be a generous amount of \ntime for debate and discussion of this issue.\n  Mr. President, in just a few moments, I will lay before the Senate \nthe modified version of the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform \nbill. After I do so, the leader will be recognized to offer an \namendment to the bill. Therefore, I wanted to take a few minutes before \nthat action occurs to speak briefly to the modification.\n  First, I want to thank my cosponsors and allies in this fight. \nSenator Thompson and Senator Collins have played crucial roles as we \nmoved forward on this matter. Their steadfast support, advice, and \nfriendship is greatly appreciated.\n  But more than anybody, I want to thank my friend from the other side \nof the aisle, the Senator from Wisconsin, Russ Feingold. I do not \nbelieve that when he and I first sat down and began a discussion on \nthis matter that we would be where are today--engaged in a historic \nbattle to reform the electoral system of this great Nation. My friend, \nas he is indeed my friend, has been steadfast in his commitment and his \nbelief in this cause and I want to state for the Record that I am \ngrateful he is my ally in this fight.\n  Mr. President, I want to briefly highlight again what the modified \nbill does and does not do. This is not a big government solution. The \nmodified test is just over 50 pages long.\n  The defenders of the status quo are not defending an unbridled, \nunregulated bastion of free speech. The Federal Election Campaign Act, \nknown as FECA, governs Federal elections today.\n  Elections are regulated today. They need to be regulated. We do not \nwant corporations, unions, or wealthy individuals to buy and sell \nelections. This is not a country where a royal class controls the \nGovernment. No one here wants corporations to give directly to \ncampaigns. The fact is that at certain times and certain places, there \nis a role for some regulation and restraint in order to protect the \ngreater public good.\n  Title I of the modified bill seeks to reduce the influence of special \ninterest money in campaigns by banning the use of soft money in Federal \nraces. Soft money would be allowed to be contributed to State parties \nin accordance with State law.\n  We do, however, seek to differentiate between State and Federal \nactivities. Soft money contributed to State parties could be used for \nany and all State candidate activities. Let me repeat that statement. \nSoft money given to the State parties could be used for any State \nelectioneering activities.\n\n  If a State allows soft money to be used in a gubernatorial race, a \nState senate race, or the local sheriff's race, it would still be \nallowed under this bill. However, if a State party seeks to use soft \nmoney to indirectly influence a Federal race, such activity would be \nbanned 120 days prior to the general election. Using such funds to \nfinance voter registration activities would be allowed except during \nthe 120 days prior to the election.\n  Voter registration efforts are very important. I know my colleagues \nrecognize that fact. We want individuals to register and then to vote. \nThis bill recognizes that fact and allows parties to engage in voter \nregistration activities. Additionally, State parties would be allowed, \nwithin limits, to engage in generic party advertising. These activities \nhelp build the party and encourage people to vote.\n  To make up for the loss of soft money, the modified bill doubles the \nlimit that individuals can give to State parties in hard money. \nConsequently, the aggregate contribution limit for hard money that \nindividuals could donate to political races would rise to $30,000.\n  Title II of the modified bill seeks to limit the role of independent \nexpenditures in political campaigns.\n  Mr. President, I think we ought to pay attention to this part of it \nbecause, over the weekend, it seems to be the attack point for various \npundits and those throughout the Nation, most of whom by the way have \nnot seen the bill.\n  The bill in no way bans, curbs, or seeks to control real, \nindependent, noncoordinated expenditures in any manner. Additionally, \nif hard money--money that is recorded and traceable--is used, then \nthere are no restrictions of any kind on advertising.\n  Let me repeat that fact. This bill in no way restricts any message or \nany use of the airwaves. It does however place limits and controls on \nexpenditures if certain kinds of money are used to fund such activity.\n  Any independent expenditure made to advocate any cause, with the \nexception of the express advocacy of a candidate's victory or defeat, \nis fully allowed. To do any thing else would violate the first \namendment.\n  However, the bill does expand the definition of express advocacy. The \ncourts have routinely ruled that the Congress may define express \nadvocacy. In fact, current standards of express advocacy have been \nderived from the Buckley case itself.\n  As we all know, the Supreme Court case of Buckley versus Valeo stated \nthat campaign spending cannot be mandatorily capped. This bill is fully \nconsistent with the Buckley decision. I ask unanimous consent that a \nletter signed by 126 legal scholars expressing support for the \nconstitutionality of this bill be printed in the Record at this time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Brennan Center for Justice,\n\n                                 New York, NY, September 22, 1997.\n     Senator John McCain,\n     Senator Russell Feingold,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators McCain and Feingold: We are academics who \n     have studied and written about the First Amendment to the \n     United States Constitution. We submit this letter to respond \n     to a series of recent public challenges to two components of \n     S. 25, the McCain-Feingold bill. Critics have argued that it \n     is unconstitutional to close the so-called ``soft money \n     loophole'' by placing restrictions on the source and amount \n     of campaign contributions to political parties. Critics have \n     also argued that it is unconstitutional to offer candidates \n     benefits, such as reduced broadcasting rates, in return for \n     their commitment to cap campaign spending. We are deeply \n     committed to the principles underlying the First Amendment \n     and believe strongly in preserving free speech and \n     association in our society, especially in the realm of \n     politics. We are not all of the same mind on how best to \n     address the problems of money and politics; indeed, we do not \n     all agree on the constitutionality of various provisions of \n     the McCain-Feingold bill itself. Nor are we endorsing every \n     aspect of the bill's soft money and voluntary spending limits \n     provisions. We all agree, however, that the current debate on \n     the merits of campaign finance reform is being sidetracked by \n     the argument that the Constitution stands in the way of a ban \n     on unlimited contributions to political parties and a \n     voluntary spending limits scheme based on offering \n     inducements such as reduced media time.\n\n\nI. Limits on Enormous Campaign Contributions to Political Parties from \nCorporations, Labor Unions, and Wealthy Contributors Are Constitutional\n\n       To prevent corruption and the appearance of corruption, \n     federal law imposes limits on\n\n[[Page S10105]]\n\n     the source and amount of money that can be given to \n     candidates and political parties ``in connection with'' \n     federal elections. The money raised under these strictures is \n     commonly referred to as ``hard money.'' Since 1907, federal \n     law has prohibited corporations from making hard money \n     contributions to candidates or political parties. See 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 441b(a) (current codification). In 1947, that ban \n     was extended to prohibit union contributions as well. Id. \n     Individuals, too, are subject to restrictions in their giving \n     of money to influence federal elections. The Federal Election \n     Campaign Act (``FECA'') limits an individual's contributions \n     to (1) $1,000 per election to a federal candidate; (2) \n     $20,000 per year to national political party committees; and \n     (3) $5,000 per year to any other political committee, such as \n     a PAC or a state political party committee. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 441a(a)(1). Individuals are also subject to a $25,000 \n     annual limit on the total of all such contributions. Id. \n     Sec. 441a(a)(3).\n       The soft money loophole was created not by Congress, but by \n     a Federal Election Commission (``FEC'') ruling in 1978 that \n     opened a seemingly modest door to allow non-regulated \n     contributions to political parties, so long as the money was \n     used for grassroots campaign activity, such as registering \n     voters and get-out-the-vote efforts. These unregulated \n     contributions are known as ``soft money'' to distinguish them \n     from the hard money raised under FECA's strict limits. In the \n     years since the FEC's ruling, this modest opening has turned \n     into an enormous loophole that threatens the integrity of the \n     regulatory system. In the last presidential elections, soft \n     money contributions soared to the unprecedented figure of \n     $263 million. It was not merely the total amount of soft \n     money contributions that was unprecedented, but the size of \n     the contributions as well, with donors being asked to give \n     amounts $100,000, $250,000 or more to gain preferred access \n     to federal officials. Moreover, the soft money raised is, for \n     the most part, not being spent to bolster party grassroots \n     organizing. Rather, the funds are often solicited by federal \n     candidates and used for media advertising clearly intended to \n     influence federal elections. In sum, soft money has become an \n     end run around the campaign contribution limits, creating a \n     corrupt system in which monied interests appear to buy access \n     to, and inappropriate influence with, elected officials.\n       The McCain-Feingold bill would ban soft money contributions \n     to national political parties, by requiring that all \n     contributions to national parties be subject to FECA's hard \n     money restrictions. The bill also would bar federal \n     officeholders and candidates for such offices from \n     soliciting, receiving, or spending soft money and would \n     prohibit state and local political parties from spending soft \n     money during a federal election year for any activity that \n     might affect a federal election (with exceptions for \n     specified activities that are less likely to impact on \n     federal elections).\n       We believe that such restrictions are constitutional. The \n     soft money loophole has raised the specter of corruption \n     stemming from large contributions (and those from prohibited \n     sources) that led Congress to enact the federal contribution \n     limits in the first place. In Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme \n     Court held that the government has a compelling interest in \n     combating the appearance and reality of corruption, an \n     interest that justifies restricting large campaign \n     contributions in federal elections. 424 U.S. 1, 23-29 (1976). \n     Significantly, the Court upheld the $25,000 annual limit on \n     an individual's total contributions in connection with \n     federal elections. Id. at 26-29, 38. In later cases, the \n     Court rejected the argument that corporations have a right to \n     use their general treasury funds to influence elections. See, \n     e.g., Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, 494 U.S. 652 \n     (1990). Under Buckley and its progeny, Congress clearly \n     possesses power to close the soft money loophole by \n     restricting the source and size of contributions to political \n     parties, just as it does for contributions to candidates, for \n     use in connection with federal elections.\n       Moreover, Congress has the power to regulate the source of \n     the money used for expenditures by state and local parties \n     during federal election years when such expenditures are used \n     to influence federal elections. The power of Congress to \n     regulate federal elections to prevent fraud and corruption \n     includes the power to regulate conduct which, although \n     directed at state or local elections, also has an impact on \n     federal races. During a federal election year, a state or \n     local political party's voter registration or get-out-the-\n     vote drive will have an effect on federal elections. \n     Accordingly, Congress may require that during a federal \n     election year state and local parties' expenditures for such \n     activities be made from funds raised in compliance with FECA \n     so as not to undermine the limits therein.\n       Any suggestion that the recent Supreme Court decision in \n     Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. FEC, 116 S. \n     Ct. 2309 (1996), casts doubt on the constitutionality of a \n     soft money ban is flatly wrong. Colorado Republican did not \n     address the constitutionality of banning soft money \n     contributions, but rather the expenditures by political \n     parties of hard money, that is, money raised in accordance \n     with FECA's limits. Indeed, the Court noted that it ``could \n     understand how Congress, were it to conclude that the \n     potential for evasion of the individual contribution limits \n     was a serious matter, might decide to change the statute's \n     limitations on contributions to political parties.'' Id. at \n     2316.\n       In fact, the most relevant Supreme Court decision is not \n     Colorado Republican, but Austin v. Michigan Chamber of \n     Commerce, in which the Supreme Court held that corporations \n     can be walled off from the electoral process by forbidding \n     both contributions and independent expenditures from general \n     corporate treasuries. 494 U.S. at 657-61. Surely, the law \n     cannot be that Congress has the power to prevent corporations \n     from giving money directly to a candidate, or from expending \n     money on behalf of a candidate, but lacks the power to \n     prevent them from pouring unlimited funds into a candidate's \n     political party in order to buy preferred access to him after \n     the election.\n       Accordingly, closing the loophole for soft money \n     contributions is in line with the longstanding and \n     constitutional ban on corporate and union contributions in \n     federal elections and with limits on the size of individuals' \n     contributions to amounts that are not corrupting.\n\n\n     ii. efforts to persuade candidates to limit campaign spending \n  voluntarily by providing them with inducements like free television \n                        time are constitutional\n\n       The McCain-Feingold bill would also invite candidates to \n     limit campaign spending in return for free broadcast time and \n     reduced broadcast and mailing rates. In Buckley, the Court \n     explicitly declared that ``Congress . . . may condition \n     acceptance of public funds on an agreement by the candidate \n     to abide by specified expenditure limitations.'' 424 U.S. at \n     56 n.65. The Court explained: ``Just as a candidate may \n     voluntarily limit the size of the contributions he chooses to \n     accept, he may decide to forgo private fundraising and accept \n     public funding.'' Id.\n       That was exactly the Buckley Court's approach when it \n     upheld the constitutionality of the campaign subsidies to \n     Presidential candidates in return for a promise to limit \n     campaign spending. At the time, the subsidy to Presidential \n     nominees was $20 million, in return for which Presidential \n     candidates agreed to cap expenditures at that amount and \n     raise no private funds at all. The subsidy is now worth over \n     $60 million and no Presidential nominee of a major party has \n     ever turned down the subsidy.\n       In effect, the critics argue that virtually any inducement \n     offered to a candidate to persuade her to limit campaign \n     spending is unconstitutional as a form of indirect \n     ``coercion.'' But the Buckley Court clearly distinguished \n     between inducements designed to elicit a voluntary decision \n     to limit spending and coercive mandates that impose \n     involuntary spending ceilings. If giving a Presidential \n     candidate a $60 million subsidy is a constitutional \n     inducement, surely providing free television time and reduced \n     postal rates falls into the same category of acceptable \n     inducement. The lesson from Buckley is that merely because a \n     deal is too good to pass up does not render it \n     unconstitutionally ``coercive.''\n           Respectfully submitted,\n     Ronald Dworkin,\n       Professor of Jurisprudence and Fellow of University College \n     at Oxford University; Frank H. Sommer Professor of Law, New \n     York University School of Law.\n     Burt Neuborne,\n       John Norton Pomeroy Professor of Law, Legal Director, \n     Brennan Center for Justice, New York University School of \n     Law.\n  Mr. McCAIN. What the modified bill seeks to do is establish a so-\ncalled bright line test 60 days out from an election. Any independent \nexpenditures that fall within that 60-day window could not use a \ncandidate's name or his or her likeness. During this 60-day period, ads \ncould run that advocate any number of issues. Pro-life ads, pro-choice \nads, antilabor ads, prowilderness ads, pro-Republican party or \nDemocratic party ads--all could be aired without restriction. However, \nads mentioning candidates themselves could not be aired.\n  This accomplishes much. First, if soft money is banned to the \npolitical parties, such money will inevitably flow to independent \ncampaign organizations. These groups often run ads that the candidates \nthemselves disapprove of. Further, these ads are almost always negative \nattack ads and do little to further beneficial debate and a healthy \npolitical dialog. To be honest, they simply drive up an individual \ncandidate's negative polling numbers and increase public cynicism for \npublic service in general.\n  The modified bill explicitly protects voter guides. I believe this is \na very important point. Some have unfairly criticized the original bill \nbecause they thought it banned or prohibited the publication and \ndistribution of voter guides and voting records. While I disagree with \nthose individual's conclusions, the sponsors of the modified bill \nsought to clarify this matter.\n\n[[Page S10106]]\n\n  Let me state that voter guides are completely protected in the \nmodified bill. Any statements to the contrary are simply not true.\n  Some of my colleagues have voiced concern about the 60-day bright \nline test as being arbitrary. They have noted that different standards \nwould exist prior to 60 days out. They are right. But what is their \npoint. Election law is riddled with deadlines and time frames. When a \ncandidate runs for office, he or she must file papers by a certain \ndate. In order to appear on the ballot, certain deadlines must be met, \ncertain events must occur. What is their point. Would they advocate \nabolishing all time frames and just let elections occur as spontaneous \nevents? I don't think so.\n  I hope that we will not allow our attention to be distracted from the \nreal issues at hand--how to raise the tenor of the debate in our \nelections and give people real choices. No one benefits from negative \nads. They don't aid our Nation's political dialog. Again, if someone \nchooses to run negative ads, this bill will not restrict their right to \ndo so. But we should not just throw up our hands and say, ``Who \ncares?'' We should seek, within the protections of the Constitution, to \nencourage a healthy political debate.\n  I believe that in 1994 it was not better funding and more money that \ngave Republicans victory; it was better and more ideas. If money was \nthe key to Republican victory, why then did it take so long?\n  I am very serious about this point. Some have stated that money helps \nequalize the Republican Party's ability to win elections due to the \nliberal press. If that is true, then why didn't it work? Since 1974, \nwhen we last reformed the campaign finance system, throughout the \n1970's and 1980's and 1990's, Republicans routinely have outraised and \noutspent Democrats. Yet, with the exception of 1980 to 1986 in the \nSenate, we did not control the Congress. I would argue that the 6 years \nin which we controlled the Senate during the 1980's was due to the \nstrength and leadership of Ronald Reagan; not our ability to spend.\n  When we took over the Congress in 1994--and I say this not to agitate \nmy Democrat colleagues--it was not due to money. It was due to our \nsuperior ideas. It was due to the Contract With America. It was due to \na fundamental change in the views of the American electorate. It was \nnot due to a spate of negative campaign advertising.\n  Title III of the modified bill mandates greater disclosure. Our bill \nmandates that all FEC filings documenting campaign receipts and \nexpenditures be made electronically and that they then be made \naccessible to the public on the Internet not later than 24 hours after \nthe information is received by the Federal Election Commission.\n  Additionally, current law allows for campaigns to make a ``best \neffort'' to obtain the name, address, and occupation information of the \ndonors, et cetera. The bill also mandates random audits of campaigns. \nSuch audits would only occur after an affirmative vote of at least four \nof the six members of the FEC. This will prevent the use of audits as a \npurely partisan attack.\n  Title IV seeks to encourage individuals to limit the amount of \npersonal money they spend on their own campaigns. If an individual \nvoluntarily elects to limit the amount of money he or she spends in his \nor her race to $50,000, then the national parties are able to use funds \nknown as ``coordinated expenditures'' to aid such candidates. If \ncandidates refuse to limit their own personal spending, the parties are \nprohibited from contributing coordinated funds to the candidate.\n  This serves to limit the advantage that wealthy candidates enjoy and \nstrengthens the party system by encouraging candidates to work more \nclosely with the parties.\n  Lastly, the bill codifies the Beck decision, which states that \nnonunion employees in a closed-shop union workplace who are required to \ncontribute funds to the union can request and ensure that his or her \nmoney not be used for political purposes.\n  I personally support stronger language. I believe no individual \nshould be forced to contribute to political activities. However, I \nrecognize stronger language would invite a filibuster of this bill and \nwould doom its final passage.\n\n  Mr. President, what I have outlined is a basic summary of our \nmodification to the original bill.\n  I have heard many colleagues say that they could not support S. 25, \nthe original McCain-Feingold bill, for a wide variety of reasons. Some \noppose spending limits. Others oppose free or reduced rate broadcast \ntime. Yet others could not live with postal subsidies to candidates, \nand others complain that nothing was being done about labor.\n  Again, as I stated in the opening debate on Friday, I hope all of my \ncolleagues who made such statements will take a new and openminded look \nat this bill. Gone are spending limits. Gone is free broadcast time. \nGone are reduced rate TV time and postal subsidies. We have sought to \naddress the problem of undue influence being exercised by the labor \nunions. All of the excuses of the past are gone.\n  Mr. President, let me close again by emphasizing that the sponsors of \nthis legislation have but one purpose--to enact a fair, bipartisan \ncampaign reform that seeks no advantage for one party or the other but \nonly seeks to find common ground upon which we can all agree to pass \nthe best, most balanced, and most important reform we have ever had.\n  All we ask of our colleagues is that they approach this debate with \nthe same purpose in mind.\n  To those who accuse the opponents of this bill of being unyielding in \ntheir opposition to any reform, let me recite the words of my friend \nfrom Kentucky from an op-ed piece he wrote for the Washington Post in \n1993. My friend, Senator McConnell from Kentucky, said:\n  ``The truth is that Republicans support a ban on all soft money,'' \nSenator McConnell wrote, ``regardless of whether it benefits \nRepublicans or Democrats.''\n  Let me repeat that.\n  ``The truth is that Republicans support a ban on all soft money,'' \nSenator McConnell wrote, ``regardless of whether it benefits \nRepublicans or Democrats.''\n  The Senator went on to identify himself and the Republican Party with \nthe advocates of reform:\n       Truly campaign finance reform is needed--\n\n  truly campaign finance reform is needed--\n\n     but it should not have to cost the taxpayers, and it does not \n     have to include spending limits. If we are going to pass a \n     meaningful bipartisan campaign finance bill, we must drop the \n     roadblocks to reform: taxpayers financing and spending \n     limits.\n\n  Mr. President, I say to my friend from Kentucky that, as a sign of \nour good faith, the sponsors of this bill have listened to his \nobjections, and we have dropped the provisions which he once criticized \nas roadblocks. Moreover, we share Senator McConnell's view that soft \nmoney must be banned.\n  I would say that we are very close to the proposed reforms that \nSenator McConnell proposed in 1993. We pled with our colleagues not to \nuse the amendment process only to kill the prospects for real reform by \noffering amendments intended to be, as Senator McConnell put it, \n``roadblocks'' to reform.\n  If Senator McConnell is as sincere in proposing reforms as he was a \nfew years ago--which I do not doubt--work with us to resolve our very \nfew remaining differences and help us reach our common goal of genuine \ncampaign finance reform.\n\n\n                         Modification to S. 25\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, I would like to explain what just \ntranspired.\n  Mr. President, Senate procedure can be sometimes confusing. So let me \ntake a moment to go over what are the amendments that were offered and \nwhat is pending.\n  Under the unanimous-consent agreement reached last week, Senator \nMcCain modified his original McCain-Feingold bill. I was then \nrecognized to offer an amendment.\n  The amendment I offered--the Paycheck Protection Act--will not wipe \nout the underlying McCain bill, if it is adopted. On the contrary, if \nadopted, this amendment would become part of the bill.\n  The other amendments I just offered were part of the process which is \ninformally known as ``filling up the amendment tree.'' This is a fairly \nstandard procedure to ensure opponents of an amendment cannot gut it by \noffering yet another amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that five recent examples be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the materials was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       1977--Jimmy Carter's Energy Deregulation Bill--Byrd filled \n     up amendment tree.\n       1984--Grove City--Byrd (in minority) filled up the tree.\n       1985--Budget Resolution--Dole filled up the tree.\n       1988--Campaign Finance--Byrd filled up the tree (eight \n     cloture votes).\n       1993--Emergency Supplemental Approps (Stimulus Bill)--Byrd \n     filled up the tree.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, also, I note that this is done two or three \ntimes a year and certainly is not unprecedented.\n  I hope no one will characterize this amendment as a ``poison pill'' \nfor campaign finance reform. It is so fundamental to fairness in the \ncampaign process. Shouldn't workers in America be able to have some say \nabout how their fees, assessments, or dues are used in political \ncampaigns? I think the answer truly should be yes.\n  Some of our colleagues may not want to expose, much less vote on, one \nof the worst campaign abuses that exists--compulsory business or union \ndues--but that is no reason for them to suddenly change their position \non campaign finance reform as a whole.\n  Most Americans would be shocked to learn that some workers in our \nNation are forced to contribute to a candidate or campaign they don't \nsupport or do not know anything about. They have no way of directing \nwhere those funds go.\n  Because of that abuse, this amendment, the Paycheck Protection Act, \nis an essential element to genuine campaign reform. It requires that \nall political contributions be voluntary.\n  The McCain-Feingold bill places restrictions on political parties, \nbans soft money, and curbs the activities of grassroots organizations. \nBut it contains a giant loophole: It allows corporations and unions to \nconfiscate money, for political purposes, from their employees' and \nmembers' paychecks without getting their permission. This loophole must \nbe closed.\n  Senator McCain himself stated that he ``personally supports much \nstronger [Beck] language.'' He said he ``believes that no individual--a \nunion member or not--should be required to contribute to political \nactivities.'' This was on a floor statement of September 26, 1997.\n  The McCain-Feingold bill limits what people can voluntary contribute \nfor political purposes, but it does not protect people from being \nforced to contribute involuntarily to political campaigns.\n  We must require unions and corporations to get a worker's permission \nbefore taking money out of his or her paycheck for political purposes.\n  As I have said before, my own father was a union member. This \namendment is not targeted at unions. It is, as a matter of fact, \ndirected at affecting both unions and corporations as well.\n  No worker--whether union or corporate business, large or small--\nshould be forced to contribute against his or her will, as a condition \nof their employment.\n  Many workers don't want to pay and be involved in campaigns or in \npolitics, and many of those don't want to be told what they have to do \nand don't want to have their funds taken from them without their \npermission.\n  A recent poll of union members revealed that 78 percent did not know \nthey had the right to stop paying for politics.\n  A 1996 poll of union members found that 62 percent opposed the AFL-\nCIO's expenditure of over $35 million--and probably much more--of their \nmoney in a campaign to control Congress.\n  No worker should be forced to pay for politics that they do not \nsupport. As such, I hope Senators will support my amendment.\n  There will be plenty of time to debate this amendment and other \namendments, and then we will design a process to have some votes to see \nwhere the Senate stands on this and other issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished leader if I may be \ndesignated as a cosponsor of his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend the leader because there is no \nmore essential thing in America than our freedom. It is written into \nevery important document. It is the very foundation upon which our \nRepublic was formed, yet we have turned aside and winked at this \nprocess whereby the American worker is penalized in that he or she \ncannot exercise his or her own free will in making the most fundamental \nof decisions: Whether or not to have his or her paycheck involuntarily \ndocked for a sum of money for which in most instances they have no idea \nto what uses it will be put by people who make decisions for them.\n  Then that same worker will exercise his or her right of freedom to go \nto a polling place and write in a check or pull a lever or whatever the \nprocedure may be by which he or she will exercise his or her freedom to \nselect that individual, Democrat or Republican, independent, whether it \nis for chairman of the board of supervisors in the hometown, President \nof the United States, or whatever the case may be. To me it is a total \nanachronism to say that you cannot make a decision with regard to your \npaycheck, yet you are free to go into the polling booth and make that \ndecision.\n  This amendment is referred to as a poison pill.\n\n[[Page S10115]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na sample of the type of thing that is being used today in certain \nStates by which that worker signs and sends into his or her respective \nemployer his or her written consent to do just what this amendment \nasks.\n  There being no objection, the sample was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n            Political Contribution Withholding Authorization\n\n       No employer or other person may withhold a portion of a \n     Washington State resident's earnings (or that of a non-\n     resident whose primary place of work is in Washington) in \n     order to make contributions to a political committee that \n     must report to the Public Disclosure Commission or to a \n     candidate for state or local office without annual, written \n     permission from that individual. Completion of this form \n     entitles the entity specified to make such a withholding for \n     no more than 12 consecutive months.\n       I, (First Name, Middle Initial, Last Name) authorize (Name \n     of Employer or Other Person) to withhold ($ Amount per/pay \n     period/week/month/year/ from my earnings in order to make \n     political contributions to (Name, City and State of political \n     committee(s) and/or candidate(s) to receive deductions).\n       If more than one recipient is indicated, each is to receive \n     the following portion of the deduction made: \n     ________________. This authorization is valid for no more \n     than twelve consecutive months. It is effective on (Month/\n     Day/Year) and expires on (Month/Day/Year).\n       Signature:\n       Date:\n       According to state law, no employer or labor organization \n     may discriminate against an officer or employee in the terms \n     or conditions of employment for (a) the failure to contribute \n     to, (b) the failure in any way to support or oppose, or (c) \n     in any way supporting or opposing a candidate, ballot \n     proposition, political party, or political committee.\n\n\n                        Timing of Contributions\n\n       Primary and General Contributions: With the exception of \n     contributions from a bona fide political party organization \n     or a legislative caucus committee, no primary election \n     contribution may be made after the date of the primary.\n       No general election contribution is permitted after \n     November 30 of the election year from any contributor--except \n     the candidate using personal funds for his own campaign.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I remember a famous poem written years and \nyears ago, and I will insert in the Record portions of it. But it \nrelated to military people around the turn of the century. It says: \n``Yours is not to reason why; yours is but to do or die.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an excerpt of ``The \nCharge of the Light Brigade'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the excerpt was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    The Charge of the Light Brigade\n\n\n                                  ii.\n\n     ``Forward, the Light Brigade!''\n     Was there a man dismay'd?\n     Not tho' the soldier knew\n       Some one had blunder'd:\n     Theirs not to make reply,\n     Theirs not to reason why,\n     Theirs but to do and die:\n     Into the valley of Death\n       Rode the six hundred.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. That is the philosophy behind this automatic deduction-- \nyours is not to reason why; you just do as we tell you. That is \nantithetical. It is not a poison pill to correct that and have maybe \nsix simple words which say, I hereby consent to have my paycheck \ndeducted in a certain amount. How can anyone in good conscience call \nthat simple one sentence a poison pill? It is the exercise of the very \nessence of democracy in this country and no longer adheres to the \nrefrain ``yours is not to reason why.''\n  The American worker is quite different in profile today than when \nthis statute, which they predicate the automatic deduction, was put in. \nGiven a few gray hairs and a few years, I bridge back to those thirties \nwhen so much of the labor legislation was enacted. That laboring person \nwas drawn from a segment of society that was struggling for its very \nexistence, would take any job, would follow any order, would accept any \nworking condition just to have enough of an opportunity to provide for \nhis or her family.\n  Fortunately, this country has progressed today to where that is gone, \nand today that working person is of an entirely different profile. They \nhave had the opportunity to get education, and many are still seeking \nto augment their education. They have the opportunity to think for \nthemselves. We are in a society today dominated by all sorts of \nopportunities, be it on television or in schools or otherwise, to \nenhance one's level of education and to develop, Mr. President, a \nthought process by which the American worker can make many, many more \ndecisions for himself or for herself than at the time of the origin of \nthese very oppressive statutes that we still struggle with today.\n  So I commend the distinguished majority leader. It seems to me anyone \nwho wants to call this a poison pill should hold up that simple form, \npoint to it and say that the exercise of the right to simply say that I \nconsent is a poison pill. I call it, Mr. President, a ``freedom'' pill, \nif you want to use that phraseology. This is a ``freedom'' pill for the \nability of the American worker to begin to think and exercise his or \nher own judgment. I commend those who support this measure. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, very briefly, reluctantly, I must oppose \nthe amendment before the Senate. I do so not because I disagree with \nits intent. In fact, I strongly support what it seeks to do. But, as \nwith all difficult choices, a decision must be made. In this case, I \nmust decide that passage of overall campaign finance reform must be the \nSenate's first goal. The cosponsors of the modified bill recognized \nthat something must be done about enforcing the Beck decision.\n  S. 25, our original bill, was silent on this point. We chose in the \nmodification to take the important step to codify Beck. This step was \nnot taken lightly, and it should not be discounted by those who want \nmore. The fight with my friends on the other side of the aisle over \nthis issue loomed large for some time. To be frank, this was certainly \none of the most contentious issues we faced. In fact, inclusion of Beck \nlanguage in the bill nearly fractured our bipartisan coalition. \nHowever, in the end, all involved came to the same conclusion that I \nhave today. We must put the goal of overall campaign finance reform \nfirst. By this I do not mean to say that workers' rights issues are \nsecond to any other subject. They are extremely important and are long \noverdue in being addressed, but now is the time to debate campaign \nfinance reform. We can turn to other subjects in due time.\n  Mr. President, in the modified bill, we seek to codify the landmark \n1988 Supreme Court Beck decision. President Bush did this by Executive \norder in 1992 to the applause of the right and a condemnation of the \nleft and the unions. It was the right thing to do then, and it is the \nright first step now.\n  Unfortunately, as we all know, elections have consequences, and after \nwinning the White House, President Clinton soon reversed course and \nrepealed President Bush's Executive order. This bill would effectively \nreverse the actions of President Clinton. The bill would require that \nall labor unions give notice to nonunion individuals who are forced to \npay agency fees annual notice of their Beck rights. Such notice would \noccur by mail and must inform the worker how much money he or she could \nreceive. Again, this notification must occur each and every year.\n\n  If an employee chooses to utilize his or her rights, an employee \nwould be able to notify the union of such action by mail and have his \nor her fees reduced accordingly. The Beck decision does not affect \nlabor's contributions to candidates from its PAC. The law already \nrestricts dues and fees from being used for any PAC activity. The \ncodification of Beck contained in the modified bill is not \ninconsequential. An estimated 3 million of 19 million individuals \nworking under labor contracts are in union or agency shops where they \nmust pay union fees even though they are not members. If nonunion \nemployees chose to invoke their rights, unions would have to return up \nto $2.4 million a year.\n  On April 14, 1992, after President Bush issued his Executive order, \nthe Cleveland Plain Dealer reported:\n\n       ``Unions in truth have not been complying with Beck,'' said \n     Robert Duvin, a Cleveland lawyer who represents management on \n     labor issues. ``It's a joke. I am not saying workers don't \n     get their money back. Unions are not keeping the kind of \n     accounting they should.''\n\n\n[[Page S10116]]\n\n\n  The language in the modified bill will go far to stop this ``joke.'' \nIt will make clear that Beck is the law of the land, that it must be \ncomplied with, and that the status quo is no longer acceptable.\n  As I noted, in 1992, when President Bush took this action, it was \nwidely applauded by Republicans as a good first step, and I admit it is \nexactly that, a good first step, not comprehensive action. Just as the \nbill before the Senate is not all that I would want, it, too, is only a \ngood first step. In both cases we must not let perfect be the enemy of \nthe good. I hope that we can quickly resolve this issue. Now is not the \ntime for a debate on labor policy. This amendment should be offered on \nother legislation. I would strongly support debate on a freestanding \nbill. Perhaps all my colleagues could agree to move to Senator Nickles' \nPaycheck Protection Act immediately after debate on campaign finance \nreform. I challenge my Democratic colleagues to come to the floor and \npledge to allow the majority leader to bring the Nickles' Paycheck \nProtection Act to the floor and to allow for full debate in the regular \norder. Just as we are debating campaign finance reform, we could have a \nhealthy debate on labor law, and that is the best way to deal with this \nissue.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to work out a solution to this matter \nthat does not jeopardize passage of campaign finance reform. Both sides \nof the aisle must come to an agreement to deal with this subject \nwithout engaging in a filibuster. A filibuster at this time will doom \ncampaign finance reform. There will be plenty of blame to go around if \nsuch action occurs. I hope the public will understand that any \nprolonged debate at this time is designed solely to kill campaign \nfinance reform. If we can't come to some agreement to bring this matter \nup freestanding, then I hope my colleagues will allow us to vote on the \nmatter. Let the will of the majority of the Senate prevail. Then we can \nand must continue under the regular order and proceed with other \namendments. We should not let the prospects for passage of campaign \nfinance reform come crashing down based on the first amendment offered.\n  Let me point out again, Mr. President, I think we ought to go ahead \nand vote on this amendment, dispose of it and move forward. I hope that \nwe can do that soon, since it is an issue that is fairly well known to \nmost of my colleagues.\n  Mr. President, on Friday, we began a historic debate on the issue of \ncampaign finance reform. The Senate heard from many Members who feel \nvery passionately on this subject. The Washington Post characterized \nthe debate as having ``rare passion and eloquence,'' and that goes on \nboth sides of this issue. I think it is a tribute to the nature of this \nbody that such a debate is now occurring. We must not allow this \nopportunity to be lost. I urge the Senate to move forward with debate \non campaign finance reform and resolve this unrelated labor debate as \nsoon as possible.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, is the Senator from Arizona going to \nstay in the Chamber? I would like to enter into a colloquy with him if \nhe is available for that.\n  If I could, I would ask my friend from Arizona, last Friday when the \ndebate began, the substitute which the Senator from Arizona laid down \ntoday was not ready until today. Is the Senator from Kentucky correct \nabout that?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Of course.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. And the letter from the Brennan Center in New York, \nwhich the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Wisconsin received, \nwas dated last Monday, September 22. So would the Senator from Kentucky \nbe correct in saying that the 126 signatories to that letter probably \nhad not seen the substitute which the Senator from Arizona laid down \ntoday?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Of course, the Senator from Kentucky knows that the core \nof the bill basically remains the same. What we did was, as I mentioned \nin both my statement on Friday and again this morning, we did away with \na number of the provisions in the bill which would have guaranteed its \nfailure, not that we had in any way abandoned the fundamental belief in \nthose provisions of the bill, but we were not going to let the perfect \nbe the enemy of the good. We are in contact with the Brennan Center, \nand they will update their views on this within a very short period of \ntime. So if the Senator from Kentucky has some concerns about their \nbeing up to date with the latest changes, let me calm his fears at this \ntime to tell him that we will be receiving very soon another letter \nthat approves of the modified version.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Well, the original letter to the Senator from Arizona, \nwhich I have read, talks about party soft money and spending limits on \ncampaigns. The spending limits on campaigns portion, I understand, is \nnot in the revision that the Senator from Arizona has sent to the desk.\n  According to my reading of the letter, there is no mention of either \nindependent expenditures or issue advocacy provisions, which I assume \nare the same in the substitute as were in the original bill. Am I \nmissing something, or is the Senator from Arizona----\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Kentucky did miss something. I am sorry \nhe wasn't able to attend our press conference that we held last week \nwith Burt Neuborne, if you will look the final signature for Burt \nNeuborne, John Norton Pomeroy Professor of Law, legal director, Brennan \nCenter for Justice, New York University School of Law. He was queried \non exactly that point and stated that he firmly believed in its \nconstitutionality and, as I say, that letter will be updated very soon \nto include that.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would say to my friend from Arizona I am reading \nfrom the letter of September 22. It says, ``We do not all agree on the \nconstitutionality of various provisions of the McCain-Feingold bill \nitself, nor are we endorsing every aspect of the bill's soft money and \nvoluntary spending limits provision.''\n  Is the Senator from Arizona then suggesting that all 126 signatories \nto the letter endorse the independent expenditure and issue advocacy \nprovisions of the modification?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am telling the Senator from Kentucky that I am totally \nconfident that all or the overwhelming majority of the 126 who signed \nthis letter will also sign and approve of the changes that we have \nmade. Again, fundamentally because there have been reductions in the \nbill instead of an expansion of it.\n  Again, Mr. Neuborne, who was the one who was the progenitor of this \nentire letter and contacted all 126 people, expressed his confidence \nthat that would also be the case.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator from Kentucky yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me just say there have been a whole series of \ncases----\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator from Kentucky yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Not at this time.\n  There have been a whole series of cases on issue advocacy. It is not \nin a gray area. In fact, the FEC's enforcement actions and regulatory \nefforts to suppress issue advocacy have been going on for a number of \nyears.\n  They have been involved in a number of cases. I am looking at a whole \nlist here, FEC versus AFSCME, in 1979; FEC versus CLITRIM, in 1980; FEC \nversus Machinists, in 1981; FEC versus Massachusetts Citizens for Life, \nin 1986; FEC versus----\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask the Senator from Kentucky, is our colloquy over \nor is it going to continue?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I apologize to my friend from Arizona. I am now making \nsome observations about issue advocacy.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. FEC versus Phillips Publishing, in 1981; FEC versus \nNational Organization for Women; FEC versus Survival Education Fund, in \n1995; FEC versus Christian Action Network, in 1996; FEC versus GOPAC, \nin 1994; FEC versus Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee, in \n1996.\n  Now, in all of those cases the Federal Election Commission was trying \nto snuff out issue advocacy. It was rebuffed in all of those cases and, \nin the case of FEC versus the Christian Action Network, in the fourth \ncircuit, the court was so angry at the FEC for continuing to pursue \nthese citizens\n\n[[Page S10117]]\n\ngroups that it ordered the FEC to pay the legal fees of the citizen \ngroup which had been harassed by the FEC.\n  Mr. President, there may be some things that are in a gray area in \nthis debate, but issue advocacy is not. The court has been very, very \nclear, since Buckley, that it is impermissible for the Congress to shut \nthese people up when they seek to criticize us. An effort to say that \nin proximity to the election they can't criticize us would be an \nexercise in futility. I mean, these citizens have a right to band \ntogether. We don't like it. I stipulate that I have been subjected, \nshall I say, to these issue advocacy campaigns myself. I don't like it. \nI would rather not be criticized. But, as a practical matter, the \ncourts are not going to allow us to shut these people up just because \nwe find what they say about us offensive.\n\n  The enforcement actions that I mentioned are just the tip of the \niceberg, since many enforcement actions never progress beyond the \nadministrative levels. But these administrative investigations can be \nequally chilling on free speech.\n  The FEC has attempted to buttress its position regulating issue \nadvocacy by extensive regulatory proceedings resulting in the adoption \nof the following regulations, which have been invalidated by the \ncourts.\n  The FEC has been on this mission to shut these people up for a long \ntime. So they issued a variety of different regulations, 11 CFR \n114.4(b)(5), which was invalidated in Faucher versus FEC, in 1991; 11 \nCFR 114.1(e)(2), invalidated in Chamber of Commerce versus FEC, in \n1995; 11 CFR 100.22, invalidated in Maine Right to Life Committee \nversus FEC in 1996; 11 CFR 114.10, invalidated in Minnesota Citizens \nConcerned for Life versus FEC, in 1995; 11 CFR 114.4(c)(4) and (5) \ninvalidated in Clifton versus Federal Election Commission, in 1996.\n  I don't know who these constitutional scholars are. I am not prepared \nto argue with the Senator from Arizona or the Senator from Wisconsin \nthat they all went to law school. But this business of seeking to \nregulate the expressions of citizens against our voting records doesn't \nhave any chance at all of being upheld in the courts. I would hope the \nSenate would not waste its time engaging in some ill-conceived idea \nhere to try to keep people from criticizing our records. It is a clear \nviolation of the first amendment.\n  So, it seems to this Senator that that is something we ought not to \nbe engaging in. As the Senator from Arizona pointed out, that provision \nof McCain-Feingold remains largely the same as it was in the original \nversion.\n  I see my friend from Wisconsin is on his feet and would like to \nengage in a colloquy. I had in mind asking him a few questions as well, \nso I will be happy to yield to him for a question.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky. I \njust want to go over a couple of points relating to the Brennan Center \nfor Justice letter of September 22.\n  First of all, the Senator from Kentucky made a statement a few days \nprior to the release of that letter on national television. He said \nsomething to the effect as follows: Russ does not have one single \nconstitutional scholar who supports his position. So I can understand \nthe Senator from Kentucky being a little tender about a letter signed \nby 126 constitutional scholars that says exactly what it says.\n  I would first like to ask the Senator from Kentucky if he ever heard \nany of us, either at the news conference or otherwise, purport that \nthat letter included references to the issue of issue advocacy versus \nexpress advocacy?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I did not. I want to commend the Senator from \nWisconsin for bringing that up, because it proves precisely my point, \nthat the constitutional scholars are not certifying to the \nconstitutionality of the issue advocacy or independent expenditure \nprovisions of the bill. I think the Senator from Wisconsin has made an \nappropriate correction.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That is right, Mr. President, because this is nothing \nbut a red herring. The Senator from Kentucky does not like what the \nletter says, so he is trying to pretend that we actually said it said \nsomething else, and then get me to say it did not say that.\n  Let me ask the Senator from Kentucky whether he, in reviewing the \nletter, recognizes that there are two main points to the letter, one is \nthe view of these 126 scholars that a ban on soft money is \nconstitutional; and, second, that a system that would provide voluntary \nincentives to candidates who agree to some limits on their spending \nwould also be constitutional?\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would say to my friend from Wisconsin, that is \nprecisely what I was saying. That is what the constitutional scholars, \nin the letter released by the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from \nWisconsin, were talking about. It's their view of what a court would \nlikely rule in the case of soft money and in the spending limits \nproposals, since dropped, that would apply to individual campaigns. \nThat was precisely the point the Senator from Kentucky was trying to \nmake, that the constitutional scholars are not certifying that they \nbelieve that provisions of the bill related to issue advocacy or \nindependent expenditure are constitutional.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Of course the Senator from Kentucky is correct. The \nvery reason we would have asked for such a letter to be signed by 126 \nconstitutional scholars is that for years the Senator from Kentucky has \nsaid that it is unconstitutional to ban soft money, even though the \nSenator from Kentucky proposed a bill in the 103d Congress that would \nban soft money himself. He has stood on the floor of the Senate \nrepeatedly, year after year, and said that a system that would provide \nan incentive to a candidate to limit his or her spending is \nunconstitutional because, in his words, ``It would put a gun to the \nhead of a candidate, in effect forcing him or her to do so.''\n  So watch the shifting constitutional argument. First, the Senator \nfrom Kentucky focused his debate last year against our bill on the PAC \nban, which is no longer in the bill. Then he focused on the soft money \nban. Then he focused on the issue of whether or not voluntary \nincentives could be given. In each case, the Senator from Kentucky \nconcluded emphatically, on the floor and off the floor, that it is \nplainly unconstitutional. He does not have a leg to stand on anymore; \n126 constitutional scholars have said to him: Wrong, wrong, and wrong.\n  So now he is moving to another discussion. Now he is going to put up \nanother figleaf in front of this obvious attempt to keep the current \nsystem in the form of a----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would caution the Senator from \nWisconsin that this is supposed to be a civil debate. I don't know \nwhether he is violating rule XIX or not, but I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I have yielded temporarily to the Senator from \nWisconsin. I would like to have a debate about this constitutional \nprinciple.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I recognize the comments of the Senator \nfrom Kentucky. Let me just go back to a question, in fairness. The fact \nis that the provisions that we have placed in the bill, the modified \nbill, with regard to the issue of candidate advocacy versus issue \nadvocacy are not identical----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is the Senator asking a question?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I am about to ask a question--are not identical to \nthose in the bill last year. In fact, I would ask the Senator from \nKentucky if he is aware that the provisions we have just put in the \nmodification are different than any that we have introduced before?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would say, Mr. President, that I am aware the bill \nhas been evolving. I am aware issue advocacy is different now, in the \nrevised bill, than it was originally.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator from Kentucky acknowledge that the \nnotion of a bright-line test with regard to issue advocacy is not the \nsame as some of the other approaches?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, regaining the floor, let me suggest to \nthe Senator from Wisconsin that the bright-line test probably makes it \neven more unconstitutional. I think it is inconceivable that the courts \nwould say that you can criticize a Member of Congress anytime you want \nto, except right before an election.\n  Let me say with regard to this ongoing discussion of constitutional \nscholars that I don't know how many of the constitutional scholars in \nthe letter\n\n[[Page S10118]]\n\npresented by the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Wisconsin \nhave actually practiced these cases in court. I don't know the answer \nto that. It could be that many of them have. But the American Civil \nLiberties Union, which was cocounsel to Senator Buckley in the 1996 \ncase and has handled a lot of this litigation over the years, believes \nthat the provisions of the McCain-Feingold substitute with regard to \nissue advocacy is unconstitutional.\n  The American Civil Liberties Union is America's expert on the first \namendment. It is true that the Senator from Wisconsin has diligently \nsearched for years and managed to come up with some folks who will sign \na letter saying this is constitutional. I said last week I could \nprobably find 126 people who say the Earth is flat. But, the experts on \nthe first amendment, the American Civil Liberties Union, believe that \nthese provisions are not constitutional.\n  Let me just read from a letter earlier this year, to me from the \nACLU, regarding independent expenditure provisions in McCain-Feingold \nat that time.\n\n       The new restrictions on independent expenditures improperly \n     intrude upon that core area of electoral speech, and \n     impermissibly invade the absolutely protected area of issue \n     advocacy.\n\n  Mr. President, the ACLU went on:\n\n       Two basic truths have emerged with crystal clarity after 20 \n     years of campaign finance decisions--[20 years]. First, \n     independent expenditures for express electoral advocacy by \n     citizens groups about political candidates lie at the very \n     core of the meaning and purpose of the first amendment. \n     Second, issue advocacy by citizen groups lies totally outside \n     the permissible area of Government regulation.\n  This bill assaults both principles.\n  So, Mr. President, I am not disputing for a moment that the Senators \nwho are the principal sponsors of this bill have found some folks who \nwent to law school who were certifying that they believe this bill is \nconstitutional. But I am suggesting that the people who litigated in \nthis area, the lawyers, the distinguished lawyers who have litigated in \nthis area for the last 20 years, who were involved in the original \ncase, the Buckley case, that went to the Supreme Court, believe that \nthese provisions on independent expenditures and issue advocacy are \nfatally flawed.\n  I rest my case. I guess we can all sort of pick our own expert and \ndecide who we want to rely on, depending upon the outcome that we want \nto achieve. But I think most people would believe that the first \namendment lawyers at the American Civil Liberties Union know a little \nbit about this area of litigation.\n  I want to take a few moments to pose a few questions to my friend \nfrom Wisconsin, if I may.\n  (Mr. DeWINE assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, if I may, I have a couple of questions \nrelating to the letter itself I would like to ask, and then I will be \nhappy to yield for those questions, if I could, just with regard to the \ncomments the Senator was just making.\n  If the Senator will yield for a question, does the Senator realize \nthat the person who put the letter together, Mr. Burt Neuborne, New \nYork University Law School, was the former executive director of the \nACLU?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Right. Also Professor Neuborne believes that the \nBuckley case was a mistake. He has been very candid about that. He \nbelieves that Thurgood Marshall was wrong when he said spending is \nspeech. So Professor Neuborne, I would say, has been very candid about \nhis views. He has a view that is contrary to the state of the law.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Doesn't the ACLU also take the position that the \nBuckley case was wrong?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The ACLU didn't like every aspect of it. They didn't \nlike the fact that the Court decided it was permissible to put a limit \non contributions. The ACLU felt that even the contribution limit, Mr. \nPresident, was a violation of free speech. They didn't win that one, \nbut they won the rest of the case.\n  Thurgood Marshall said spending is speech, and all nine Supreme Court \nJustices said spending is speech. I heard the Democratic leader out \nhere Friday talking about a 5-to-4 case. It wasn't a 5-to-4 case. It \nwas 9 to 0 that spending is speech. My friend from Wisconsin wanted to \nask a question or observe----\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, does the Senator from Kentucky consider \nLawrence W. Knowles, University of Louisville School of Law, qualified \nto discuss these issues?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I don't know Larry Knowles, but a professor of mine at \nthe University of Kentucky Law School I noticed was a signatory to your \nletter, I say to my friend from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. One of my former professors is a signatory of your \nletter. I think we haven't persuaded him----\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Can we safely assume the two signatories with a good \nKentucky background know what they are talking about?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I don't know what they know about this kind of \nlitigation and the first amendment, but I won't dispute the fact that \n126 people signed this letter. I hope the Senator from Wisconsin won't \ndispute that Professor Neuborne disagreed with the Buckley decision, \nthinks it was wrong and for 24 years has been trying to argue that \nsomehow the Court ought to reconsider this and change its mind even \nwhile the Court has been going more and more in the direction of \npermissible political speech.\n  So, Mr. President, I still have the floor, I believe, and if the \nSenator from Wisconsin is up for a few more questions, I would like to \nask him a few.\n  I gather that the Senator from Wisconsin said last Friday--I know the \nSenator from Arizona did, too--that they hoped to offer an amendment to \nrestore the individual spending limits on campaigns, if they were given \nsuch an opportunity. Is that correct?\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Let me respond to that in a slightly different way. \nAnother point I wanted to clear up in response to that question, the \nSenator from Kentucky is suggesting that there are no spending limits \nin our base bill. That is incorrect. Our bill, the modification that \nwas just offered, does provide that a candidate who wants to get the \ncoordinated party expenditure benefit from their party has to limit \ntheir personal wealth contribution to no more than $50,000.\n  So the fact is that provision, which these 126 constitutional \nscholars have suggested is perfectly constitutional, is in our base \nbill. The Senator is, of course, correct, that we do intend to add--in \nfairness to his comment--we do intend to add an amendment that would go \nfurther, that would, in fact, bring back some of the other proposed \nvoluntary limits that would then be coupled with what we hope would be \nan incentive for reduced cost for television time. We hope to add that \nto the bill, but the concept is already in the base bill.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I stand corrected, Mr. President. There is a partial \nspending limit in the remaining bill. In any event, I am sure I haven't \nmischaracterized the position of the Senator from Wisconsin. He likes \nspending limits. He thinks that too much money is being spent in \nAmerican campaigns; is that correct?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. It is not correct that I like mandatory spending \nlimits, Mr. President. I believe that under the Buckley versus Valeo \ndecision--which the Senator knows I accept because I oppose a \nconstitutional amendment that would require mandatory spending limits--\nI believe that under that decision, it is permissible and appropriate \nto offer voluntary spending limits, and that is the kind of spending \nlimit that I would support. I would not support a constitutional \namendment, for example, to require mandatory spending limits.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Well, Mr. President, the original McCain-Feingold bill \nseeks to, shall I say, entice people into limiting their spending, and \nthe Senator has often said he thinks there is too much money in \npolitics and we should be able to entice people into limiting their \nspending. So I would just like to ask the Senator how much is too much? \nHow much spending is too much?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I don't believe it is my language that \nthere is such a thing as too much money. It is all in context, and the \ncontext is this: If somebody chooses, as they may under their \nconstitutional right, to spend as much as they want, I believe we \nshould establish a system whereby a person who is challenging that \nperson has a chance to at least get their message out.\n\n[[Page S10119]]\n\n  So I don't have any theoretical limit that I believe in. If Michael \nHuffington wants to spend $30 million in California, that's his right, \nbut it is my belief that we ought to provide some kind of incentive to \nthose who would voluntarily limit their spending so they could have a \nfair chance to get their message out.\n  I don't accept the premise of the Senator's question, that I believe \nthere is some sort of a magical number. What I want is some kind of \nfairness in the system, some kind of leveling the playing field so not \njust multimillionaires would get to participate.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. In the McCain-Feingold bill, there is a State-by-State \nformula for how much one would be permitted to spend if he \n``voluntarily'' accepted the spending limit. Now, what would that add \nup to in the 1998 elections? Do you have a calculator there, or does \nyour staff have a calculator to give us a sense--\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. You are asking about the total amounts for all the \nStates put together?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. There is a formula in the McCain-Feingold bill, as I \nunderstand it, that specifies how much spending would be allowed in \nvarious States. Do you know what that would add up to in the 1998 \nelection?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Of course, Mr. President, that is an inaccurate \nstatement of what the bill does. It does not provide limits. It says \nonly that if a person agrees to a stable or certain figure, depending \non the size of the State, that those individuals would get the benefits \nprovided by the bill. There is no automatic limit. Anyone can go over \nthe limit if they want to, if they are willing to forfeit the benefits.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for an additional \nquestion?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield to the Senator from Utah for a question?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I recall in Friday's debate when the Senator from \nArizona laid down the three fundamental purposes of McCain-Feingold, \nand the second of those three was to lessen the amount of money in \npolitics. So I think the question of the Senator from Kentucky is a \nlegitimate one: How much do the sponsors of McCain-Feingold want to \nlessen the amount of money in politics?\n  According to the Senator from Arizona, that is one of the three \nfundamental pillars of this, and I hope the two Senators will continue \nthe colloquy until we get an answer to that question: How much do the \nsponsors of McCain-Feingold want to lessen the amount of money in \npolitics?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend from Utah. Let me just read the \nformula that is in the McCain-Feingold bill. I say to my friend from \nUtah, that might be helpful in giving my colleague from Wisconsin an \nopportunity to answer the question, How much is too much?\n  The formula, as I understand it, in the original bill is $400,000 \nplus 30 cents times voting age population less than or equal to 4 \nmillion plus 25 cents times the voting age population greater than 4 \nmillion.\n  So in the case, I say to my friends from Utah and Wisconsin--but \nthere is one State that is different. In the case of New Jersey, where \nthey have only one VHF station, the formula is different. It is 80 \ncents and 70 cents instead of 30 cents and 25 cents. Moreover, the \nminimum general election limit is $950,000, maximum being $5,500,000. \nThat is for any State, no matter how big. And then the primary is 67 \npercent of the general limit, and the runoff limit is 20 percent of the \ngeneral.\n  I am a little confused here. I gather that means that you can spend \nmore per voter in New Jersey than you can in Utah; is that right?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Is the question being posed to me?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes, it is your bill. I want to ask you about it.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I will be happy to respond to that question. First of \nall, of course, this provision is not what is before us at this point. \nNevertheless, I do believe in the system of overall voluntary spending \nlimits, and the real driving force behind that is a concern about \ntelevision costs. Any modifications or changes in the formula that had \nto do with a State-by-State difference without a doubt had something to \ndo with the question of what does it cost to run a television campaign \nin a U.S. Senate race.\n  I find it slightly amusing that the Senators question me about \nlanguage that my colleague from Arizona used about limiting spending in \ncampaigns, when the Senator from Kentucky, in S. 7, 103d Congress, had \na bill entitled ``To amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to \nreduce special interest influence on elections, to increase competition \nin politics, to reduce campaign costs, and for other purposes.''\n  The point is, actually all three of us agree that you should not \nmandatorily limit campaign spending.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. But it is the hope of the Senator from Wisconsin that \nsomebody would accept these ``voluntary'' spending limits.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Of course, it is my hope they would accept them, but \nonly voluntarily, so that not a single person in this country is forced \nto give up their free speech rights. That is not a part of our bill. \nThe whole premise of reducing the amount of money in politics is not to \ndeny anyone their rights, but, in appropriate cases, to encourage \npeople to limit their spending so we can have fair races, so we don't \nhave a scenario like the one that we have now where a Senate race, on \naverage, costs $4.5 million or $10 million or $15 million.\n  I would be curious if either the Senator from Utah or the Senator \nfrom Kentucky believe there is any amount of money that is \ninappropriate in terms of a U.S. Senate race?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If I may regain my time, the answer is I don't think \nthe Government should be determining how much speech there is in any \nSenate race, I don't care what the size of the State is.\n  I see my friend from Utah standing up again. Here is an explanation \nthat I think will help the Senator from Wisconsin. Obviously, he hopes \nthat people will accept their spending limits and the provision in \ntheir measure that would make it pretty hard not to, because if you \ndon't accept the spending limits, you have to pay way more for \ntelevision than somebody who doesn't.\n  It is my view the courts would strike that down as unconstitutional \nbecause they are punishing you if you choose to express yourself too \nmuch. You get punished because you have to pay more for your broadcast \ntime.\n  Clearly, the Senator from Wisconsin wants people to accept the \nspending limit, and I would argue the spending limit in the original \nMcCain-Feingold is not voluntary at all because the Government \nbasically has a gun to your head.\n  If you do not accept it, it costs you a heck of a lot of money. It \ngets back to this formula we were just discussing. The measure's \nspending limits are based on a formula that takes each State's voting \nage population into account. The basic general election spending limit \nis $400,000, plus 30 percent per voter up to 4 million of the voting \nage population and 25 percent per voter in excess of 4 million of the \nvoting age population.\n  I say to my friend from Utah, it appears as if the voters in excess \nof 4 million do not get as much spent on them as the voters below 4 \nmillion. So presumably you do not speak as much to the people over 4 \nmillion as you do to the people under 4 million. But then the general \nelection spending limit can be no lower than $950,000. So presumably if \nyou are in a little State, it cannot go below $950,000 or more than \n$5.5 million in any State. That presumably would limit California to \n$5.5 million. Then the basic primary election spending is two-thirds of \nthe general election spending limit, but not more than $2.75 million in \nany State.\n  If I could read on just a minute before taking the question of the \nSenator from Utah.\n  The proposed legislation creates some incredible anomalies that have \nbeen omitted from the public debate. Incredible? How else to describe a \nlaw, when figured on a per-voter basis, that would allow a Senatorial \ncandidate in Wyoming to spend almost 11.5 times the amount that could \nbe spent by a candidate in California?\n  With a 22.8 million voting age population, the biggest of any State, \nCalifornia, under the McCain-Feingold scheme, gets the biggest spending \nlimit. If figured on the same basis as other States, California \nspending would be $10.5 million; but, in fact, it is capped at $5.5 \nmillion. But California is\n\n[[Page S10120]]\n\nthe only State where maximum spending limits, $5.5 million per general \nand $2.75 million for a primary election would be applied; thus, \nCalifornia's total campaign spending is $8.25 million for the general \nelection, which works out, Mr. President, to about 24.1 cents per \nvoter.\n  Not too far away from California, in Wyoming, the State with the \nleast population where there are only 344,000 people of voting age, the \nspending limit would be $503,200 if it were not for the laws of minimum \nlimit of $1.586 million, general election and primary election, \n$636,000. The general election spending limit works out to $2.74 per \nvoter.\n  Mr. President, over in California under the spending limits regime in \nthe McCain-Feingold bill, which is not in the substitute but will be \noffered as an amendment if given the opportunity, a voter in California \nis treated to 24.1 cents in campaigns while Wyoming is $2.76 per voter.\n  Putting this in a different perspective, the McCain-Feingold \nlegislation allows senatorial candidates in California to engage in \nfirst amendment protective activity at a level of financial activity \nthat is barely one-tenth of the amount that a candidate could spend in \nWyoming. To achieve parity so that the voters in the two States receive \nthe same level of general election campaigning from their U.S. Senate \ncandidates would require California candidates to spend an amount that \nis 11.5 times greater than allowed in the McCain-Feingold bill, a \nwhooping $63.25 million; or you could reduce the amount that could be \nspent in Wyoming to $82,600.\n  Now, why do I bother to mention this Mr. President? This is truly a \nRube Goldberg scheme. ``We are here from the Government to help you,'' \nand we have concocted this spending limit regime up here in the \nGovernment so that the voters in these various States will not be \ntainted by too much expression being directed at them in the course of \ntheir campaigns. But as often is the case when the Federal Government \ntries to micromanage something, particularly something so difficult as \nmicromanaging political expression, you end up with a sort of absurd \nresult.\n  Mr. President, the reason I talk about these spending limits is that \nthey are in the original McCain-Feingold bill. Senator McCain, Senator \nFeingold do intend--if they have the opportunity--to offer that \namendment to give the Senate an opportunity to go on record as saying \nthat California voters only get 24.1 cents spent on them while Wyoming \nvoters get $2.76. This scheme is something that they want us to \nsanction.\n  Mr. President, this is an extraordinarily difficult concept for \npeople of average intelligence to understand. Besides the \nconstitutionality problem, they are also saying that in order to speak \nmore you have to pay more--and you do not get the broadcast discount--\nor if you decide to speak too much, you pay more for your speech. It is \njust one of the many problems with the spending limits regime with \nwhich the Senate has been confronted not just in this debate, but at \nvarious times over the last decade.\n  And I ask my friend from Utah, is a voter in Wyoming entitled to more \nof a campaign than a voter in California?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, if I may respond to my friend from \nKentucky, I know a little bit about campaigns in Wyoming because a \nlarge portion of the Wyoming electorate is served out of the television \nmarket headquartered in Salt Lake City, UT. As a consequence, voters in \nUtah were treated to attack ads telling us how terrible Mr. Enzi was in \nthe last campaign. We had no idea who he was. I did not meet him until \nhe was sworn in here. But I had seen all of the attack ads that were \nput on through the Salt Lake City television stations attacking the \nsenatorial candidate in Wyoming.\n  By contrast, if I may, our friend from Delaware, Senator Biden, has \ntold us that Delaware has no television outlets at all in the State. As \na consequence, if he is going to run a television campaign in Delaware, \nhe has to do all of his buying in Philadelphia, so that the voters of \nPennsylvania get to hear all of the glories and beauties of Joe Biden, \nnone of whom can vote for him because he cannot buy television time in \nDelaware.\n  What the Senator from Kentucky has demonstrated is how incredibly \ndifficult it is to craft legislation that approaches the ideal sought \nby the Senators from Arizona and Wisconsin in a market-by-market, \nState-by-State, election-by-election circumstance. It is virtually \nimpossible to do that. We ought to recognize that and defeat the whole \nthing out of hand.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would it not be appropriate to say, I say to my friend \nfrom Utah, that the Government has no business doing that anyway?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Of course the Government has no business doing that. \nThat is the point we made on Friday when we were having the debate. \nEven if we grant the argument raised by the Senator from Wisconsin and \nhis 126 experts that it can be done in a way that is constitutional, we \nrecognize that it cannot be done in a way that makes sense.\n  It is possible to craft a system that meets the narrow requirements \nof the Constitution in terms of protecting free speech, but it is not \npossible to do one in a way that makes any logical sense at all.\n  I had risen to ask my colleague this question about the example we \nhave before us. We are being told this is constitutional because it is \nvoluntary. And I suppose that is the reason these 126 scholars have \nsigned the letter. As long as you agree in advance to give up your \nconstitutional rights, then the Constitution will not defend you.\n  The Senator from Kentucky has said it isn't really voluntary. There \nis a huge incentive which the Senator from Kentucky describes as a gun \npointed at your head to see to it that you are voluntary. So it is not \nvoluntary. This is the question I had in mind.\n  We have an example before us of people giving up their constitutional \nrights in return for Federal dollars. There are some who are so unkind \nto call that a bribe. But in the Presidential system now, virtually \nevery candidate for President accepts the bribe; that is, he or she \naccepts the Federal dollars in return for agreeing to limit their \nspeech. The Senator from Wisconsin says, no, every American has a \nconstitutional right not to accept that money and to go ahead on their \nown.\n  Isn't it true that the only two candidates who have been able to run \nfor President without accepting the Federal money and mount anything \napproaching a worthwhile campaign are Ross Perot and Steve Forbes, both \nof whom approach billionaire status? Is that a correct summary of what \nthe Presidential system that is constitutional has brought us to?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from Utah is entirely correct. Even people \nlike Ronald Reagan, who opposed the Federal Election Campaign Act of \n1974, always checked no on his tax return as a protest against using \ntax dollars for the Presidential campaign. He had no choice because the \ncontribution limit on candidates for President was only $1,000. You \nsimply could not raise enough to compete for President unless you \naccepted the bribe that the Government offered you to give you so much \nmoney to limit your speech. There was simply no choice. And that kind \nof choice, it seems to me, is similar to what we have here and is \nreally quite unfortunate for candidates because it restricts their \noptions.\n\n  If I may just for a moment go back to the spending limit analogy \nwhile my friend from Utah is still up, another example would be to \ncompare New Jersey to New York, two States right next to each other. In \nNew Jersey they are able to spend more money on a candidate than in New \nYork, even though New York has more than twice as many voting age \nresidents as New Jersey. Two States right next to each other, people \ncommuting back and forth to work all the time, and yet somebody in the \nGovernment determines that the voters of New Jersey are entitled to \nmore communication than the voters in New York under the formula in the \noriginal McCain-Feingold bill.\n  Does that strike the Senator from Utah as really very difficult to \nunderstand?\n  Mr. BENNETT. As I said at the outset, it demonstrates just how \nridiculous it is for the Federal Government to get into the business of \ndetermining who can spend what and for how much in a constitutional \nway. You end up so contorted and distorted in your attempt to get \naround the obvious constitutional ban on this kind of nonsense that you \ncreate a circumstance\n\n[[Page S10121]]\n\nthat virtually no one can defend on practical grounds: More money going \nfor a candidate in New Jersey than for a candidate in New York, \ndifferent rules applying to a candidate in Delaware than apply to a \ncandidate in Wyoming.\n  All of this is voluntary, but it becomes voluntary because there is a \nhuge bribe out there waiting for you if you agree to give up your \nconstitutional rights. I think it is absurd.\n  I was delighted over the weekend to read the comments of George Will, \nwho said that this debate is one of the most fundamental we have had \nsince the founding of the Republic. I had not thought to put McCain-\nFeingold in the same fashion that George Will does, but he describes it \nas similar to the speech codes adopted in many of our campuses, the \nexcesses of the 1950's in the days of Joseph McCarthy, the 1920's \nspeech activity, the Alien and Sedition Acts, but he says all of those \nare less significant in their threat to a fundamental liberty than this \none because they came and went in the frenzy of the day. This one would \nleave behind a huge Federal bureaucracy aimed at producing exactly the \nkind of results the Senator from Kentucky is talking about, laying out \nthat this candidate in this State can spend this much, and as soon as \nhe steps across the State line, if he decided to run in another State, \nthen the rules would change, the limits would change, the circumstances \nwould change.\n  That kind of Federal bureaucracy intruding itself into the campaign \neven if it were through some tortuous method of gaining consent on the \npart of those involved, constitutionally it remains clearly violative \nof the spirit of the first amendment, if not the specific letter. I \nbelieve the courts would strike it down.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Virginia is on \nhis feet. I just want to make one wrapup observation about what the \nSenator from Utah was just talking about.\n  The George Will column to which he referred was in the Washington \nPost yesterday. And just to pick out some excerpts, Mr. Will said, \n``Nothing in American history * * * matches the menace to the First \nAmendment posed by campaign `reforms' * * *''\n  Further, Mr. Will said, ``Thus is the First Amendment nibbled away, \nlike an artichoke devoured leaf by leaf,'' which is what the Senator \nfrom Utah was talking about.\n  And toward the end of the article he called this ``the most important \n[debate] in American history'' because really what we are talking about \nhere is core political discussion in this country, as the Senator from \nUtah has pointed out.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that George Will's column, the \nheadline of which says ``Here Come the Speech Police,'' be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 28, 1997]\n\n                      Here Come The Speech Police\n\n                          (By George F. Will)\n\n       Almost nothing that preoccupies Washington is as important \n     as Washington thinks almost all its preoccupations are. But \n     now Congress is considering some version of the McCain-\n     Feingold bill, which raises ``regime-level'' questions. It \n     would continue the change for the worse of American \n     governance. And Washington's political class hopes the bill's \n     real importance will be underestimated.\n       With a moralism disproportionate to the merits of their \n     cause, members of that class--including the exhorting, \n     collaborative media--are mounting an unprecedentedly sweeping \n     attack on freedom of expression. Nothing in American \n     history--not the left's recent campus ``speech codes,'' not \n     the right's depredations during 1950s McCarthyism or the \n     1920s ``red scare,'' not the Alien and Sedition Acts of the \n     1790s--matches the menance to the First Amendment posed by \n     campaign ``reforms'' advancing under the protective \n     coloration of political hygiene.\n       Such earlier fevers were evanescent, leaving no \n     institutional embodiments when particular passions abated. \n     And they targeted speech of particular political content. \n     What today's campaign reformers desire is a steadily \n     thickening clot of laws and an enforcing bureaucracy to \n     control both the quantity and the content of all discourse \n     pertinent to politics. By the logic of their aims, reformers \n     cannot stop short of that. This is so, regardless of the \n     supposed modesty of the measure Congress is debating.\n       Reformers first empowered government to regulate ``hard'' \n     money--that given to particular candidates. But there remains \n     the ``problem'' of ``soft'' money--that given to parties for \n     general political organizing and advocacy. Reformers call \n     this a ``loophole.'' Reformers use that word to stigmatize \n     any silence of the law that allows unregulated political \n     expression. So now reformers want to ban ``soft'' money. But \n     the political class will not stop there.\n       Its patience is sorely tried by the insufferable public, \n     which persists in exercising its First Amendment right of \n     association to organize in groups as different as the Sierra \n     Club and the National Rifle Association. One reason people so \n     organize is to collectively exercise their First Amendment \n     right of free speech pertinent to politics. Therefore \n     reformers want to arm the speech police with additional \n     powers to ration the permissible amount of ``express \n     advocacy,'' meaning speech by independent groups that \n     advocates the election or defeat of an identifiable \n     candidate.\n       But the political class will not stop there. Consider mere \n     issue advocacy--say, a television commercial endorsing \n     abortion rights, mentioning no candidate and not mentioning \n     voting but broadcast in the context of a campaign in which \n     two candidates differ about abortion rights. Such \n     communications can influence the thinking of voters. Can't \n     have that, other than on a short leash held by the \n     government's speech police. So restriction of hard money \n     begets restriction of soft, which begets regulation of issue \n     advocacy--effectively, of all civic discourse.\n       The political class is not sliding reluctantly down a \n     slippery slope, it is eagerly skiiing down it, extending its \n     regulation of political speech in order to make its life less \n     stressful and more secure. Thus is the First Amendment \n     nibbled away, like an artichoke devoured leaf by leaf.\n       This is an example of what has been called ``the Latin \n     Americanization'' of American law--the proliferation of \n     increasingly rococo laws in attempts to enforce fundamentally \n     flawed laws. Reformers produce such laws from the bleak, \n     paternalistic premise that unfettered participation in \n     politics by means of financial support of political speech is \n     a ``problem'' that must be ``solved.''\n       One reason the media are complacent about such restrictions \n     on (others') political speech is that restrictions enhance \n     the power of the media as the filters of political speech, \n     and as unregulated participants in a shrunken national \n     conversation. Has the newspaper in which this column is \n     appearing ever editorialized to the effect that restrictions \n     on political money--restrictions on the ability to buy \n     broadcast time and print space and other things the Supreme \n     Court calls ``the indispensable conditions for meaningful \n     communications''--do not restrict speech? If this newspaper \n     ever does, ask the editors if they would accept revising the \n     First Amendment to read:\n       ``Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of the \n     press, but Congress can restrict the amount a newspaper may \n     spend on editorial writers, reporters and newsprint.''\n       As Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican, and \n     others filibuster to block enlargement of the federal speech-\n     rationing machinery, theirs is arguably the most important \n     filibuster in American history. Its importance will be \n     attested by the obloquies they will receive from the herd of \n     independent minds eager to empower the political class to \n     extend controls over speech about itself.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I yield for a question to the Senator \nfrom Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wonder at this point in time if I just \nmight make some follow-on comments to my earlier observation. Would the \nSenator be agreeable?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I will.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, earlier I talked in support, the strongest \nsupport, of the distinguished majority leader's amendment. Mr. \nPresident, I rise today to address the issue of campaign finance \nreform. As chairman of the Committee on Rules and Administration, I \nhave spent a great deal of time with these issues over the past 2 \nyears. I appreciate the effort by the majority leader to bring campaign \nfinance reform to the floor for debate, and I welcome the opportunity \nto join in this important debate.\n\n  The Rules Committee has held 10 hearings in 1996 and 1997 concerning \ncampaign finance reform issues. Many of these hearings dealt with the \nspecific issues contained in the legislation commonly known as McCain-\nFeingold, such as soft money, free television time, regulation of issue \nadvocacy, and spending caps. The committee has compiled a detailed \nrecord on these issues for the Senate. During these hearings, we have \nheard from many noted experts in this field, including many of the same \nwitnesses who appeared before the Committee on Governmental Affairs \nlast week.\n  My view of how the campaign finance debate will evolve is as follows. \nDemocrats argue that the Republicans must rely even more on \ncontributions from\n\n[[Page S10122]]\n\nindividuals--hard money--and less on large soft money contributions. \nRepublicans argue that the Democrats, who have relied heavily on the \ninvoluntary confiscation of the dues of union members, must agree that \nunion members must give their advance, written consent before a part of \ntheir paycheck should go to partisan political activities.\n  I received a letter from President Clinton last Tuesday in support of \nMcCain-Feingold. He added that ``any attempts to attach amendments that \nwould make it unpalatable to one party or another are nothing less than \nattempts to defeat campaign finance reform.'' I understand that latest \nversion of McCain-Feingold does not include a requirement that union \nmembers give prior, written consent before their dues could be used for \npartisan purposes. This Senator will support an amendment to add this \nrequirement, and I say that if the Democrats decide to filibuster \ncampaign finance legislation because it includes this provision, then \nit is they who are blocking true bipartisan reform, not the \nRepublicans.\n  In the Rules Committee we have held a series of hearings on these \nissues that are being discussed here today. I want to focus on one \nparticular hearing where we allowed both sides to come in and discuss \ncompulsory deduction by unions. And we held this hearing. We had as a \nwitness David Stewart, a member of the Transport Workers Union of \nAmerica, local 514, located in Tulsa, OK.\n  I remember him very well. He was proudly in the hearing room in his \nbasic working uniform. He testified, and I have extracted some of that \ntestimony to read in this debate today, this very important debate. \nThis is what this American worker said:\n\n       * * * I really do not agree with some of the Agendas and \n     the Candidates that the union endorses. Yet, we are all \n     required to fund these agendas and campaigns just by virtue \n     of our membership in the Union.\n\n  This is a union man, Mr. President.\n\n       As I searched for relief from this unjust requirement, I \n     found out about the ``Beck Supreme Court Decision,'' which in \n     effect gives a Union Member the right to a refund of the Non-\n     Bargaining expenditures of the Union. The problem is, I must \n     relinquish my Union Membership and the rights associated with \n     that Membership to seek this refund. It is absurd to require \n     me to fund the Contract Bargaining, Contract Enforcement and \n     Administration of the Local, yet require me to forfeit my \n     rights to a voice in these affairs, only because I oppose the \n     Political Expenditures of the Union. I am not opposed to my \n     requirement to belong to the Union. I still attend the Union \n     meetings and enjoy having a voice in the affairs of the Union \n     and my career, I am not willing to give up this activity to \n     receive the refund afforded me by the ``Beck Decision.''\n\n  We also heard from Cindy Omlin, a former teacher from Washington \nState. She described the schemes by which her union illegally used her \ndues--that mandatory deduction--for political contribution. The unions \ngot caught, but nonetheless they upped the amount of dues teachers were \nrequired to contribute for partisan activities. Our committee listened \nto these workers and they came forward at some risk to themselves to \ngive this important testimony.\n\n  At the appropriate time I hope to ask the sponsors of this \nlegislation whether or not they have taken it upon themselves to go out \nand talk to the workers and find out exactly how they feel about this \nonerous requirement of mandatory deduction. I will await the \nopportunity to talk to one or more of the sponsors or both on this \npoint when they have that availability.\n  Now I have read that the new version of McCain-Feingold may include a \nprovision to enforce the Beck decision and require posting of notices \nthat employees can receive refunds. This idea, although certainly \nbetter than the status quo, is not nearly good enough.\n  Effective enforcement of Beck is difficult at best. The posting of a \nsmall sign or a small note in a union magazine will not do. Many \nemployees will never learn of their Beck rights, and unions will no \ndoubt continue to set up substantial obstacles to exercising these \nrights. In our hearing, we heard how unions make the window for \nobjecting very brief and it changes every year, with the notice often \nburied deep within lengthy union magazines.\n  Moreover, single employees are very poorly equipped to challenge \naccountings provided by union officials as to the breakdown of \nchargeable and nonchargeable activities. Also, an employee wishing to \nappeal this determination would need to hire his or her own attorneys \nand accountants for an arbitration run under rules established by the \nunion. The financial disclosure forms filed by unions with the Labor \nDepartment, the LM-2, are notoriously useless in actually assisting \nemployees to determine what percentage of their dues go to political \nactivities.\n  All of these procedural hurdles are in addition to the stigmatization \nof objectors, officially called agency-fee payers. Often lists of \nobjectors are published in union literature and cases of threatened \nviolence are common.\n  I believe the only solution, and one that is not contained in the \nMcCain-Feingold legislation, is to require prior, written consent \nbefore dues are confiscated. I am a cosponsor of Senator Nickles' bill, \nthe Paycheck Protection Act, which would rectify this egregious \nsituation. Without this provision, we will not have fair campaign \nfinance reform.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I want to thank the Senator from Virginia not only for \nthe remarks he has made today but the way he has listened to all of \nthose who have come forward at the Rules Committee over the period of \nhis chairmanship. He and I, many times, were the only two there. He has \nbeen wonderful in giving an opportunity to a number of groups who, \nfrankly, have had a difficult time giving testimony in the past, who \ntypically have not been listened to. I think he has made a major \ncontribution in providing some balance to this important constitutional \ndebate.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague. \nIndeed, we have not fully agreed on all provisions that are options \nthroughout this whole realm of campaign finance, but fundamentally we \ncertainly agree on the question of the mandatory deduction.\n  We went to the difficulty of finding witnesses and brought them to \nthe hearing room and listened to their testimony.\n  It is ever so clear to this Senator, and I am sure the other members \nof the committee, that throughout America the workers want to be \nrecognized for their ability to think for themselves and their ability \nto make decisions for themselves. This whole idea of mandatory \ndeduction is against free will--I think, indeed, against the very \nessence of what freedom is all about.\n  I commend my distinguished colleague from Kentucky. Let us fight on \nin the cause of freedom.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am happy to yield the floor. I see \nthe Senator from Illinois is here desiring to speak.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague, the Senator from Kentucky for \nyielding. I only have a short period of time here, I say for the \ninformation of my colleague from Maine, and I appreciate this chance to \nrise and speak on this issue.\n  It has been said in debate that the columnist, George Will, has \npronounced this as the most important debate in American history. I \ndidn't want to miss it and that is why I came to the floor today. I \nwill not question Mr. Will because he was reared and his early \neducation took place in the State of Illinois, and somewhere or another \nhe got off the course shortly afterwards, but at least we attribute his \nearly training to Illinois' educational standards.\n  Is this the most important debate in American history? It may be, \nbecause what is at stake in this debate is not the amount of money that \nis being spent in a campaign, it is really not about the conduct of \ncampaigns, it really doesn't have much to do with political action \ncommittees or labor unions or corporations or associations. What is at \nstake in this debate is the future of this democracy.\n  If that sounds hyperbolic, let me tell you why I say it. I am \nhonestly, genuinely, personally concerned as a Member of this great \ninstitution, about the fact that the American people are losing \ninterest in their Government. The clearest indication of that loss of \ninterest is their participation in elections.\n  Now, why is it at this moment in time when the United States of \nAmerica is obviously one of the most attractive places in the world to \nlive, where we have to almost construct a fence and a wall around our \nborders to keep people from other nations from coming\n\n[[Page S10123]]\n\nto the United States, why is it that at a time when our economy is \nbooming, at a time when we are so proud of what we have achieved not \nonly in this Nation but around the world, that the people we serve, the \nAmerican voters, have decided they are not interested? And they have \ndemonstrated that, unfortunately, in that quadrennial forum where we \nasked people to come forward and name the leader of this Nation.\n  Let me show you what I am talking about. I think it is interesting in \nthis debate about campaigns and money and voters to take a look at what \nhas happened in the United States of America in the last 36 years. This \nbar graph shows the amount of money that has been spent on campaigns at \nall levels, Federal through local. If you look it was a rather meager \nsum, $175 million, in the earliest years, and then skyrocketed up to $4 \nbillion here in 1996.\n  So to entice people to vote, to interest them in candidates and \ninterest them in campaigns, we have raised money in record sums and \nspent it on television, radio, direct mail, bumper stickers, emery \nboards, pocket combs and everything we can dream of, to say to the \nvoters, ``Look at me. Get interested. I'm running. I need your vote.'' \nIs it working? As we plow more money into this system, is it working? \nWell, the sad truth is, it is not.\n  Look at this percentage of those who vote in Presidential elections: \nStarting in 1960, 63.1 percent of the American people said the Kennedy-\nNixon election is one that we consider critically important, our family \nis going to vote. Look what happened in this last election in November: \n49.1 percent of the American people turned out to vote. We spent record \nnumbers, dramatically increasing the amount of money on political \ncampaigns, and the voters voted with their feet and stayed home. Isn't \nit curious that the more money we plow into our campaign system the \nfewer voters turn out?\n  Now let me just suggest something. If you happen to own a company \nselling a widget and say to your marketing department, ``We are going \nto double our advertising. Next quarter we want to see what happens to \nsales,'' and you gave them twice as much money for advertising your \nwidget, and they came back after the quarter was finished and said, \n``We have the report.'' You said, ``What is it?'' ``Advertising went up \n100 percent.'' ``How about sales?'' ``Sales went down.'' What? \nAdvertising went up and sales went down? Well, you could draw some \nconclusions. There was something wrong with the advertising or there \nmay have been something wrong with the product. That is what this \ndebate is about.\n\n  There is not only something wrong with the advertising, it has become \nso negative, so nasty, so dirty, that people are disgusted with it. \nThere is something wrong with the products. Candidates for the House \nand Senate are losing their reputation or seeing their integrity \nmaligned because we spend so much time grubbing for money. People \nbelieve that we are captives of special interest groups. And because \nthey are sick of the style of campaign and because they have little or \nno confidence in those of us who wage the campaigns, they stay home.\n  The turnout for the Presidential election last November was the \nlowest percentage turnout in America for a Presidential election in 72 \nyears. Now if Jay Leno and David Letterman pronounced this election \nover in July, as they probably did, I don't think that explains it. I \nthink there was something else at work here. The American voters are at \nbest indifferent, and at worst, downright cynical about the system we \nuse to elect people in the United States.\n  Let me also show you something that makes the case even more. I guess \nsome people would argue, well, back in 1960 there must have been a \nhigher percentage of people who were registered to vote. Well, that was \nnot the case. Our figures start on this chart in 1964, and there were \n64.6 percent of Americans were registered to vote; if you remember, \n63.1 percent of those turned out to vote.\n  Now, we have increased the franchise by making it easier to register \nto vote. You can register when you go to get a new license for your car \nor driver's license renewal, that sort of thing. So, more and more \nAmericans are getting registered to vote. There is more participation. \nI think that is a healthy thing. I backed motor-voter. We are now up to \n74.4 percent of eligible voters registered in America in the 1996 \nelection. You can be proud of that.\n  People have said, ``Yes, I will sign the form. I'm willing to go out \nand put my name on the voter rolls'' knowing they may be called for \njury duty or something else. They did it anyway. Then look what \nhappened. Despite this dramatic increase in the people who are \nregistering to vote, remember November 1996? Fewer than 50 percent of \nthe American people then exercised their right to vote.\n\n  I think that is a telling commentary on this debate. If you listen to \nthe arguments of my colleague from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, and \nSenator Bennett from Utah, who was on the floor the other day, and \nSpeaker Newt Gingrich and others, they have analyzed the situation and \nsaid, clearly, the major problem with the American political system is, \nin their words, ``We're just not spending enough money. We have to put \nmore money in these campaigns. We have to get on television more and \nradio more, and mail more things to the American people. Then they will \nknow we are out here.''\n  Well, they know we are out here. They just aren't buying what we are \nselling. They are staying home. Those who argue that the best way to \nreform the system is to plow more money into the system have missed the \npoint completely. Nine out of ten Americans--90 percent of them--\nbelieve that we spend too much in political campaigns, not too little.\n  Isn't it an oddity that we are at this point in our history where we \nare actually engaging in an argument as to whether or not a person's \nwealth should determine their ability to participate in a democracy? \nThis is not a new debate. We have been through this one before. In the \n19th century, the debate was cast in a different tone. If you wanted to \nvote, would you have to be a property owner? That is an evidence of \nwealth and stability, and some of our Founding Fathers said, well, that \nis a good indicator, and we should not let people vote unless they own \nproperty, and the States can determine the qualifications of electors. \nLet them put that in as a qualification.\n  We rejected that over 100 years ago and said that isn't what America \nis all about. Your participation with a vote should not have anything \nto do with whether you are wealthy or poor. If you are an American \ncitizen, you are entitled to vote. Since the early part of this \ncentury, whether you are a man, a woman, black, white, or brown, \nwhatever your ethnic heritage, whether you are poor as a church mouse \nor as rich as Donald Trump, you get the same one vote when you come to \nthe polls.\n  Listen to this debate today. The debate today says, let's change this \nsystem and say that if you are wealthy in America--let's say you are a \nmiddle-aged, crazy millionaire who decided he wants to be in the House \nor Senate or a Governor, then you go out and spend your money, exercise \nyour constitutional right, show your freedom of speech to go forward \nand ask for votes. If you happen to have more money than the next guy, \nyour likelihood of winning is that much better. What I just said is not \nbreakthrough; this is established fact. Candidates with more money and \npolitical campaigns usually win. That is a fact of life.\n  So my Republican friends who say, ``All this system needs is more \nmoney,'' are basically saying, ``If we can just get wealthier people \ninterested in running for office or people who are drawing money in \nfrom wealthy interests, special interests, that is good for America, \nthat is endorsement of our Bill of Rights, and that speaks well of our \nfreedom of speech.''\n  I don't buy that. I don't think the American people buy that.\n  As amendments are produced on the floor during the course of this \ndebate which try to enshrine wealth as the keystone for American \ncitizenship, I will oppose them. I hope Members on both sides will join \nme. It is a sad state of affairs in America if we have reached the \npoint where, in fact, a person's wealth is a determinant as to whether \nthey can be a successful candidate or be directly involved in our \npolitical process. That is what this debate is all about. That is why \nit could be historic in nature.\n  Let me address one particular example used in the debate Friday about \na good friend of mine who passed away a little over a year ago. His \nname was\n\n[[Page S10124]]\n\nMike Synar. Mike was a Congressman from Oklahoma. He was proud to \ncharacterize himself as an ``Okie from Muskogee.'' You have never met a \npolitical renegade like Mike Synar. I loved him. I loved his politics. \nHe used to drive people crazy. He would vote on issues and know that, \nif he went home, people would be angry with him. He would get involved \nin issues that made everybody squirm and uneasy in their seats. That is \njust the way he was. He also decided to stack the deck against himself \nbecause he announced when he came to the House of Representatives, \nrepresenting Muskogee, he wasn't going to take PAC money. Mike said, \n``I am going to take money from individuals, and I will rise or fall \nbased on my friends supporting me, and so be it.'' He managed to \nsurvive for a number of years.\n\n  Then came 1994. All of the special interest groups that had been \nopposing him in the Halls of Congress decided to team up against him \nback home. In 1992, they had spent $750,000 to defeat Mike Synar. Who \nwere these people? The National Rifle Association, the tobacco lobby, \nthe western grazing interests. They came in, and did they debate Mike \nSynar on gun control in his district? No. Did they debate him on \ntobacco regulation? No. Did they debate him on whether or not we are \ntoo generous in the subsidies to western grazing? No. They came in and \nliterally plowed hundreds of thousands of dollars into the campaign \nagainst him with negative ads on a variety of other subjects--and it \nwas perfectly legal. Mike escaped it in 1992, but not in 1994.\n  The illustration on the floor made by one of my colleagues last \nFriday that somehow or other ``Mike Synar, with $325,000, could not \ndefeat an opponent who only had $10,000 and, therefore, money is not \nthe determinate in an election,'' really overlooked the obvious. Mike \nSynar's money alone wasn't at risk. It was the money of a lot of \nspecial interest groups. He was defeated. He worked very hard for \ncampaign finance reform and a lot of other issues that I have the \nhighest respect for.\n  Let me just also say that I have heard a lot of argument from my \ncolleagues on the Republican side that this debate is really about \nlabor unions, and we have to get our hand on the fact that labor unions \nin the last election were so vocal and involved and spent so much \nmoney. Some estimate $35 million. That is an interesting premise for \nthis debate because, if you look at the totals that were spent by labor \nand business, the business community dramatically outspent labor \norganizations in that campaign. Yet, many of the amendments which we \nwill be considering have nothing to do with the business community \nbeing restricted, only labor unions.\n  I think some of my colleagues should take care to watch out for what \nis characterized as poison pills, or those amendments that will be put \nin the bill in the hope of killing the bill. It is an old legislative \nploy. Take an amendment adopted on the floor, which you are certain \ncould never be part of the final legislation, show your heartfelt \nconcern about campaign finance reform, knowing in your heart of hearts \nthat it will go nowhere with a poison pill amendment. We are going to \nsee a lot of these, I am afraid, during the course of this debate.\n  Let me address an issue that I think is critically important--\ntelevision time. In the McCain-Feingold, as originally introduced, \nwhich I and 44 other Democratic Senators endorsed, which three of my \nRepublican colleagues have joined in endorsing, including my colleague, \nthe Senator from Maine, Senator Collins. I think the number may be up \nto four now, we have, in that original bill, provisions that would say \nto a candidate that we know what is costing money in campaigns. We know \nwhere you are putting your money.\n  When I ran for the Senate in Illinois and raised literally millions \nof dollars sitting on a telephone day after day calling strangers and \nbegging them to contribute, the money that was coming in was going \nright out the front door for television. That is where I spent my \nmoney. Most major State candidates do the same. My colleague, Bob \nTorricelli of New Jersey, spent 84 percent of all the money he raised \non television. Think about that. Try to buy a 30-second TV ad in New \nYork City that costs $100,000, and you will understand very quickly how \nthat could happen. In Illinois, over 80 percent of our money went into \nraising money and spending it on television.\n\n  I think it is a good illustration that if we don't address the reason \ncampaigns are so expensive, we are not going to see any real reform. \nNow, the people who represent the television industry say you can't do \nthat; you can't take away time that this station can sell to a private \nadvertiser and give to it a political candidate. But they forgot \nsomething very basic. The people who own television stations and make a \nvery handsome profit do it because they are using our airwaves--not the \nSenate's airwaves; the American people's airwaves. We own these \nairwaves. We license these companies, at no charge, to use our airwaves \nand make a profit. It is not unreasonable for us as a people to go back \nto these television stations and say we want to take a slight and tiny \npercentage of those airwaves and dedicate them to cleaning up the \nAmerican election process, to make sure that the time is available for \nincumbents and challengers alike on a reduced level--or even free in \nsome circumstances--so the voters can hear legitimate messages and we \nwill clean up the message in the process. It won't be the drive-by \nshooting ads you see in campaigns. It will be informative. People will \nknow where Durbin stands on Social Security and where his opponent \nstands on Social Security. Things like that. That is not unreasonable. \nFor the stations to say, ``don't even touch it; we own the airwaves, \nnot the American people,'' I think they need a reminder as to how this \ngot started. They are licensed by this Government, representing the \nAmerican people, to make their profits. Now the argument that we are \ngoing to take away reduced costs of TV time is troubling to me. If you \ndon't reduce the cost of television, you will in fact continue to have \npolitical campaign costs skyrocketing. You will have men and women \nrunning for election and re-election to seats, spending the majority of \ntheir time raising money to pay for television.\n  So I think the original McCain-Feingold provision is absolutely \nessential. I think we should continue on not only to eliminate soft \nmoney, not only to reduce the cost of television, but also to go after \nissue ads that are actually candidate ads. Political candidates and \nthose who work around us watch television more closely than anybody, \nbecause we search that screen during a campaign cycle to find the \ntiniest of print on the bottom of the TV commercials, which identifies \nwho paid for it.\n  On the Saturday night before the election last November, bone weary, \nI pulled into my apartment in Chicago, and I was going to relax a \nlittle bit. It was in the closing days of the campaign. So I slumped \ndown in a chair, grabbed the remote control to listen to Saturday Night \nLive. Somewhere between the news and Saturday Night Live, up pops four \ntelevision commercials, one after the other, and every one of them \nblasting me. What a treat that was to sit in the chair and get pummeled \nby four different commercials.\n  The most unique thing was that not a single one was paid for by my \nopponent, the Republican Party in Illinois, or the National Republican \nParty. They were paid for by committees and organizations that most \npeople never heard of. These are organizations which mushroom up during \ncampaigns, take some high-sounding name, collect millions of dollars, \nundisclosed and unreported, and run ads, the most negative ads on \ntelevision, against politicians. That is an outrage. It is an outrage \nthat I have to account for every dollar I raise and spend and I have to \nidentify the television commercials that I put on, either comparing my \nrecord with my opponent or speaking about something I believe in, and \nthese groups can literally run roughshod over the system, spending \nmillions of dollars without any accountability.\n  McCain-Feingold addresses that. Thank God it does. If we don't put an \nend to this outrage, most of these other reforms are meaningless. To \neliminate soft money and to allow special interest groups, whether on \nthe business or labor side, to continue to spend money unfettered in \nissue advocacy and the like is outrageous. The McCain-Feingold \nlegislation is an idea whose time has come.\n\n[[Page S10125]]\n\n  I hope that a number of my colleagues will step forward, as my \ncolleague, the Senator from Maine, has done already. We have 49 votes, \nladies and gentlemen, for McCain-Feingold. We need one more. Every \nDemocrat has signed onto this bipartisan legislation. We now have four \nRepublican Senators. We need one more. Who will it be? Who will step \nforward and say, ``This is the most important debate in American \nhistory and I want to be on the right side of history''? I hope we can \ncome up not only with that 50th vote, but with enough votes \nprocedurally to keep this issue alive. The rules of the Senate, like \ncloture and filibuster and the like, allow people who in the name of \ngood government, or whatever, can stop an issue in its tracks. I hope \nthat doesn't happen. I hope we can debate this to its conclusion and \nhave a real vote on real reform.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Steve \nDiamond, from my staff, be accorded privileges of the floor for the \nduration of this debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to seize \nthis opportunity to make much-needed changes in our campaign finance \nlaws by supporting the modified version of the McCain-Feingold \nlegislation. I am pleased, Mr. President, to be a cosponsor of this \nlandmark bill.\n  Shortly after becoming President of the United States, one of our \nformer Presidents was asked what his biggest surprise was on assuming \noffice. Without hesitation, he said it was his discovery that things \nwere actually as bad as he had been saying they were during the \ncampaign.\n  Mr. President, during my Senate campaign, I told the people of Maine \nthat our Nation's campaign finance system is broken. Since my election, \nI have spent a great deal of my time questioning witnesses at the \nhearings held by the Governmental Affairs Committee. Unlike the former \nPresident, what I have discovered is not that things are as bad as I \nhad been saying they were; it is that they are much worse.\n  The twin loopholes of soft money and bogus issue ads have virtually \nobliterated our campaign finance laws, leaving us with little more than \na pile of legal rubble. We supposedly have restrictions on how much \nindividuals can give to political parties; yet, Yogesh Gandhi is able \nto contribute $325,000 to the DNC to buy a picture with the President, \nand Roger Tamraz mockingly tells a committee of the U.S. Senate that \nnext time he will spend $600,000, rather than $300,000, to buy access \nto the White House. We supposedly prohibit corporations and unions from \nspending money on political campaigns; yet, the AFL-CIO spends $800,000 \nin Maine on so-called issue ads which anyone with an ounce of common \nsense recognized were designed to defeat a candidate for Congress.\n  We in this body decry legal loopholes, but we have reserved the \nlargest ones for ourselves. Indeed, these loopholes are more like black \nholes, and that sucking sound you hear during election years is the \nwhoosh of six-figure soft money donations rushing into party coffers.\n  Why should this matter, we are asked by those all too eager to equate \nfreedom of speech with freedom to spend? It should matter because \npolitical equality is the essence of democracy, and an electoral system \ndriven by big money is one lacking in political equality.\n  Mr. President, this is an issue of great concern to the people of my \nhome State. While there are differences in Maine on how the system \nshould be reformed--I, for one, do not believe that meaningful change \nrequires that we make taxpayers underwrite campaigns--there does seem \nto be a stronger consensus in Maine than elsewhere on the need for \nreform.\n\n  If my colleagues will indulge me a bit of home State pride, I think \nthe Maine perspective results from old fashioned Down East common \nsense. Maine people are able to see through the complexities of this \ndebate. They focus on what is at heart a very simple and yet very \nprofound problem. As long as we allow unlimited contributions--whether \nin the form of hard or soft money--we will not have political equality \nin this country.\n  It is not simply the lack of a level playing field for those seeking \npublic office. What is more important is the lack of a level playing \nfield for those seeking access to their government.\n  It strikes me that the Maine attitude may be shaped by the fact that \nmany communities in my State still hold town meetings. I am not talking \nabout the staged, televised town meeting which has become so \nfashionable of late. I am talking about a rough and tumble meeting held \nin the town office or the high school gym or the grange hall. Attend \none of these sessions and you will observe an element of true \ndemocracy: People with more money do not get to speak longer and louder \nthan people with less money. What is true at Maine town meetings is \nunfortunately not true in Washington.\n  Mr. President, let me address a very disquieting aspect of the debate \non the McCain-Feingold bill; namely, the misinformation that is being \nspread about what the bill would do. In that connection, I would \nemphasize that McCain-Feingold does not bar issue advocacy. I will say \nthat again because the legislation's opponents persist in misstating \nthis point--McCain-Feingold does not, and I emphasize not, bar issue \nadvocacy.\n  To explain this aspect of the bill in more detail, and to share with \nmy colleagues an experience that contributed to my becoming a \ncosponsor, I need to go back to the 1996 race for Maine's First \nCongressional District in the House of Representatives. In the course \nof that election, the AFL-CIO spent $800,000 to defeat the Republican \ncandidate. They did this by running a steady barrage of blatantly \nnegative ads.\n  Now why am I protesting a national union, using money from its \ngeneral treasury to run a saturation campaign of negative ads that may \nwell have decided a Maine congressional race? Whatever our objection to \nsuch ads, isn't that perfectly legal? The answer is, or at least is \nsupposed to be, no. Current law prohibits a union, as well as \na corporation, from spending money, other than through a PAC, to \ninfluence an election for a Federal office.\n\n  That leads to another obvious question--if current law forbids unions \nfrom using non-PAC money to run ads to influence a Federal election, \nhow was the AFL-CIO able to spend $800,000 to defeat a Republican \ncongressional candidate in Maine? Mr. President, that question takes us \nto the heart of the problem and to the need for McCain-Feingold.\n  Unfortunately, some courts have interpreted ``expressly advocating'' \nto require that the ad use words such as ``vote for'' or ``vote \nagainst'' or ``elect'' or ``defeat.'' If the ad avoids those magic \nwords and makes at least a passing reference to an issue, as the AFL-\nCIO did in Maine, those courts concluded that it does not expressly \nadvocate the election or defeat of a candidate, and the union may run \nit.\n  Mr. President, the situation I have described has led to the biggest \nsham in American politics. Nobody in Maine believed that the AFL-CIO's \nnegative ads were for any purpose other than the defeat of a candidate. \nIndeed, at least one newspaper which endorsed the Democratic candidate \nblasted the union ads against his opponent. Ads of that nature make an \nabsolute mockery out of the prohibition against unions and corporatings \nspending money on Federal elections.\n  The ``express advocacy'' provision in McCain-Feingold is designed to \ndo away with this sham. Contrary to what some have said, it would not \naffect independent ads financed other than by a union or corporation, \nexcept to enhance the reporting requirements, which everyone in this \nbody purports to favor. It also would not stop unions and corporations \nfrom running true issue ads.\n  Mr. President, I would say to my colleagues that if you believe, as I \ndo, that it continues to represent sound public policy to prohibit \nunions from using their vast general funds to dictate the results of \nFederal elections, particularly in small States like Maine, then you \nshould support McCain-Feingold.\n\n[[Page S10126]]\n\n  Mr. President, let me also take a minute to explain the bright line \ntest for express advocacy that has been the subject of ill-informed \ncriticism during this debate. What that test would provide is that any \ntelevision ad that clearly identifies a candidate and that is run \nwithin 60 days of an election would be deemed express advocacy.\n  I view the bright line test as a key provision of McCain-Feingold, \nand I support its inclusion for two reasons. First, the courts have \nsaid that for constitutional purposes, people must clearly know what \nthey can and cannot do, something which the bright line test gives \nthem.\n  Second, and contrary to what some opponents of the bill have said, \nthe bright line test lessens the power of the Federal Election \nCommission. By having a clear standard, rather than one which requires \na case-by-case analysis, the regulatory agency has less discretion to \ndetermine what the law should be and when actions should be brought. \nThus, those who have argued both against the test and against a greater \nrole for the FEC are in reality arguing with themselves.\n  Mr. President, this subject is more complex than any of us would \nlike, but behind the complexity is a simple proposition. Current law \nhas given rise to the widespread practice of running bogus issue ads, \nand that should not be allowed to continue. Those Members of this body \nwho support the prohibition against unions and corporations using their \nvast resources to dictate the results of Federal elections should vote \nfor McCain-Feingold. Those Members who do not support the prohibition \nshould take the honest road and work for its repeal. The one \nunacceptable course is to perpetuate a sham that undermines the \nintegrity of our election laws.\n  I look forward to debating this issue in the days ahead.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me congratulate the Senators from \nArizona, Wisconsin, Maine, and other Senators who have joined so \nstrongly in this effort--an important bipartisan effort--to finally \nreform the campaign finance laws. The system is terribly broken. I \nthink most of us know that, and I hope enough of us will get together \nto really reform it properly.\n  The time has finally come for Congress to decide whether we are going \nto fix this system, which is in shambles, and fix the laws that are now \ndoing so much damage to public confidence in our governmental \noperations. These laws are now so full of loopholes that what was \nintended to be limits on campaign contributions in effect are easily \nevaded. And if we are going to close those loopholes we must do it \ntogether. This will not happen if Democrats and Republicans do not come \ntogether. It is going to require that kind of a bipartisan effort if we \nare going to restore public confidence in this campaign finance system.\n  For the past couple of months, members of the Senate Governmental \nAffairs Committee have sat through hours and days of hearings on the \nfailings of our campaign finance laws. We have asked dozens of \nwitnesses hundreds of questions on the problems of the 1996 elections.\n  My constituents are asking me just one question. ``Are you going to \ndo something about it?'' That is what they want to know. They have \nheard our questions. They have heard the answers. They know we have \nobserved the witnesses. They have seen and heard the debate. And, of \ncourse, the majority who have not been able to watch the hearings \npersonally know that the campaign finance system is a subject of great \ndebate.\n  Yet the question I get wherever I go is, ``Are you going to do \nsomething about it?'' It is a simple question. It is a direct question. \nMy answer is, ``I hope so, and I am sure going to do everything I can \nto see that we finally do in fact close the loopholes that have made a \nshambles of the laws that are supposed to set limits on how much money \ncould be contributed by individuals to our campaigns.''\n  The Senate hearings have focused much of their time on allegations of \nillegal conduct in the 1996 elections. But the vast majority of what \nthe public doesn't like is not what is illegal, although they surely \ndon't like that. It is what is legal. Most of it involves the so-called \nsoft money or unregulated money because both parties have gotten around \nthe law of the 1970's by establishing a whole separate world of \ncampaign finance. That is the world of so-called soft money--\ncontributions that are not technically covered by the limits under \ncurrent law.\n  In the 1996 election, the Republican Party raised more than $140 \nmillion in soft money. The Democrats raised over $120 million.\n  That is how we get to these enormous sums of money in the last \ncampaign, like the $1.3 million to the Republican National Committee \nfrom just one company in 1996 and a $450,000 contribution from just one \ncouple to the Democratic National Committee the same year.\n  Once that soft money loophole was opened and once that loophole was \nviewed as being legal, the money chase was on, and that chase has been \ncarried on by both parties. When you couple that with the high cost of \ntelevision advertising, you have the money chase involving just about \nall candidates. The chase for money has led most of us in public office \nor seeking public office to push the envelope and to take the law to \nthe limits in order to get the necessary contributions. The money chase \npressures political supporters to cross lines that they should not in \norder to help their candidates get needed funds. The money chase in \npolitical campaigns is a serious disease and it has become chronic. \nMost of us have been affected by it. Most of us have spent too much \ntime fundraising and in the process pushing the fundraising rules to \ntheir limits. We know in our hearts that the money chase is a \nbipartisan problem and that bipartisan reform is the right way to go.\n  If the Senate hearings have exposed illegal practices that would \notherwise go unpunished, that is useful. If the hearings have also \nexposed activities that are currently allowed but which should not be, \nand if that arouses public opinion so that Congress will end the money \nhunt, that would be a major contribution. But if those hearings leave \nno solid record of legislative reform behind, we will have done \nsomething far worse than missing an opportunity. We will be deepening \npublic pessimism and thickening the public gloom about this democracy's \nability to restore public confidence in the financing of our campaigns \nand our elections. And that is why I believe the enactment of major \ncampaign finance reform is so critical. Existing law says that \nindividuals cannot contribute more than $1,000 now to any candidate or \npolitical committee with respect to any election for Federal office. \nExisting law says that corporations and unions can't contribute at all \nto those candidates. And Presidential campaigns are supposed to be \nfinanced with public funds. That is the law on the books today. And yet \nwe have all heard stories of contributions of hundreds of thousands of \ndollars from individuals, from corporations and from unions--Roger \nTamraz giving $300,000 to Democrats. What happened to the $1,000 \ncontribution limit?\n  Here is a Democratic National Committee document relative to DNC \ntrustees. These are major contributors, I think $100,000, and they're \noffered various events to attend if they make that large contribution. \nWhat are the events? The events are two annual trustee events with the \nPresident in Washington. That is just an offer of access for \ncontributions. But these are not the contributions that the law is \nsupposed to limit to $1,000 for each candidates. These are $100,000 \ncontributions. These are the soft money contributions. And these are \nthe connections to access. Both parties do it.\n  Here is the 1997 RNC Annual Gala, May 13, 1997. Right in the middle \nof all of this angst, all of this concern about big money and access, \nit has this dinner. It is open, nothing hidden about this. Cochairman \nof the Republican National Committee Annual Gala, $250,000 fundraising \ngoal.\n  What do you do? You sell or purchase, sell or purchase, Team 100 \nmemberships or Republican Eagle memberships. That's $100,000 I believe \nfor Team 100. And what do you get? You get, among other things, \nluncheon with the Republican Senate and House committee chairman of \nyour choice. It is the open offer of access in exchange for a\n\n[[Page S10127]]\n\ncontribution, and the contribution is soft money. It is not the $1,000 \ncontribution to come to a dinner. It is give or raise $250,000 and you \nget lunch with the committee chairman of your choice. It is like the \nDemocratic National Committee offer, give $100,000 and you get two \nreceptions with the President.\n  Now, one of the ways we are going to stop this abhorrent offer of \nsale of access in exchange for contributions is if we get to the soft \nmoney loophole it is the most direct way to get to it. Here are some \nother examples, recent examples of soft money. This is, I believe, a \nTeam 100 document, a Republican document called hot prospects. Who is \nthe third prospect? Some retired inventor. And here is what the \ndocument says.\n\n       We are working on getting him an appointment with Dick \n     Armey so we can get his other $50,000.\n\n  These are documents which came up in our investigation, in our \nhearings. We can get his other $50,000 if we can get him an appointment \nwith Dick Armey. The public sees that and they respond the way I \nrespond. That is abhorrent. What are we doing, offering access in \nexchange for a contribution? And the amount of money here is abhorrent. \n``His other $50,000.'' That means he has already given $50,000. Here is \na total of $100,000. What happened to the $1,000 limit?\n  We thought there was a law. The problem is that in the race to \ncompete and to win in our Federal elections, candidates and parties \nhave found a way around the law. And that is the soft money loophole. \nHard money, the contributions which are regulated by campaign finance \nlaws, is, indeed, hard money. It is harder to come by. So soft money is \neasier to raise. You can get $100,000 or $500,000 from just one \ncorporation or individual. You don't have to go to 500 different people \nand raise $1,000, and you don't have to go to 5,000 people and raise \n$100 the way you do with hard money. You can just find one person, one \ncorporation wealthy enough or willing enough to pay a half-million \ndollars and then you accept that contribution.\n  Now, there is another part of the current law which says if you spend \nmoney in an election in support of a candidate or opposed to a \ncandidate, you have to spend money that is only raised the hard way, \nfollowing the limit. But one of the greatest areas of abuse in the 1996 \nelection was the use of hundreds of millions of dollars of unregulated, \nunlimited, and undisclosed money to broadcast so-called issue ads just \nbefore an election--ads that any reasonable viewer would interpret as \nattacking or supporting a particular candidate.\n  Here is an example of one of these so-called issue ads. This was an \nad that was run against Congressman Cal Dooley in California. This ad \nwas paid for with unregulated, unlimited dollars. It read as follows:\n\n       Congressman Cal Dooley makes choices for you and your \n     family.\n       Cal Dooley said ``no'' to increased money for federal \n     prisons. Instead, Dooley gave money to lawyers. Lawyers that \n     used taxpayer's money to sue on behalf of prison inmates and \n     illegal aliens.\n       Cal Dooley said ``no'' to increased money for drug \n     enforcement. Instead, Dooley gave your money to radical \n     lawyers who represented drug dealers.\n       Is Cal Dooley making the right choices for you?\n\n  That is a so-called issue ad, at least it was called, because it \ndidn't use the magic words ``vote for,'' ``vote against,'' ``elect,'' \n``defeat.''\n  And that is paid for with unlimited dollars. But here is the same ad \nwith one of the magic words:\n\n       Congressman Cal Dooley makes choices for you and your \n     family.\n       Cal Dooley said ``no'' to increased money for Federal \n     prisons. Instead, Dooley gave the money to lawyers that used \n     taxpayer's money to sue on behalf of prison inmates and \n     illegal aliens.\n       Cal Dooley said ``no'' to increased money for drug \n     enforcement. Instead, Dooley gave your money to radical \n     lawyers who represented drug dealers.\n       Is Cal Dooley making the right choices for you?\n\n  That is the exact same ad except in this version I have added the \nfollowing words: ``Defeat Cal Dooley.''\n\n  All of a sudden the same ad becomes an ad which under the current \napproach of some has to be paid for in hard dollars. If you put that ad \non and then comply with the election limits, you could go to jail. But \nif you put the first ad on and just said, ``Is Cal Dooley making the \nright choices for you?'' You can put on millions of dollars of \nadvertising. No one knows where it is coming from, no restrictions, the \nexact same ad with the same effect except for one word.\n  Now, any viewer looking at that ad is going to say that both ads have \nthe same effect. They are both attack ads. They are both attacking a \ncandidate. And yet one of those ads, if paid for with dollars that are \nsupposed to be limited but weren't, could actually put the person who \nput that ad on either in jail or given a fine. The other ad, unlimited \nsoft money.\n  In the real world, there is no difference between those ads. The \nSupreme Court has ruled that the second ad, with the word ``defeat,'' \nmust be paid for with limited dollars. This is a candidate advocacy ad, \nand that is what the Supreme Court has ruled. It is said that we can \nrequire that ads which explicitly call for the election or defeat of a \ncandidate must be paid for in limited dollars. But the first ad which I \nhave put up is the functional equivalent of the second ad. It is the \napparent equivalent of the second ad. It is the real world equivalent \nof the second ad.\n  This bill, which has been introduced today, would treat these two ads \nthe same legally because they have the same apparent effect, the same \nfunctional effect, the same real world effect, the same practical \neffect. There is no difference between those ads except for one word. \nAnd to our constituents there is no difference when they see those two \nads.\n  We believe that the Supreme Court, because we maintain a bright-line \ntest, will permit this law to stand. That is our hope, and that is our \nbelief. It is based on the real world, the real world of our \nconstituents who, when they see those two ads I have just read, see and \nhear no difference between them because they know that the first ad is \nan ad that is attacking a candidate just the way the second ad does and \nthere is no real world difference between those two ads.\n  Now, we intended corporations and unions not be allowed to contribute \nto candidates. That is the intention of the current law. Corporations \nare not supposed to contribute except through political action \ncommittees. Unions are not supposed to contribute except through very \nlimited means.\n  How is it then that, for instance, corporations contribute millions \nof dollars? The same thing can be said for unions--millions of dollars \nto these campaigns which do not comply with the current law? Congress \nis permitted to restrict the contributions of corporations and unions. \nThat was a decision in the Austin case where Justice Thurgood Marshall \nsaid that ``we, therefore, have recognized the compelling governmental \ninterest in preventing corruption supports the restriction of the \ninfluence of political war chests funded through the corporate form.''\n  Justice Marshall said, speaking for the Court, ``Regardless of \nwhether this danger of financial quid pro quo corruption may be \nsufficient to justify a restriction on independent expenditures, \nMichigan's regulation,'' which was the regulation on corporate \ncontributions at issue, ``aims at a different type of corruption in the \npolitical arena, the corrosive and distorting effects of immense \naggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the help of the \ncorporate form and have little or no correlation to the public support \nfor the corporation's political ideas.''\n  And then he went on:\n\n       Corporate wealth can unfairly influence elections when it \n     is deployed in the form of independent expenditures just as \n     it can when it assumes the guise of political contribution.\n\n  We intended to restrict corporate contributions to candidates. We \nintended, in our law, to say that corporations cannot contribute to \ncandidates at all except through the very strict rules for political \naction committees. Yet we have corporations and unions, both, \ncontributing millions of dollars that effectively get involved in \ncampaigns and effectively go to either help candidates or hurt \ncandidates. It is that same soft money loophole that allows the \nfrustration of congressional intent.\n  Our intent was clear. The Supreme Court has held that our intent is \nlegitimate; that where there is an express\n\n[[Page S10128]]\n\nadvocacy in a campaign for the defeat or the election of a candidate, \nthat we are right, we are permitted, it is allowed for Congress to \nrestrict those kinds of contributions. That effort on the part of \nCongress over 20 years ago to restrict corporate and union \ncontributions has also been frustrated by the soft money loophole. We \nare determined to close that loophole. We are also determined to make \nit very clear that advertisements, which are functionally the same, \nthat have the exact same effect on the effort to defeat or elect a \ncandidate, be treated the same. That is part of this bill, the so-\ncalled independent expenditure part, or issue advocacy part. We simply \nare adopting another very bright bright-line test.\n  The Supreme Court did not say it was the only bright-line test. The \nSupreme Court said that a bright-line test was necessary, relative to \nsatisfactory compliance with the first amendment. And it gave an \nexample of a bright-line test, an example which was realistic in the \nworld of the 1970's. But another bright-line test is necessary now \nbecause the first test that we adopted, that the Supreme Court used as \nan example, has been evaded. And the rules that were permitted by the \nSupreme Court to apply, the law which the Supreme Court said was \nappropriate to enact relative to advocacy--to the election or defeat of \na candidate--that has been frustrated, it has been evaded, and we are \nnow simply trying to implement it in another way which is fully \ncompliant, we believe, with the first amendment.\n  There has been a new study by the Annenberg Public Policy Center, \nwhich estimates that during the 1996 election cycle, as much as $150 \nmillion was spent on so-called issue ads by political parties and \ngroups other than candidates. Their research shows that half of those \nads favored Democrats and half favored Republicans. It found that \nnearly 90 percent mentioned a candidate by name and, compared to other \ntypes of political advertising, these so-called issue ads were the \nhighest in pure attack.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the Annenberg \nCenter study be inserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Annenberg Public Policy Center Analysis of Broadcast Issue Advocacy \n                          Ads, September 1997\n\n       A national survey of 1,026 registered voters commissioned \n     by the Annenberg Public Policy Center shortly after election \n     day showed that a majority of voters (57.6%) recalled seeing \n     an issue advertisement during the 1996 campaign. When \n     compared to other political communications, using data \n     collected from the same national survey viewership of issue \n     advertisements ranked below that of presidential candidate-\n     sponsored advertising and debates. More voters recalled \n     seeing issue advertisements than recalled watching at least \n     one of the short speeches delivered by President Clinton and \n     Robert Dole using free air time donated by broadcast \n     networks.\n       The Annenberg Public Policy Center has compiled an archive \n     of 107 issue advocacy advertisements that aired on television \n     or radio during the 1996 election cycle. These ads were \n     sponsored by 27 separate organizations. Data about the \n     content of these advertisements are summarized below. The \n     following figures are percentages of produced advertisements, \n     which do not take into account differential airing and reach \n     of the ads. In addition, although the Center's archive does \n     include independent expenditure advertisements aired by \n     parties and advocacy organizations, only the issue ads are \n     included in this analysis.\n       As noted earlier, issue advertisements are those that do \n     not expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate. \n     If the ads do not call for viewers or listeners to cast a \n     vote in a particular manner, what action do they call for? In \n     many cases, the advertisement makes no call to action at all. \n     Our analysis shows that one-quarter of issue ads (25.2%) \n     contained no action step. Of those issue ads produced in 1996 \n     that did solicit some actions on the part of the audience, \n     the greatest proportion asked voters to ``call'' a public \n     official or candidate (37.4%). Some asked individuals to \n     ``tell'' or ``let a public official know'' one's support for \n     or disapproval of particular policy positions (16.8%), while \n     others asked that a call be placed directly to the advocacy \n     organization sponsoring the ad (15.9%). A few of the \n     advertisements called for support or opposition to pending \n     legislation (4.7%).\n       Despite the presence of clear calls to action, many \n     advertisements did not provide information, such as a phone \n     number or address, to enable the individual to carry out the \n     action. One in three (31.3%) issue ads that suggest action \n     did not provide sufficient actionable information.\n       During the 1996 election cycle, it was the norm for issue \n     advertisements to refer to public officials or candidates for \n     office by name. Early nine in ten did so. It was also common \n     for television issue advertisements to picture officials and \n     candidates:\n       Both ends of the political spectrum were represented in \n     issue advertising campaigns. Based on the number of \n     advertisements produced, ads generally supportive of \n     Democratic positions and those generally aligned with \n     Republican positions were evenly split. Each accounted for \n     48.6% of the total. A few advertisements (2.8%), on term \n     limits and flag burning, were not categorized as Democratic \n     or Republican.\n       While issue advertising echoed many dominant campaign \n     themes, it also raised issues not addressed by the major \n     party presidential candidates. For instance, abortion, gay \n     rights, pension security, product liability reform, and term \n     limits were among the topics that appeared in issue advocacy \n     advertising, but were largely absent from the policy debate \n     among the presidential candidates.\n       Medicare was the topic most frequently mentioned in the \n     issue advocacy advertising of 1996. One in four advocacy ads \n     (24.3%) mentioned the issue.\n       Consistent with prior Annenberg Public Policy Center \n     research on the discourse of political campaigns, we divided \n     issue advertisements into their central arguments. Arguments \n     were categorized as advocacy (a case made only for the \n     position supported by the ad's sponsor), pure attack (a case \n     made only against the opposing position), and comparison (an \n     argument that pairs a case against the opposition with a case \n     for the sponsor's position). Comparison is considered \n     preferable to pure attack because it allows evaluation of \n     alternative positions. Pure attack contributes to the \n     negative tone of political campaigns.\n       Compared to other discursive forms, including presidential \n     candidate ads, debates, free time speeches and news coverage \n     of the campaign (both television and print), issue \n     advertisements aired in 1996 were the highest in pure attack. \n     Two in five arguments in issue ads attacked.\n       Arguments in issue ads were less likely to compare \n     positions than debates, free time speeches, and ads sponsored \n     by the presidential candidates.\n       Because pure attack and comparison accounted for 81.3% of \n     the arguments, so-called ``advocacy ads'' rarely simply \n     advocated their own position. Pure advocacy appeared in fewer \n     than one in five of the ads (18.7%).\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. So the result is now a vicious combination, outside of the \nlimits of our campaign finance laws, of, one, huge amounts of money; \ntwo, funding the worst type of campaign attack ads. And the net result \nis that the exceptions to our campaign finance laws have swallowed the \nrules. The rules basically no longer exist. It is up to this body and \nto the House to restore limits--restore some fences around \ncontributions so what we intended to do, and the portion of what we did \nthat was affirmed by the Supreme Court in the Buckley case, can be \noperative in the real political world that we operate in.\n  It is a daunting task to plug these loopholes, to make the law whole \nagain--to make it whole, to make it effective. If we don't do this, if \nwe do not act on a bipartisan basis and adopt real campaign reform, and \nif we do not make real what Congress intended to do 20 years ago, and \nwhich the Supreme Court has said we can do, where the advocacy of the \nelection or defeat of a candidate is involved--we are allowed to act \nrelative to campaign contributions. We know that. We were told that in \nBuckley. Providing our aim is at those contributions which go to the \neffort to elect or defeat a candidate, we are permitted to act \nproviding we act in a way which is clear and has a bright line, and \nwhich is aimed at a problem, a societal problem which we identify. \nClean elections are something that we are allowed to seek to achieve. \nWe are allowed to seek to achieve the reduction of the impact of \naggregated money by corporations and power by corporations and unions. \nThat has been permitted by the Supreme Court. It is up to us, now, to \nfashion a bill which complies with those standards and we believe this \nbill does.\n  If we do not do it, if we do not put a stop to the money chase and \nthe attack ads that are overwhelming the system and disgusting the \nAmerican people, we will let down our constituents. Marlin Fitzwater, \nwho was the press secretary for President Bush, made this statement in \nApril 1992. He made this statement following a dinner for President \nBush, at which the major contributors, soft money contributors, were \noffered access, private receptions with the President in the White \nHouse. It was a very open offer of access in exchange for major \ncontributions, contributions of soft money. This is what Marlin\n\n[[Page S10129]]\n\nFitzwater said very openly and honestly in April 1992, following that \ndinner: ``It buys access to the system, yes. That's what the political \nparties and the political operation is all about.''\n  He spoke the truth. He spoke the tragic truth that buying access to \nthe system is what the political operation is all about and, too often, \nwhat the political parties are all about. We have to change that. We \nhave to restore to the political process what the political parties and \nthe political operations should be all about, which is listening to \npeople, communicating with people, organizing people, grassroots \neffort--yes, raising contributions in small amounts, limited amounts as \nwe intended to do in the 1970's when we passed that law. That is what \nthe political operation and the political parties should be all about.\n  But whether or not they are going to, again, be about that instead of \nabout raising $50,000 and $100,000 and $250,000 and $1 million in soft \nmoney, which is spent in the functionally equivalent way--the same way, \napparently, as the so-called hard money--whether we are going to be \nable to do that is going to be dependent on whether or not we can pull \ntogether Democrats and Republicans as Americans, realize that we have a \nsick system of campaign finance raising and money raising, and change \nit--close the loopholes, respond to the demand of the American people \nthat the money chase and the excessive contributions and the attack ads \nend.\n  In the next week or two, that is a decision we are going to make. I \nbelieve the majority of the Senate will support significant reforms and \nthe President has said he will work for the passage of McCain-Feingold \nand will sign it with enthusiasm. The time for waiting while we \ndocument further campaign abuses that we all know exist is over. The \ntime for ending those abuses is here.\n  I want to close by again commending the sponsors of the bill for \ntheir steadfast efforts and their commitment to campaign finance \nreform. It is a privilege to be part of their cause.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a number of documents be printed in the \nRecord including the campaign television advertisements that were \ninvolved in the Cal Dooley campaign and in the Bill Yellowtail \ncampaign. I ask unanimous consent they be printed in the Record at this \ntime.

Mr. President, I think, with some research by some very \nexcellent staff members, we may have a basis for an agreement here. I \nreally believe we have a very strong chance, because I think we can \nuse, to a large degree, as a basis for our negotiations, not so much \nthe McCain-Feingold bill but the bill that was introduced as S. 7 by \nSenator Robert Dole and Senator McConnell on January 31, 1993.\n  This was S. 7, remembering in those days on this side of the aisle \nthe Republicans were in the minority, so the majority had the first \nfive bills and the minority, the Republicans, had the next five. This \nis S. 7, so I don't know what 6 was, but this was the second one.\n  I want to talk about this a little bit because I think it is \nimportant. This is a bill that Senator McConnell introduced and spoke \non with Senator Dole. I think it is very important. The bill was \nintroduced in the Senate on Thursday, January 21, 1993 by Senator \nRobert Dole. At the present time there are 24 cosponsors of the bill--\n24 Republicans. Let me tell you the cosponsors of this bill. They were \nBurns, Chafee, Coverdell, Craig, D'Amato, Domenici, Durenberger, \nGorton, Grassley, Gregg, Hatch, Hatfield, Kempthorne, Lott, Lugar, \nMcCain, McConnell, Murkowski, Nickles, Packwood, Roth, Simpson, \nStevens, Thurmond.\n  So, most of the present leadership of the Republican side was \nrepresented as cosponsors of this bill. Of course Senator Lott, Senator \nCoverdell, Senator Nickles, the whip, Senator Craig, and of course \nSenator McConnell.\n  The bill says: Deal with campaign finance reform. Let me read very \nquickly from Senator McConnell's remarks.\n\n       Mr. President, in 1992, voter turnout increased, electoral \n     competition increased, campaign spending increased. Most \n     objective observers of the political system . . ..\n       Mr. President, Democratic campaign finance bills based on \n     spending limits and taxpayer financing do, indeed, constitute \n     change. They do not, however, reform. They do not improve the \n     electoral process.\n\n  Quoting from Senator McConnell:\n\n       The Democratic bills we have seen in the past were good \n     public relations . . .. Spending limits were totally \n     discredited in the presented system . . .. Mandatory spending \n     limits are unconstitutional . . .. Taxpayer funding of the \n     Congressional campaign system to provide inducements or \n     penalties is not palatable.\n\n  Then he goes on and says:\n\n       Republicans will not stand by while the first amendment is \n     sacrificed for a facade of reform. Campaign finance reform \n     need not be unconstitutional, partisan, bureaucratic or \n     taxpayer funded. The minority leader and I, joined by \n     Republican colleagues, have today introduced the \n     Comprehensive Campaign Finance Reform Act, the most extensive \n     and effective reform bill before this Congress bar none. It \n     bans PAC's, the epitome of special interest influence and a \n     major incumbent protection tool. Our bill bans soft money, \n     all soft money, party, labor, and that spent by tax-exempt \n     organizations. It cuts campaign costs, provides seed money to \n     challengers paid for, not by taxpayers, but by the political \n     parties. It constricts the millionaires' loophole, [which, by \n     the way, happens to be a part of the revised package we have, \n     I am sure by coincidence] restricts and regulates independent \n     expenditures, fights election fraud, and restricts \n     gerrymandering.\n       Real reform: In stark contrast to the Democrats' bill, the \n     Republican bill puts all the campaign money on top of the \n     table where voters can see it. Nothing would have a more \n     cleansing effect on the electoral process.\n\n  Then:\n\n       The text of the bill eliminates all special interest \n     political action committees, corporate, union, and trade \n     association, also bans all non-connected or ideological PAC's \n     and all leadership PAC's.\n       Note, if a ban on non-connected PAC's is determine to be \n     unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, the legislation will \n     subject nonconnected PAC's to a $1,000 per election \n     contribution limit.\n\n  I could not agree more with Senator McConnell's position on that.\n  Soft money ban: Bans all soft money from being used to influence a \nFederal election. Soft money is defined as the ``raising and spending \nof political money outside of the source restrictions, contribution \nlimits and disclosure requirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act \nand its regulations.''\n  So we are in complete agreement with Senator McConnell on that.\n  Establishes new rules for political party committees to ensure that \nsoft money is not used to influence Federal elections, including the \nrequirement that national, State, and local political parties establish \na separate account for activities benefiting Federal candidates and a \nseparate account for activities benefiting State candidates.\n  Requirement of full disclosure of all accounts by any political party \ncommittee that maintains a Federal account, and the establishment of \nminimum percentages of Federal funds which must be used for any party \nbuilding program, voter registration, get out the vote, absentee \nballots, ballot security which benefits both Federal and State \ncandidates.\n  Exempts certain organizational activities, as ours does--research, \nget out the vote, voter registration--from coordinated or other \nlimitations.\n  Requires disclosures and allocation for these activities and retains \nthe same coordinated expenditure limits for media expenditures.\n  Maintains the limit on total contributions of Federal party accounts \nat $20,000; limits to $50,000 per calendar year the total amount of \ncontributions an individual or other entity may make to national, \nState, or local party accounts combined.\n  Labor and soft money employee protection: Codifies the Supreme Court \ndecision in Beck versus Communications Workers of America and provides \ncertain rights for employees who are union members.\n  Soft money restrictions: Prohibits tax-exempt 501(c) organizations \nfrom engaging in any activity which attempts to influence a Federal \nelection on behalf of a specific candidate for public office.\n  Extends to all 501(c) organizations the current prohibition on \ncampaign activity which applies to 501(c) charities.\n  Restricts tax-exempt organizations from engaging in voter \nregistration or get-out-the-vote activities which are not candidate-\nspecific if a candidate or Member of Congress solicits money for the \norganization.\n  Restricts Federal activities by State PAC's created by Members of \nCongress.\n  Reduces from $1,000 to $500 the maximum allowable contributions by \nindividuals residing outside a candidate's State, an interesting take \non the influence of outside money.\n  Indexes the individual contribution limit, $1,000 per election for \nin-State contributions or $500 per election to out of State.\n  Congressional candidates using Consumer Price Index, something that I \nthink could be very well discussed.\n  Prohibits bundling, which I think is a very laudable goal, and then \nit talks about independent expenditures.\n  Requires all independently financed political communications to \ndisclose the person or organization financing it. That is very \ninteresting. I wonder how the Christian Coalition and the right to life \nand other organizations would feel about requiring all independently \nfinanced political communications to disclose the person or \norganization financing it. When Senator Feingold and I floated that \nproposal, it met with a pretty strong opposition from both sides. This \nis a proposal that, obviously, as I have said many times, Senator \nMcConnell made around 4 years ago; requires that that disclosure be \ncomplete and conspicuous.\n\n  Requires timely notice to all candidates of the communications \nplacement and content.\n  Defines independent expenditure to prohibit consultation with a \ncandidate or his agents.\n  Requires the FCC to hold a hearing within 3 days of any formal \ncomplaint of collusion between an independent expenditure committee and \na candidate.\n  I must say, Mr. President, if, in the last election campaign, that \nprovision requiring the FCC to hold a hearing within 3 days of any \nformal complaint of collusion between an independent expenditure \ncommittee and a candidate had been the law of the land, they would have \nbeen holding hearings 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n  Creates an expedited cause of action in Federal courts for a \ncandidate seeking relief from expenditures which are not independent.\n  Allows for a broadcast discount in the last 45 days before a primary \nand the last 60 days before a general election.\n  Permits challenger seed money, which I think is a laudable goal, and\n\n[[Page S10131]]\n\naddresses a problem that we have had with giving a challenger a level \nplaying field.\n  Requires congressional candidates to declare upon filing for an \nelection where they intend to spend alone over $250,000 in personal \nfunds in a race and raises the individual contribution limit to $5,000 \nper election, from $1,000 for all opponents of a candidate who declare \nsuch an intention.\n  No limits would apply to individual contributions by party, et \ncetera.\n  Then there is a very interesting one, franked mail. Prohibits franked \nmass mailings during the election year of a Member of Congress and \nrequires more disclosure of the use of franked mail for unsolicited \nmailings.\n  Our proposal, as we know, is to cut off the name and face being \nmentioned in drawing a bright line. I have 60 days. Senator McConnell's \n1993 proposal prohibited franked mass mailings during the entire \nelection year.\n  It goes into gerrymandering and goes into enhanced FEC enforcement. I \nheard my colleague from Utah complaining long and loud about any \npossibility of enhanced FEC enforcement. By the way, my colleague from \nUtah was not here in 1993, so I kind of doubt that he would have \ncosponsored this bill, as did 24 Republicans.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I guess what I am saying is that we had a very good bill \nin 1993--a very good bill--and one that I was proud to cosponsor, along \nwith Senator Dole and Senator McConnell and 24 of our Republican \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a \nclarification?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I was here in 1993, and I think I probably did cosponsor \nthat. The Senator is making a good case that I probably made a mistake.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Thank you. I appreciate the correction from the Senator \nfrom Utah.\n  That entire list of 24 Republican cosponsors of S. 7, as I mentioned, \nare Burns, Chafee, Coverdell, Craig, D'Amato, Domenici, Durenberger, \nGorton, Grassley, Gregg, Hatch, Hatfield, Kempthorne, Lott, Lugar, \nMcCain, McConnell, Murkowski, Nickles, Packwood, Roth, Simpson, \nStevens, and Thurmond.\n  Mr. President, I haven't had a chance to examine all the details of \nthe proposal that Senator McConnell's and Senator Dole's S. 7 had, and \nI believe that there are probably some differences, but I will argue \nvery strongly that we have the basis for negotiations and possible \nagreement based on S. 7.\n  My understanding is that there is not the independent campaign bright \nline. That actually, as my colleagues know, was an idea that Mr. Norm \nOrnstein and Mr. Mann and Mr. Trevor Potter, Professor Potter, came up \nwith as a way of trying to get about the issue of the independent \ncampaigns which we all know are out of control and they are all \nnegative campaigns.\n  I was, frankly, encouraged to see that Senator McConnell had proposed \nsuch a comprehensive way of reforming the campaign system as far back \nas 1993, obviously displaying a degree of clairvoyance that I didn't \nhave at the time. So I hope we can go back to that.\n  Mr. President, I just want to end up--and I know Senator McConnell \nwants to respond to that--there is a book that Brooks Jackson wrote \ncalled ``Honest Graft: Big Money in the American Political Process.'' \nThis book is somewhat dated. It was published in 1990. A lot of things \nhave happened since then. Some things haven't happened. Some things \nhaven't changed, they have just gotten worse.\n  Let me quote from a chapter in his book, and I will be brief:\n\n       Nearly everyone complains that something is wrong with the \n     American political system. Liberals see a Congress bought by \n     business interests, while PAC managers complain they are \n     being shaken down by money-hungry legislators. Lawmakers \n     detest the rising cost of campaigning, the inconvenience and \n     indignity of asking for money, and the criticism they endure \n     for accepting it. Democrats envy the Republican Party's \n     financial strength and decry the sinister influence of big \n     money and expensive political technology while trying to get \n     as much of both for themselves as possible. Republicans, \n     portrayed by the business PACs they nourished, seethe at \n     their inability to dislodge Democratic incumbents. Critics of \n     various leanings deplore lawmakers who use their office to \n     help themselves or moneyed benefactors. Liberal and \n     conservative commentators alike call the system ``corrupt.''\n       The problem isn't corruption; it is more serious than that. \n     If unprincipled buying and selling of official favors was at \n     fault then the solution would be simple. Honest legislators \n     would refuse to participate, and prosecutors or voters would \n     deal with the rest. To be sure, corruption does exist; it is \n     hard to imagine any other community of 535 souls where \n     felonies are so often proven. But those illegalities are only \n     symptoms of the underlying sickness.\n       The true predicament is that perverse incentives twist the \n     behavior of ordinary legislators. The system of money-based \n     elections and lobbying rewards those who cater to well-funded \n     interests, both by keeping them in office and by allowing men \n     like Ferdinand St. Germain to enrich themselves while they \n     serve. It also punishes those who challenge the status quo, \n     as D. G. Martin discovered. And it bends even the best of \n     intentions, like Tony Coelho's priestly instincts, toward the \n     courtship of moneyed cliques. As Coelho himself says, ``the \n     process buys you out.'' The system doesn't require bad \n     motives to produce bad Government.\n       America is becoming a special-interest nation where money \n     is displacing votes. Congress commands less and less support \n     among the electorate as it panders increasingly to groups \n     with money, yet its members cling to office like barnacles on \n     a hull of a broken-down steamer.\n\n  Mr. President, I would not use those words myself. I think they are \nstrong words. I do respect Brooks Jackson a great deal. He is one of \nthe foremost authorities on campaign finance reform. But if that was \nthe case, if that was the view of one of the most respected \ncommentators in 1990, can you imagine what the view of many of them are \ntoday?\n  Again, I want to say that I hope we can sit down and have some \nserious negotiations. I would, to a large degree, move to S. 7 as a \nbasis for a lot of those negotiations. Maybe we can get Senator Dole \nback, most respected by all of us, and see if Senator Dole--I believe \nhe still supports many of those principles. We could all sit down \ntogether.\n  If I can very seriously say, I hope that we can understand that what \nthe American people want is not a filibuster and not a gridlock, not a \nfilibuster by Republicans, not a filibuster by Democrats, but we have \nshown certainly this year what we are capable of doing when we sat down \non both sides of the aisle and put the Nation on a path toward a \nbalanced budget; when we sat down, Republicans and Democrats alike, \ntrading off, as is necessary, to reach a goal of giving the American \npeople their first tax cuts in 16 years.\n  I believe we can do that if there is a willingness to do so, and I, \nfor one, believe that the majority of my colleagues would agree that \nthere are some things that are fundamentally wrong with this system. If \nthe majority of my colleagues agree with that, then it seems to me we \nshould be able to reach some kind of agreement on how we can reform \nthat system.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am sure my good friend and colleague \nfrom Arizona will agree that politics is a team sport. In order to be \neffective, we have to have allies. The bill he went back 4 years to had \n24 cosponsors. I can assure my friend from Arizona, it had a good idea \nfrom all 24. Legislation is, someone said, sort of like making sausage: \na little bit of this and a little bit of that.\n  I confess to having joined in cosponsoring a bill with a whole lot of \nthings that my friend from Arizona will surely remember that I have \nconsistently argued against for 10 years. But the feeling was, and he \nremembers it because he cosponsored the bill, that we needed to have a \nRepublican alternative. And in the spirit of being a part of the team, \nI put my name on a bill. I am sure the Senator from Arizona has never \nput his name on a bill with which he disagreed with any part. In fact, \nhe said here today he is not entirely happy with the union provision in \nthe bill that he is putting forward.\n  The Senator from Kentucky may be guilty of many things, but I think \nin this debate rarely guilty of inconsistency and many of the things \nthat the Senator from Arizona mentioned I personally argued against \nprior to coming up with this five-legged dog. Somebody said you might \nbe able to make a five-legged dog, but nobody has ever seen one in \nnature. That is sort of what that bill was. So I confess to having \nsigned on to a bill much of which I thought was probably not the right \nthing to do.\n\n[[Page S10132]]\n\n  But let me ask the Senator from Arizona--he said on Friday and again, \nI believe, today, any genuinely independent expenditure made to \nadvocate any cause which does not expressly advocate the election or \nthe defeat of a candidate is fully allowed. Is that the view of the \nSenator from Arizona?\n  Mr. McCAIN. That is correct. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Arizona, under the Federal \nElection Campaign Act the term ``independent expenditure\" is defined as \nfollows:\n\n       The term ``independent expenditure'' means an expenditure \n     by a person expressly advocating the election or defeat of a \n     clearly identified candidate which is made without \n     cooperation or consultation with any candidate or any \n     authorized committee or agent of such candidate and which is \n     not made in concert with or at the request or suggestion of \n     any candidate or any authorized committee or agent of such \n     candidate.\n\n  I am wondering if the Senator from Arizona really meant what he said, \nbecause an ``independent expenditure'' under the Federal Election Act \ndoes by definition expressly advocate the election or defeat of a \ncandidate.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to my friend from Kentucky, we are changing the \ndefinition of ``express advocacy'' as well as the definition of \n``independent campaign.'' And we feel compelled to do so because we see \nthat on both sides the campaigns are no more independent than I am \nqualified to be on the next trip to Mir.\n  We are, on page 13 of the bill, under where it says ``Definitions * * \n* (17) Independent Expenditure--* * *. The term ``independent \nexpenditure'' means an expenditure by a person--(i) for a communication \nthat is express advocacy; and (ii) that is not provided in coordination \nwith a candidate or a candidate's agent or a person who is coordinating \nwith a candidate or a candidate's agent.''\n  And then ``(b) Definition of Express Advocacy--Section 301,'' which \nthe Senator from Kentucky just quoted from ``* * * is amended by adding \nat the end the following: `(20) Express Advocacy--(A) In general.--The \nterm ``express advocacy'' means a communication that advocates the \nelection or defeat of a candidate by--containing a phrase such as \n``vote for'', ``reelect'', ``support'', ``cast your ballot for'', \n``(name a candidate) for Congress'', ``name of candidate in 1997'', \n``vote against'', ``defeat'', ``reject'', or a campaign slogan or words \nthat in context can have no reasonable meaning * * *' ''\n  This is the important part--``can have no reasonable meaning other \nthan to advocate the election or defeat of 1 or more clearly identified \ncandidates; * * *''\n  That is, so we are changing both. I say to my friend, I am changing \nboth the definition of ``independent expenditure'' and the definition \nof ``express advocacy.'' We are doing so because there is clearly a \nhuge problem in American politics today, which I am sure the Senator \nfrom Kentucky appreciates. There are no longer independent campaigns. \nThere is nowhere in any dictionary in the world the word \n``independent'' that would fit these campaigns. They are part of \ncampaigns. To my dismay, and I am sure to every Member of this body, \nthey are negative. And they are negative to the degree where all of our \napproval ratings sink to an alltime low.\n  So that is--I am sorry for the long response, but the Senator from \nKentucky asked a very good question.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Then the definition of what is ``reasonable'' would be \ndetermined by the Federal Election Commission; is that correct?\n  Mr. McCAIN. And the courts, just as the previous ones were \ninterpreted, and in the case of the Colorado decision, as the Senator \nfrom Kentucky well knows, opened up a massive loophole which was driven \nthrough with alacrity and speed. That is what we are trying to close \nhere.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I ask my friend from Arizona, how would it work? The \nFederal Election Commission would either on its own initiative or as a \nresult of receiving some complaints from someone intervene in what way \nto determine what is or is not ``reasonable\"?\n  Mr. McCAIN. First of all, as you know, any bright line would be that \nthe candidate's name or face would not be mentioned, which is carrying \nwhat was, in my view, the original intent, which was obviously that \nthey could not say ``vote for'' or ``cast your ballot for.''\n  So I would be glad to discuss with the Senator from Kentucky exactly \nhow we could define that in report language or other.\n  But I want to return to the fundamental problem here with the Senator \nfrom Kentucky. I ask him, in return, does he believe that these so-\ncalled independent campaigns are truly independent?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Well, if they are not, if it is an independent \nexpenditure which is required under the law----\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am talking about, are they really independent in what \nany of us would define as the word ``independent,'' or are they just \nadditional methods to get around contribution limits in order to defeat \nanother candidate? Which is it?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is the Senator talking about independent expenditures \nor express advocacy?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am talking about independent campaigns. I am talking \nabout a problem. What drives independent campaigns, as the Senator from \nKentucky well knows, is the definition of ``independent expenditure'' \nand ``express advocacy,'' which we are changing.\n  I am asking the Senator from Kentucky again, does he believe that in \nthe last campaign the attacks by labor, for example, in congressional \ndistrict 6, where over $2 million was spent by labor, with Congressman \nJ.D. Hayworth's face distorted on the screen, sometimes morphing into \nthat of Newt Gingrich, does the Senator from Kentucky believe that that \nwas an independent campaign against Congressman J.D. Hayworth?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. What I believe it was is an engagement in issue \nadvocacy.\n  Mr. McCAIN. You really believe that was an issue advocacy ad when \nthey said: Congressman J.D. Hayworth is an enemy of every man, woman \nand child in Arizona? Surely, the Senator from Kentucky does not \nbelieve that. Surely, the Senator from Kentucky does not believe that \nthese independent ads, which are done by both sides, both Republican \nand Democrats, are no more than character attacks, destruction, but, \nmore importantly, adjunct to political campaigns. Surely, the Senator \nfrom Kentucky cannot stand here on the floor of the Senate and say that \nthose are independent campaigns by any reasonable definition.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Arizona, it really does not \nmake any difference what the Senator from Kentucky says. The Supreme \nCourt says----\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think it has a lot to do with what the Senator from \nKentucky believes. I think it has a lot to do with it, because if the \nSenator from Kentucky thinks that this is just basically an evasion of \nthe law by getting around the law, which has contribution limits, then \ncertainly it matters what the Senator from Kentucky believes.\n  If the Senator from Kentucky believes that these are truly \nindependent campaigns, set up and run and funded by individuals who \njust want to see their particular issues, whether it be pro-life or \npro-choice or workers' right to strike or any of the others, then fine. \nBut it is beyond me to believe that the Senator from Kentucky could \nhave, having seen these ads--he is very deeply involved in the \npolitical process--that they are independent. They are not. They are \nappendices of the political campaigns. The tragedy of it is, 98 percent \nof them are attack ads, as the Senator well knows.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe I have the floor.\n  All I was trying to say to my friend from Arizona is that worth a \ngood deal more than the opinion of the Senator from Kentucky is the \nopinion of the Supreme Court, which has said in order to avoid--and \nadmittedly these groups want to criticize us. There is no question \nabout it. They want to criticize us. They want to criticize us. And we \nhate it. They want to criticize us in proximity to the elections. \nSometimes they criticize us earlier than that.\n  But the Supreme Court has said that it is issue advocacy unless the \nwords ``vote for,'' ``elect,'' ``support,'' ``cast your ballot,'' \n``Smith for Congress,''\n\n[[Page S10133]]\n\n``vote against,'' ``defeat,'' or ``reject''--or it lists the magic \nwords here. It is not really vague. I think the reason the Court did \nthis is because they want to encourage citizens to be free to be \ncritical of us any time they want to.\n  I would readily concede to my friend from Arizona we have gotten a \nlot more criticism in the last couple of years than we used to. I will \nalso readily concede that having been the beneficiary, or victim, \ndepending on your point of view, of some of that myself, I do not like \nit. But the Court, it seems to me, has made it rather clear that we do \nnot have the right to keep these people, these groups, from expressing \ntheir views about our records at any point, whether it is in close \nproximity to the election or not.\n  Now, an independent expenditure, as my friend from Arizona knows, is \ndifferent. That is hard money. That is regulated by the FEC. In order \nto qualify as an independent expenditure, you must not consult with \nthose whom you are seeking to aid or reject.\n  Issue advocacy is a different animal. The Court has put that in a \nseparate category. Admittedly, the distinctions are sometimes blurred. \nThe Court anticipated in the Buckley case that many times the \ndistinction would be blurred. But they erred on the side of more \nexpression. They erred on the side of allowing more and more citizens, \nif they chose to, to criticize us at any point they wanted to.\n  Now, what we all saw in 1996 was there was a lot of criticism, a lot \nof criticism by a lot of groups that a lot of people on my side of the \naisle did not like. But I think there is not any chance whatsoever the \nSupreme Court is going to allow us by legislation to make it difficult \nfor people to criticize us just because it may be in close proximity to \nan election.\n  Therein lies the dilemma. My good friend from Arizona is trying hard \nto do that. I understand why he would like to do it. These campaigns \nare a source of great irritation to the people who run for public \noffice. I understand that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I respond?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It is just my prediction--just as one Senator here \nhaving read these cases, it is my prediction that the courts will not \nallow us to in effect shut these folks up or to create a context in \nwhich their criticizing us is more difficult. That is just my opinion. \nBut it is also the opinion of many, including the American Civil \nLiberties Union, who have looked at this particular area.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I respond to the Senator very quickly?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Sure.\n  Mr. McCAIN. First of all, the Senator well knows better than I, \nfootnote 52 is where the magic words are, which is a footnote on the \ndecision. The interpretation of many of us is that the language in the \nbody of the opinion indicates that Congress does have a role to play \nand can be involved in it.\n  But that is a difference of opinion that the Senator from Kentucky \nand I have. That is why I think I would be willing to try to make a \ncase on the floor of the Senate here of the constitutionality of our \nview of changing the definitions of ``independent expenditure'' and \n``express advocacy'' just as when we passed the line-item veto and \nthere was significant constitutional question about the line-item veto \nby good and principled individuals of this body who said, ``Look. What \nyou're doing here is unconstitutional; so, therefore, I'm voting \nagainst it.''\n  I am saying that I believe there is sufficient good opinions by good \nand principled individuals that differ as to what the interpretation is \nand what Congress has the right to not do.\n  May I ask unanimous consent, Madam President, to have stricken from \nthe Record the name of a Member of the other body, because I misspoke, \nand it is against the rules of the Senate to say the name of a Member \nof the other body. I ask unanimous consent that that reference be \nremoved from the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I believe I have the floor. I had \nyielded to the Senator from Arizona for a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So if I could finish my answer. It is not so much that it \naggravates me as to whether it is negative or not. Of course, it pains \nall of us when the approval rating of elected officials is so low. \nThere was a Fox poll that said, ``I believe that my Member of Congress \nis:'' 36 percent said, ``someone I can trust,'' 44 percent said, ``a \nlying windbag.'' That bothers all of us. But that is not the \nfundamental problem here, I say to my friend from Kentucky, because you \ncan do that with hard money. You should be able to do that with hard \nmoney, any kind of attack, any kind of thing you want to do.\n  What we are objecting to is it being used for soft money and the fact \nthat it is not independent, does not meet, by any objective measure, at \nleast in my view, the definition of the word ``independent.''\n  I thank the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe I still have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky still has the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. No, not right now.\n  I say to my friend from Arizona, it is not at all clear that express \nadvocacy has to be independent. But nevertheless, the Senator from \nArizona is entirely correct that the words are in a footnote. There is \nno question that the words are in a footnote.\n  On the other hand, there have been at least 15 cases in this field. \nThis has been a field that has been very much litigated. The Federal \nElection Commission has been interested in going after issue advocacy \ngroups for years. So there has been a lot of litigation on the issue \nthat my friend from Arizona raises.\n  He raises a good point, it is in a footnote. It is not like we \nhaven't been there before. There have been 15 cases. The FEC has lost \nevery single issue advocacy case seeking to do things similar--\nsimilar--to what is sought to be done by legislation here.\n  Recently in the Citizens Action Network case, not only did the fourth \ncircuit rule against the Federal Election Commission trying to do what \nwe are trying to do here, it ordered them to pay the legal fees of the \ngroup that they were out to quiet.\n  So the only thing I say to my friend from Arizona, he is right, it is \na footnote. On the other hand, this is something that the courts have \nhad a good deal to say about, a good deal to say about, and there has \nbeen a lot of litigation on this whole question of trying to quiet the \nvoices of those who would criticize us for our votes.\n  I see my friend from Utah is on the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator from Kentucky yield?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Was the Senator from Utah seeking to ask a question?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I would like to obtain the floor in my own right at some \npoint, but I make a comment to the Senator from Kentucky and ask him if \nhe would like at this point with respect to the 126 scholars that have \nbeen mentioned up until now--I will wait until I have the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think this kind of debate we need to engage in. I think \nthis is important. I think the Congressional Record needs to be made \nand I look forward to more of this kind of debate and discussion \nbecause this is really the heart of the matter. I thank the Senator \nfrom Kentucky for raising this particular issue because this seems to \nbe one of the major, if not the major, areas that need to be discussed.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I believe I still have the floor.\n  I agree with the Senator from Arizona. I think this is the heart of \nthe current version of McCain-Feingold, and certainly does need to be \nadequately vented.\n  I see the Senator from Wisconsin was interested in getting into the \ndiscussion.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for his courtesy and \nI will have a couple of brief questions for him on a very interesting \ndiscussion that the Senator from Arizona and Kentucky had.\n  I ask the Senator from Kentucky if he voted for the Communications \nDecency Act, which was sent up to the Supreme Court?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Frankly, I don't remember. I am sure the Senator \nknows.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. The answer is yes. I believe there were only 16 Members \nof\n\n[[Page S10134]]\n\nthe Senate--I happened to be one--who did not think it was \nconstitutional, who thought it was a violation of the first amendment \nto start censoring the Internet.\n  Does the Senator recall how the Supreme Court disposed of the \nCommunications Decency Act?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Why don't I let the Senator from Wisconsin tell us.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. It was a unanimous decision, 9 to 0.\n  The U.S. Senate, including yourself, voted overwhelmingly for \nsomething that in my view, was unconstitutional on its face.\n  What was the downside of it? What happened? What happened was that \nthe law was struck down, isn't that right?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My friend from Wisconsin, who is a distinguished \nlawyer and went to Harvard knows that pornography does not enjoy the \nsame level of protection as political speech. The Supreme Court has \nalways put political discourse in a special protected category. \nPornography, by its very definition, has been excluded from first \namendment protection.\n  My guess is that in that particular piece of litigation we didn't \nhave a very good idea how the Supreme Court was going to decide and the \nSenator from Wisconsin is probably going to say why not take a chance \nhere and see if the Court will uphold these restrictions on express \nadvocacy.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I assume the Senator has no doubt that this Supreme \nCourt will strike down the provisions in our bill he is talking about, \nisn't that right?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It is my hope, Madam President, that we won't give \nthem an opportunity to do it.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I understand, but my question is, Don't you believe \nthat this Court would strike down the provisions you criticize?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes, I believe the Supreme Court would not, in this \nhighly protected area of political speech, allow the Congress to reduce \nthe quality of criticism that can be leveled at us in proximity to an \nelection.\n  I think we are not flying entirely blind here, Madam President, \nbecause this whole delicate area of issue advocacy has benefited from a \nlot of litigation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. One other question, a point I am trying to make for the \nRecord is I agree with the Senator from Kentucky that should we pass \nthis legislation, this, of course, will go to the Supreme Court. I \nthink it is very important that we acknowledge as we make this Record \nthat they will review it, and that they will want to know exactly what \nour intentions were with regard to this legislation.\n  I want to ask a question in terms of making this Record, following on \nthe question of the Senator from Arizona. I will read the Senator from \nKentucky an advertisement that supposedly was an issue advocacy ad, \napparently legally treated that way, and ask him if he believes this is \nproperly characterized as issue advocacy rather than express advocacy \nor campaign ad.\n  The ad concerned a Winston Bryant. The announcement said, ``Senate \ncandidate Winston Bryant's budget as attorney general increased 71 \npercent. Bryant has taken taxpayer-funded junkets to the Virgin \nIslands, Alaska, and Arizona, and spent about $100,000 on new \nfurniture. Unfortunately, as the State's top law enforcement official, \nhe has never opposed the parole of any convicted criminal, even rapists \nand murderers; and almost 4,000 Arkansas prisoners have been sent back \nto prison for crimes committed while they were out on parole. Winston \nBryant: government waste, political junkets, soft on crime. Call \nWinston Bryant and tell him to give the money back.\n\n  Does the Senator from Kentucky consider that to be an issue ad within \nthe Supreme Court definition, or does he think it is possible--\npossible--that the U.S. Supreme Court just might find that to be a \ncampaign ad?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, that ad sounds very similar to some \nnewspaper editorials I have read during the end of campaigns and in \neditorial endorsements, another form of criticism that we typically \nfind very offensive.\n  My guess is, absent the words ``vote for,'' or ``vote against,'' the \nothers that we went over in the Buckley case, the Court would in all \nlikelihood say those voters are perfectly free to make candidate \nWinston Bryant very uncomfortable before his election.\n  And I understand that the Senator from Wisconsin and the Senator from \nArizona would like to change that standard and give the Supreme Court \nanother chance to try to reach a different decision.\n  Let me tell you why, Madam President, I think it is extremely \nunlikely that the Court would go in the direction that the Senator from \nWisconsin would like it to go. Referring again to the American Civil \nLiberties Union, America's experts on the first amendment, dealing with \nthe restrictions on independent expenditures and issue advocacy in the \nbill we are discussing.\n  They say the new restrictions on independent expenditure are \nimproperly intruding upon the core area of electoral speech and \ninvading the absolutely protected area of issue advocacy--absolutely \nprotected area of issue advocacy.\n  The ACLU went on: Two basic truths have emerged with crystal clarity \nafter 20 years of campaign finance decisions-- 20 years. This is not a \nnew area of the law; 20 years of campaign finance decisions.\n  First, independent expenditures for express electoral advocacy by \ncitizen groups about political candidates lie at the very core of the \nmeaning and purpose of the first amendment. This is not some peripheral \narea here--the very core of the first amendment.\n  Second, issue advocacy by citizen groups lie totally outside the \npermissible area of Government regulation. So I say to my friend from \nWisconsin, my prediction that no matter how much candidate Bryant may \nnot have liked that criticism, my prediction that the Court is likely \nto uphold the ability of citizens to band together and engage in that \ncriticism is based not on some kind of speculation but on 20 years of \ndecisions in this field.\n  So I guess my prediction, in answer to the question the Senator from \nWisconsin asked, is that I don't think there is any chance the Court \nwould allow the Congress to make it tougher for people to criticize us. \nThere is absolutely no hint in 20 years of cases in this area that the \nCourt is going to backtrack and give us the ability to quiet our \ncritics. We would love to do this.\n  One thing I am sure the Senator from Wisconsin and I agree on, we \ndon't like this kind of thing. We really would prefer not to be \ncriticized by either of these avenues, whether it is independent \nexpenditures or whether it is express advocacy, we don't like it. I \nthink we can stipulate that.\n  However, the Court has been rather clear over 20 years that we are \nnot going to be able to quiet these voices. So my prediction would be \nthat they would not allow us to do it.\n\n  There are others who want to speak. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I thank the Senator from Kentucky for his candid \nanswers and say I have great confidence in the U.S. Supreme Court. They \nare perfectly capable of handling this provision. Our job is to pass a \nlaw so they can take it up and they can strike it down if they don't \nlike it. That is the approach we take here when there is a good-faith \ndisagreement about a constitutional provision. Surely there are good-\nfaith arguments on both sides, and the right body to resolve it is the \nSupreme Court.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, during the hearings we have held in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee there have been a number of headline-\ngrabbing witnesses who have appeared before us. Unfortunately, when we \ngot to the phase of the hearings where we were discussing this issue, \nthe television cameras all left the room and the press tables all \nbecame vacant.\n  In that atmosphere I was able to say some things that I maybe \nwouldn't have otherwise said because I knew no one would say anything. \nIt is a bit like the question, When a tree falls in the forest and \nnobody is there to hear it does it make any sound?\n  But there was one witness that appeared who made a lot of sound and \nwhose statements are so apropos I have taken the floor to read most of \nthem into the Record. His full statement is available to anyone who \nwants to go into the committee. I will not take the\n\n[[Page S10135]]\n\ntime to read the full statement here, but for the Senators who \nparticipated in this debate I think hearing some of the comments this \nman made will be particularly enlightening. I am speaking of Curtis \nGans, the director of the Committee for the Study of the American \nElectorate. The advisory board of that committee includes people such \nas David Gergen, Peter Hart, Abigail McCarthy, Cyrus Vance, former \nSecretary of State, Ted Van Dyk, Anne Wexler, Richard Whalen, and a \nnumber of others whose names I don't recognize but I am sure are \nequally distinguished.\n  Mr. Gans points out he has been the director of this nonpartisan \nnonprofit committee for 21 years, engaged in the issues surrounding low \nand declining voter participation. That is his area of expertise. He \nhas published publications, organized commissions, testified before \nCongress, engaged in this activity for a long period of time.\n  With my apologies for quoting so much, I will get into the details of \nMr. Gans' testimony because, as I said, I think it is particularly \nenlightening.\n  I am now quoting from Mr. Gans:\n\n       Mr. Chairman, with all respect to this committee's good \n     work and the chairman's good intentions, I would like to \n     suggest a few verities: that campaign finance is the most \n     overblown issue in American politics, that the problems we \n     face today in campaign finance are the products of bad law \n     passed in 1971 and 1974 and the severability contained in \n     that law and not the result of the Buckley versus Valeo \n     decision; that there are serious problems in the present \n     methods of financing campaigns, but that they are built \n     into the incentive structure current law creates; that, in \n     attempting to remedy the existing problems deliberations \n     should be guided by the principle of ``Do No Harm,'' (that \n     we have already seen the unintended consequences of good \n     intentions) and that it should proceed incrementally and \n     with true bipartisanship; and that the case for such \n     incremental reform can be done without the gross \n     vilification of individual leaders or the system as a \n     whole which is both inaccurate and does a profound \n     disservice by undermining--perhaps more than the laws \n     themselves--public faith in the political process.\n\n  Mr. Gans goes on in another place in his testimony:\n\n       I think the American people have long known that people \n     give money for essentially four reasons:\n       1. That they are friends with the candidate or \n     officeholder.\n       2. That the candidate or officeholder has views congruent \n     to the giver on one or more key issues.\n       3. That the opponent has views which are anathema on one or \n     more key issues.\n       4. To gain access to the candidate/officeholder to express \n     one's interest and point of view.\n       I don't believe that the American people think that \n     Representative . . .\n\n  He names the Member of the other body.\n\n     is a liberal because he gets liberal money, or that . . .\n\n  He names another Member of the other body.\n\n     is a conservative because he gets conservative money.\n       I do believe they understand that access is different from \n     influence--even if money buys access. I think they know that \n     access to a leader comes from several different sources--\n     personal friendship, long-time loyalty, fame, grassroots \n     citizens organization and money, and that money does not \n     speak with one voice. I think the American people know--as \n     their responses to surveys about their own Congresspersons \n     and Senators (the ones with whom they have had first-hand \n     experience)--that the overwhelming majority of leaders are \n     honorable leaders who arrive at public policy decisions on a \n     basis other than contributions. And that if there is cynicism \n     about the profession as a whole, it is not because of its \n     actions, but because they have been vilified by those who \n     seek reform.\n\n  Later on in his statement, Mr. Gans gives what I find to be two \nfascinating questions:\n\n       I am fond of asking the question: ``What do Social \n     Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Aid to Families with Dependent \n     Children, Federal aid to education, the Civil Rights Act, the \n     Voting Rights Act, the Occupational Safety and Health \n     Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, the \n     Council on Environmental Quality have in common?''\n       The answer is that they were all enacted and created when \n     individuals could give unlimited and undisclosed amounts of \n     money to candidates, often in unmarked paper bags, and when \n     the Republican party usually enjoyed a 3-1 spending advantage \n     over the Democrats. (As one staff member of this committee \n     has pointed out, it should also be noted that the Hatch and \n     Taft-Hartley Acts were also enacted in this period, lest the \n     Republicans think reform would be a good thing for their \n     policy ends.)\n       What this incandescently shows us is that major public \n     policy is a matter of leadership and citizen consensus rather \n     than campaign cash.\n  Mr. Gans goes on in his second question, equally compelling in my \nopinion:\n\n       I am also fond of asking a second question, ``What do \n     Michael Huffington, Clayton Williams, Rudy Boschwitz, Mark \n     Dayton, Lew Lehrman, Jack Brooks, Guy VanderJagt, Steve \n     Forbes and, if anyone remembers, John Connally, have in \n     common?''\n       The answer is that each and every one of them spent \n     millions of dollars of their own money, outspent their \n     opponents by as much as 5-1 and lost.\n\n  When he gets to discussing our current problems, Mr. Gans has this to \nsay.\n\n       . . . campaign finance laws were enacted in 1971 and 1974, \n     whose only beneficially durable features were the mandating \n     of public disclosure of some of the money in politics, the \n     provision for partial public financing of campaigns and the \n     establishment of an agency, which for whatever its flaws, has \n     attempted to do a decent job of disclosure and tracking and \n     improving election law.\n\n  Later, he says:\n\n       That law were challenged and substantial parts of the law \n     were overturned in Buckley. The Supreme Court ruled, and I \n     believe rightly, not, as some would have us believe, that \n     ``money is speech,'' but rather that money is necessary for \n     speech to be heard. Accordingly, the Court ruled against \n     spending limits--as inhibiting speech and competition (about \n     which there is considerable evidence) unless such limits were \n     truly voluntary and until there were compensatory benefits to \n     insure that there would be a full and fair hearing of \n     campaign speech. It overturned restrictions on the use of \n     personal funds in campaigns. But it left stand, I think \n     wrongly, the $1,000 contribution limits (to meet the \n     ``appearance of corruption,'' and established a ``bright \n     line'' of ``express advocacy''--the specific advocacy to vote \n     for or against a particular candidate, so named, as the only \n     place in which the amount of money spent on such advocacy \n     could be regulated.\n\n       Because the law law was written so that it was severable--\n     that the provisions which were not struck down--would remain \n     in place, we emerged with an accident waiting to happen, a \n     partial law for which evasion would prove not only likely, \n     but perhaps necessary. We ended up with contribution limits \n     that were constraining and subject to strict disclosure, hard \n     money for both candidates and national parties which were \n     severely restricted and subject to disclosure both on the \n     contribution and expenditure level, soft money--to nonfederal \n     party accounts and to nonprofit groups--which were \n     unregulated and only partially disclosed. . . . The problems \n     with the resulting system became evidence early.\n\n  Mr. Gans goes on to give us a personal example that I found \nfascinating. He says:\n\n       (On the issue of venture capital, I can speak from some \n     experience. I provided the theory for and helped organize in \n     1967 something called ``the Dump Johnson Movement,'' and by \n     the accident of being one of two persons who knew who \n     populated that movement, I became staff director of Senator \n     Eugene McCarthy's 1968 Presidential campaign. When the \n     candidate announced on November 30, 1967, he was unknown to \n     57 percent of the American people; in early February, he \n     stood at 2 percent in the polls in New Hampshire, the \n     first primary, and there was near-universal opinion that \n     one could not beat a sitting President within his own \n     party. If we had had to live within the present \n     contribution limits, that campaign would never have \n     happened and the people of the United States would have \n     been denied the opportunity to express their opinion on \n     the war in Vietnam and Johnson's leadership within the \n     political process. There was neither the time to raise the \n     money or an adequately accessible number of small \n     contributors to make that effort possible. And we do not \n     today know how many other legitimate challengers have been \n     denied the opportunity since 1974 to compete because of a \n     lack of venture capital.)\n\n  Now, apropos of this debate, Mr. Gans has some interesting things to \nsay about that great bugaboo, soft money:\n\n       Then, there is the question of ``soft money.'' I, along \n     with Dr. Herbert Alexander and Dr. Anthony Corrado, among \n     comparatively dispassionate and nonpartisan observers, have \n     long been a defender of soft money. I have done so because my \n     research shows that in competitive campaigns for the U.S. \n     Senate, nearly 60 percent . . . of the hard money campaign \n     budget goes to televised advertising, 30 percent usually is \n     expended on fundraising, and the balance on candidate travel \n     and staff. In this situation, soft money are the only funds \n     then and now available for activities involving people--\n     grassroots campaigning, voter registration and education and \n     party development.\n       But beginning in 1992, soft money has increasingly been \n     used for none of these. Instead, almost all of these \n     unregulated moneys have been poured into television \n     advertising, which is the antithesis of grassroots \n     organization and party development. They underline \n     participation and erode respect for either party. It is safe \n     to say that one reason the Democratic National Committee is \n     substantially in the business of refunding illegal \n     contributions is that they so denuded their\n\n[[Page S10136]]\n\n     staff during the campaign to put every last dollar into \n     advertising that there was no one left to exercise oversight.\n       All of which is to suggest that--without the high-flown \n     rhetoric about corruption, elections being bought and public \n     policy being for sale--both supporters and critics of current \n     and choice reform proposals see some of the same problems.\n       The question is what to do. And therein lies the rub.\n\n  Mr. Gans says:\n\n       I will leave to others the argument about the implication \n     of limits on the First Amendment guarantees of free speech. \n     While I agree with them, leaders like Senator Mitch \n     McConnell, Ira Glasser, Roy Schotland, among a host of \n     others, can carry this argument better than I. I would rather \n     deal in the world of practicality.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       I think there are four verities which will, at least in my \n     limited lifetime and perhaps through the lifetime of my ten-\n     year-old child, continue to hold:\n       1. That because of the recent realignment in the South, the \n     Republican Party will continue to have, at the very minimum, \n     a cloture-proof minority. The impact of this on campaign \n     finance law is that campaigns will be run for the forseeable \n     future largely or totally on private money.\n\n  I think his implication there is that he knows the Republican Party \nis opposed to public funding.\n\n       2. That the Supreme Court is highly unlikely ever to rule \n     that an individual cannot spend whatever he or she wants of \n     his or her personal money on his or her campaign. Thus, we \n     will continue to have self-financed millionaires running for \n     office.\n       3. That the Supreme Court is highly unlikely to rule that \n     like-minded people cannot band together, organize, \n     participate and contribute to campaigns. Thus, we will \n     continue to have political action committees.\n       4. That the Supreme Court is highly unlikely to say that \n     groups and individuals independent of campaigns cannot \n     express their points of view on the issues and candidates up \n     for election. Thus, we will continue to have independent \n     expenditures.\n       (Two things in this regard should be noted. The recent \n     statement by 126 legal scholars, organized by the Brennan \n     Center, was notably silent on these issues. Secondly, Mr. \n     James Bopp's excellent law review article which chronicles \n     various recent cases regarding independent expenditures shows \n     that, if anything, both the Court--in the Colorado case, and \n     the courts, in general, are likely to expand the ability of \n     both parties and independent groups to exercise their free \n     speech rights in the electoral context.)\n       All of which suggests to me that no closed system can or, \n     from my point of view, should be created and that limits will \n     not work.\n       Do we really want to continue the current low level of \n     contribution limits and continue to advantage millionaires \n     and those with large rolodexes of midlevel and large \n     contributors?\n       Do we really want to abolish soft money if the net effect \n     will be simply to starve the political parties and drive \n     money toward independent expenditures?\n\n  He says:\n\n       In some mythical world it might be conceivable to create a \n     system of limits which would not have downside effects--that \n     would be high enough to insure competition, that would \n     provide for full accountability, and would provide varying \n     forms of compensation for the inequities that grants the \n     constitutional rights to such entities as millionaires and \n     independent expenditures may create.\n\n  Madam President, I love this sentence. It summarizes better than \nanything I could say how I feel about the enforcement procedures that \nwe are having discussion about here:\n\n       But to administer such a program would likely take a \n     bureaucracy larger than the Department of Defense and a \n     litigation budget considerably in excess of the Department of \n     Justice and the tobacco companies combined.\n\n  Well, what does Mr. Gans have to offer in the way of a solution? He \nsays this toward the end of his testimony:\n\n       I think at this time there is a possibility of real \n     bipartisan agreement on a number of modest, but not \n     unimportant steps.\n       1. That we mandate full and timely disclosure of all \n     contributions and expenditures above a certain level and \n     within a certain timeframe--including the expenditures and \n     larger contributions to State parties and independent \n     expenditure groups.\n       2. That we establish nationwide computerization of finance \n     records and mandate electronic filing and fast release of all \n     things mandated to be disclosed.\n       3. That we define adequately what a foreign contribution \n     is, provide strict prohibition on such contribution and \n     provide teeth in the enforcement of this provision.\n       4. That, at least within this mandate, we empower the \n     federal election commission and give it the resources to do \n     its job.\n       5. That we indeed do something about soft money. But that \n     we need to think carefully about what we do. To abolish soft \n     money would send money into independent expenditures and, in \n     the absence of substantially raising the amount which can be \n     given in hard money, starve already atrophying parties.\n       There is, to my mind, a better way. Which is that soft \n     money has been justified on the basis that it exists to \n     provide a source of funds for grassroots activity and party \n     building. Let us limit its use to that. Specifically, let us, \n     as we have not until now, recognize in law that such funds \n     exist, deny their use for broadcast advertising and overrule \n     the Federal Election Commission's decision that ``generic'' \n     advertising is not broadcast advertising as stated in \n     existing law. If we did that we would either reduce the \n     demand for soft money or there would be enormous amounts of \n     money moving in the right direction--in activities that \n     educate and engage the citizenry and strengthen and build \n     political institutions rather than in destroying the will to \n     vote.\n       This would not solve all the problems contained within the \n     campaign finance conundrum, particularly with respect to \n     contribution limits, independent expenditures and the overall \n     and spiralling demand for money. But it would be a good \n     start. It would make the system profoundly more accountable, \n     and it would correct the worst abuses of soft money without \n     rendering the parties impotent.\n\n  Finally, as he concludes, Mr. Gans summarizes this whole circumstance \nin language that is one of those phrases you say afterward, ``Gee, I \nwish I had written that.''\n  This is his conclusion.\n\n       The dialogue on campaign finance has generated a maximum \n     amount of heat and a minimum amount of light.\n       Our political system has been called corrupt. Our Congress \n     bought. Our leaders cowardly. All in the name of attempting \n     to force through a particular set of ill-thought out \n     proposals for reform on a Congress which well understands \n     their weakness.\n       Those responsible for this dialogue are Common Cause, \n     Public Citizen and their mouthpieces particularly on the \n     editorial boards of The Washington Post and New York Times. \n     And while both the latter are great newspapers with noble \n     journalistic traditions, with respect to this set of issues, \n     all should be ashamed.\n       Not only because it is not true, but because they, by this \n     attitude, much more than the admittedly flawed system of \n     campaign finance, are deepening the cynicism of an already \n     increasingly cynical public.\n       I know the overwhelming majority of our leaders are \n     honorable. I know many have demonstrated courage in their \n     lives and in their political conduct. I know that, despite \n     many flaws, this nation's political system is the greatest in \n     the world or at least among the greatest.\n       It is time to stand up to the bullies and cool the \n     dialogue--to pinpoint our flaws precisely and address them, \n     but not to tear down the system most of us love and are \n     seeking to improve.\n\n  As I said at the outset, Madam President, I apologize for quoting so \nmuch from one man's testimony. But I found it compelling. I find myself \nin agreement with almost all of it, if not all of it. I am particularly \nin agreement with his statements that our problems arise in large part \nbecause of the flaws in the current law, and the lack of severability \nthat occurred when the law came before the Court, so that when the \nCourt found portions of it unconstitutional they did not strike down \nthe entire law. And we were left with, as Mr. Gans says, ``an accident \nwaiting to happen.''\n  I know in the context of this debate we cannot start with a clean \nsheet of paper and move in the direction that Mr. Gans outlined. But if \nin fact, as many are predicting, and as, frankly, I expect nothing \ncomes of the present effort to enact McCain-Feingold, I hope that \ninstead of walking away from it shaking our heads and pointing our \nfingers at each other that we take a clear look at Mr. Gans' approach, \nwhich would be to, as he quotes Abraham Lincoln, ``think anew and act \nanew,'' and say, We can solve this problem. We can solve it in a \nbipartisan manner. But we can do it in such a way that would not create \nall of the evils that his testimony so graphically describes.\n  I thank my colleagues for their indulgence in allowing me to read so \nmuch.\n  I yield the floor, Madam President.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I must say that it is interesting when \nwe involve ourselves in aggressive and controversial debates that we \nfind from time to time we disagree with colleagues for whom we have the \ngreatest respect. That is certainly the case with me for the Senator \nfrom Utah. He is one of the best Members of the U.S. Senate, and I have \nbeen privileged to work with him on a lot of things. And, yet, I \nprofoundly disagree with him on\n\n[[Page S10137]]\n\nthis issue. I want to spend a bit of time explaining why that is the \ncase.\n\n  In September 1796, George Washington announced that he was retiring \nafter some 45 years of service. I want to read just a paragraph from \nhis Farewell Address, which is read each year here in this Chamber.\n  George Washington wrote:\n\n       This government, the offspring of our own choice, \n     uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full investigation and \n     mature deliberation, completely free in its principles, in \n     the distribution of its powers, uniting security with energy, \n     and containing within itself a provision for its own \n     amendment, has a just claim to your confidence and your \n     support.\n\n  George Washington was right about that. I wonder today, as perhaps \nothers have before me, why has the confidence and support of the \nAmerican people in this institution receded? What is causing that?\n  I happen to enjoy public policy. I rather like politics. I feel that \nit is an enormous privilege to serve here in the U.S. Senate. And, yet, \nI think the political system is a system that has become distorted in a \ncaricature of itself. The question is, what can we do about that? What \nshould we do about that? In answering that, we should probably answer, \nwhat is the problem? Answer the question, what is the problem? And then \ndefine, what is the solution?\n  I have listened for the last hour and a half with great interest to \nmy friend, the Senator from Kentucky, who I am sure will be back on the \nfloor momentarily. He made references when the Senator from Arizona was \nspeaking that no one can nor should be prevented from involving \nthemselves in issue advocacy, et cetera. No one that I am aware of on \nthe floor of the Senate has ever proposed such a position. No one that \nI am aware of is suggesting that anyone under any circumstances in this \ncountry can be prevented from speaking, or prevented from paying for a \npolitical message. No one has made that proposition.\n  So, to the extent that it is being represented that is so, let us \nsay, yes, that is the case. And let's move on to what we are debating, \nand not create a new debate.\n  When the Lincoln and Douglas debates were well underway, at one \npoint, I am told, President Lincoln was so frustrated because he \ncouldn't get Mr. Douglas to understand his point. And finally he said \nto him in great frustration, ``Well, then tell me. How many legs does a \nhorse have?''\n  Douglas said, ``Why, four, of course.''\n  Lincoln said, ``Well, now if you were to call a horse's tail a leg, \nhow many legs would the horse have?''\n  Douglas said, ``Why, five.''\n  Lincoln said, ``See, that is where you are wrong. Simply calling it a \nleg doesn't make it a leg at all.''\n  That is the point in this debate. One can take positions. But if they \nare not on point and totally relevant to what is being discussed, what \nis the value of the position?\n  I want to describe that just a bit in terms of what I mean by that.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin read an advertisement. I want to read it \nagain because I think it is at the heart of this discussion, and it is \nat the heart of the mess that we find ourselves in in campaign finance \nreform. This was an ad in a Senate race down South. I will just add as \nan aside that both political parties did this. Independent groups did \nit. But here is an ad.\n\n       Senate candidate Winston Bryant's budget as attorney \n     general increased 71 percent. Bryant has taken taxpayer-\n     funded junkets to the Virgin Islands, Alaska and Arizona, and \n     spent $100,000 on new furniture. Unfortunately, as the \n     State's top law enforcement official, he has never opposed \n     the parole of any convicted criminal, even rapists and \n     murderers; and almost 4,000 Arkansas prisoners have been sent \n     back to prison for crimes committed while they were out on \n     parole. ``Winston Bryant: government waste, political \n     junkets, soft on crime. Call Winston Bryant and tell him to \n     give the money back.''\n\n  Should there be some position that says they don't have any right to \nsay this? No. Whoever did this has every right to put this on \ntelevision, and did. Do they have a right to put this on TV with soft \nmoney so that those who contributed are never disclosed? Do they have a \nright to say this is not part of the political process; this is not \npart of the campaign; it is totally unrelated; this is an issue \nadvocacy commercial? Does that pass anybody's laugh test? Not in a \nmillion years.\n  That is why one Senator, when asked repeatedly by the Senator from \nArizona, ``Do you really think these are independent; do you really \nbelieve these are independent expenditures?''--referencing a series of \nthese kinds of things. It was never answered. I suspect the answer \nwould be no.\n  We all understand what is going on. The same people are involved. \nThey hire common television producers to produce the commercials, and \nthe same fundraising networks. But it has become a legal form of \ncheating. It has taken the old tax reform law and manipulated it and \ndistorted it to the point that is no longer recognizable, and becomes \nwhat I think is a legal form of cheating. And I say that we ought to \nstop this. Stop it by saying You can't say it? No. You can say that. \nBut if you want to get involved in this particular Senate campaign, \nthen you must abide by the rules. You say it by hard dollars and \ndisclose who donated the hard dollars.\n  That is the point. It is not that they can't say it. It is that they \nare required to use the same hard dollars that the people involved in \nthe race are using, and getting it from the same sources and disclosing \nwho made the contribution.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I hesitate to intrude when he is in full cry because I \ndon't like to be intruded on when I am in a full cry. But I am \nemboldened by the kind of words that my colleague offered at the \nbeginning.\n  This is a personal observation. I agree with the Senator absolutely. \nThat ad should be identified; that it was clearly part of the campaign. \nI am not any more fooled than anybody else. However, we are driven to \nthat kind of chicanery by the present law.\n  My solution--and I am speaking clearly just for myself and not for \nanybody else on this side--would be to repeal the present law and allow \nthe campaigns to go back to a degree of honesty. I do say to the \nSenator: I believe that under the present ruling of the Court the \nstatement by the Senator from Kentucky is correct. The Court would rule \nthat since the magic words were not in that ad it would in fact not be \nconsidered a campaign ad under the legal definition.\n  I agree with the Senator. The legal definition is artificial and \nimproper.\n  But I would solve it in ways other than passing the McCain-Feingold.\n  I thank my friend.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I appreciate the contribution because the contribution \nmade by the Senator from Utah is that this sort of thing is improper, \nand that it is chicanery.\n  If that is the case--if in fact what I just described is improper and \nchicanery--then the question isn't whether there is a problem. The \nquestion is, What do we do about the problem?\n  And there are some people, as the Senator from Utah especially knows, \nin this Chamber who would say, What problem? There is no problem. The \nonly problem we have, they say, is there is not enough money in \npolitics.\n  I want to show my colleagues what is happening with campaign finance.\n  This line, the red line, describes what is happening with funding for \npolitical campaigns in this country.\n  I assume we can find people who will come to the floor and will wave \ntheir arms, and say on this floor and on the floor on the other side of \nthis building, Well, the American people spend x hundreds of millions \nof dollars on Rolaids, they spend x hundreds of millions of dollars on \nPreparation H, and Oh Henry candy bars and, therefore--what? Therefore, \nwhat? It is totally irrelevant.\n  The point is what is happening to campaign financing is it is \nmushrooming and escalating out of control. Is there a problem? Or is it \njust fine?\n  In the paper today there is a statement by one of the leaders of the \nother body saying there is not enough money in politics; we need more \nmoney in politics. In fact, those who debate this issue saying there is \ntoo much money in politics are wrong. We need more money in politics, \nthey say.\n  I could not disagree more. You see what is happening. There is too \nmuch money in politics. Too much money. In State after State after \nState, all of these campaigns are mushrooming out\n\n[[Page S10138]]\n\nof control, and it is not just the campaigns; it is the independent \nexpenditures and all the groups weighing in with chicanery and with \nimproper, in my judgment, spending, packaging up things saying, by the \nway, this is independent, this is express advocacy, this is issue \nadvertising. And all of us know that you cannot say that any longer \nwith a straight face. It is all connected. It is all part of the same \ncampaign. It becomes legal cheating. If we do not have the courage to \nstand up when we see this proliferation of legal cheating going on and \nsaying, if that's the way the law is going to be interpreted and if, \nafter pulling the teeth of the FEC, we complain they can't chew, if we \nare left in that position, then let us at least change the campaign \nfinance law to know what we should do in this country and take at least \nsome of the influence of money out of campaigns.\n  Now, there is a proposal that is being debated in the Senate called \nthe McCain-Feingold proposal. I don't think it is perfect. If I had \nwritten it, I would have written it differently. I cosponsored it, but \nI would have written it differently. But it is a proposal that deals \nwith a whole range of things, and it needs to deal with some more. I \nhope that we will add to it an amendment to restore a portion that was \nnot included when it was brought to the floor of the Senate but which \nwas included when it was written. That provision is spending limits.\n  Now, I want to deal just a bit with this question of spending limits \nand free speech. I noticed this weekend some of the columnists talked \nabout the speech patrol and the infringement of free speech, and so on.\n  Spending limits, which is not now in this bill, which I think should \nbe--and I hope there will be an amendment we can vote on to restore \nspending limits--is an attempt to say let's establish a set of rules by \nwhich campaigns are waged and let's try to see if we can, if not \nestablish enforceable spending limits, at least establish voluntary \nspending limits with sufficient incentive that most campaigns would \nabide by voluntary limits. The limit might be $1.5 million in one \nState, $3 million in another, less than that in a third State, in which \nboth candidates agree here is a practical limit on spending.\n  As I said, there are lots of ways to do that. The Supreme Court has \nalready ruled by a one-vote margin that enforceable spending limits is \nnot appropriate; it is unconstitutional. I think the Supreme Court \nought to be asked to rule again on another case because, if it is that \nclose, I think you can make the case they might rule differently in \nother circumstances. Notwithstanding that, I think we ought to try to \nwork to achieve some approach by which we are able to get spending \nlimits in campaigns.\n  The problem is campaigns cost too much. That's why money has such a \ncorrosive influence in politics. Campaigns cost too much. How do you \nget to the solution of that? Well, you try to establish some spending \nlimits, some spending limits that are practical, that you can make \nstick.\n  John F. Kennedy used to say that every mother kind of hoped her child \nmight grow up to be President as long as they didn't have to be active \nin politics. I suppose he was musing about how unpopular the process of \npolitics is. I am not someone who believes that politics is something \nthat is underhanded or dirty. I think politics is noble and honorable. \nI am involved in it because I enjoy the political process. But I do not \nenjoy what is going on with respect to campaign finance. I think this \nsystem is broken. No one in this Chamber can look at this system and \nwith a straight face say, yes, this system sure does serve America \nwell.\n  This system does not serve this country well. This system is a \ndisservice to the country. Now, do we fix it by suggesting, as one \nSenator today has implied, that we prevent this group or that group \nfrom being able to speak in the political system? No. No one has ever \nrecommended that--no one. So if you want to have that debate, have that \ndebate alone. You can always win a debate that no one else is involved \nwith. I say good for you; you just won a debate that I was advocating.\n  We are not suggesting, none of us, that we would infringe on the \nright of any group to say anything at any time. I am saying, however, \nthat when you take a look at advertisements like the one I described \nand read in the Chamber, as did Senator Feingold, and understand that \nthis is a pole vault over the legal definition and becomes on its face \na farce and an attempt to undermine the process, if we are not willing \nto decide to correct this, then there is no hope for us to deal with \nthe issue of campaign financing.\n  We have a bill in the Chamber that is called a reform bill. It is \ncosponsored by Senator McCain from Arizona and Senator Feingold from \nWisconsin. Both of them are Senators for whom I have a great deal of \nrespect. I do not agree with them on everything either, but they \nbrought a reform to the floor of the Senate. It is interesting; at \nleast for a half-hour or so today I heard a description of this bill \nthat doesn't match the bill. The description was that somehow Senator \nMcCain and Senator Feingold want to prohibit criticism of the Congress. \nSo I felt, well, maybe I may have missed something here. Maybe they \nhave introduced a bill that I hadn't read previously.\n  But then I realized that is simply taking the debate and moving it \nover here to create an issue that does not exist because one is \nuncomfortable debating the issue of McCain-Feingold.\n  No one is suggesting there would be any manner that one could devise \nin McCain-Feingoldo prohibit criticism of the U.S. Congress. Lord, read \na couple hundred years of history and discover about a Congress that's \nbeen criticized. No one is suggesting that you could not do anything \nthat constitutionally prohibits criticism of the Congress. We have \ngenerous criticism of the Congress, always will. The issue that Senator \nMcCain and Senator Feingold address is not criticism of the Congress. \nIt is the corrosive influence of money in campaigns. And ads like this \nsponsored and run by organizations whose funding is secret, undisclosed \nto anyone in this country, collected in soft money increments perhaps \nof $20,000, $50,000, maybe $100,000, could be $1 million. We have seen \n1 million chunks of money go in soft money, undisclosed secret money, \nthrough organizations used as express advertising or express advocacy \nrather than declare they are not part of the campaign. What a bunch of \nrubbish. It does not pass any laugh test in any cafe in this country, \nand that is why we must be serious about trying to find a way to \nthoughtfully reform this system.\n  I would like to just mention two additional items before I close. One \nof the concerns I have about our political system is so much of the \nadvertising is negative. There is nothing you can do about that; I \nunderstand that. We cannot prohibit this kind of advertisement. We can \nsay, if you are going to put this kind of advertisement on the air, you \nhave to play by the rules and get hard money and disclose the donors.\n  There is nothing wrong with that. But we cannot prohibit any \nadvertisement. So much of it now is negative and so much of it is a 30-\nsecond little political explosion that goes on across our country where \ncandidates are not even hardly named, at least with respect to the \nperson's campaign, in financing the 30-second ad. It is a nameless, \nfaceless, little bomb directed to destroy, tar or feather some other \ncandidate.\n  One of the small amendments that I intend to offer is the following. \nWe now require in Federal law that television stations provide the \nlowest cost for television commercials during certain periods of the \nyear. In other words, the lowest part of their rate card must be \noffered to campaigns for those political commercials. I am going to \npropose that the lowest cost on their rate card be provided candidates \nwhose commercials are at least 1 minute in length and on which the \ncandidate appears 75 percent of the time. I am not suggesting you \ncannot continue the 30-second slash-and-tear ads. Everybody can do \nthat. Why should we reward those advertisements with the bottom of the \nrate card? Why don't we as a matter of law say we will provide and \nrequire the lowest rate be offered to those commercials that are at \nleast 1 minute in length and on which at least 75 percent of the time \nthe candidate appears in the commercial.\n\n  Well, we will have a debate about that. I suppose some will say, \nwell, that is interference. We interfere already by saying you must \ncharge the\n\n[[Page S10139]]\n\nlowest rate that a television station offers for advertising for a \npolitical campaign during certain portions of the year. Perhaps we \ncould do so providing an incentive that the campaign commercials be \nsomewhat instructive and somewhat related to the candidate who is \nactually paying for the campaign commercial.\n  There are several kinds of air pollution in this country, one of \nwhich is political air pollution, and if we can do anything to in any \nsmall, measurable way, provide a little more thoughtful approach to \ncampaign advertising through an incentive, then I would like to see us \ndo it. I expect, however, that when and if I am able to offer this \namendment, some will suggest it is some sort of colossal interference. \nI think not. I think it is a sensible, thoughtful way to address that \nissue.\n  Finally, if the problem is there is too much money in politics and \nthe solution is to reform our campaign financing system in one way or \nanother, then how will we reform our system? Well, we reform it by \nbringing a bill to the floor and passing it, doing the same in the \nHouse, going to conference, agreeing in conference and getting a bill \nto the President he can sign.\n  Now, is that likely? What is likely to be the future of campaign \nfinance reform? I applaud Senator Lott for bringing it to the floor of \nthe Senate for a debate. Giving us the opportunity to discuss this \nissue is important. But it is the starting line, not the finish line. \nThe finish line for Congress will be when we have, on a bipartisan \nbasis hopefully, achieved an agreement on a campaign finance reform \npackage that will give the American people some basic confidence that \nwhat we are holding are elections not auctions; some basic confidence \nthat we will step away from this exponential increase in spending on \npolitical campaigns.\n  Senator McCain and Senator Feingold have taken a first long jump here \nto get this legislation to the floor of the Senate, and I hope that in \nthe coming few days we can open up the process and allow some \namendments and have a vote.\n  I noticed today, when the Senate opened for business, amendments were \noffered in a very careful way. In fact, it took, I believe, six \ndifferent amendments today in a series of maneuvers to fill the tree \nwhich, for those who don't know about our parliamentary situation, \nmeans that no one else is allowed to do anything at this point because \nthe parliamentary tree is full. Amendments are not allowed. So we have \nhad a maneuver that was accomplished today to fill the tree.\n  So we will see where all that leads. Every time somebody does that--\nand both sides have done it about a handful of occasions--every time \nsomeone has done it, they have done it to prevent someone else from \ndoing something later. I hope that is not the case. I hope we can shake \nthis tree a bit and shake it sufficiently so that we can offer some \namendments and reach a conclusion on campaign finance reform that is \ngood for this country and restores some confidence in the American \npeople that we are moving in the right direction.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. ALLARD). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  This, as the tone of the debate indicates, is a critically important \ndebate with consequences that go well beyond the subject at hand, \ncampaign finance reform, because the infusion of massive amounts of \nmoney into our political process affects so many other areas in which \nwe are supposed to govern and to legislate, and it is why this \nappropriately becomes a priority topic.\n  As I hear the seriousness of the debate in the Chamber, I must share \nmy own disappointment that there is murmuring outside the Chamber that \nnothing is going to happen this year, that there is not going to be any \ncampaign finance reform legislation adopted, that this is just a lot of \nsound and fury which, as the bard reminded us, will signify nothing.\n  Well, that would be an infuriating tragedy, an outrageous, in my \nopinion, abdication of our responsibility, a shocking refusal to face \nthe facts that have come out at the hearings of the Senate Governmental \nAffairs Committee, on which I am privileged to serve. That committee's \nhearings show that ours is a system in crisis, and it is a crisis that \naffects so many aspects of our Government.\n  I hope these murmurings are wrong, and I hope that the debate we have \nbegun in the Chamber will signify more than noise; it will signify the \nbeginning of a genuine effort to change the laws, to go back in some \nways to where we were after the last great campaign finance scandal, \nwhich was the Watergate scandal, to go back to the laws adopted after \nthat scandal which set limits not only on contributions but on spending \nin a campaign.\n  In my capacity as a member of the Governmental Affairs Committee, I \nhave had what might be called a front-and-center view of the \nextraordinary failures of the status quo campaign finance system, \nfailures that routinely stem from the corrupting influence of big money \nin politics. As if peeling back the layers of an onion, in this case a \nspoiled onion, our investigation slowly revealed story after story of \nunseemly and negligent behavior that all too often seemed to cross over \nthe line into lawlessness.\n  I know the Governmental Affairs Committee's hearings were \ncontroversial. Sometimes they were criticized for being partisan. In \nfact, sometimes they were too partisan. But the fact is, though they \nwere not always orderly and they weren't always neat and they weren't \nalways pretty, they told a story. They told a story of a system gone \nout of control and the consequences it has had on our great democracy.\n  There was the international entrepreneur who never registered to vote \nbecause he thought his money was more influential than his franchise. \nThe sad fact is, he was right.\n  There was the story of the White House official who advised a \npotential contributor, whom he had never met, whom he had just talked \nto over the phone, about how to effectively skirt tax liabilities on a \nproposed donation of somewhere between $1 million and $5 million.\n  There was the Republican Party research institute that defaulted on a \nloan from a Hong Kong businessman and then swindled him out of the \ninterest he had earned on his own money, which was deposited as \ncollateral for the loan; and the party chairman, Democratic Party \nchairman, who allegedly called on the CIA--although there is doubt on \nthis, conflicting testimony, but an allegation that the chairman called \non the CIA to help burnish the image of a questionable contributor.\n  In no uncertain terms, as far as I am concerned, people with fat \nwallets bought access at the highest levels of our Government, \nexecutive and congressional, and some Government leaders were perfectly \nwilling to auction off their clout.\n  As California entrepreneur and major Democratic donor Johnny Chung \nobserved, ``The White House is a subway: You have to put in coins to \nopen the gates.''\n  Clearly, the two parties, in their mad scramble for money, \nshamelessly exploited during the 1996 election cycle well-intentioned \ncampaign finance laws to the point of rendering them meaningless. In \nthe end, their debased standards of the pressure-cooker world of high-\nstakes election campaigns mocked one of the basic principles of our \ndemocracy, the principle that all citizens have an equal vote, an equal \nvoice in the governance of their country, an equal opportunity to \ninfluence its policies.\n  Now we have an unfettered political fundraising system that neither \nserves the public interest nor deserves the public trust. No wonder the \nAmerican people look on politics with a jaundiced eye. No wonder more \nand more of them have concluded their vote doesn't count, so they don't \nvote. I saw a survey awhile ago of 165 countries in the world today who \nconduct elections. The United States of America is 139th in terms of \nthose of voting age who actually vote. Our proud democracy--we are \nproud to call it the greatest democracy in the world--we are 139th \namong the countries of the world in the percentage of our population \nthat can vote that actually does vote. Don't you think part of that has \nto do with the conclusion that millions of our fellow Americans have \nmade that their vote doesn't count, not if they don't have money?\n\n[[Page S10140]]\n\n  The proposal offered by Senators McCain and Feingold is, in my \nopinion, our best hope for changing this unacceptable status quo and \nfor reviving public faith in our Government.\n  The key to real reform, I conclude after sitting through the Senate \nGovernmental Affairs Committee hearings, is less big money and less \nspecial interest money in the election process. That is exactly what \nthe McCain-Feingold bill would do. The central provision of this bill \nis a ban on soft money; that is, a ban on unlimited contributions to \nthe two national parties from corporations, unions, and wealthy \nindividuals.\n  It is hard to believe, but it actually was 1907 when a law was passed \nby this Congress that made it illegal for corporations to contribute to \npolitical campaigns. In the 1940's a similar law was passed regarding \nlabor unions. How is it that in the 1996 election corporations and \nlabor unions contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars individually, \nmillions in some cases? It is because of this so-called soft money, \nthis little opening that was created in a vaguely worded law that was \nthen interpreted by the Federal Election Commission to allow people to \ngive unlimited amounts of money to parties to help voter registration, \nget out the vote, that turned into a loophole large enough for a fleet \nof trucks--not Mack trucks but Brinks trucks--to go driving through.\n  The explosive growth of soft money and the way it is spent \nrepresents, in my opinion, the most egregious abuse of our campaign \nfinance laws today. Most of the controversial donations from the 1996 \ncampaigns were soft-money contributions. Most of the foreign money \ncontributions that we took evidence on at the governmental Affairs \nCommittee hearings were soft-money contributions.\n  Soft money has played a role in Federal elections since 1980, the \nyear after Congress tried, the way I mentioned, to enhance the role of \nnational parties. But in 1996 it exploded--$272 million that we know of \nspent by both national parties in soft money in 1996, 13 times the \namount spent in 1984, an increase that has dramatically changed the \nlandscape of campaign fundraising and of American democracy. By the \nNovember 1996 elections, the soft-money loophole had become a cash \nbonanza for the two parties, an irresistible opportunity to raise and \nspend money, each driving the other to keep up, and the easiest way to \ndo it was to raise big money. It became, for that reason, the most \nexpedient way for an elite class of contributors to buy access; \nfrankly, for an elite class of contributors to be exploited, in some \nsense coerced, by the political class into giving contributions of \nunprecedented size.\n  The quintessential example of trading money for access was the \nbrutally honest and now legendary Roger Tamraz. An international \nbanker-businessman, Tamraz donated $300,000 to the Democratic Party \nbecause he wanted to talk to President Clinton and other high officials \nof our Government about his plans to finance an oil pipeline through \nthe former Soviet Union. The National Security Council warned against \nadmitting Tamraz to the White House. They had already decided, in the \ndue and diligent exercise of Governmental decisionmaking, that his \nproposal was not the right proposal for a pipeline in that particular \npart of the world. They understood that he was falsely claiming White \nHouse support for his projects. They warned that, if high officials of \nour Government gave him even a meeting, even were seen close to him, he \nwould trade on that proximity in the area of the world in which he was \ndoing business.\n  But Tamraz was nothing if not persistent. He said to us at one point \nthat, ``I'm the kind of person, if I can't find my way through a door, \nI'll go through a window. And if that window is closed, I'll go through \nanother window until I get in.'' He went so far as to enlist a buddy at \nthe CIA to lobby the administration on his behalf. But what he really \ndid was kept going to the window with his checkbook. Eventually, he was \ninvited to six different social gatherings.\n  The very troubling clincher is this. When I asked Tamraz when, not \nwhether he registered to vote--because I then was going to ask him what \nparty he was in, trying to prove the fact that parties didn't matter to \nhim, ideology didn't matter to him, he was just buying access, he was \ntrying to influence our Government with bucks--when I asked him when he \nregistered to vote he shocked me by saying he wasn't registered to \nvote. When you think about it, in his world, the world that soft money \ninvites, there is no need to register to vote. His money was more \nimportant and bought more access than any vote could. It was as if he \nwas saying: Oh, voting is a nostalgic exercise for those millions of \npeople out there who don't have influence--most Americans. They are the \nones who can take the time to register and vote. I buy my way, in \nAmerica, to the highest levels of power. So Mr. Tamraz seemed to be \nsaying.\n  The right to vote, which was central to the creation of our country, \nthe right to vote, for which our founders and succeeding generations of \nAmericans have fought and died, didn't matter to Tamraz. He figured it \nout--$300,000 bought him a lot more access in this democracy than \nanybody who just votes had. This standard is so well embedded in our \npolitical system that when I asked him whether he got his money's \nworth, even though he never actually won White House support for his \npipeline nor got a separate private meeting with the President, Tamraz \nsaid next time he'd double that donation to $600,000.\n  I am not naive. People have always tried to do what Roger Tamraz did. \nAs long as there have been governments, as long as there have been \npeople with any power in any human society, people have tried to seek \nfavor by conveying items of worth, and they will continue to do so. \nBut, when soft money contributions open the door to unlimited \ncontributions, when the competitive pressure of our political campaigns \nraises leads to spending without limits, the temptations will be that \nmuch greater for the influence peddlers and purchasers, for the \nhustlers to try to buy something big. Frankly, the temptation will be \nthat much greater and, ultimately, for many, irresistible, for those in \npower to sell what the influence purchasers are trying to buy. That is \nwhy, in short, we have to ban soft money.\n  The attempt to influence Government with purchases is nothing new. \nLook in the Bible. There is a prohibition there against judges or other \nleaders accepting gifts from anyone who comes before them for judgment, \nanyone who is affected by their leadership.\n  The wisdom there was based on an understanding of human nature and \nthe need for those in government to set limits to protect themselves \nand those they governed. People in government who exercise power are, \nafter all is said and done, beneath their titles, no matter how high \nthey are, just human beings with the same frailties as everyone else. \nPut them in the public competitive reality of a political campaign, and \ntoo many will not be able to say no, particularly while they see their \nopponents saying yes.\n  The Governmental Affairs Committee's hearings have built significant \nsupport for banning soft money. Just last week, John Sweeney, the \npresident of the AFL-CIO--his organization, in fact, contributed \nmillions in soft money, almost all of it to the Democratic Party in the \n1996 cycle--said, soft money donations are ``polluting our political \nsystem.''\n  Last week, a group of business leaders made essentially the same \nstatement demanding a ban. Chief executives at Monsanto, General \nMotors, and Allied Signal have already dropped out of the soft money \ngame. Why? They said it is impossible to track contributions to gauge \ntheir success. In other words, the payoff for five- or six- or seven-\nfigure contributions is simply not worth the expense.\n  I will tell you something else they didn't say. Members of the Senate \nmay have heard, as I have, from people who were solicited for soft \nmoney contributions, large contributions. They felt coerced. They felt \nit hard to say no. Think about it, if you are the executive of a \nbusiness and you have a lot of contact with the Government and are \nregulated by the Government, if you are the executive of a business \nthat has matters before Congress and a high official in the executive \nbranch or the legislative branch calls you and asks for a large soft \nmoney contribution, it is hard to say no.\n  If we are successful only in banning soft money, however, as \nimportant as\n\n[[Page S10141]]\n\nthat is, our work will still be incomplete. Although I must say, if we \ncould just ban soft money, I think we will have achieved enormously \nsignificant reform.\n  But in the best of all worlds, it is not enough, and in the best of \nall bills, the McCain-Feingold bill, they don't stop at banning soft \nmoney. It is important to go on. Money is like water, it flows to the \nweakest point. Just as water spills through an unplugged gap in the \ndike, once one hole is filled, it will find the next hole, or it will \nfind the weakest point in the dike to make a hole. Political money \nseeks unregulated gaps in our election laws.\n  I do not say this simply as a matter of physics or theory. I say \nthis, again, as a result of what we heard in the hearings before our \ncommittee. Money blocked by contribution limits to candidates flows \ninstead into unlimited soft money contributions to parties. Money \nblocked by a soft money ban will be diverted in increasingly large \namounts to unregulated issue ads.\n  Issue ads are paid for by soft money raised by independent advocacy \ngroups and parties. They are supposed to be about specific policy \nissues, not specific candidates. That is why unlimited amounts of money \nmay be spent. But issue ads, as we heard discussed on this floor in the \n2 days of this debate, have actually become stealth candidate ads.\n  Widespread abuse in the last election saw these ads hiding behind the \nveil of issue advocacy, even as they promoted or attacked individual \ncandidates.\n  A study by the nonpartisan independent Annenberg Public Policy Center \nfound that 87 percent of the so-called issue advertisements broadcast \nin 1996 mentioned a candidate by name--87 percent mentioned a \ncandidate. Almost 60 percent showed the likeness of a candidate.\n  The Annenberg study further found that more than 40 percent of the \n1996 ads plainly attacked candidates, not issues. One of the witnesses \nbefore our committee said last week that by his review of the ads, the \nissue ads were actually more negative to candidates than the candidate \nads were. Some ads don't bother with issues at all.\n\n  One of these ads, run by opponents of a congressional candidate in \nMontana, simply used the air time to rehash the candidate's marital \nproblems. Ads broadcast by the Democratic and Republican parties \nostensibly on the issues in the 1996 Presidential campaign were little \nmore than biography spots at best, promoting the election of President \nClinton or of our former leader, Bob Dole.\n  Issue ad sponsors, like the AFL-CIO or the National Rifle \nAssociation, are under no obligation to disclose the money they spend \nwhen they do issue ads. But when the ad zeros in on specific \ncandidates, as we all know was the case and as the Annenberg study so \nbrilliantly documents, clearly there is at least a violation of the \nspirit of the Federal spending limits. It is an end run on what the law \nsays can be spent on a campaign.\n  No one can be held accountable for the false or misleading \ninformation those ads might convey, because the public doesn't know who \npaid for the ads. And yet in the 1996 election cycle, advocacy groups \nand the two parties spent more than $135 million on issue ads. That is \nabout one-third of the $400 million that was spent on broadcast \nadvertising by all Federal candidates last year.\n  Kathleen Hall Jameison, director of the Annenberg center, concluded \nthat issue ads ``set an agenda different from that of either candidate \nand, in some cases, drown out the voices of these who are actually \nrunning for office.''\n  We run the risk here, Mr. President, of the candidates becoming bit \nplayers in a contest that occurs at a higher level between dueling \ninterest groups spending millions of dollars running issue ads with \nsoft money.\n  McCain-Feingold appropriately proposes a more precise distinction \nbetween ads supporting or opposing an issue versus those supporting or \nopposing a candidate. I am convinced, based on my own reading of the \nSupreme Court decisions, that that provision will withstand the \nconstitutional test.\n  The soft money ban and the crackdown on illegal issue ads, which I \nhave spoken to, are two of the most critically important and \npolitically realistic reforms that we can hope to make. I say \npolitically realistic in the sense of being related to the political \nreality that we all have experienced in campaigns, and it was vividly \ndocumented in the hearings that the committee held.\n  Other provisions in the McCain-Feingold bill--strengthening \ndisclosure requirements, outlawing the solicitation of campaign \ndonations in Federal buildings and limiting the amount of personal \nmoney that candidates may contribute to their own campaign--will also \nhelp bring our fundraising system back under control.\n  But, Mr. President, I regret that the bill has been stripped of the \nvoluntary spending limits in it, because I believe that ultimately the \nbest way to end corruption or the appearance of corruption in campaigns \nis to impose spending limits on campaigns.\n  I know that there is a disagreement among Members on whether that \nwould be constitutional. Under the Buckley versus Valeo decision, \nmandatory spending limits would not be constitutional. If I had my \ndruthers, as Li'l Abner used to say, personally I would like to see \nthat 1976 Supreme Court decision overturned, because I think the \ncentral principle established by that case, that money equals speech, \nis not right, and, even if it had some validity in theory in 1976, it \nno longer reflects the reality of the last 20 years of campaign raising \nand spending.\n  Money doesn't equal speech. How can speech be free if it costs money? \nHow can speech be free if you have to spend money to get it or, as I \nbelieve my friend and colleague from Georgia, Senator Cleland, who is \non the floor, said in our committee--and I paraphrase knowing I will \nnot achieve the pungency that he did--if money equals speech, if you \nhave to have big bucks to have speech, that means the people who don't \nhave big bucks aren't going to have any speech. Is that what the \nFramers of the Constitution intended when they adopted the first \namendment? I can't believe that they did.\n  Several times in the history of the Supreme Court, the Justices have \napplied principles of law that did damage to our country and that \nexperience ultimately proved were not realistic. That most tellingly \nwas the case when the Court upheld segregation laws on a theoretical \nbasis of equal protection when the reality of equal protection was not \nthere.\n  It took until 1954 when a massive amount of evidence was brought \nbefore the Supreme Court to show that separate but equal was in fact \nnot equal--only then did the Court strike down those discriminatory \nlaws. In another way, this was true with some of the labor laws adopted \nin the earlier part of this century.\n  Minimum wage laws were originally struck down as violations of \nemployee's rights to contract until a case was built by advocates for \nthose laws which showed that the right to contract, though noble in \ntheory, was not real when you had two unequal parties negotiating the \ncontract. So the Supreme Court reversed itself, and upheld the minimum \nwage laws and maximum hour laws to protect working people from being \nexploited.\n  Respectfully, I think the same scenario is true with regard to the \ninterpretation of the first amendment rendered by the Supreme Court of \n1976 in Buckley. Let me just point out for the record, which a lot of \nfolks forget--I forgot myself before I went back and read the Buckley \ndecision--that the post-Watergate reforms, the 1974 Federal Election \nCampaign Act didn't just say that Mr. Buckley, who was a part-time \nresident of my State and truly one of the Lord's noble people, could \nspend his own money and not being restricted from doing so by the law, \nbut the Buckley decision struck down the preexisting limits on what \nMembers of Congress could spend in their campaigns--the 1974 act \nactually had limits that Members of both the Senate and the House could \nspend on their campaigns based on a certain amount per voter in the \nState--the Court struck that down on the theory that that was an \nelement of free speech.\n  But what is the reality? The reality is that the unlimited spending \nthat has occurred has distorted and constricted free speech. It has \nlimited the free speech of those who don't have the money. It has \nundercut the other fundamental bedrock principle of our Government that \neverybody should have equal access to Government. All people\n\n[[Page S10142]]\n\nare created equal, all created in God's image. Our rights were given to \nus not by Congress, but by our Creator, as it says in the first \nparagraph of the Declaration of Independence. That principle clearly \nhas been compromised by the enormous sums of money people are spending \nin political campaigns today.\n  I must also say that the testimony we heard, and I understand we \ndidn't hear exactly a random sample of contributors of big soft money \ncontributions, but it seemed to me, at least, that those generous \ncontributions were not political speech in the way we normally \ncontemplate.\n  Roger Tamraz did not give $300,000 because he had a particular \nfeeling that he wanted to express about an ideology, a candidate or a \nparty. He was buying access. He was trying to make money. It was clear \nthat he was willing to spend $300,000, $600,000 because he would have \nmade hundreds of millions of dollars if his pipeline proposal had been \nadopted.\n  Johnny Chung, Yogesh Ghandi, the whole range of people who were \nbuying access through soft money, they were not interested in political \nspeech as we know it, the kind of political speech that the Founders of \nour country established in our formative documents.\n  They were buying a picture with the President to take back home, as \none said, ``to put powder on my face so I would look better so I could \nconvert that into business.'' They were looking to do business. They \nwere looking to influence Government to make them richer. That is not \npolitical speech in the traditional way in which it has been known. \nThey were advancing their interests.\n  White House coffees, photo-ops with the President, breakfasts, \nlunches, dinners with Members of Congress--these are the things that \ntop-dollar contributors enjoy. These are the things that are protected \nby the Buckley decision. These are things that we do not normally \nconsider to be speech in the fullest sense of our democracy.\n  Jefferson, I think, would be surprised--Madison, Hamilton, Adams, no \nmatter which side they were on, in the early debates of our country's \nhistory, they would be surprised to see that it is the rights of Roger \nTamraz and Johnny Chung that we are now using the first amendment to \nprotect. The Supreme Court adopted that theory in 1976, but now we have \nthe facts. And with the facts, I hope someday we can reverse this \ndecision.\n  I know that more than 20 State attorneys general of both parties have \nformed a task force to see if they can find a case to take back to the \nSupreme Court to relitigate the Buckley decision, because the fact is \nthat you cannot really have contribution limits without spending limits \nthat are effective.\n  When candidates and parties are free to spend as much money as they \nwant, they will. That is what the record shows. They will find ways to \nraise that money in larger and larger amounts even if it means ignoring \nthe results and breaking the law because the stakes are enormous. Those \nwho continue to argue for the Buckley decision are just not considering \nthe realities of what has happened under that decision. And those \nrealities are based on the realities of human nature and the give-and-\ntake of today's real political world.\n  Despite all of that, we have to legislate within the Buckley \ndecision. We have to recognize that reality. Within that decision, I \nthink the McCain-Feingold proposal, by banning soft money and \nregulating issue ads, does as much as we can possibly do and does a lot \nto put us back on course to protect the equal access to and founding \nprinciples of our Government.\n  If we do not adopt something like this, I hesitate to think about \nwhat the future is going to look like. Despite all the congressional \nhearings, all the special investigations, all of the concern about \nforeign money and big money in the 1996 campaign, the fact is that \nwhile all this attention has been given, Federal Election Commission \nrecords show that the two parties have actually raised $34 million in \nsoft money in the first half of this year, which is not less than the \nlast comparable period, it is 2\\1/2\\ times the $13 million raised in \nthe 6 months after the last election.\n  These numbers are going to continue to escalate, Mr. President, \nunless we find the courage to rein in the system, to rein in ourselves. \nIf we face the 2000 Presidential election without any change in the \nlaw, I am afraid it is going to be the biggest auction in American \nhistory.\n  What is going to be for sale is our Government. And what is going to \nbe lost is the people's faith in public service, which will erode at \never-alarming rates unless we give them, by our actions, reason to \nrespect the political system. Our own integrity, human as we are, full \nof frailties as we are, our own integrity will continue to be \nthreatened by the pressure to spend big money in an unlimited system \nand the need, therefore, to raise it.\n  Mr. President, the people are watching. They are skeptical. We can \ncontrol temptations that inevitably arise when gigantic amounts of \nmoney are available for political campaigns. Millions of them have, in \nfact, given up on us and our system, bringing our great democracy I am \nafraid to one of the lowest points in its proud history.\n  We have it within our capacity to change all this, to work together \nacross party lines to reform the status quo of the campaign finance \nsystem, to return our politics to a higher ground and revive our \ncitizens' trust in their Government by adopting genuine campaign \nfinance reform like that included in the McCain-Feingold bill.\n  The question remains, and it will echo throughout the debate this \nweek and next, will we do it? Will we seize the moment or will this \ndebate ultimately be just a lot of sound and fury that will ultimately \nproduce nothing?\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to speak on campaign reform, but I \nalso see my colleague from Georgia is here. I have kind of come in two \nor three times to speak thinking maybe we are going to alternate. I do \nnot want to impugn on his time.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my colleague from Georgia. It is a pleasure to \nserve on the Governmental Affairs Committee with him. He is one of the \nmembers, as well as the Senator from Connecticut, who spends a lot of \ntime on the committee and does a very good job, I will say, in really \ntrying to find out what has happened and what the facts are.\n  Mr. President, just a few general comments on campaign reform. \nEverybody says, ``Well, now we change the law. It's vitally important \nfor us to change the law.'' I think it is more important, and maybe the \nbest campaign reform that we could have would be enforcement of the \nexisting law.\n  Why in the world, if the statutes are very clear on the books--and \nsome people say they are ambiguous; I think I will show in a moment \nthey are not that ambiguous--why in the world should we be worried \nabout changing the law if we are not going to enforce the law as it is \nwritten?\n  We have numerous cases that, I believe clearly, laws were broken, and \nin some cases flagrantly broken, and yet we have seen almost no \nenforcement from this administration, and yet they are out there \nbeating the drum, saying, ``Change the law. Change the law.'' It \nreminds me of something like somebody has been robbing banks and says, \n``Oh, yes, let's have a tougher law against bank robbing. Oh, yeah, \nI've been doing it a long time. Oh, yeah, if I get caught, I'll send \nthe money back.'' I don't think that is good enough.\n  As a matter of fact, this administration has been caught with their \nhand in the cookie jar for millions of dollars. They have sent millions \nof dollars back, and they say, ``Well, that's OK.'' Well, I do not \nthink that is OK.\n  If the law has been broken, it should be enforced. If we would \nenforce the law, if we would actually indict people, if we would arrest \npeople, if we would seek their participation and comments before a \ngrand jury, I think that would do more for campaign reform than any of \nthe bills that we have before us.\n  And we have a lot of bills, good bills I will say, Democrat bills, \nRepublican bills. Before we do that, we have several statutes that are \non the books that ought to be enforced. Frankly, they have not been \nenforced. You\n\n[[Page S10143]]\n\nmight say, ``Well, give me an example.''\n  One that has been kind of famous is 18 United States Code 607: \nprohibits soliciting and receiving contributions in Government \nbuilding.\n  I know we heard from Mr. Sandler, who is general counsel for the \nDemocratic National Committee say--well, he interprets that to mean \nthat you can be in a Federal building, you can make all the phone calls \nyou want on hard money, soft money, as long as you are calling somebody \nthat does not happen to be a Federal employee in a Federal building, \nthat you can do it.\n  That is an absurd reading of the statute. I do not see how an \nintelligent person can read the statute and come to that conclusion, \nbut that is the Democratic National Committee's general counsel, that \nwas his general summary. It seems to be the advice that the Vice \nPresident has followed, to say he has broken no law.\n  But the law is very clear. It says it should be unlawful for any \nperson to solicit or receive campaign contributions in a Federal \nbuilding, period. If you look further, the definition of \n``contribution,'' is ``money received to influence an election.'' So I \nthink they have broken the law.\n  Maybe we will just ignore the law and say there is no controlling \nlegal authority because that law has not been enforced. But my guess is \nno other administration in history has ever broken the law like this \nadministration, never abused the law, never pushed the envelope. I \nthink they pushed well beyond the envelope. I do not think it is into \nthe gray area. I do not think it is a couple cases where somebody \ncalled you back and, ``Well, yes, we'd like for you to host \nsomething.'' I think this was systematic, flagrant--``Let's raise a lot \nof money.'' I believe very much that the President and the Vice \nPresident were involved in it. The President had a memo that said, \n``Start the overnighters at $50,000 and $100,000.'' I happen to think \nthat is the silver bullet people are talking about.\n  The President of the United States said, ``Let's start the coffees.'' \nHe is talking about raising money. They had 103 coffees. They raised \n$26.4 million. In the President's own handwriting he said, ``Start \nthem.'' Guess what, they started right after he said, ``Start them.'' \n``Start the overnighters''--they started the overnighters. They had \nhundreds of people spending the night, hundreds of people spending the \nnight in the White House, more than any other administration, a volume \nthat they have never seen before. And a whole lot of them were \ncontributing $100,000. We had the FBI testify that 51 averaged over \n$107,000 each to spend the night in the White House. I happen to think \nthat is a flagrant violation of the current law, the law as it is \nwritten right now.\n  We could just go on and on.\n  And 18 United States Code 600: prohibits promising any Government \nbenefit in return for political support. Johnny Chung is reported to \nhave donated $25,000 to Ms. O'Leary's favorite charity at her direction \nin order for Mr. Chung to obtain a meeting with several Chinese \nbusinessmen. He contributed the money. He got the meeting. Ms. \nO'Leary's charity got the $25,000. He also donated more than $360,000 \nto the DNC from 1994 to 1996.\n  And 2 United States Code 441(e): prohibits a foreign national from \nmaking a political contribution either directly or through another \nperson. Also prohibits anyone from accepting such contributions.\n  Pauline Kanchanalak contributed $135,000 which the DNC had to return \nwhen it was revealed the contribution was actually from her mother-in-\nlaw. She visited the White House 26 times, she testified. Yet, has she \nbeen before a grand jury? Has this administration done anything to \ncompel her testimony for laundering funds? I do not think so.\n  Charlie Trie contributed $789,000 to the President's legal defense \nfund which we heard testimony that some of the checks were laundered \nthrough a Taiwan-based religious sect, Suma Ching Hai. He also received \na steady stream of wire transfers from foreign sources from 1994 to \n1996, totally $1.4 million, some of which came from Mr. Wu, his Macao-\nbased business partner.\n  Some people said, ``Well, we haven't seen any foreign money.'' They \nhave not had their eyes opened.\n  Mr. Trie had a lot of foreign money, $1.4 million, wired in, and he \nhad great access. This is a person who is a Little Rock restaurant \nbusinessman. And all of a sudden he is spending millions of dollars, \nhad unbelievable access to the White House. He visited the White House \nat least 37 times. He received a Presidential appointment to a foreign \npolicy commission, one that the President had to expand the number of \ncommissioners so he could serve on it.\n  John Huang directed a $50,000 contribution to the DNC through Hip \nHing Holdings which was reimbursed from Lippo's Indonesian \nheadquarters. John Huang and a DNC fundraiser, Maria Hsia ``Shaw,'' \ncollected $100,000 to $140,000 from Vice President Gore's Buddhist \nTemple fundraiser of which half had to be ordered returned from foreign \nsources. A lot of that money was laundered as we found out through \ntestimony. It happens to be illegal.\n  United States Code 201: prohibits any Federal official from receiving \nany benefit in return for official action. Johnny Chung brought in six \nChinese officials to hear the President's radio address and gave the \nFirst Lady's chief of staff a $50,000 check in the same week that he \nwas able to get them in. In exchange for $50,000, they were able to \nattend the radio address. That happens to be illegal. Has Mr. Chung \nbeen indicted? Has he been brought before a grand jury? Has he \ntestified before the Senate committee? No. Mr. Chung made a statement, \n``I see the White House like a subway; you have to put in the coins to \nopen the gates.''\n\n  I could go on and talk about Charlie Trie getting a Chinese arms \ndealer into a White House coffee with President Clinton. Only 4 days \nbefore the coffee, it is reported, Mr. Huang's arms trading company \nreceived special permission to import 100,000 special assault weapons, \nalthough there was a ban on the importation of these assault weapons.\n  United States Code 7201 prohibits evasion of income tax; United \nStates Code 371 prohibits conspiracy to defraud the United States. The \nBuddhist temple is a tax-exempt organization. They made contributions \nto Vice President Gore, they made contributions to other colleagues in \nthis body, they made contributions at the DNC with tax-exempt dollars. \nPeople were getting tax deductions, writing checks to the Buddhist \ntemple, and the Buddhist temple wrote political checks. Everybody else \nin the country who writes political checks has to do it with after-tax \ndollars. In this case, people got a tax deduction for contributing to a \nBuddhist temple, and it was the Buddhist temple who was making \ncontributions.\n  That is wrong. That is against the law. That is against the IRS Code. \nI just quoted the IRS Code. Who has been indicted on that? This is an \negregious violation of the law. It has happened time and time again.\n  My point is we need campaign reform. In my opinion, one of the best \nsteps we could take toward campaign reform would be to enforce the \nexisting law. Maybe we should enforce the existing law and find out \nwhere its shortcomings might be before we try to expand the law or \nredefine the law or change the law.\n  Now, Mr. President, I want to make a couple of comments concerning \nthe legislation that we have before the Senate, the so-called McCain-\nFeingold legislation. First, let me compliment the authors of the \nlegislation because I think they made some steps in the right \ndirection. They have improved it and taken off, as I can see, the \nspending caps. They have taken off the ban which, incidentally, I think \nis clearly unconstitutional. They have taken off the ban on PAC's, \npolitical action committees. Those are steps in the right direction.\n  They did a couple of things, though, that need to be improved upon, \none of which is they said, well, we are going to codify Beck. We are \ngoing to make sure union members can get their money back. That is the \nlanguage I have heard bandied about on the floor. Mr. President, that \nis not good enough.\n  I firmly believe we should make sure that all Americans have \nvoluntary contributions to campaigns. No Americans should be compelled \nto contribute to a campaign, whether they work for a business, whether \nthey are a member of the union, or whether they are not a member. Some \nsay that is an antiunion provision, a killer amendment. I beg to \ndiffer. If we are going to pass campaign\n\n[[Page S10144]]\n\nreform this year, we will pass a provision that makes campaign \ncontributions voluntary for all Americans.\n  I feel very, very strongly about this. You might say, where did this \ncome from? It came from a town meeting I had in Collinsville, OK, when \nan employee of American Airlines held his hand up, and one of the first \nquestions he asked was, ``Senator Nickles, I really don't like my money \nbeing taken away from me on a monthly basis without consent to be used \nto elect people and support issues I don't agree with. That is not \nAmerica. That is not right.'' The company the person worked for \nhappened to be American Airlines. He happened to be what some \npeople call a blue-collar, middle-income American. He is a great \nAmerican. He is a union guy. He is prounion. He just wants to have a \nvoice on whether or not he is going to contribute to a political party \nor not.\n\n  I happen to agree with that. I happen to be a Republican, but I don't \nwant anybody taking my money to spend it for political purposes without \nmy consent. It would be over my body. I don't think anybody should be \ncompelled to contribute to a different campaign or to a campaign they \ndon't agree with. If you are going to have compulsory campaign \ncontributions, you have lost real freedom, you have lost your political \nfreedom. To say, ``We will give you information on how you can get a \nrefund,'' is not satisfactory. That is after the fact. That is after \nyour money has already been taken away from you, spent in a way you \ndidn't like, and, ``Oh, yes, you can file for a refund. Incidentally, \nyou have to go through a lot of trouble if you file.''\n  Guess what? You can't be a member of the union. Under the Beck \nlanguage we have in the McCain bill and under the language that is \ncurrently out, if you get a refund, you have to be basically a nonunion \nmember. You can't vote in union elections. You can't decide who would \nbe president of that union. You can't have any impact on the collective \nbargaining strategy. Maybe you want to be a member of the union. Maybe \nit is the thing to do, but you disagree with the union's political \nagenda. Right now you don't have a choice. You can't have both. You \ncan't be in the union and say, ``No, I don't want my money going to \nelect liberal Democrats or to elect people who have a social agenda \nthat I disagree with.'' You don't have that option under current law.\n  We will change that. If we are going to have campaign reform this \nyear, we will have the underlining promise that all campaign \ncontributions will be voluntary, period. Every employee that works for \nany company should know his campaign contributions will be voluntary. \nIf he doesn't want to make them, he doesn't have to make them, period, \nwhether they are a member of the union, not a member of the union, \nwhether they work for a company that doesn't have a union, they should \nall know, nobody should be compelled to contribute to a political \ncampaign against their will. Nobody.\n  So that is one of the amendments we have up here. I don't look at it \nas a killer amendment. I tell my colleagues I am willing to negotiate. \nI heard Senator McCain say he is willing to negotiate. I am willing to \nnegotiate. Senator Lott asked me to see if we couldn't work out a \nbipartisan bill. I am willing to work with my colleagues.\n  I mentioned earlier, I think the McCain-Feingold bill took some steps \nin the right direction. I think it maybe has a couple of steps further \nto go. This is one of them. This is one of them. If we are going to \nhave campaign reform, in this Senator's opinion, it will have to start \nwith the premise that all campaign contributions will be voluntary; \nmake sure that no one is compelled.\n  Then what else can we do? We can do a lot of things. Some say ban \nsoft money, others have proposals to limit soft money. Some say allow \nindividuals to do more. Some people have ideas requiring that a certain \npercentage has to be raised within an individual's home State or \ndistrict. I think all those things are legitimate for discussion. Let's \nput them all on the table. Some people have a proposal that says you \ncan't contribute to campaigns unless you can legally vote. I think that \nis a good proposal. Other people want to have free TV time. I don't \nhappen to agree with that. Some people want to have subsidized TV or \nhalf-rate TV for political candidates. I don't agree with that.\n\n  I am willing to talk about it. I am willing to negotiate. I am \nwilling to negotiate everything I mentioned, but the one fundamental \nthing I draw a line on is that the campaign contributions have to be \nvoluntary.\n  I take issue with anybody who says that is an antiunion bill. That is \na proworker provision. That is a profreedom provision. It is basically \nsaying no one should be compelled to contribute to a campaign against \ntheir will. That is a fundamental American freedom. We should be \nashamed of ourselves for making anybody be compelled to contribute to a \ncampaign against their will.\n  We will fix that. I hope we will fix it. I believe we will fix it. I \nalso believe that will be part of our bill, and then I will tell my \ncolleagues I don't look at it as a killer amendment, because I'm \nwilling to work with them to try to pass real, substantive campaign \nreform.\n  Keep it constitutional, do not limit speech, encourage participation, \nmake it possible for more people to participate, do not come up with a \nsystem that guarantees incumbents' advantage. I am more than willing to \ndo other things that would limit incumbents' advantage. We can say, \nincumbents, you can't do any mailings in an election year. That will \ncrimp it down a little bit. Incumbents, you cannot have carryover \nfunds. We can do a lot of things for real campaign reform that we could \npass in a bipartisan fashion.\n  I believe one fundamental freedom should exist that we should all \nagree on, Democrats and Republicans, and that is that all campaign \ncontributions should be voluntary. That is the reason why we have the \nPaycheck Protection Act. We don't want anybody reaching into your back \npocket, taking your money out, and spending it for political purposes \nunless you say OK. That is your back pocket. You are the one who worked \nhard; you are the one who put the money in there. Nobody--no group, no \nassociation, no employer--should be able to reach in and say, ``I will \ntake a little bit out and spend it the way I want without your \npermission.'' We will protect your paycheck and let you have control \nover it. That will be part of this bill. It will be the first amendment \nI believe we will vote on.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for it.\n  Mr. CLELAND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I enjoyed the remarks of my colleague \nfrom the great State of Oklahoma.\n  Mr. President, this is a day I have been waiting for since I had the \ngreat honor and privilege of taking my oath of office as a U.S. Senator \nback in January: a day when we are debating pending campaign finance \nreform legislation on the Senate floor. It has been a long and tortuous \nroad since January, and on more than one occasion, we have all heard \npronouncements that campaign finance reform was dead for this session, \nif not for all time.\n  That we are here today is a great tribute to the perseverence an \neffectiveness of my friends and colleagues, Senators McCain and \nFeingold, as well as the relentless commitment of the Democratic \nleader, Senator Daschle, to the cause of campaign finance reform.\n  I wish also to thank the distinguished majority leader for affording \nus the opportunity to debate, and cast meaningful votes, on this vital \nissue.\n  This is also a testimony to the groundswell of public opinion that is \ncompelling us to act on a very embarrassing matter, the way we raise \npolitical money.\n  Will Rogers said it best: ``It takes a lot of money now days to even \nget beat with.'' That was said over 70 years ago. It is certainly even \nmore true today.\n  But, in describing the current unremitting, unforgiving money chase \nwhich has overtaken our democratic process, especially, at the Federal \nlevel, in such a manner as to have a ``for sale sign'' on both ends of \nPennsylvania Avenue, I like the quote by W.C. Fields to the extent, \n``We must take the bull by the tail and face the situation.''\n  As we begin this Senate debate on whether or not we should enact far-\nreaching restrictions on the current way money is raised and spent for \nFederal office in America, we must face\n\n[[Page S10145]]\n\nthe situation that this current system is fatally flawed. It has enough \nloopholes in it to drive a fleet of 18 wheelers through it and is \nrendering our democratic process and our Government, which flows from \nthat process, vulnerable to influence peddling, the inordinate impact \nof special interest pressure groups, foreign influence and outright \ncorruption.\n  It's time to take the bull by the tail.\n  I for one have been fighting this battle for campaign financing \nreform for many years.\n  In 1974, in the wake of the Watergate scandal, I introduced \nlegislation in the Georgia Senate when I was a State senator limiting \ncampaign expenditures and contributions. As Georgia's secretary of \nstate in the 1980's and early 1990's, I fought for tighter limits on \ncampaign giving, and full disclosure of lobbying expenditures.\n  As a U.S. Senator sworn in this year on January 7, the first \nlegislation I signed as a cosponsor was the McCain-Feingold campaign \nfinancing reform bill. I am 1 of 45 of my Democratic colleagues and 4 \nof my Republican colleagues pledged to support the McCain-Feingold bill \nin its present form when it comes to the floor of the Senate.\n\n  Also, as a new Member of the Senate, I volunteered for service on the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, which has been conducting a far-\nreaching investigation into the multitude of alleged illegal and \nimproper activities associated with the 1996 campaign. Just last week, \nthe committee turned to consideration of suggested remedies for such \nabuses. All year long, I have listened to numerous witnesses, sifted \nthrough countless pages of testimony, read scores of media reports, and \notherwise immersed myself in the nitty-gritty of the financing of \nFederal campaigns last year. I also had the personal experience of \nenduring the current process in my own race for the U.S. Senate in \n1996.\n  Sitting in these hearings and seeing the sordid tale of the money \nchase in 1996, has turned my stomach. I also think the American public \nhas viewed all this with increasing disgust. What I have witnessed, \nheard, and read has made me even more convinced than ever that we must \nstrengthen our campaign financing laws, now, and provide strong \nenforcement through the Federal Election Commission of these laws, or \nrisk seeing our elections process, which is supposed to be conducted \nbetween the candidates, the press, and the voters, be swept away in a \ntidal wave of big bucks. Unless we act now, we will only see the power \nof special interest groups, corporations, and unions to pedal influence \ngrow. We will only see our system more and more vulnerable to foreign \ngovernments and unscrupulous individuals. Unless we tighten our laws, \nwe will see our system more and more operating against the public \ninterest.\n  I don't think our Founding Fathers, especially Thomas Jefferson and \nJames Madison, had that in mind when they helped create this \nGovernment.\n  Mr. President, the other day I was over in the Library of Congress \nand received a marvelous book by James Madison, titled ``The Search for \nNationhood.'' Mr. President, I am afraid that more and more candidates \nfor Federal office are not so much in search of fulfilling our search \nfor nationhood as they are for fulfilling the search for money.\n  I certainly don't think they had that in mind when they led the \neffort to create the U.S. Senate. Jefferson and Madison led the way to \ncreate the Senate to look at the long view of American government, and \nprovide a balanced approach for the future of our country.\n  Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence \nstated in that magnificent document that the Founding Fathers had \npledged their lives, fortunes and sacred honor. They didn't say that in \norder to set up a democratic form of government that one had to spend \ntheir lives to pursue a fortune to run for public office and jeopardize \ntheir honor in the process.\n  Opponents of McCain-Feingold tend to concentrate their spoken \ncriticisms on its alleged violations of free speech. Those criticisms \nmistakenly equate money with speech. It is an equation which inevitably \nleads to the conclusion that the paid speech of the millionaire will \nhave greater weight and influence than the opinions and expressions of \nthe common man and woman.\n  Certainly there can be little doubt about the commitment of James \nMadison, Father of the Constitution, an architect of the Bill of \nRights, and President of the United States, to the great cause of free \nspeech. But listen to what Madison wrote in The Federalist Papers:\n\n       But what is government itself, but the greatest of all \n     reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no \n     government would be necessary. In framing a government which \n     is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty \n     lies in this: you must first enable the government to control \n     the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control \n     itself.\n\n  While he was certainly both a revolutionary and a visionary, Madison \nnever allowed himself to stray too far from the practical realities of \nthe world in which he lived. To him, the lack of human perfection was \nthus the basis for government, and a factor which must be taken into \naccount in providing a government with sufficient powers to accomplish \nits necessary functions, while at the same time holding it fully \naccountable to the governed. We must hold those who run for Federal \nelective office fully accountable to tight regulations and complete \ndisclosure in the raising and spending of campaign dollars.\n  Last week on the Senate floor, Senator Thompson delivered a very fine \nstatement on campaign finance reform and free speech in which he \npointed out that, in the real world, this current debate about campaign \nfinance reform and free speech is not one of absolutes, as some would \nhave it. This is not a choice between a system of unfettered free \nspeech and government regulation, for our current system recognizes \nmany, many instances in which there is a legitimate, and \nconstitutional, public interest in regulating speech, from slander \nlaws, to prohibitions on the disclosure of the identities of American \nintelligence agents, to the campaign arena itself, with a longstanding \nban on corporate contributions, and quarter-century and older limits on \nother forms of contributions and disclosure requirements.\n  So the debate really isn't about free speech. TV isn't free, yet it's \nthe main vehicle by which Federal candidates connect to their voters, \nand the single most important factor driving up campaign costs. In the \nwords of Dr. Norm Ornstein, a noted political scientist and recent \nwitness in the Governmental Affairs hearing, the question is not free \nspeech, but whether we will erect some fences to prevent the worst \nabuses of campaign financing to occur. I'm for tighter fences, to \nprevent the horse from getting out of the barn next time.\n  Campaign finance reform opponents also sometimes claim to be \nconcerned that such efforts will further increase the advantage \ncurrently enjoyed by incumbents. Even on its face, I have a hard time \ntaking this argument seriously. I am aware of very, very few cases in \nthe real world of contemporary American politics, whether at the \nFederal, State, or local level, where incumbents do not enjoy a \nsubstantial advantage over challengers under the current system. And, \nit is difficult to imagine any situation under which any form of \ncampaign limits, whether or contributions or spending, will not \nconstrain far more the incumbents rather than the challengers.\n  For example, earlier this year, the group Public Citizen presented \none of the first detailed analyses of the likely impact of the \nexpenditure limits contained in the original version of McCain-\nFeingold, based not on theoretical conjecture, but on the actual \nresults had S. 25 been in effect in the most recent elections for each \nof the 100 U.S. Senate seats, based on the 1992, 1994, and 1996 Senate \nelections. The findings of the Public Citizen study clearly demonstrate \nthat had the provisions of McCain-Feingold been in effect since 1992, \nSenate campaign spending would have been reduced by $259 million--\nthat's $259 million--with far more of this reduction coming among \nincumbents than challengers. While fully 90 percent of all the Senate \nincumbents were able to exceed McCain-Feingold's spending limits, just \n24 percent of all the challengers did so. In other words, 9 out of 10 \nSenate incumbents would have been forced to spend less by McCain-\nFeingold, while only one in four challengers would have seen their \nspending constrained. This should\n\n[[Page S10146]]\n\nput to rest any legitimate argument that spending limits are an \nincumbent's protection measure. The record does not bear this out, and \nas the figures demonstrate, this is not even a close call.\n\n  Some also charge that McCain-Feingold, in whatever version, would \nsomehow advantage Democrats more than Republicans. First of all, one of \nthe prime sponsors of S. 25 is my good friend and fellow Vietnam \nveteran, the distinguished senior Senator from Arizona. Senator McCain \nis many things. He is a wonderful human being, and a fine Senator. But, \nhe is also a very faithful Republican. He would never put forward a \nproposal which would harm is party.\n  Once again, the Public Citizen report bears out this commonsense \nwisdom.\n  Since 1992, almost identical portions of Democratic and Republican \nSenate candidates would have exceeded McCain-Feingold spending limits: \n54 percent of Democrats, 59 percent of Republicans. You can't get much \nmore of a level playing field than that.\n  And, while the revised version of McCain-Feingold does not contain \nspending limits, the principles of greater constraint on incumbents \nthan challengers, and of relatively even partisan impact, applies to \nsoft money and issue advocacy advertising as well.\n  As I have told anyone who has asked, I like being a U.S. Senator. \nHaving the privilege of representing my State in this body, where such \ngiants as Clay, Webster, Calhoun, Norris, LaFollette, Dirksen, and \nRussell have served with distinction is the greatest honor of my life. \nBut, sitting here day by day, with evidence continually mounting in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee hearings of campaign abuses, and public \nopinion surveys chronicling the loss of public trust in the political \nprocess, not to mention the ongoing massive fundraising which takes \nplace all the time in the Nation's Capital, I cannot but conclude that \nthe current campaign finance system is broken and cries out for reform.\n  We have heard a lot of talk, and we will hear more talk this week and \nnext, about these abuses, and about the general topic of campaign \nfinance reform. But, the time is coming when we must take action. \nCertainly, the revised McCain-Feingold package is not perfect; it is \nnot all that I think needs to be done to remedy our problem, but it is \nan essential first step aimed at dealing with the worst of these abuses \nwhich currently plague our campaign system.\n  The revised bipartisan campaign finance reform proposal does not \ncontain spending limits, does not contain limits on PAC's, and does not \nprovide free or discounted broadcast air time for Federal candidates, \nall of which I personally favor. It places no limits on what groups or \norganizations say in their campaign-related communications.\n  What the proposal does do is this: It bans soft money contributions \nto and spending by the national political parties--something that has \nbeen the bane of those that care about campaign finance reform, and who \nhave witnessed the testimony before the Government Affairs Committee. \nIt should be noted that the pursuit of soft money is at the root of \nalmost all of the questionable fundraising activities identified to \ndate by the Governmental Affairs Committee upon which I sit.\n\n  I might say also that if you ban soft money then all contributions, \nwhether you are a union member, a citizen, stockholder, would be \nvoluntary because you would have only two ways you could contribute: \nIndependently on your own, or through a political action committee \nregistered with the Federal Elections Commission. That is voluntarily \nas well.\n  The bill modifies the definition of ``express advocacy.'' These are \nads, unfortunately, that don't provide a clear distinction between \ncommunications used to advocate issues from those used to back or \noppose candidates. This bill would require that clear distinction.\n  Under the proposal, independent groups will be free to air either \nkind of ad, but to qualify for the ``issue ad'' designation and thereby \nto avoid the disclosure and financing requirements applied to \ncandidates and party committees, they merely have to not use a \ncandidate's name or else run more than 60 days before the election. \nThis hardly represents an infringement on free speech.\n  It improves the enforcement of existing laws by expanding disclosure \nand Federal Election Commission monitoring capability. It strengthens \ncurrent law in such areas as fundraising from Federal property, and the \nuse of the Congressional franking privilege.\n  It strictly codifies the Beck decision concerning the right of \nnonunion members to have a refund of any union fees used for political \npurposes to which they object.\n  It bars political parties from making coordinated expenditures on \nbehalf of candidates who do not agree to limit their own personal \nspending on their own behalf.\n  It bans all campaign contributions and expenditures by foreign \nsources.\n  In addition to this core package, Senators McCain and Feingold will \noffer an amendment, which I strongly support, to establish a voluntary \nsystem in which those candidates who raise a majority of their \ncontributions in their home State, accept no more than 25 percent of \ntotal contributions from political action committees, and spend no more \nthan $50,000 of their own money in the election would receive a 50-\npercent discount on television costs.\n  We must have controls--rigid, well-enforced controls--on campaign \nfinancing because campaigns are the embryo of democratic government \nitself. Men are not angels, yet we must find ways to govern ourselves \nin a fair and democratic manner. Therefore, we must enact laws to \ncontrol the financing of campaigns for Federal office in a fair and \ndemocratic manner.\n  My colleagues, the country is watching what we do on campaign finance \nreform. Make no mistake about this. They are understandably skeptical \nthat we will take action to reform the system under which we all were \nelected. Their expectations for our action are quite low. Let's \nsurprise the public as well as ourselves. Let's prove that physicians \ncan heal themselves. Let's take the bull by the tail.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the distinguished efforts of two \ncourageous Senators, John McCain and Russell Feingold, who through \ntheir diligence, persistence, and strong belief in upholding the finest \ntraditions of our democratic process have brought us to this hour.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me first thank my friend, the \nSenator from Georgia, for his kind remarks, but more importantly for \nhis steadfast support on the issue of campaign finance reform.\n  The first thing that the Senator from Georgia did when he became a \nMember of this distinguished body was to cosponsor our legislation. But \nhe didn't stop there. He has been out here every single time we have \nhad to fight the battle. And I know he will be again. I thank very much \nthe Senator from Georgia for his support.\n  I also want to thank my colleagues, Senators Levin, Lieberman, \nDorgan, Collins, and, of course, Senator McCain for taking the time on \nwhat is usually a quiet Monday to have a very intense debate to \ncontinue this discussion on campaign finance reform.\n  Mr. President, one of the most important tactics that has been used \nalready in this debate is to single out a couple of provisions of the \nMcCain-Feingold modification and to suggest that they are the entire \nbill. It happens that the provisions that have been discussed--the \nissues having to do with express advocacy, and a couple of others--are \nvery important provisions, but you would swear that they were the whole \nbill. That is because it is virtually impossible to criticize or attack \nthe rest of the bill. Let us remember what is included in the entirety \nof the McCain-Feingold modification--the bill that we introduced today.\n  First of all, it completely bans soft money. We have heard virtually \nnothing on the floor effectively criticizing banning these $100,000, \n$200,000, and $500,000 contributions that have clearly undermined our \npolitical process and made a mockery of the fact that for almost a \ncentury corporations have not been allowed to give contributions to \ncampaigns directly, and for almost half a century labor unions have not \nbeen allowed to give contributions directly to campaigns. Our bill bans \nthat, and the other side apparently has dropped their concern about \nthat.\n\n[[Page S10147]]\n\n  There is also virtually no discussion of the fact that our bill \nstrongly improves the provisions having to do with disclosure of \ninformation about campaign contributions; and strengthens the hand of \nthe Federal Elections Commission so it can do its job; so we can \nenforce the current laws--the very argument that we have heard the \nmajority leader and the Senator from Kentucky make. ``Why don't we \nenforce the current law?''\n  Why no comment about the series of important provisions in our bill \nthat do exactly that, that improve disclosure and improve enforcement?\n  Why no comment on the lowering of contribution limits from $200 to \n$50? If somebody gives $100 to a candidate, we think this ought to be \nreported.\n  Why no comment on the fact that our bill strengthens the hand of the \nFederal Election Commission by tripling the penalty for knowing, \nwillful violations of Federal election law? This is exactly the kind of \nprovision that the other side claims we should have and yet fails to \nmention it is part of the bill.\n  Why no mention of the fact that our bill does provide for electronic \nfiling with the FEC on a daily basis of campaign contributions so that \nthe public does not have to wait and the media do not have to wait for \n6 months to find out whether a contribution occurred in close proximity \nto a vote? Our bill provides for that. Our bill provides that the FEC \nwould make campaign finance records available on the Internet within 24 \nhours of their filing.\n  The bill also strengthens the hand of the Federal Election Commission \nby permitting the FEC to conduct random audits at the end of a campaign \nto ensure compliance with Federal election law. We are strengthening \nthe hand of enforcement under the current law.\n  Why no discussion at all of the fact that our bill, in addition to \nthe other issues, makes it absolutely clear that campaign contributions \ncannot be used for personal purposes? You cannot buy a new suit with \ncampaign contributions. You cannot finance various family activities or \nmortgage payments or country club memberships. Some of this has been \ndone in the past. Why no comment on the fact that our bill tightens up \non that?\n  Why no reference to the fact that the McCain-Feingold bill requires \npolitical advertisements to carry a disclaimer that clearly identifies \nwho is responsible for the content of the campaign ad?\n  Do you know what really irritates my constituents in Wisconsin? It is \nall those negative ads and the fact that the candidates who put them \nout make sure that they are not identified, that people do not know who \nmade the ad? The McCain-Feingold bill says if you want to say it, you \ncan say it, but how about letting us know you are saying it. The other \nside completely ignores this provision that I think would be of great \nappeal to many members of the public.\n  Why doesn't the other side say anything about the fact that the \nMcCain-Feingold bill bans the practice of using mass mailings under the \nfranking privilege in an election year? We get rid of that. We get rid \nof that incumbent protection provision in current law that allows \nSenators to send out thousands, tens of thousands, of items at public \nexpense, at Government expense when they are running for reelection. We \nget rid of that. I happen to not do these mailings anyway. A number of \nSenators do not do them anyway. But we get rid of that in an election \nyear. But no comment whatsoever from the other side.\n  Our bill also clarifies, which is long overdue, that it should be \nabsolutely unlawful to raise any money or solicit any money on Federal \nproperty, whether it be in the White House or whether it be in the \nCapitol or whether it be in one of these Senate or House office \nbuildings. We do know that even Members of Congress have already said \nthat they have done that. This bill makes it clear that there are no \nexcuses for doing that in the future.\n  No reference from the other side except for a brief one to the fact \nthat we do begin in this bill to voluntarily provide an incentive to \ncandidates to limit their spending. Our bill, as we introduced it today \nas a modification to the underlying bill, says that if you contribute \nover $50,000 of your own personal money to a campaign, you can do that, \nbut you shouldn't be able to get the large party-coordinated \nexpenditures to assist you. We do that.\n  We have provisions relating to clarifying contributions regarding \nmoney contributions from foreign nationals.\n  All of this is in the bill. They are very good provisions. But yet, \nin an effort to distort what this bill is about, the focus has been on \nonly one or two provisions rather than the heart of the bill.\n  Mr. President, I should like to summarize the debate today by \npointing out that all of this emphasis on a couple of items in the bill \nto the exclusion of the rest of the bill is merely a prelude to the \nthree principal arguments that our opposition has raised thus far as we \nhave debated the issue on Friday and today.\n  The first argument has been the primary argument in the past, but it \nis flagging. The argument that our bill will be deemed unconstitutional \nby the U.S. Supreme Court just is not having the same luck it has had \nin the past.\n  The senior Senator from Kentucky recently said on one of the national \nnews shows with reference to me, he said:\n\n       Russ has got no constitutional experts with any credentials \n     who will say that this is going to be upheld in court.\n\n  That was on Fox News Sunday, September 14, 1997. Not one \nconstitutional expert, the Senator from Kentucky said, would support \nour view that the basic provisions of the bill are constitutional.\n  That was an unfortunate claim because 1 week later we were able to \nrelease a letter signed by 126 constitutional experts across this \ncountry representing 88 different institutions, including those in \nKentucky, saying just the opposite--126 constitutional scholars \nspecifically said that the ban on soft money and those provisions that \nrelate to providing voluntary incentives to candidates to limit their \nspending are perfectly constitutional within the ruling of the Supreme \nCourt 20 years ago in Buckley versus Valeo.\n  It is hard to read this chart because there are so many of them, \nbecause 126 of the leading constitutional experts in this country say \nthat this constitutional argument is wrong. In fact, the constitutional \nargument is nothing but a smokescreen because it has been shifting from \nmonth to month. First, it was the claim that the PAC ban was \nunconstitutional, even though the Senator from Kentucky knew very well \nthat we had a backup provision because of that concern which he himself \nhad introduced in the past. The Senator from Kentucky had proposed the \nvery provision that he said was unconstitutional. So then he shifted to \nsaying that banning soft money was unconstitutional.\n  Well, that is not working out very well after 126 constitutional \nscholars say just the opposite. There is no credible argument under \ncurrent law that banning that kind of contribution is unconstitutional. \nThere simply is no credible authority who believes that.\n  So the Senator from Kentucky shifts again. He says that providing \nvoluntary incentives to candidates to limit their spending is \nunconstitutional. But that is the very thing that Buckley versus Valeo \nlaid out as a mechanism by which you could limit spending voluntarily.\n  So now the Senator from Kentucky seems to have dropped all of these \nconstitutional arguments and all he has left now is to try to say that \nour attempt to clarify the meaning of express advocacy is \nunconstitutional. Well, he is wrong about that, too. But as he admitted \nin the Chamber today--and this is critical--in the worst-case scenario, \nin the very worst-case scenario, if he is right and we are wrong, the \nSupreme Court will simply strike that provision down.\n  Our bill is severable. What does that mean? It means that if the \nSupreme Court determines a provision is unconstitutional, they can \nsever that provision, leaving the rest of the bill intact. That's \nexactly what the Court did in the landmark case of Buckley versus \nValeo, where the Court said you can't have mandatory spending limits, \nand it severed that from the bill, but the Court did say you could have \ncontribution limits, which is what we have had for 20 years. This is \nwhere PAC's are limited to $10,000 per campaign, where individuals are \nlimited to $1,000 per individual. So the fact is that these \nconstitutional arguments, if they are\n\n[[Page S10148]]\n\nright, in the worst-case scenario, will simply be dealt with by the \nSupreme Court doing their job. Now, why can't we do our job and let the \nSupreme Court do their job?\n  Where was the concern of the Senator from Kentucky about this when he \nvoted for the Communications Decency Act, saying that it violated the \nfirst amendment? And the Supreme Court voted 9 to nothing: No, you \ncan't do that. It was taken care of, it was struck down. It is not a \nlaw. So, this is a smokescreen. Mr. President, 126 constitutional \nscholars have already said that the basic provisions of our bill are \nconstitutional.\n  So, the constitutional argument is flagging. So the opponents of \nreform, who I think sometimes can also be known as the filibusterers, \ngo to a second tactic, that is killing the bill by trying to force a \nfilibuster. Today, not surprisingly--the majority leader had his choice \nof any amendment he could offer. That is his right. He could offer a \nsubstitute amendment, a whole new bill, he could offer a simple \namendment having to do with certain kinds of contributions or aspects \nof soft money or FEC enforcement--he could choose any amendment he \nwanted. What did the majority leader choose? And what did he use to \nfill up the tree? He used a provision specifically and harshly directed \nat labor unions. The majority leader, and I do appreciate his letting \nus have this bill come to the floor, came out here and said that that \nchoice, to be the first item we debate, was not intended as a poison \npill.\n  What does that mean? What it means is, he is saying he didn't pick \nthat amendment as a way to cause a filibuster. But this does not square \nwith what the majority leader said last Friday. He was quoted in the \nWall Street Journal, saying ``I set it up so they will be filibustering \nme.'' That is what I am talking about. He had his choice. He came out \nhere, he purposely offered a strong antilabor amendment, he set it up \nin the hope that he would force Members on the other side of the aisle \nto filibuster the bill so that he and his colleagues would not be \nblamed for killing it. How can you say that's not a poison pill, if \nyour very statement was that you set it up so the other side would \nfilibuster? That is the definition of a poison pill. Let no one mistake \nthis. This is an intentional effort to kill campaign finance reform.\n  Why, if this concern about this issue was so great, was it not \nbrought up earlier? This is S. 9, that he has brought up. It is a bill \nI believe offered by the Senator from Oklahoma. Why was this not \nbrought out to the floor earlier? Why is this the item that we lead \nwith, if it is not intended to destroy campaign finance reform and make \nsure somebody else gets blamed for it? It is a poison pill. It's a more \ndangerous attack than the flimsy constitutional arguments. It does run \nthe risk--it does run the risk of destroying the bill, and everyone \nshould know that when we vote on the poison pill antilabor amendment, \nthat is exactly what it does.\n  Most of the time that has been taken up on the floor of the Senate by \nthose who seek to kill this legislation has been devoted to a third \nattempt. That third attempt is to make the public believe that this \nbill somehow creates a giant Government bureaucracy that is going to \nregulate their speech. If I could just show a copy of the bill--the \nproblem with that is, in the past, when folks have tried to argue that \na bill is a huge Government bureaucracy bill, they hold up the bill. \nThey hold up the President's budget: 2,000 pages. They hold up the \nhealth care bill and they weigh it on a scale. But this is not going to \nwork with the McCain-Feingold bill. It is only 55 pages. It is pretty \nhard, the way lawyers write, to set up a giant Government bureaucracy \nin 55 pages.\n  But that is what they want folks to believe. They want folks to \nbelieve that somehow we are creating a new world of campaign financing \nthat will change the way things are done in this country and will \nchange the ability of members of the public to speak their mind in an \nelection. I think it is just the opposite. I think what the current \nsystem is, I think the status quo, that the Senator from Kentucky \ndefends so vigorously, is so at variance with the system that I grew up \nto believe in that it is shocking. I think we have come so far from the \nnotion of one person one vote; so far from the notion that every child \nborn in this country could grow up to serve in the House or serve in \nthe Senate, or perhaps even be President, that it is an embarrassment.\n  Look at what Mr. Tamraz said recently about this system and how he \napparently gamed it. He said, before the Governmental Affairs Committee \non September 18, 1997, in response to a question--the question was a \nvery direct question:\n\n       Was one of the reasons that you made these contributions \n     because you believed it might get you access? That's my \n     question.\n\n  Mr. Tamraz' response was very straightforward. He said:\n\n       Senator, I'm going even further. It's the only reason--to \n     get access, but what I'm saying is once you have access, what \n     do you do with it? Is it something bad or something good. \n     That's what we have to see.\n\n  When I heard that comment from Mr. Tamraz I just couldn't help but \nthink how far we had come from the America that I was brought up to \nbelieve in. Maybe I was naive, growing up back in Janesville, WI, but I \nreally believed it when my parents told me that, ``You may not be the \nrichest kid in town, you may not be the most powerful person in the \ntown or in the State or in the country. But every American has the same \nvote. Your vote counts the same as a Rockefeller's.'' That was the name \nwe used in those days.\n\n  So, when you look at the story of what has happened in the last 30 \nyears, I can't help but reflect that when I was 7 years old and John F. \nKennedy was running for President, the way that we would sort of \nobserve a Presidential campaign was not just through the television. \nThere were a few television sets. You could go out to the Sauk County \n4-H fair. There was a little Democratic booth. Just a few feet away was \na little Republican booth. And there was a little ribbing going back \nand forth. You know, those booths have not moved an inch in 37 years. \nThey are in the exact same place they always were. That is where the \ncampaign was, people talking to each other.\n  Nobody said anything about raising money. I'm sure they had to fund \ntheir campaigns, but that was not what the news stories were about. I'm \nsure the Senator from Utah, who is on the floor, would agree with me, \nthat that was not the nature of the discussion, who had the most money \nto win an election in those days. Then, as I got into my teen years, \nthe civil rights movement came upon us, the Vietnam war, the beginning \nof the environmental movement, the women's movement--so many political \nmovements; on the other side of the political spectrum, the great \nconcern that arose about law and order in this country. These were the \ngreat discussions of our time, as well as others.\n  I recall some kind of conversation about Howard Hughes giving some \nmoney to both Presidential candidates, but it was sort of an odd story, \nan esoteric story. ``What is going on? Why would this rich fellow, a \nrecluse, give all this money to Presidential campaigns?'' It was not \nthe stuff of public life. It was not the news, who was giving what \nmoney to what political party. In fact, the gentleman who used to hold \nthis seat before I did, a couple of Senators back, my friend Gaylord \nNelson, told me recently that in his distinguished career in Wisconsin \npolitics as a Member of this body for 18 years, he never once made a \nphone call to raise money. He never once picked up the phone and said: \nHey, I'm running for reelection, can you give me some money?\n  I suggest that those were the good old days. What the Senator from \nKentucky is trying to defend is a new world, where not only are \nSenators expected to make phone calls almost every day to raise money \nfor their campaigns, but where Senators and others are encouraged to \ncall up people and ask them for $100,000. This is not the system that I \ngrew up with. This is not the system that led the late Robert Kennedy \nto refer to politics as an honorable profession.\n  Then, in high school, the people used to rib me a little bit. I guess \nI was a little bit too open about my desire to go into politics. Some \nof them would say, because I talked so much I would be a good \npolitician, and other comments like that. But the one thing they never \nsaid to me was, ``Russ, if you want to go into politics you have to go \nout and make $10 million first; that there is an opening ante, there is\n\n[[Page S10149]]\n\nan opening fee, that you must be a millionaire.'' That we are, in \neffect, recreating here in Washington the House of Lords, which we \nfreed ourselves from over 200 years ago. Nobody ever said that to me.\n  Politics was still church dinners and Rotary clubs and the State fair \nand all those things that one may regard as corny. But the fact is, it \nwas a pretty good system. This is a lousy system; a system where \nsomebody pays $300,000 to get in a room to be with his competitor who \nhas paid $300,000, a room that none of us could ever get in. That is a \nlousy system.\n  I was still under the perhaps naive belief, in 1982 when I sought \nelection to the State senate in Wisconsin, my first race for public \noffice--I was under the illusion that money wasn't important. Thanks to \nthe good laws of the State of Wisconsin it wasn't terribly important.\n  I had no money, but the State law provided that if I could raise \n$17,000, the State would match it with $17,000 if I agreed to a $34,000 \nlimit and that that would be a reasonable amount for a campaign \nvoluntarily. That's what I did.\n  I wrote to every relative I had. I wrote to a few former professors \nand teachers of mine. They all sent in a few dollars. We had $17,000 by \nAugust, and we went out and campaigned. I went to the Sauk County Fair, \nwalked in parades, and had some very civil and nice debates with my \nopponent.\n  I do remember a brief moment, though, at the end of that campaign \nwhen one of the senior Democratic officials in the State called me up \nand said, ``Russ, you're going to lose if you don't borrow $10,000 for \nthe last few days.''\n  I said, ``I can't do that. I'm just not going to do that to my \nfamily.''\n  He was almost right, because I only won that election by 31 votes out \nof 47,000. It was the closest election in the history of the Wisconsin \nState Senate. But the fact is, it was reasonable--$35,000. It was \nsomething I could at least think about as a person of average means.\n  Now the same races in that same district, just 15 years later, cost \nsomething like $250,000, $300,000 just for a Wisconsin State Senate \nseat that pays somebody some $35,000 to $40,000. But yet I still \nbelieve, because I won by the slimmest of margins, that running for \noffice was not equal to having a lot of money.\n  I got a bit of a rude awakening, Mr. President, in 1987 when I \nstarted thinking about running for the U.S. Senate. I thought I had \namassed a decent record over the years as a Wisconsin State Senator, \nand I wanted to run against the incumbent senator. But as I went around \nthe State gradually for several years trying to build a grassroots \norganization, I wasn't asked what I had done in the State Senate; I \nwasn't asked what I had done before I was in the State Senate; I wasn't \nasked what my views might be. Almost every single encounter, whether \nwith the media or with a potential supporter, was, ``Russ, this is fine \nand good and you seem like a nice young fellow, but where are you going \nto get the money?''\n  ``Where are you going to get the money, Russ?''\n  ``How can you possibly think you have a right or an opportunity to \nrun for the U.S. Senate unless you are independently wealthy or if you \nare well connected to Washington?''\n  That was the message I was given over and over again. Anybody who \nknows the kind of race I went through--I had a lot of good fortune, \nobviously, because I am standing here--that was my biggest problem. I \nwasn't considered credible because I wasn't wealthy. That didn't feel \nto me like what my parents had told me. That didn't feel to me like the \nassurance that I would have a fair chance to compete with everyone else \nsimply because I am an American citizen. It felt really bad. Maybe it \nmade me work hard. Maybe it made me stay the course.\n  It got particularly difficult when I would go to a group with whom I \nhad a good relationship; for example, the independent bankers, a group \nwith whom I have a very good relationship. I always admired their \nindependence in Wisconsin. And I said to them, ``Could you give me some \nsupport for my race?''\n  They said, ``Well, we think you have done a good job, but we have to \ncheck in with Washington.'' There is a guy in Washington who makes this \ndecision.\n\n  Then when I checked in with some of my friends in the labor unions, \nwhom I probably do support on many, many issues, I thought they would \nbe able to decide at the local whether or not they would want to back \nme. But, no, they had to check in with Washington, with the Washington \ngatekeepers who want to kill this bill. That is what I learned about \nthe system.\n  Of course, partially because my two primary opponents were both very \nwell-heeled and attacked each other that I wound up winning the \nprimary. They used their money to make each other look pretty bad, and \nI wound up winning the primary because I was the other guy who was \nrunning. And that gave me momentum to win the final election.\n  As I stand here with these colleagues I admire greatly, sometimes I \nwonder, am I the last person of average wealth and income who will ever \nserve in this body? Is the door going to slam on people who actually \nworry about making ends meet, people who actually worry about their \nmortgage payment, as I do? Am I the last person who is not a \nmillionaire who will be invited to serve in this institution?\n  I don't think that is the way it will end up, but I can tell you \nthis, if we don't pass a reform like the one we have before us today, \nit will be. I cannot in good conscience look at a high school senior \ntoday, as I was in 1971, and say, ``You know, it would be great if you \npursued a political career; it will be wonderful; just learn the \nissues, work with people, show people that you are a natural leader.'' \nI can't just leave it at that. If I am being honest with a young \nperson, I would have to say, ``And you better darn well come up with \n$10 million or nobody is going to take you seriously.'' That hurts my \nimage of America that I have to say that to a high school senior today.\n  The opponents of this bill have absolutely no answer for those high \nschool students. They say somehow that free speech in America means \nthat they don't matter, it means that they can't participate, it means \nthat they don't have the same right that everyone else does to run for \nan office in the House or Senate and have some kind of a belief that \nthey can prevail.\n  Each of us, I suppose, wants to tell our own story of how we got \nhere, as I just did. It is a great honor to serve in this body. Less \nthan 2,000 Americans have ever done so. I appreciated it when the \nmajority leader the other day spoke to some of his concerns when he was \nrunning for office. This is the only issue where all the Members of the \nSenate are experts, because we have been through it and we know.\n  But the reason I am involved with this bill is that the senior \nSenator from Arizona had the courage to come to me and say, ``Look, \nwe've got to do something to change this system, to put aside our \npartisan differences.'' We just decided that we couldn't live with a \ncountry where a Presidential candidate would begin his campaign, make \nthe high point of his announcement for President the following \nstatement:\n\n       I have the most reliable friend you can have in American \n     politics and that is ready money.\n\n  That was a leading comment in an announcement for President of the \nUnited States. I don't remember either John F. Kennedy or Richard Nixon \nleading their campaigns in 1960 with that comment, on anyone else. That \nis a tragic commentary on where we have come over the years.\n  So that is what this really comes down to. You have heard the \nconstitutional arguments and have seen them fall. You see already an \nattempt to bring a ``poison pill'' out on the floor to kill this bill \nby making it too harsh for either side to accept and destroy its \nbipartisan nature. You have heard the effort to distort what this bill \nreally does by suggesting that somehow our bill will create a large \ngovernmental involvement in free speech.\n\n  The fact is, it is this system that is destroying free speech. It is \na system where people can give hundreds of thousands of dollars of \nunregulated money or give huge contributions or fundraisers of hard \nmoney to candidates that cut the average person out of the process. \nThis is the corporate democracy that we have come to.\n  So, in the coming days, we will hear more of the efforts of our \nopponents to\n\n[[Page S10150]]\n\ntake each little piece of the bill and indicate that there is a problem \nhere or a problem there. Of course, that is the purpose of the debate. \nBut we are ready, Senator McCain and I, to negotiate to solve some of \nthe real problems. But what we will not tolerate is the suggestion that \nwe should do nothing. Our opposition has no alternative. They have no \nanswer to the careening role of money in American politics. They just \nwant to kill this bill and get back to the business of running \nelections.\n  Mr. President, there will be much more to say on this bill.\n  All I can say is that we will not allow this debate to become mired \nin the minutia of important issues that ultimately would be resolved by \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. We will come back again and again to the \ncentral point that this is still a country of one person-one vote, not \n$1 million-1 million votes. And it is still a country where every high \nschool student should at least be able to think or dream about \nparticipating in the process without having to become a \nmultimillionaire first.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have listened to my colleague from \nWisconsin chat about these problems. You know, in all honesty, I wonder \nsometimes if we do not treat the American public like they are idiots, \nwhen in fact the American public is a very smart collective group of \npeople.\n  You know, I just do not see why in the world we have to have \ngovernment interfere with the first amendment privileges of free \nspeech, just to mention one constitutional issue involved here, just \nbecause some think there are millionaires in the Senate. There have \nalways been millionaires in the Senate, as far as I know, at least in \nthis century. But there have always been a number of Senators--and \nthere is a great number of Senators here today--who are not \nmillionaires who made it here the hard way, even under this present \nsystem, and who will always be able to make it because the American \npeople are not idiots.\n  They are smart. They know what is going on. They have the ability to \nchoose between competing candidacies. Every once in a while you know \nsome of us worry about it because of some people who make it here, but, \nin all honesty, it seems to me that to put another layer of Federal \nregulations on what people can say and do in politics is not the way to \ndo it, and it presumptively seems to believe that the American people \ndo not have the capacity collectively or individually to make right \ndecisions for themselves with regard to politics.\n  The thing that I find heinous and offensive in the current political \nstructure is that we have all kinds of advocacy groups out there, some \nof which support only one party to the exclusion of the other, who \nspend millions and millions of dollars that are never reported in this \npolitical process.\n  I will just cite with particularity one group. I remember when the \nAFL-CIO decided they were going to spend $35 million in advocacy during \nthe last campaign. Now, we Republicans all understand that because \nvirtually every penny of that goes for liberal Democrats. The only \nRepublicans that they ever support --and there are very few of those; \nand if there is a moderate-to-liberal Democrat, they will support the \nDemocrat every time over even a liberal Republican for the most part--\nvery few of the liberal Republicans are supported by them, but if any \nare, they have to be very liberal.\n  So virtually every dollar of the union movement goes into liberal \nDemocratic Party politics. But $35 million is a drop in the bucket \nbecause the Congressional Research Service mentions that in every 2-\nyear election cycle the trade union movement puts between $100 and $500 \nmillion into the political process, not one penny of which is reported \nin any filing or disclosure form.\n  There is nothing in the Republican Party that comes close to that \ntype of economic leverage, and yet I have to say McCain-Feingold does \nabsolutely nothing about that. There is good reason for it, because you \nwould be restricting the right of the trade union movement in this \ncountry to express their viewpoints with regard to their political \nbeliefs. But you are not talking about distortion.\n\n  Mr. President, $100 to $500 million every 2 years in local, State, \nand Federal politics, not one penny of which is reported. The $35 \nmillion was reported because those were direct contributions to \nindividuals, or actually most of it was not reported because most of it \nwas soft money that was used to advocate for Democratic, liberal \nDemocratic Party politics.\n  In fact, ask conservative Democrats how much union money they get as \na general rule. Not very much. So you know, I sometimes think that we \nbeat our gums in here over what appear to be on the surface important \nprinciples but which really in reality would undermine the very \nconstitutional process that we have.\n  In that regard, let me just mention that I think one of the most \nprescient articles on this subject ever written was written by George \nWill in the Washington Post yesterday. I know it has been mentioned \nhere on the floor before. But let me just read a little bit from that \narticle.\n  I did not come here wanting to talk about campaign finance \n``reform,'' but I did want to say these few remarks. But I did read \nthis today, and I brought it with me. He just says, ``Here Come the \nSpeech Police,'' which is the title of the article--``Here Come the \nSpeech Police.'' George goes on to say:\n\n       Almost nothing that preoccupies Washington is as important \n     as Washington thinks almost all its preoccupations are. But \n     now Congress is considering some version of the McCain-\n     Feingold bill, which raises ``regime-level'' questions. It \n     would continue the change for the worse of American \n     governance. And Washington's political class hopes the bill's \n     real importance will be underestimated.\n       With a moralism disproportionate to the merits of their \n     cause, members of that class--including the exhorting, \n     collaborative media--are mounting an unprecedentedly sweeping \n     attack on freedom of expression. Nothing in American \n     history--not the left's recent campus ``speech codes,'' not \n     the right's depredations during 1950s McCarthyism or the \n     1920s ``red scare,'' not the Alien and Sedition Acts of the \n     1790s--matches the menace to the First Amendment posed by \n     campaign ``reforms'' advancing under the protective \n     coloration of political hygiene.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 28, 1997]\n\n                      Here Come the Speech Police\n\n                          (by George F. Will)\n\n       Almost nothing that preoccupies Washington is as important \n     as Washington thinks almost all its preoccupations are. But \n     now Congress is considering some version of the McCain-\n     Feingold bill, which raises ``regime-level'' questions. It \n     would continue the change for the worse of American \n     governance. And Washington's political class hopes the bill's \n     real importance will be underestimated.\n       With a moralism disproportionate to the merits of their \n     cause, members of that class--including the exhorting, \n     collaborative media--are mounting an unprecedented sweeping \n     attack on freedom of expression. Nothing in American \n     history--not the left's recent campus ``speech codes,'' not \n     the right's depredations during 1950s McCarthyism or the \n     1920s ``red scare,'' not the Alien and Sedition Acts of the \n     1790s--matches the menace to the First Amendment posed by \n     campaign ``reforms'' advancing under the protective \n     coloration of political hygiene.\n       Such earlier fevers were evanescent, leaving no \n     institutional embodiments when particular passions abated. \n     And they targeted speech of particular political content. \n     What today's campaign reformers desire is a steadily \n     thickening clot of laws and an enforcing bureaucracy to \n     control both the quantity and the content of all discourse \n     pertinent to politics. By the logic of their aims, reformers \n     cannot stop short of that. This is so, regardless of the \n     supposed modesty of the measure Congress is debating.\n       Reformers first empowered government to regulate ``hard'' \n     money--that given to particular candidates. But there remains \n     the ``problem'' of ``soft'' money--that given to parties for \n     general political organizing and advocacy. Reformers call \n     this a ``loophole.'' Reformers use that word to stigmatize \n     any silence of the law that allows unregulated political \n     expression. So now reformers want to ban ``soft'' money. But \n     the political class will not stop there.\n       Its patience is sorely tried by the insufferable public, \n     which persists in exercising its First Amendment right of \n     association to organize in groups as different as the Sierra \n     Club and the National Rifle Association. One reason people so \n     organize is to collectively exercise their First Amendment \n     right of free speech pertinent to politics. Therefore \n     reformers want to arm the speech police with additional \n     powers to ration the permissible amount of ``express \n     advocacy,'' meaning\n\n[[Page S10151]]\n\n     speech by independent groups that advocates the election or \n     defeat of an identifiable candidate.\n       But the political class will not stop there. Consider mere \n     issue advocacy--say, a television commercial endorsing \n     abortion rights, mentioning no candidate and not mentioning \n     voting, but broadcast in the context of a campaign in which \n     two candidates differ about abortion rights. Such \n     communications can influence the thinking of voters. Can't \n     have that, other than on a short leash held by the \n     government's speech police. So restriction of hard money \n     begets restriction of soft, which begets restriction of \n     express advocacy, which begets regulation of issue advocacy--\n     effectively, of all civic discourse.\n       The political class is not sliding reluctantly down a \n     slippery slope, it is eagerly skiing down it, extending its \n     regulation of political speech in order to make its life less \n     stressful and more secure. Thus is the First Amendment \n     nibbled away, like an artichoke devoured leaf by leaf.\n       This is an example of what has been called ``the Latin \n     Americanization'' of American law--the proliferation of \n     increasingly rococo laws in attempts to enforce fundamentally \n     flawed laws. Reformers produce such laws from the bleak, \n     paternalistic premise that unfettered participation in \n     politics by means of financial support of political speech is \n     a ``problem'' that must be ``solved.''\n       One reason the media are complacent about such restrictions \n     on (others') political speech is that restrictions enhance \n     the power of the media as the filters of political speech, \n     and as unregulated participants in a shrunken national \n     conversation. Has the newspaper in which this column is \n     appearing ever editorialized to the effect that restrictions \n     on political money--restrictions on the ability to buy \n     broadcast time and print space and other things the Supreme \n     Court calls ``the indispensable conditions for meaningful \n     communication''--do not restrict speech? If this newspaper \n     ever does, ask the editors if they would accept revising the \n     First Amendment to read:\n       ``Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of the \n     press, but Congress can restrict the amount a newspaper may \n     spend on editorial writers, reporters and newsprint.''\n       As Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican, and \n     others filibuster to block enlargement of the federal speech-\n     rationing machinery, theirs is arguably the most important \n     filibuster in American history. Its importance will be--\n     attested by the obloquies they will receive from the herd of \n     independent minds eager to empower the political class to \n     extend controls over speech about itself.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me just quote a couple of other paragraphs because I \nthink this article really sums it up. I do not know how anybody could \ndisagree with this article. I am skipping over quite a bit of it which \nI think is worthy of consideration by anybody, but let me just read a \ncouple more paragraphs:\n\n       The political class is not sliding reluctantly down a \n     slippery slope, it is eagerly skiing down it, extending its \n     regulation of political speech in order to make its life less \n     stressful and more secure. Thus is the First Amendment \n     nibbled away, like an artichoke devoured leaf by leaf.\n       This is an example of what has been called ``the Latin \n     Americanization'' of American law--the proliferation of \n     increasingly rococo laws in attempts to enforce fundamentally \n     flawed laws.

And it sums it up pretty well:\n\n       Has the newspaper in which this column is appearing ever \n     editorialized to the effect that restrictions on political \n     money--restrictions on the ability to buy broadcast time and \n     print space and other things the Supreme Court calls ``the \n     indispensable conditions for meaningful communication''--do \n     not restrict speech?

He sums it up better than anybody I know. Frankly, I \ncommend this article to anybody who cares about free speech rights, \nthat this bill, as modified, would eviscerate.\n  I don't quite agree with George Will, that this may be the most \nimportant constitutional filibuster in history, but it is certainly one \nof the most important. I know of others that have been, I think, equal \nin importance, not the least of which is the debate we had on the \nresignation of the President a few years ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/29/senate-section/article/S10103-5", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. HATCH.

SCHOOLS IS A BAD IDEA\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, tomorrow morning the Senate will vote on \nthe creation of the first federally funded private school voucher \nprogram in the Nation.\n  It is no accident that this new voucher program is being debated on \nthe D.C. appropriations bill. None of us has a constituency in the \nDistrict of Columbia. We can do anything to the District, and we are \nunaccountable to its voters for our actions. And in recent years, \nCongress has done quite a bit to the District of Columbia.\n  Two years ago, in recognition of poor city management and extreme \nbudgetary problems, Congress created a financial control board to help \nget the city back on its fiscal feet. Not quite a year ago, the control \nboard announced the formation of an emergency management team for the \ncity's schools. The elected school board was relieved of its authority. \nThe superintendent was urged to resign, and a new team was established, \nwhich is headed by retired Gen. Julius Becton.\n  General Becton signed on for a 3-year tour of duty in D.C. schools, \nyet before even a full year has passed, Congress is poised to pull the \nrug out from under him by creating a private school voucher plan.\n  Supporters of private school vouchers prefer to call them school \nchoice. But parents don't choose the schools their children will \nattend. Private schools select the children they will accept. This is \nnot a luxury our public schools enjoy. Public schools are committed to \nproviding an education to all children: To children who come to school \nat any time of the year, to children with disabilities, to children \nwhose primary language is not English, to children with disciplinary \nproblems, and to children with low IQ's.\n  Private schools have the ability to select the smartest, the least \ndifficult students with the fewest challenges to overcome. Supporters \nof the voucher plan point out that there are a number of inner-city, \nparochial schools that take whatever child comes to the door. There is \nno doubt that parochial schools have an important role to play and are \ndoing a good job, but that does not mean that they should receive \nFederal funding. It does not mean that they have taken on all of the \nobligations of our public schools.\n  I believe that it is wrong to provide Federal dollars to private or \nparochial schools to enable them to skim the best students from the \npublic schools. Vouchers also would skim the students whose parents are \ninvolved in their child's education, leaving the public schools with \nthe greatest challenges.\n\n[[Page S10152]]\n\n  Supporters of the voucher plan say District of Columbia should \nprovide choices to parents. They say District of Columbia should have \ncharter schools. They call for partnerships between city schools and \nthe Smithsonian Institution. The truth is that District of Columbia has \nall of these things. The District has public school choice. There is a \ncharter school program at a school not six blocks from the Capitol. \nDown the street there is a middle school which has entered into a \npartnership with the Smithsonian. D.C. public schools are the only \npublic schools in the area that provide an all day kindergarten \nprogram, and every high school in the District is a magnet school.\n  A lot of attention has been paid to the fact that the schools didn't \nopen on time this year, and Congress is not without responsibility for \nthe delay. But very little mention has been made of the rigorous \nstandards that have been put into place in every school, here. Starting \nthis school year, teachers, parents, and students have a clear idea of \nwhat the children should know at each grade level. Last week, students \nall across the District were tested in reading, math, and language arts \nto see what level they are at. At the end of the school year, they will \nbe tested again, to assess their progress. The performance of teachers \nand principal also will be based on these assessments. The pressure is \non not to let a single child slip through the cracks, and I think that \nis an enormous step in the right direction.\n  Teachers and principals are turning up the heat on parents, as well. \nParents of students in D.C. public schools are signing compacts, \nagreeing to be full participants in their child's education. They are \nvisiting classrooms, to see first-hand what and how their children are \nlearning. They are becoming responsible for making sure their children \ndo their homework, and parents are being asked to check the work and \nsign it. They are being asked to read to their children regularly. I \nask unanimous consent that an article from the Washington Post, dated \nSeptember 28, 1997, about back to school night at a local school be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, these are improvements that will help all \nof the students in the District of Columbia schools, not just 3 percent \nof the students. Let's support what works for all of the children, not \njust a handful of them. That's the point of public education.\n  I plan to vote against the voucher plan and urge my colleagues to do \nthe same. Let's send a clear message to General Becton and the \nteachers, parents, and students in D.C. schools: We support your \nefforts to make your local schools better for everyone.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 28, 1997]\n\n                        Back to Work for Schools\n\n                         (By Courtland Milloy)\n\n       ``Good evening,'' W. Irene Woodard, the Watkins Elementary \n     School principal, said melodically. The parents seated before \n     her nodded politely.\n       ``I said, `Good evening,' '' Woodard repeated, not so sweet \n     as before. ``When I say, `Good evening,' I expect you to \n     sing.''\n       It was Back to School Night, and apparently I wasn't the \n     only parent feeling somewhat demoralized by the delayed \n     opening of D.C. public schools. No school for the first three \n     weeks of September, and then, when it did start last week, \n     some schools still had not received all of the necessary \n     books and supplies.\n       ``Don't look so dreary,'' said Channita Fraser, the Watkins \n     PTA president. ``When you come to meetings, smile.'' She \n     began to sing in Spanish, ``The more we get together, the \n     happier we'll be.''\n       People like Woodard and Fraser made it hard for me to just \n     sit and stew in my juices. The way they saw it, there was no \n     time for sulking or complaining. Our children needed help, \n     and they needed it fast.\n       ``Because of the delay in the opening of school, we're \n     going to need parental cooperation like never before,'' said \n     Ellen Costello, who heads PTA fund-raising for Watkins.\n       To make sure it gets the resources it needs, an abundance \n     of candy and holiday wrapping paper must be sold. Parents \n     with the means could make donations directly to their \n     children's classrooms, she said.\n       ``Last year, we raised $22,000,'' Costello told the \n     parents. ``The money was used to fix up the school library. \n     But more is needed to purchase copy paper and make copy \n     machine repairs. We're also trying to get water coolers for \n     each classroom. Remember, we live in the District of \n     Columbia, and we don't have much money.''\n       That notion--that we live in the District, ergo, we don't \n     have much money--was going to take me more than one Back to \n     School Night to get used to. The tax bite out of my paycheck \n     said otherwise. D.C. public schools get more than $500 \n     million a year to educate about 78,000 students. You'd think \n     we'd have all the amenities of an elite private school.\n       Instead, I was told, my third-grader would be expected to \n     take on the equivalent of a part-time job as a candy bar \n     salesman just so his school could get money to buy supplies. \n     But there I go being negative again.\n       ``We had 142 students who sold something last year,'' \n     Costello reported. ``That's only a 33 percent participation \n     rate, and we need to raise it.''\n       I was particularly impressed with my child's teacher, \n     Kimberly Sakai. She's from Hawaii. This is her first year \n     teaching in D.C. public schools, and she has brought to the \n     job all of the enthusiasm you'd expect of a person who \n     doesn't know any better.\n       ``Our class will be starting a new social studies program \n     that focuses on D.C.,'' Sakai told parents. ``Strange how \n     D.C. schools don't have a program that focuses exclusively on \n     Washington. Hawaii is very big on learning about D.C. How can \n     we bypass D.C.? We're going to get to know our community and \n     our government and go on lots of field trips.''\n       Then she asked us to fork over $3 each for a subscription \n     to a weekly children's current events magazine.\n       More important than raising money, however, is getting \n     parents to support their children's teachers. To that end, we \n     all signed a ``parent contract.'' Instead of giving parents \n     money to escape the public school system, as a school voucher \n     would, a parent contract pledges parents to work to improve \n     the schools that their children already attend.\n       An exchange that occurred between a teacher and a parent at \n     the meeting last week revealed the need for greater parental \n     commitment.\n       Teacher: ``Each child will have a homework folder with his \n     or her assignments written down in it, and I expect you to \n     check it and sign it before your child returns.''\n       Parent, sounding distressed: ``You aren't going to assign \n     homework every night, are you?''\n       Teacher: ``I'll try not to give them homework on Fridays.''\n       Parent, with a sigh of relief: ``Thank you.''\n       That parent, judging from the way she was dressed, probably \n     had just come from work. She might have had another full-time \n     job as a housekeeper waiting for her when she got home. \n     Understandably, more homework for her child meant more work \n     for her.\n       And yet, I would have thought that all D.C. \n     schoolteachers--just to make up for the three-week delay--\n     would be piling on the homework. And I wouldn't expect them \n     to let up on Fridays either, especially for third- and fifth-\n     graders, whose progress is being measured against national \n     standards for the first time this year.\n       I could only vow that my child would have homework every \n     night, whether his teachers assigned it or not. Somehow, the \n     expectations for our children must be raised.\n       ``For all of the resources and services that we have, our \n     children are not achieving at the level that they are capable \n     of,'' Woodard told the parents. ``We all must work harder on \n     that. We especially need parents to enhance and extend what \n     is going on in the classroom.\n       ``Be sure that your children are reading a great deal of \n     books, and be sure that they are understanding what they \n     read.''\n       Sounds like homework to me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/29/senate-section/article/S10151-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 4:24 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that pursuant to the \nprovisions of section 154 of title 2, United States Code, as amended by \nsection 1 of Public Law 102-246, the Chair announces the Speaker's \nappointment of the following member on the part of the House to the \nLibrary of Congress Trust Fund Board: Mr. Wayne Berman of the District \nof Columbia to fill the existing vacancy thereon.\n                                                                    ____\n\n  At 6:28 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following joint resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.J.

A bill to improve transportation safety, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n       the highway and surface transportation safety act of 1997\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Highway and \nSurface Transportation Safety Act of 1997. This legislation is designed \nto reauthorize federal highway safety and surface transportation \nprograms that are under the jurisdiction of the Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation Committee.\n  As the Members of this body know, the Commerce Committee has \njurisdiction over Federal agencies that oversee highway safety and \nsurface transportation policies. These agencies include the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration [NHTSA], which administers \nautomobile safety regulations and Federal safety grant programs, such \nas anti-drunk-driving and seatbelt use grants; the Research and Special \nProjects Administration [RSPA], which assists States in responding to \nhazardous materials spills; the Federal Highway Administration [FHWA], \nwhich administers the truck safety programs; and the Federal Railroad \nAdministration [FRA], which regulates rail safety. Each of these \nagencies, as well as the policies under their authority, is vital to \nensuring that Americans are provided with the safest and most efficient \ntransportation, including safe automobiles, highways, and public \ntransportation systems.\n  In addition to preserving the security of our roadways, the measures \nadministered by these agencies are critical to the health of our \nNation's economy. The availability of the goods we consume and that are \nessential to our everyday lives depend on efficiently functioning \ntransportation systems.\n  The participation of the Federal Government in assuring that our \nautomobiles and roadways are safe has been affirmed overwhelmingly by \nthe American public. A recent Lou Harris poll shows that 91 percent of \nAmericans believe the Federal Government has a role in assuring safe \nhighways and 94 percent believe it is important to have motor vehicle \nsafety standards.\n  Our transportation and highway safety policies deserve as much \nattention as campaign finance reform, the popular measure of today. \nYes, we must clean up the election system, but we also must clean up \nour roadways. NHTSA reports that every year over 41,000 Americans are \nkilled on our Nation's highways--that is an average of 114 lives every \nday. In just the past 5 years alone, over 160,000 Americans have lost \ntheir lives, and more than 12 million have suffered serious injuries \ndue to traffic accidents and road hazards--at a cost over $700 billion \ndollars.\n  Astoundingly, almost 25 percent of these traffic fatalities involve \nchildren. In 1995, over 9,000 kids were killed in auto accidents. Of \ncourse, no poll, and no economic gauge, can measure the value of losing \na precious young life.\n\n  Studies, however, show that many of these accidents and fatalities \nare preventable. Most accidents are due to reckless behavior, such as \ndrunk driving. According to NHTSA, alcohol-related accidents are \nresponsible for over 40 percent of traffic fatalities. That means \nalmost half of the tens of thousands of Americans that die every year \nbecause of traffic accidents can be saved if we can just prevent people \nfrom driving drunk. That is why I have supported measures in the past, \nand included provisions in this legislation, to encourage the enactment \nof stringent anti-drunk-driving laws.\n  In addition to deterring the reckless behavior of those that cause \naccidents, there are steps every vehicle occupant can take to enhance \nsafety. All safety experts agree that the most simple,\n\n[[Page S10154]]\n\nand most effective, way to protect ourselves from accidental injuries \nis to buckle up--wear a seatbelt. During the early 1980's an active \ncampaign was initiated by NHTSA and public safety groups to encourage \nthe use of seat-belts. The campaign had many positive results--helping \nto increase seatbelt use from 11 percent in 1980 to a current use rate \nof 68 percent. But 68 percent is still not sufficient. To continue to \nsave lives, we must boost the use rate, at the very least, to the 90 \npercent range. This is why I joined Senator McCain earlier this year in \nsending letters to all State Governors encouraging the enactment of \ntougher seatbelt laws nationwide.\n\n\n                              Legislation\n\n  The legislation I am introducing is designed to address these \nimportant safety issues. The following is a summary of many of the \nmajor provisions:\n  Drunk driving--The bill reauthorizes NHTSA's safety grant programs, \nwhich include incentive grants to States to encourage the adoption of \nstringent drunk driving laws.\n  Seatbelt Grant Program--The bill establishes for the first time ever \na formal Federal seatbelt grant program to encourage states to adopt \nprimary seatbelt laws. Primary seatbelt laws permit police to stop \npersons solely for not wearing a seatbelt. The new grant program has \nbeen included in lieu of the administration's proposal which attempted \nto force States to adopt primary seatbelt laws by reducing their \nhighway construction funds.\n  Required warnings--Vans to transport children--A provision has been \nincluded to require NHTSA to notify car dealers each year about Federal \nregulations that prohibit the sale of vans to schools for the \ntransportation of students. This policy has been adopted to prevent the \ntransport of children in less safe vehicles.\n\n  Hazardous materials transportation Reauthorization--The bill \nreauthorizes appropriations for assisting States in responding to \nhazardous materials spills.\n  Sanitary food transportation--The bill authorizes the transfer from \nthe Department of Transportation to the Food and Drug Administration \n[FDA] the responsibility of ensuring that trucks and rail cars that \ntransport the Nation's food supply are sanitary. This change is needed \nin order to take advantage of FDA's expertise in determining the \ncleanliness of these transports.\n  Rail and mass transportation anti-terrorism--The legislation \nincreases the penalties for anyone convicted of a terrorist attack on \nrailroads or mass transport systems and gives the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation [FBI] the lead role in investigating such incidents.\n  Rail and mass transportation safety--This legislation requires that \nDOT's Federal Transit Administration consult with the Federal Railroad \nAdministration on relevant rail safety issues in making any grant or \nloan under its commuter railroad authority.\n  Boating safety--The bill extends funding for the Clean Vessel Act, \nand authorizes spending for State grants for recreational boating \nsafety, vessel pump-outs, facilities for large recreational vessels, \nand sport fishing outreach and communications.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n  This legislation has been drafted from the framework of the \nadministration's proposed highway safety bill. However, a number of \nchanges have been made as a result of consultation with highway safety \nand consumer groups, such as the Advocates for Highway Safety and \nPublic Citizens, as well as the National Association of Governors' \nHighway Safety Representatives, in an effort to craft the best safety \nbill possible. I look forward to working with Chairman McCain and other \ncommittee members, in addition to the highway safety organizations, as \nwe begin our work on the legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1234\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Department of Transportation, the Department of \n     Agriculture, and the Food and Drug Administration in the \n     Department of Health and Human Services have consulted about \n     how best to ensure that food is not adulterated as a result \n     of the conditions under which it is transported. As a result \n     of these consultations, the agencies have confirmed that \n     steps to ensure the safety of food are more efficient if \n     taken by the agencies directly charged with the \n     responsibility for food safety;\n       (2) the Secretary of Agriculture has ample authority under \n     the Federal Meat Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), the \n     Poultry Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 451 et seq.), and \n     the Egg Products Inspection Act (21 U.S.C. 1031 et seq.), to \n     inspect and regulate continuously the transportation of meat, \n     poultry, and eggs in commerce for use in human food, has \n     exercised the statutory authority in a diligent manner so as \n     to prevent the transportation of unwholesome or adulterated \n     meat, poultry, and egg products in commerce, and does not \n     need additional enforcement authority to regulate the \n     transportation of meat, poultry, and egg products in \n     commerce;\n       (3) certain statutory changes are necessary to provide the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services with the authority \n     necessary to ensure that food, other than that regulated by \n     the Secretary of Agriculture, will not be rendered \n     adulterated in transportation;\n       (4) the appropriate role for the Secretary of \n     Transportation is to provide assistance concerning the \n     transportation aspects of food safety; and\n       (5) therefore, amendment of chapter 57 of title 49, United \n     States Code, and the transfer of certain authorities to the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services, is appropriate.\n\n     SEC. 303.

A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to provide for \na national program concerning motor vehicle pursuits by law enforcement \nofficers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n             the national police pursuit policy act of 1997\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, when Police Chief John Whetsel pulled up \nto the scene of a fiery car wreck, he never expected to recognize the \ncharred remains of a familiar vehicle. After receiving word that a \nhighway patrol cruiser's 100-miles-per-hour pursuit of a fleeing \nmotorcycle had led to a terrible accident involving several bystanders, \nChief Whetsel hurried to the scene.\n  Upon his arrival, Chief Whetsel quickly recognized his family's \nsmoldering automobile and let out a long cry of anguish as he \ndiscovered that his wife and two daughters were the victims of this \nterrible accident. Unfortunately, 1995 statistics show that 40 percent \nof all high-speed pursuits end in accidents, causing needless death and \ninjury to our Nation's families.\n  I certainly understand the pain that Chief Whetsel endured. My mother \nwas killed in a high-speed police chase on her drive from a local \nBismarck, ND hospital. Eyewitnesses say that the speed of this chase \nwas 80 to 100 miles an hour through the city streets. She died as the \ndrunk lawbreaker fishtailed his pickup truck racing away from pursuing \nofficers. She was a wonderful woman, and it was a senseless and painful \nloss of life.\n  There are countless other tragic examples. In fact, there is an \nentire organization, called STOPP, dedicated to raising the awareness \nof the dangers of high speed police pursuits. The members of their \nboard have very strong convictions on this issue, for each of them also \nlost a family member or a friend who was an innocent victim of a high \nspeed chase.\n  Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the National Police Pursuit \nPolicy Act of 1997. It is my hope that this legislation, if enacted, \nwould help prevent tragic losses like the episode that occurred to \nChief Whetsel, my family, and so many others. High speed chases are \ndangerous and occur too frequently, and the human losses resulting from \nhigh-speed police pursuits in the last several years continue to mount. \nWhile we are finally seeing some initiative being taken by various \nStates and local communities to address this problem, these efforts \nmust extend to all State and local jurisdictions in this country to \nattack the problem.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, there were 377 \ndeaths nationwide in 1996, and 27 percent of these deaths were police \nofficers or innocent bystanders that died as a result of high-speed \nchases. Many chases begin as motorists--whether out of fright, panic, \nor guilt--flee at high speeds instead of pulling over when a police \nvehicle turns on its lights and siren. Unfortunately, some police \nbecome determined to apprehend the fleeing motorists at all costs, and \nan alarming 60 percent of all police pursuits originate from minor \ntraffic violations. The result is that the safety of the general \npublic--and the dangers that are created by high-speed chases in city \ntraffic--become secondary to catching someone whose initial offense may \nhave been no greater than driving a car with a broken tail-light.\n  Increased training and education are essential in addressing this \nproblem. Every single law enforcement jurisdiction in the United States \nmust adopt a reasoned, and well-balanced pursuit policy. With 73 \npercent of all police officers reporting that they have been involved \nin a high-speed pursuit in the last 12 months, these officers need \nspecialized training in this area. Currently, new studies show that on \naverage only 14 hours of driver training is provided to new law \nenforcement recruits, with the majority of this time used for the \nmechanics of driving rather than practicing safe and effective high-\nspeed pursuit procedures. In addition, statistics show that there is a \ndecrease in high-speed pursuits when law enforcement officers are \nproperly trained in this area.\n  Specific training on departmental pursuit policies and regular \nfollowup training is necessary to guarantee that all citizens, both \ncivilians and police, receive the benefit of uniform awareness of this \nproblem. There must be a national realization that there are \ncircumstances in which police should not conduct a chase, and our \nofficers should be commended for making these important, lifesaving \nchoices. A drive across country should not be a ``pot luck'' regarding \none's chances of being maimed or killed by a police pursuit.\n  I want to stress that the police are not the villains here. It is the \nfolks that run from the police who are the villains. We must focus on \nthe fleeing lawbreakers who are initiating these chases. The punishment \nfor fleeing the police should be certain and severe. People should be \naware that if they flee they will pay a big price for doing so.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today would require the \nenactment of State laws making it unlawful for the driver of a motor \nvehicle to take evasive action if pursued by police and would establish \na standard minimum penalty of 3 months imprisonment and the seizure of \nthe driver's vehicle. In addition, my bill would require each law \nenforcement agency to establish a hot-pursuit policy and provide that \nall officers receive adequate training in accordance with that policy.\n  Mr. President, this public safety problem is not an easy issue to \nsolve. I understand that it will always be difficult for police \nofficers to judge when a chase is getting out of hand and when public \nsafety would be served best by holding back. However, it can improve \nthe situation if we ensure that police officers are trained on how best \nto make these difficult judgments, and if we send a message to \nmotorists that if you flee, you will do time in jail and lose your car.\n\n[[Page S10176]]\n\n  I believe that these requirements, if passed, will demonstrate strong \nand uniform Federal leadership in response to this problem. \nConsequently, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this bill \nbe printed in the Record, and I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant measure.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1236\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Police Pursuit \n     Policy Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) in 1996--\n       (A) 377 deaths occurred in the United States as a result of \n     high-speed motor vehicle pursuits; and\n       (B) 103 of those deaths were police officers or innocent \n     bystanders who died as a result of high-speed motor vehicle \n     pursuits;\n       (2) in 1995, of the high-speed motor vehicle pursuits \n     conducted during that year, approximately--\n       (A) 40 percent resulted in accidents;\n       (B) 20 percent resulted in injury; and\n       (C) 1 percent resulted in death;\n       (3) a recent study found that approximately 60 percent of \n     high-speed motor vehicle pursuits resulted from pursuits that \n     were not related to felony offenses;\n       (4) an insufficient amount of statistical data and \n     documentation concerning high-speed motor vehicle pursuits is \n     available;\n       (5) a recent study found that although only 31 percent of \n     law enforcement agencies maintain consistent records on motor \n     vehicle pursuits made by law enforcement officers, 71 percent \n     of those agencies were able to provide data on the number of \n     high-speed motor vehicle pursuits conducted;\n       (6) a recent study found that--\n       (A) 73 percent of the law enforcement officers polled had \n     been involved in a high-speed motor vehicle pursuit during \n     the 12-month period preceding the date of the polling; and\n       (B) 40 percent of those officers reported that an accident \n     resulted from a high-speed motor vehicle pursuit in which the \n     officer participated;\n       (7) a recent study found that most law enforcement recruits \n     who receive training to become law enforcement officers \n     receive only an average of 14 hours of training for driving \n     skills, and a majority of that time is used to provide \n     training in the mechanics of driving instead of providing \n     practice for safe and effective high-speed motor vehicle \n     pursuit procedures; and\n       (8) a recent study found that an increased emphasis on the \n     high-speed motor vehicle pursuit policies, procedures, and \n     training decreases the occurrence of high-speed motor vehicle \n     pursuits, as the recruits who receive training that includes \n     special training for effective high-speed motor vehicle \n     pursuits were less likely to engage in those pursuits.\n\n     SEC. 3.

PRIME MINISTER? DEMOCRACY HANGS IN THE BALANCE IN \n              SLOVAKIA ON CONSTITUTION'S FIFTH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, 5 years ago, the speaker of the \nSlovak Parliament, Ivan Gasparovic, described his country's new \nconstitution as ``an expression of centuries-old emancipation efforts \nof the Slovak people to have a sovereign state of their own.'' He also \nspoke of its ``supreme binding force.'' Since then, the people who \npresent themselves as the guardians of Slovakia's statehood have \nundermined Slovakia's constitution.\n  This is what they have done.\n  This May, the Ministry of Interior ignored the Constitutional Court's \nruling and altered an important referendum on NATO and on the direct \nelection of the President, effectively denying the people of Slovakia \ntheir constitutionally guaranteed right to register their views through \na referendum. Defending its actions, members of the Prime Minister's \nparty insisted that they acted in conformity with the constitution--as \nthey interpreted it--and that they were justified in placing their \nviews ahead of the ruling of the highest court in the land.\n  The actions of the ruling coalition in the case of Frantisek \nGaulieder makes clear that the Meciar government has a profound and \nfundamental disregard for the constitution of Slovakia.\n  Then there is the case of Frantisek Gaulieder.\n  Frantisek Gaulieder is a member of the Slovak Parliament who was \nremoved from office because he renounced his membership in Prime \nMinister Vladimir Meciar's party, the Movement for a Democratic \nSlovakia. On July 25, the Constitutional Court confirmed that the \nruling coalition's action which deprived Gaulieder of his seat was \nunconstitutional and violated Gaulieder's rights. But members of the \nPrime Minister's coalition again claimed that they, and not the \nConstitutional Court, have the right to determine what the constitution \nmeans, and have declined to act to restore Gaulieder to his seat in \nParliament.\n  In short, the ``supreme binding force'' that Ivan Gasparovic spoke of \n5 years ago no longer flows from the constitution, but from the will of \nVladimir Meciar.\n  When there are differences of opinion as to what a constitution \nmeans, whether those differences arise between branches of government \nor between the government and its citizens, in a state operating under \nthe rule of law, it is the job of a constitutional court to interpret \nwhat the constitution means--not the Prime Minister or Parliament. \nAlthough this principle is taken for granted in many parts of Europe, \nand was established early in American history by the famous Supreme \nCourt case of Marbury versus Madison, it has apparently not yet been \naccepted in Slovakia.\n  Mr. President, the Slovak Democratic Coalition has moved, four times, \nto convene a special session of the Parliament in order to implement \nthe decision of the Constitutional Court and restore Frantisek \nGaulieder to his seat. Four times, however, Prime Minister Meciar's \ncoalition has boycotted their own Parliament rather than face the \nfollowing dilemma: restore Gaulieder to his seat--consistent with the \nConstitutional Court's decision--and risk\n\n[[Page S10179]]\n\nthe chance that others will follow Gaulieder's example and defect from \nthe Prime Minister's party, or vote down the Slovak Democratic \nCoalition's proposal to restore Gaulieder to his seat and confirm that \nwhatever form of government exists in Slovakia, it is not \nconstitutional democracy, at least not as we understand it.\n  Sooner or later, the Slovak Parliament will reconvene. When it acts, \nor fails to act, on the Gaulieder question, we will know whether \nSlovakia is committed to becoming a functioning constitutional \ndemocracy. If it is not, what it will become is an isolated State under \nconstant international pressure and scrutiny, cut off from a promising \nand prosperous future by the arrogance and greed of its own leaders.\n  As Vladimir Meciar is asked in his weekly news show, what next, Mr. \nPrime Minister?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/29/senate-section/article/S10178-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO GEN. JOHN M. SHALIKASHVILI\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Gen. \nJohn M. Shalikashvili on the occasion of his retirement after serving \non active duty for more than 39 years, the last 4 years of which he has \nserved as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  General Shalikashvili's life is a marvelous American success story. \nMany people are aware that he was born in Warsaw, Poland of stateless \nparents and came to Peoria, IL, at the age of 16. What is not generally \nknown, however, is that when he became a naturalized American citizen \nshortly before he graduated from Bradley University, it was the first \nnation of which he was a citizen, and that he was drafted into the U.S. \nArmy shortly after graduation. He is the only Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff who is a naturalized American citizen and the only \nChairman who was drafted into the military.\n  Mr. President, I won't attempt to describe all of General \nShalikashvili's military achievements, but I would like to include a \nfew of his experiences that I believe molded his outlook and enabled \nhim to perform in such a superb fashion as our Nation's senior military \nofficer.\n  General Shali, as he likes to be called, served in Vietnam during the \nTet offensive and in Korea in the early 1970's. His experience in \ncombat and in a theater in which U.S. forces faced a strong and \nunpredictable military foe undoubtedly prepared him to be the strong \nspokesman for the men and women in uniform and a strong advocate for \nmaintaining our Nation's military might second to none.\n  I have been struck by General Shali's frequent reference to his \nexperience in 1991 as the head of Operation Provide Comfort. This \noperation brought the Iraqi Kurds down from the mountains of northern \nIraq and eastern Turkey where thousands were dying and helped them to \nreturn to their towns and villages. He has described that experience as \nthe toughest challenge and, at the same time, one of the most \ngratifying things that he has done. Mr. President, it has been my \nexperience that our finest military leaders are also people who are \ncaring human beings. General Shali's compassion and humanity comes \nclearly through in his recollection of his experience with the Iraqi \nKurds who suffered so much at the hands of Saddam Hussein.\n  General Shali also served in a number of positions in Europe both \nduring and after the cold war. Just last week, I had an opportunity \nalong with Senators Roth and Biden and other members of the Senate NATO \nObserver Group to meet with General Shali and the chiefs of defense of \nour NATO allies. I observed with pride the respect and admiration that \nthe senior military leaders of our NATO allies have for General Shali. \nI am sure that it was also evident to them that all of the Senators at \nthat meeting have the highest regard for General Shali. With his \nEuropean upbringing and his several assignments in the European area, \nincluding as NATO's Supreme Allied Commander, General Shali has been a \nunique leader as NATO has been carrying out its internal adaptation and \nits enlargement.\n  Mr. President, I am sure that there will be a number of tributes paid \nto general Shali here on the Senate floor, elsewhere in the Capital \narea, and around the world. Some will no doubt recount his \nextraordinary performance as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. \nI have chosen to highlight only a few and perhaps lesser known aspects \nof General Shali's career because I believe they demonstrate his \nqualities of leadership, compassion, humanity, and courage.\n  General Shali has been a superb Chairman, a true friend of the men \nand women who serve our Nation, and I count myself fortunate to \nconsider him a good personal friend. I salute him for the former and \ncherish the latter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/29/senate-section/article/S10179-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10179]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       KENNETH APFEL CONFIRMATION\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today Mr. Ken Apfel will be sworn \nin for the position of Commissioner of the Social Security \nAdministration. Mr. Apfel was confirmed earlier this month to direct \nthe agency responsible for administering the largest domestic program \nin the United States. Social Security will have an impact on the life \nof every single American at one time or another. I support Mr. Apfel's \nconfirmation to head this vital agency.\n  Mr. Apfel will guide the Social Security program into the 21st \ncentury, bringing it right up to the edge of the largest demographic \nshift this country has ever seen. Starting in 2010, the baby boom \ngeneration--70 million strong--will begin entering retirement. Because \nof the tremendous medical strides we have made in extending life \nexpectancy, this cohort will be living longer and collecting benefits \nlonger. It is imperative that our Social Security program be ready to \nabsorb such a huge influx of beneficiaries. The Commissioner must be a \nleader in preparing the agency and the program itself, to meet this \nchallenge.\n  Preparing for the retirement of the baby boom generation is only half \nof the challenge. There are on-going problems that must be addressed as \nwell. The Social Security Administration has had difficulties \nprotecting taxpayer dollars. The General Accounting Office recently \nelevated the Supplemental Security Income Program to its high-risk list \nof Federal programs because of their inability to pay out the proper \namount of money. Huge overpayments go out to beneficiaries--most of \nwhich are never collected. Additional problems exist in the Disability \nInsurance Program. Prisoners and legal aliens have received benefits \nimproperly. The agency has not fulfilled its legislative mandate to \nrefer applicants and recipients of disability benefits to appropriate \nrehabilitation. Addressing these issues is very important because \nproblems in any one of the programs that the Social Security \nAdministration operates undermines confidence in all of the programs.\n  I will say right now that I do not envy Mr. Apfel. He is endeavoring \nto take on a job with many difficult challenges. Having met with him \npersonally, I can honestly say I believe he can do the job. It is my \nhope, however, that he will not fall into the practice of his \npredecessors of not taking a pro-active stance with regard to policy \nissues faced by the Social Security Administration. When he sees the \nneed for legislative action, or he sees problems with policies that \nmust be changed--that he communicate with Congress immediately.\n  I hope he will see himself , in his capacity as Commissioner, as a \nliaison to the public, to the President, and to Congress to resolve \nsome of the most important challenges that will face our country and \nthe Government over the next 6 years. Most of all, SSA, like any other \nGovernment agency, is an overseer of taxpayer dollars--our money. That \nresponsibility must be taken with the utmost seriousness and \ndeliberation. If he can motivate his personnel to do that--protect \ntaxpayer dollars--he will have a successful term as \nCommissioner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/29/senate-section/article/S10179-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10179-S10180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BLACK CAREER WOMEN\n\n Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nachievement of a very valuable community organization in Cincinnati, \nOH.\n  The group--known as Black Career Women, or BCW--has been serving the \nAfrican-American community in Cincinnati and throughout the United \nStates for 20 years. Back in the early 1980's, BCW provided word \nprocessing assistance and office-skill development\n\n[[Page S10180]]\n\nservices to unemployed and underemployed women--to help them get decent \njobs with a living wage.\n  This nonprofit organization provides an extremely valuable service to \ncorporations and managers who are trying to develop and support \nsuccessful skills-development strategies for African-American women. \nWorking in partnership with executives, BCW has helped improve the \nlives of countless women from corporate executives to entrepreneurs.\n  Over the last two decades, more than 10,000 women have benefited from \nthe service of Black Career Women.\n  Black Career Women has been helping the African-American women in the \nCincinnati area and throughout the Nation achieve the goals of self-\nhelp and self-determination. They deserve the praise of all people who \nbelieve in diversity, economic progress, and independence for working \npeople.\n  I ask all my colleagues to join me in extending our warmest \ncongratulations on their 20th anniversary. They are making a big \ndifference for the better in the life of the Cincinnati area and the \nentire nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/29/senate-section/article/S10179-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10180]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNITION OF HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am proud to be able to speak \ntoday, as many of my colleagues have done recently, on the significance \nof Hispanic Heritage Month, being commemorated from September 15 \nthrough October 15. For almost 30 years, we as a nation have, in this \nway, formally acknowledged and celebrated the contributions Hispanic \nAmericans have made and are making to our country.\n  Mr. President, in my home State of Texas, Hispanics are an intrinsic \nand dynamic part of our history, culture, economy, and civic life. From \nEl Paso to Texarkana, and from Amarillo to Brownsville, over 6 million \nLatinos in Texas contribute immeasurably to making the Lone Star State \nthe unique and wonderful place it is. Whether they trace their ancestry \nto the earliest Spanish settlers in Texas or have recently immigrated \nto this country, individually and collectively Hispanics have made our \nState and our Nation a richer place in which to live.\n  For at least 250 of the last 400 years, Hispanic heritage was \nsynonymous with Texas heritage. Since the first Spanish landing at the \nmouth of the Rio Grande by Alonso Alvarez de Pineda in 1519, the \nSpanish, and later the Mexicans bravely began to colonize the vast and \nrugged land known as Tejas. To this day, Hispanics continue to \ncontribute their boundless determination and unique perspective to \nevery facet of life in Texas and the Nation. Hispanic Americans enrich \nour lives in virtually every field of endeavor: politics, business, \nscience, education, art, music, film, cuisine, and countless other \nfields.\n  In my home State, we recently lost two of our greatest native Texas \nHispanics, Congressman Frank Tejeda and musical artist Selena Perez. In \ntheir own way, both of these individuals demonstrated astonishing \ndetermination, which in turn reflected the vibrancy and strength of the \nHispanic community: Frank Tejeda, who dropped out of high school from \nthe south side of San Antonio and went on to distinguish himself in \nmilitary service in Vietnam, in higher education, in the business \nworld, and as a dedicated public servant; and Selena who, at the young \nage of 23 became a pop icon, entertaining audiences in her hometown of \nCorpus Christi and throughout the world with her unique brand of \n``Tejano'' music. Although the lives of these two great Texans ended \nfar too soon, they will forever inspire the tens of thousands of young \nHispanics who will look to them and to the many other Hispanic leaders \nin our country as symbols of what can be achieved through hard work, \nambition, and the support of the community.\n  As a Texas and as a member of the Senate Republican Conference Task \nForce on Hispanic Affairs, I remain committed to ensuring that the \nAmerican dream continues to exist and to come true for all Americans. \nThrough my activities on this task force and in the Senate, as well as \nthrough daily contact with my constituents, I have worked hard to \nensure that the needs and concerns of the Hispanic community are heard \nand responded to. While we all share the goal of improving our country \nand the opportunities for our children, there are economic and other \nconcerns that disproportionately impact the Hispanic community. I \nbelieve we in Congress must continue to address those concerns by \npursuing policies that promote education, health care, urban renewal, \nand a business environment that encourages entrepreneurial activity and \nrisk taking.\n  There are certainly challenges ahead. With so many Hispanic-owned \nbusinesses starting up around the country, access to capital is a \ncritical need. I have supported and continue to support lending and \ncontracting programs that offer fledgling businesses the opportunity to \nlaunch themselves--and to continue to soar.

Mr. President, I rise today to draw the attention \nof my colleagues to an article I recently read on the subject of \nreligious freedom. The author, Mr. Philip Peters, a senior fellow at \nthe Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, offers a keen assessment of the \ntragedy that currently faces Christians who are being persecuted in \ntheir homelands. In his article, ``Persecution and Redemption,'' Mr. \nPeters makes specific reference to the treatment of Christians and \nother victims of religious persecution living in the former Soviet \nUnion.\n  It is unfortunate but true that tens of thousands of people in the \nformer Soviet Union cannot practice their religion without encountering \nhostility from their government. As the author points out, ``About one \nfourth of Russia's regional governments have laws restricting religious \nactivity.''\n  I agree with Mr. Peters' assessment that refugees from the former \nSoviet Union ``deserve the support of anyone concerned about Christians \nand other victims of religious persecution around the world.'' I have \njoined with Senators Kennedy, Hatch, and Leahy in urging President \nClinton to restore the refugee ceiling on refugees from the former \nSoviet Union in fiscal year 1998 to its level in fiscal year 1997.\n  Mr. President, I ask that Mr. Peters' article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The article follows:\n\n              [From the Washington Times, Sept. 25, 1997]\n\n                       Persecution and Redemption\n\n                           (By Philip Peters)\n\n       This year, Washington has caught on to a fact that human \n     rights activists have known for some time: Persecution of \n     Christians is on the rise around the world. This issue was at \n     the center of the debate on China's trade status, and the \n     State Department issued a special report on it in July.\n       Now, the question is whether anything will be done about \n     it.\n       New legislation introduced by Sen. Arlen Specter and Rep. \n     Frank Wolf, the Freedom From Religious Persecution Act, is so \n     laden with new economic sanctions and foreign policy \n     prescriptions that it has drawn the opposition of the Clinton \n     administration, business, and pro-trade groups, and is \n     destined for prolonged debate.\n       While that debate goes on, four other senators have \n     proposed a far more immediate and concrete way for the U.S. \n     to help.\n       On Sept. 10, Sens. Spencer Abraham, Edward Kennedy, Orrin \n     Hatch, and Patrick Leahy called on the administration to \n     abandon its current plan to cut next year's admissions of \n     refugees from the former Soviet Union. They deserve the \n     support of anyone concerned about Christians and other \n     victims of religious persecution around the world.\n       The State Department wants to cut admissions from the \n     former Soviet Union to 21,000, even though 27,000 were \n     admitted this year. The senators propose instead 30,000 \n     admissions from the former Soviet Union, with no reductions \n     in planned admissions from other regions.\n       This proposal is modest. The Clinton administration has \n     driven refugee admissions down 40 percent, and if the \n     senators' proposal is accepted, total 1998 admissions\n\n[[Page S10181]]\n\n     would be 87,000, far lower than the 100,000-plus refugees \n     admitted annually from 1989 to 1995.\n       The senators' letter has ignited a debate among \n     administration aides, who must soon decide on the number of \n     refugees to admit in 1998. They need look no further than the \n     administration's own reports on religious persecution in the \n     former Soviet Union. These reports document that:\n       Legislation passed last week by the lower house of Russia's \n     parliament would require the registration of new religious \n     groups, and would require these groups to wait up to 15 years \n     to obtain full legal status. During this period, these groups \n     would be barred from importing or distributing religious \n     materials, and it would be difficult for them to own property \n     or have bank accounts. This bill does not apply to Orthodoxy, \n     Islam, Judaism or Buddhism; instead, it would affect faiths \n     newer to Russia, especially evangelical Christians. President \n     Yeltsin vetoed the bill once but now seems prepared to sign \n     it.\n       About one fourth of Russia's regional governments have laws \n     restricting religious activity.\n       Russian authorities have made Christian missionary work \n     difficult or impossible in some regions, and they have made \n     recovery of property difficult for non-Orthodox faiths, \n     including the Catholic church.\n       As a result, Pentecostals and other evangelical Christians \n     now account for about half the refugees from the former \n     Soviet Union.\n       The State Department argues against any increase in refugee \n     admissions. In spite of conditions in the former Soviet \n     Union, it claims that interest in the U.S. refugee program is \n     declining, even though 6,000 more were admitted this year \n     than it proposes to admit next year.\n       But even if less than 30,000 admissions slots for the \n     former Soviet Union are needed in 1998, the increase in \n     overall admissions would give the administration greater \n     flexibility to address other crises. This year, the \n     administration exceeded its planned admissions from the \n     former Yugoslavia by 25 percent. If the implementation of the \n     Dayton accords continues to prove difficult, the need to \n     resettle refugees from this region will grow. And, following \n     the historical pattern in other refugee crises, American \n     action to resettle refugees from the former Yugoslavia will \n     cause European and other countries to accent greater numbers \n     of these refugees for resettlement.\n       Last year, the House and Senate defeated legislative \n     attempts to slash refugee admissions. The senators' action is \n     one more demonstration of the bipartisan consensus supporting \n     American action to help refugees fleeing oppression. \n     President Clinton should view their proposal as an \n     opportunity to help victims of religious oppression, and to \n     revitalize American humanitarian leadership around the \n     globe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/29/senate-section/article/S10180-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ENERGY AND WATER APPROPRIATIONS CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, in the Energy and Water \nAppropriations Conference Report, which this body may consider as early \nas tomorrow, is a provision that encourages the Corps of Engineers to \nmake a decision on permits for a 50-foot dock extension at the Port of \nSeattle.\n  Over the past several years the Port of Seattle, Muckleshoot Indian \nTribe, and Corps of Engineers have been involved in a debate over the \nreplacement of a 350-foot wood dock with a 400-foot concrete dock at \nthe Port of Seattle. In an effort to move this process forward and \nbreak the deadlock between the parties, I included report language in \nthe Energy and Water Appropriations Conference Report asking the Corps \nof Engineers promptly to consider the permit issue.\n  Due to the continued cooperation and hard work of the Muckleshoot \nIndian Tribe and Port of Seattle, an agreement was reached this past \nFriday evening over the dock extension. I would like to praise the \njudgment and cooperation of the Port of Seattle and the Muckleshoot \nIndian Tribe both. Their willingness to work together has not only \naverted a protracted conflict but also provide a positive example for \nother local governments and tribal governments in reaching agreements \nunder similar circumstances.\n  As a result of this agreement, the language which I included in the \nEnergy and Water Appropriation Conference Report is redundant and no \nlonger necessary. I have discussed this point with Congressman Norm \nDicks in the House and would like the official record to show that both \nthe House and Senate agree that this language is effectively voided by \nthe agreement. Furthermore, I would like to request that the final \nversion of the Energy and Water Conference Report that will be \nconsidered by the Senate not contain this language.

Mr. President, I rise this evening to say a few words in \nresponse to President Clinton's radio address over the weekend about \nthe pace of the Senate's consideration of judicial nominees. In that \naddress, the President chided Members of this body for what he \ndescribed as ``a vacancy crisis'' in our Federal courts ostensibly \nresulting from politically motivated scrutiny of his nominees.\n  I will respond for a moment to the myths and distortions that the \nClinton administration has engaged in; specifically the myth that there \nis a vacancy crisis in the Federal judiciary and the myth that there is \na Republican slowdown of judicial confirmations.\n  There is no vacancy crisis. So far this year, the Senate has \nconfirmed 18 of President Clinton's judges. This brings the total \nnumber of Clinton nominees on the Federal bench to 222--that is nearly \n30 percent of the active Federal judiciary. There are more sitting \nFederal judges today than there were through virtually all of the \nReagan and Bush administrations. As of September 26, 1997, just 3 days \nago, there were 750 active Federal judges. Now, this figure excludes \nthe approximately 79 senior status judges who continue to preside over \nand hear cases.\n  Yet at this point in the 101st Congress when George Bush was \nPresident and in the 102d Congress when George Bush was President, by \ncontrast, when President Bush's nominees were being processed by a \nDemocrat-controlled Senate, there were only 711 and 716 active judges, \nrespectively. We have 750 as we stand here today.\n\n  Keep in mind that the Clinton administration is on record as stating \nthat 63 vacancies--a vacancy rate just over 7 percent--is considered \nvirtual full employment of the Federal judiciary, and they were right. \nNinety-four vacancies, the current vacancy rate, is a vacancy rate of \nabout 11 percent. So ask yourselves this question, how can a 4-percent \nrise in the vacancy rate from 7 percent to 11 percent convert full \nemployment into a crisis?\n  Moreover, let's compare today's vacancy level, 94, with those that \nexisted during the early 1990's when George Bush was President and the \nDemocrats controlled the Senate. In May 1997 there were 148 Federal \njudicial vacancies, and in May 1992 there were 117 Federal judicial \nvacancies. I remember those years. I don't recall one comment about it \nin the media. I don't recall one television show mentioning it. I don't \nrecall one writer writing about it. Nobody seemed to care. But all of a \nsudden it has become a crisis today with less vacancies at this time \nthan the Democrat-controlled Senate and Judiciary Committee at that \ntime had.\n  I should also note that at the end of the Bush administration, there \nwere 115 vacancies compared to the 65 at the end of the last \nPresidential election; 115 vacancies, for which 55 nominees were \npending before the Judiciary Committee. None of these 55 nominees even \nreceived the courtesy of a hearing.\n  I have heard all the yelling and screaming here on the floor and in \nthe public media today and by the President on Saturday. In short, I \nthink it is unfair and frankly inaccurate to report that the Republican \nCongress has created a vacancy crisis in our courts.\n  Now, it is also incorrect when we suggest there is a deliberate \nRepublican slowdown of the nominations process. The President pointed \nout on Saturday, correctly I might add, that he has sent up to the \nSenate nearly 70 nominees to fill vacant seats on the Federal bench, 68 \nto be exact. By way of comparison, he notes that the Senate has \nconfirmed fewer than 20 of his nominees, suggesting undue Senate delay \nin the face of an abundance of qualified nominees.\n  But the picture the President paints is less than complete. Of the 68 \njudicial nominees submitted to the Judiciary Committee this year, \nnearly half of them, 30 in all, have been nominated just since July 1 \nof this year. So, factoring in the Senate's August recess, when we were \ngone for better than 30 days, the Judiciary Committee has had scarcely \n2 months to consider virtually one-half of the President's nominees \nthis year.\n  Perhaps, then, it is fair to say the delay has been a factor in the \nface of\n\n[[Page S10182]]\n\nSenate confirmation. Unfortunately, the delay has to date been largely \nat the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue--at the White House, if you \nwill.\n  Even the Administrative Office of the Courts has concluded that most \nof the blame for the current vacancies falls predominantly with this \nadministration. It calculates that until his most recent rush of \nnominations, it has taken President Clinton an average of 618 days to \nname a nominee for a vacancy--nearly twice the time it has historically \ntaken prior White Houses.\n\n  By contrast, it has taken the Senate an average of 91 days to confirm \na judge once the President finally nominates him or her. In other \nwords, the Senate is carrying out its constitutional responsibilities \nwith respect to the confirmation of judicial nominees more than six \ntimes faster than the President. And in recent months, the Judiciary \nCommittee has been moving noncontroversial nominees at a remarkably \nfast pace.\n  Since returning from the August recess, we have already scheduled two \nnomination hearings. At the first, earlier this month, we considered \nfour of the President's nominees. Tomorrow we will hold a hearing for \nseven judicial nominees, and in addition a hearing for the President's \nnominee for Associate Attorney General. Those were scheduled before the \nPresident, I think, ever dreamed of giving a speech last Saturday. I \nshould note that the Clinton administration was made aware of this fact \nprior to the President's address, but he failed to mention that. In \naddition, we are planning to have another hearing in the next few \nweeks, so, clearly noncontroversial nominees are being considered at a \nresponsible pace.\n  I will concede that some nominations have taken longer than is \ncustomary. But in many instances, this has been due to the unfortunate \nfact that some nominees have not been entirely forthcoming with the \nJudiciary Committee. In the interest of fairness, I have given these \nnominees repeated opportunities to fully respond to the committee's \ninquiries, and when they have done so, we have moved the nomination. \nMs. Margaret Morrow is a good example of a nominee who was slowed by \nher reluctance to promptly answer questions posed by members of the \ncommittee. After I spoke with her and urged her to be more forthcoming, \nher nomination was reported to the floor--with my support, I might \nadd--and I expect her nomination will be scheduled for a floor vote \nsoon. I expect it to be scheduled. It should be scheduled. If people \nhave differences with her, let them express those differences with \ntheir votes. But she has been reported by the Judiciary Committee, and \nwith good reason as far as I'm concerned.\n  Nevertheless, other nominees have been similarly less than \ncooperative. While I appreciate and concur in the President's \nexpression of concern for the integrity of our courts, we will all be \nbetter served by this administration's renewed commitment to sending up \nrestrained, qualified nominees who respect the essential role that the \nSenate must play in the confirmation process. We cannot serve that \nfunction well when nominees are less than forthright with members of \nthe committee.\n  The President was quite correct when he said over the weekend, ``This \nage demands we work together in a bipartisan fashion and the American \npeople deserve no less.'' Indeed, they do deserve no less. But \nbipartisan cooperation depends not only on swift confirmations, but \nqualified and cooperative nominees as well.\n\n  Now, I also want to take a moment to address some of the personal \ncriticisms directed at our majority leader. To suggest that the \nmajority leader has acted irresponsibly with respect to the nominations \nis just plain wrong. Of 21 judicial nominees reported to the floor by \nthe Judiciary Committee, only 3 remain on the calendar. One was \nreported within the last 2 weeks. So to suggest that this majority \nleader is playing games with nominations is not only unfair, it is \ngrossly untrue.\n  Now, I have been pleased to have worked, over the past number of \nmonths, with White House counsel Chuck Ruff to ensure that the \nnomination and confirmation process is a collaborative one between the \nWhite House and Members of the Senate. I think it is fair to say that \nafter a few months in which the process suffered due to inadequate \nconsultation between the White House and some Senators, the process is \nnow working rather smoothly. I think the process is due to the White \nHouse's renewed commitment to good faith consultation with Senators of \nboth parties.\n  Now, I think it is important to note that I believe the Senate is \ndoing its best to move nominees and to move them quickly. If we have \nnoncontroversial nominees submitted, we can move them quickly. If and \nwhen the administration sends us qualified, noncontroversial qualified \nnominees, they will be processed fairly and promptly. In the last 6 \nweeks or so, the administration has finally began sending us nominees \nwhich I have, for the most part, found to be quite acceptable. Take Ms. \nHull, who was nominated for a very important seat on the Eleventh \nCircuit. That is a circuit court of appeals judge. She was nominated on \nJune 18, she had her hearing June 22, and was confirmed on September 4. \nThat is a remarkably fast turnaround for both parties, the White House \nand the Senate. Or Mr. Alan Gould from Florida, who was nominated in \nFebruary. We completed his paperwork and our review in March and April. \nHe had a hearing shortly thereafter in May, and was reported out in \ncommittee and confirmed before the Fourth of July recess. Another good \nexample is Janet Hall, from Connecticut, who was nominated to the U.S. \nDistrict Court on June 5, 1997. The Committee had a hearing on July 22, \nand she was confirmed September 11. Clearly, when it comes to new \nnoncontroversial nominees, we are in fact proceeding with extraordinary \nspeed and diligence.\n  Now, more controversial nominees take a little more time. Of the 69 \nindividuals nominated in this Congress, only 43 have been new. The \nother 23 are renominees that were nominated but never confirmed in the \nlast Congress. Some have had committee consideration, but most of the \nnominees with completed paperwork who have not yet had consideration \nare ones who were renominated from the last Congress. When the \nadministration simply sends back nominees who had problems last \nCongress, it takes much more time and it is much more difficult to \nprocess them, and they know it.\n  I am trying to work out the differences between the Senators of the \nrespective States--I might add, Democrats and Republicans--and the \nWhite House so that we can move more of these. It was worth pointing \nout that there was, in nearly every instance, a reason why the Senate \nconfirmed 202 other Clinton nominees, but not these 23. If all we are \nleft with are judges that we are not ready to move, I will not \ncompromise our advise and consent function simply because the White \nHouse does not send qualified nominees. As I said at the outset, the \nSenate's advise and consent function should not be reduced to a mere \nnumbers game. The confirmation of an individual to serve for life as a \nFederal judge is a serious matter and should be treated as such. In \nfact, we have sent a letter down to the White House and Justice \nDepartment and explained the problem with each nominee, and they \nunderstand perfectly well why some of these nominees have not moved. \nWhen you talk about confirmation numbers, let me compare them to the \nprevious Congresses. As of today, we have processed 24 nominees this \nyear--18 confirmed, 3 on the floor, and 3 are pending in committee. \nNow, not all of these judges have been confirmed, but we expect that \nmost all of them will be confirmed fairly promptly.\n\n  Assuming most of these nominees are confirmed, I think any reasonable \nperson could see that our efforts compare quite favorably to prior \nCongresses in terms of the number of judges confirmed at this point in \nthe first session of a Congress, especially if you look at recent \nDemocrat controlled Congresses. In 1993, there were zero judges \nconfirmed by the Democrat Congress by the end of July of that year. In \n1991, 23 judges were confirmed, at a time when there were 148 \nvacancies--in a Congress controlled by Democrats. In 1989, only 4 \njudges were confirmed--a Democrat Congress. In 1987, only 17 judges \nconfirmed--a Democrat Congress. I can go on and on. So the plain fact \nis, we are on track, if not ahead of previous Democrat Congresses.\n  Well, I can say so much more, but let me just say this. Some have \nargued\n\n[[Page S10183]]\n\nthat the Republican leadership is holding up qualified nominees. Let me \njust point out for the record that there were a number of qualified \nnominees of President Bush who weren't even given the courtesy of a \nhearing. For instance, John G. Roberts, Jr., nominated on January 27, \n1992, for the vacancy left by the now Supreme Court Justice Clarence \nThomas. Among his long list of accomplishments, I note, was that he was \na former law clerk to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. He had \nworked at various high level positions at the Justice Department, \nincluding serving as Deputy Solicitor General of the United States. He \nwas an outstanding lawyer and he wasn't even given the courtesy of a \nhearing.\n  Another fine nominee was Maureen Mahoney. Keep in mind, we have had \nsome Senators take to the floor here and try to imply that because it \nhas been difficult to get a certain woman nominee through from time to \ntime, that there must be something wrong with the Judiciary Committee \nfor not doing that. Well, take the fine nominee, Maureen Mahoney, \nnominated for the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of \nVirginia on April 2, 1992. Like Mr. Roberts, she, too, was a well-\nrespected litigator. She clerked for Chief Justice Rehnquist and also \nserved as a deputy solicitor general of the United States. Neither of \nthese exceptionally qualified nominees were able to get a hearing on \ntheir nomination.\n  I could go on and on. Keep in mind that we have 750 judges on the \nbench today, compared to in 1991-92 when we had considerably less \njudges at that particular time--711 and 716, compared to 750 today. \nPlus, in addition to the 750, we have a number of senior status \njudges--79 as I recall--who are hearing cases and continuing their work \neven though they have taken senior status. So there is no crisis.\n  Now, having said all of this, I would like to move these nominees who \nare qualified as fast as we can. I would like them to come up on the \nfloor as fast as they can be brought up. Thus far, the majority leader \nhas virtually brought up everybody we have brought out of the \ncommittee, except a couple, and they will be brought up in the near \nfuture. Margaret Morrow will have her vote in the Senate. I will \nannounce right here and now that I will vote for her, even though I did \nhave some qualms as a result of her first confirmation hearing and as a \nresult of some of the things that she had said while President of the \nCalifornia Bar Association, and on other occasions during the earlier \nyears. But I have found her to be qualified and I will support her. \nUndoubtedly, there will be some who will not, but she deserves to have \nher vote on the floor. I have been assured by the majority leader that \nshe will have her vote on the floor. I intend to argue for and on her \nbehalf.\n  I believe that with continued cooperation from the White House, in \nconsultation with Senators up here--keep in mind that this isn't a one-\nway street. Senators have a right to be concerned about lifetime-\nappointed judges serving within their areas, their States. Therefore, \nthat is why the Senate has a noble and very important role in this \nconfirmation process. I want to commend the current White House \ncounsel, Charles Ruff for the work he is doing in meeting personally \nwith Senators up here and trying to resolve their difficulties. I think \nhe has made a lot of strides, and I think that is going to be helpful \nover the long run.\n  Mr. President, these are important matters. I do not believe they \nshould be politicized. I think activist judges, whether they come from \nthe right or left, are judges who ignore the law and just do whatever \ntheir little old visceral tendencies tell them to do. These are judges \nwho act like superlegislatures from the bench who usurp the powers of \nthe other two branches--coequal branches--of Government, the executive \nand legislative branches. These are judges who ignore the written law. \nThese are judges who take their own political purposes to what the law \nshould be. These are judges, a number of whom sit on the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, who have given me nothing but angst because of their \nactivism. During this last year 28 of 29 cases on the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals were reversed by the Supreme Court because of judicial \nactivism.\n  Everybody knows that judicial activism is hard to define. But it is \nnot hard to define when you look at some of those cases. Judges do have \nto try cases at first impression. And when they do, they do have to \nmake decisions, and they have to split the baby, so to speak. But we \nare talking not about those cases. We are talking about judges who \nignore the basic intents of the law, the basic languages of the law, \nwho substitute their own policy preferences for what the law really is.\n  When we see judges like that, I tell them they are undermining the \nFederal judiciary, they are making my job as chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee much more difficult, and the job of the ranking member much \nmore difficult, and they are doing wrong things.\n  It is important that this be brought to the attention of the American \npeople because these judges are nominated by the President. They are \nconfirmed for life. When they retire, they get full judgeship pay the \nrest of their lives. We need an independent judiciary in this country. \nThere is no stronger voice for an independent judiciary than I. And we \ndo need the lifetime tenure. But when judges ignore the basic laws and \nsubstitute their own policy preferences for what the law really is, \nthey are undermining the Federal judiciary, and they are disgraces to \nthe Federal judiciary.\n  Frankly, it is time that they wake up and realize that. It is \nembarrassing to the good judges throughout this country--manifestly \nembarrassing to them to have some of these judges who just think they \nare above the law; who think they are above the Constitution; who think \nthey are above the other two coequal branches of Government.\n  Thank goodness there are not too many of them in the Federal \njudiciary. Thank good goodness we have people and a Senator willing to \nstand up and say, We have had enough. I happen to be one of them.\n  Mr. President, these are important issues. The Federal judiciary can \ndetermine what happens in this country for years to come. It is \nimportant that we have people of the utmost integrity and respect for \nthe law and respect for the rule of law and respect for the role of \njudging on our Federal benches.\n  As long as I am on the Judiciary Committee, I am going to work as \nhard as I can to see that those are the kinds of people that we get \nthere. I am not so sure it is that important whether they are liberal \nor conservative, if they will respect the role of judges and respect \nthe rule of law.
