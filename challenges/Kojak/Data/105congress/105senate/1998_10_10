Mr. President, this morning, the Senate will be in a period \nfor morning business until 12:30 p.m. Following morning business, the \nSenate can be expected to consider any legislative or Executive \nCalendar items cleared for action, although I don't expect any items to \nbe cleared today. Votes are not anticipated during Saturday's session \nof the Senate, and it is expected that the Senate will not be in on \nSunday, but we will be in Monday afternoon at a time we will discuss \nwith the Democratic leadership.\n  During Friday's session, the Senate passed a continuing resolution \nallowing Government to operate until midnight Monday. So it will be \nanticipated that by Monday afternoon, we will have agreement on an \nomnibus appropriations bill or we need to consider another short-term \ncontinuing resolution.\n  Negotiations are ongoing at this time with regard to a number of \nissues, including the tax extender issue, a number of authorizations \nand appropriations issues, all of which could end up in the omnibus \nappropriations bill. Of course, there is a possibility on Monday, or at \nsome point, some of the bills that are being discussed in connection \nwith the omnibus appropriations bill might move separately. One example \nis the Treasury-Postal Service conference report. If we can get an \nagreement in the omnibus bill on some of the issues involved in that \nbill, that became controversial, if we get that worked out, we can move \nthe bill freestanding, but all of that is in the process of being \ndiscussed right now.\n  We will update our colleagues as progress is being made. I think that \nprogress is occurring. A lot of negotiations are going on this morning \nand will continue throughout the afternoon. We have had meetings \nbetween the congressional leadership and the White House this morning. \nWe expect to meet again at 5 o'clock this afternoon to get an \nassessment of where we are. We are getting Senators and House Members, \nDemocrats and Republicans, involved in all those negotiations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12272-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12272-S12273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, let me just say briefly, Mr. President, on \nthe education issue, it is very difficult to deal with these \nnegotiations fairly and honestly and productively when you have the \nPresident and the Democratic leadership coming out and bashing \nnegotiators on issues like education. It also makes it difficult, when \nyou have that happen, to be able to work with people with whom you \ndisagree philosophically, although you try to work in good faith, but \nalso it begins to diminish respect and trust.\n  That is one of the biggest problems we have right now. It is so \ndifficult to maintain a sufficient level of trust to be able to get \nyour work done. I think most people who know me--Senators on both sides \nof the aisle--know that is very important to me. I strive to be \ntrustworthy myself and to keep my word, and I find it very hard to work \nwith people who I don't have that same feeling about.\n  When it comes to education, I will stand aside to nobody, especially \na bunch of people who went to private schools and then holler and \nscream about what ought to happen in public schools. I went to public \nschools from the first grade right through college. I went to Duck Hill \nElementary and Grenada Elementary and Pascagoula Junior High School. My \nwife went to public schools. My children went to public schools.\n  I believe and care about education and public schools. I worked for \nthe University of Mississippi. My mother was a former schoolteacher. \nShe taught school for 19 years.\n  For the President to get up down there and demagog this issue about \nhow he is not getting his principles in education is very hard for me \nto accept, Mr. President. What he wants is a Federal education program. \nHe wants it dictated from Washington. He wants it run by Washington \nbureaucrats, and he wants it his way.\n  I don't have faith in Washington bureaucrats. When the money comes to \nWashington and it trickles down through the Atlanta bureaucracy and \ntrickles down to the Jackson bureaucracy, by the time it gets to the \nteachers and the kids, half of it is gone. And they are told, you must \nspend it this way or that way, when it may not be the way it is needed.\n\n  I have faith in local school administrators, local teachers, parents, \nand, yes, the children, to make the decisions about what is needed for \nreading, what is needed in remedial math, what is needed to fight the \ndrug problem. And so that is the basic difference for the American \npeople. I ask you, who do you trust on education? The local officials, \nthe local school officials, the parents, or Washington bureaucrats? \nThat is the choice.\n  President Clinton and his bureaucrats, the liberals in Washington, \nthey want to run education and manipulate education from Washington, \nDC. The Republicans say we should return the money to the local level. \nIf the schools want to use it for reading, fine. If they want to use it \nfor extra teachers, great. If they want to use it for more school \nconstruction, that is their choice. If they want to use it for a drug-\nfree school program, great; do that.\n  That is the difference. Who do you trust? Local officials or national \nofficials? Who do you trust on education? The son of a schoolteacher \nand people who went to public education, or pampered people who went to \nprivate schools and then stand on their mounts and look down their \nnoses and tell us what ought to happen in public education?\n  I have about had it on this issue, and I am sending a warning to the \nPresident of the United States: I am not going to tolerate a whole lot \nmore demagoguery on this subject.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I want to commend the able majority \nleader for his remarks on just what he said. Are the local people going \nto control education or the people in Washington going to control it? I \nam in thorough, thorough agreement with the able majority leader in \nwhat he has had to say.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12273-4", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ORDER FOR RECESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, the Medicare+Choice program was created as \npart of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 to provide Medicare \nbeneficiaries with high quality, cost effective options, in addition to \nthe continuing option of traditional fee-for-service Medicare. When \nfully implemented, Medicare+Choice will provide seniors with one stop \nshopping for health care; including hospital and physician coverage, \nprescription drugs, and even preventive benefits, at a savings.\n\n[[Page S12274]]\n\n  This change in Medicare is monumental. It is dramatic. And it is \nessential to preserving and strengthening Medicare for our seniors and \nindividuals with disabilities. This change breeds challenges--some that \ncan be predicted but many which cannot. The potential for these \nchallenges to hurt and harm is very real. The senior, so relieved to \nfinally find a health plan that covers the cost of his prescription \ndrugs because of Medicare+Choice, hears this week that he might not \nhave that plan--or that coverage next year. Who to call? What to do? We \nas a government must respond. This Administration must move decisively \nto respond and to mend flaws in the system.\n  We on the National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare \nare working hard to address ways to strengthen the security provided by \nMedicare. And the red flags raised by the announcements this week \nunderscore the importance of this work. No longer can we be satisfied \nwith an outdated, 30 year old bureaucracy as the best way to care for \nour nation's seniors. A typical 65 year old senior who retires moves \nfrom a private sector health care system--with a variety of quality, \nlow cost options, including prescription drug coverage, and out-of-\npocket protections--to a more limited, antiquated government program, \nwithout any limits on how much you are required to pay and no drug \ncoverage. By updating Medicare, we not only ensure its continued \nexistence past the current bankruptcy date 10 years from now, but we \nprovide continuity of care, limited out of pocket expenses, and a \nmechanism for improving quality of care that you the patient receive.\n  As of October 8, forty-three of the current health care plans \nparticipating in Medicare announced their intention not to renew their \nMedicare contracts in 1999. Another 52 plans are reducing service \nareas. The net result is that 414,292 beneficiaries in 371 counties \nface the daunting task of securing alternative coverage provided by \nMedicare by January 1, 1999. Although this represents a small number of \ntotal beneficiaries, about one percent, those who have relied on their \nhealth plan to bridge the traditional gap between Medicare and Medigap \nnow must either find another HMO (which means switching doctors in many \ncases), or move back to traditional fee-for-service Medicare which \nfrequently means more personal expense. Should these individuals choose \nthe traditional Medicare option, they will probably also scramble to \nfind a supplementary Medigap policy, with likely higher premiums than \ntheir original Medigap policy and perhaps fewer benefits. 10% of the \ndisadvantaged beneficiaries live in areas where no alternative Medicare \nHMO plans are offered. However, traditional Medicare remains an option \nfor every beneficiary, and by law, seniors may return to that program.\n  In addition to the serious dilemmas this disruption has caused for \nthose seniors, the extent to which HMOs pulled out sent shock waves \nthroughout the Federal government and health care industry. There are \nmany profound questions provoked by this announcement. Why are \ninsurance companies, hospital systems, and physicians who once \napplauded the Medicare+Choice program, now seemingly hesitant to \nparticipate? Are the pullouts the beginning of a trend which will \nultimately undermine the Medicare+Choice program, which was \nspecifically designed to restore Medicare's fiscal health and give \nseniors more options? To what extent are insurance companies and health \nplans over-reacting to natural ``growing pains'' associated with the \nimplementation of new policies? What actions, if any, should HCFA and \nCongress take in response to what President Clinton characterized as \nHMO's breaking ``their commitment to Medicare beneficiaries?'' The \nPresident now vows to initiate ``abandonment'' legislation to punish \nthose plans leaving and prevent a further exodus, but will he only \nsucceed in discouraging new Medicare participating contracts? How can \nwe avoid a short-sighted political response and create realistic \nincentives to provide seamless continuous coverage across geographic \nboundaries? How can we more adequately risk adjust payments to \nencourage health plans to accept, rather than avoid the most seriously \nill? How can we incentivize health plans, who have little experience in \ncaring for the chronically ill, to develop systems that appropriately \naddress the very unique and specific needs of the older population?\n  The insurance industry is responding defensively to charges that they \nhave ``abandoned beneficiaries.'' They contend that in many regions \nMedicare's payments to HMOs fall far short of even covering the cost of \ncare for beneficiaries. Furthermore, they argue at the very time a \nfledgling market structure most needs flexibility, the Administration \nhas instead placed such rigid bureaucratic burdens that their hands are \ntied and they have no choice but to opt out of certain regions. Some \nbelieve the recent pullouts may simply reflect an effort on the part of \ninsurance companies to bide time in the hopes that Congress will \neventually ease requirements and make further progress with plan \npayments.\n  Seeing what has happened to their HMO competitors, provider-sponsored \nplans, or PSO's, have also been wary of Medicare+Choice contracts. \nTheir uneasiness over the Administration's treatment of new \nparticipants, however, is secondary to their concern that private \nsector plans may boycott their facilities, viewing them as competing \ninsurers, rather than providers. PSOs face an uphill battle with state \nregulatory agencies. They fear that other insurers will use them as a \n``dumping ground'' for the expensive, chronically ill cases many \ninsurers are tempted to avoid.\n  Both HMOs and PSOs complain loudly about the high administrative \ncosts inherent in new Medicare contracts. By participating with the \ngovernment, they agree to submit large amounts of data, pay for \nextensive education campaigns for their enrollees, participate in \ngovernment sponsored health fairs, and keep up with all the regulatory \nrules and regulations. Mayo Clinic estimates that the rules governing \ntheir participation in Medicare are spelled out in 586 pages of law and \naccompanied by 111,088 pages of regulation, guidance, and supporting \ndocuments. We in government should listen to this call for \nsimplification, streamlining the regulatory burden, demanding \naccountability without trying to micromanage.\n  The Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), the government \nagency in charge of Medicare, is surprisingly optimistic and upbeat \nabout the long term feasibility of Medicare+Choice. They urge skeptics \nto remember that the program is in its infancy. They point to data on \nMedicare HMO participation, which after a rocky start in the mid 1980s, \nnow boasts one in six Medicare beneficiaries. They anticipate increased \nenrollment as more Medicare recipients have a greater understanding of \ntheir options and of how the opportunity to have a plan that meets \nspecific needs meaning better care with greater security, not less. To \ndate, full scale educational efforts have only occurred in five states. \nThe beneficiary education program, which includes a booklet and hotline \ncampaign, is slated for nationwide expansion by August, 1999. Most \nseniors are still unaware of their options in their regions. Many \nassociate expanded choice with insecurity. Only education will change \nthis. And that is a government responsibility.\n  HCFA also takes issue with the HMOs' assertion that it is underpaying \nmanaged care plans. They cite evidence obtained by the Physician \nPayment Review Commission in 1997 that Medicare has been paying $2 \nbillion a year too much to managed care plans. This observation led to \nHCFA's September decision to reject the insurance companies' proposal \nto resubmit their cost projections, to obtain additional reimbursement. \nHCFA did not intend to raise reimbursement levels, and feared that such \nan opportunity would allow plans to hike beneficiary premiums and \ndecrease benefits. In addition, HCFA points to reluctance on the part \nof HMOs to pay their fair share of marketing and education costs. But, \ndespite HCFA's point that, in the aggregate, they overpay HMOs, the \nagency governing Medicare may not be adequately considering the fact \nthat within that average there may well be plans with a \ndisproportionate number of older and sicker beneficiaries who are \nindeed underpaid. We must be committed to fair and just payment to \nthese plans for the service we are asking them to deliver. Because of \nthe tendency, at the federal level, to look at\n\n[[Page S12275]]\n\naverages, rather than individuals, and the reality of where people \nlive, we must commit to address reasonable compensation in greater \ndetail. The reality is: the reimbursement system for health care plans \nis surprisingly disassociated with the actual costs of delivering care. \nWe must invest today in designing and implementing a realistic, \nscientifically based reimbursement structure.\n  A key component of the Balanced Budget Act was the move toward equity \nin payment across the country. Many HMOs were counting on receiving \nadditional funds, following review by HCFA on the vast geographic \ndisparities in payment. However, HCFA decided to postpone this \nadjustment until 2000, based on inadequate funds following an across-\nthe-board 2% update. Thus, the so-called ``blended rates'' will not be \napplied until 2000. HCFA plans to incorporate risk adjustment in 2000 \nto reduce selective enrollment by plans and reduce total overpayments \nto managed care plans. HCFA has also recognized the adjustments \nnecessary in implementing new plans, and has thus allowed leeway with \nquality improvement plans. There are some who feel that recent \ndevelopments could have been avoided if HCFA acted more rapidly and \nmore responsibly in carrying out Congress' mandate. Congressman \nBilirakis, chairman of the House Commerce Subcommittee on Health and \nthe Environment, stated that federal health officials were ``guided by \na rigid bureaucratic mentality which led to ossification rather than \nmodernization of the Medicare program.''\n  The decision of so many managed care plans to withdraw and downsize \ntheir Medicare contracts raises a red flag. We must first resolve the \nimmediate coverage disruptions facing many of our elderly, and then \nwe--this Congress, this President, HCFA, the insurance industry and \nseniors--must pledge to work together to make this program a success. \nNot only in the short term, but with an eye to the future. To survive, \nMedicare must change. Medicare needs the flexibility to respond to the \nchanging health care environment, not only for our generation, but for \nour children and grandchildren. Now is the time for commitment and \ncompassion, rather than overreaction or prematurely concluding failure \nof changes made to date. Knee jerk reactions, rather than thoughtfully \nmoving to solve the problems, will only wreak further havoc on this \nevolving program. A commitment to education, and a more rational, \nresponsive administrative and oversight structure must be pursued to \nmeet future needs in Medicare and the care of our seniors. On a \npositive note, there are 48 pending applications of private plans \nwishing to enter the Medicare Market; 25 plans have requested to expand \ntheir current service areas. By working with HCFA, the insurance \nindustry, hospitals, health care providers, and beneficiaries, we can \nassure that the Medicare+Choice program will reach its full potential \nof better and more secure care for seniors and individuals with \ndisabilities.\n  Also embedded within my remarks is a challenge to the Congress. \nAlthough we just passed, last year, the Balanced Budget Act that \nstretched the solvency of Medicare until 2008, it is clear that the \nCongress must promptly revisit Medicare once the National Bipartisan \nCommission on the Future of Medicare files its report by March 1, 1999. \nThe dynamics of American health care, and the rapid changes in care for \nthe nation's seniors, will not allow for maintenance of the status quo \nfor the next decade. It is my hope that the current focus on \nMedicare+Choice serves as a catalyst for renewed discussion on the \nfuture of Medicare once we have the Medicare Commission's \nrecommendations in hand. We will be remiss in our responsibility if we \ndo not again next year continue our efforts to insure the solvency and \nimprove the quality of the Medicare program--for our seniors, our \nparents and grandparents, today--and for all Americans--including our \nchildren--tomorrow.\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I would like to respond briefly to the \ncomments made by the majority leader earlier this morning on the \nsubject of education.\n  I have great respect for our Senate majority leader. He and I agree \non some things and disagree on others, but I always have great respect \nfor his opinion. But on the issue of schools and what kind of, if any, \ninvolvement the Federal Government shall have on this issue, I think we \nhave a very substantial disagreement.\n  State and local governments, especially local school boards, will \nalways run our school system, and that is how it should be. I don't \nsuggest, and would never suggest, that we change that.\n  However, there are some things that we can and should aspire to as a \nnation in dealing with education. One is to improve and invest in the \ninfrastructure of our schools. I have spoken on the floor a good number \nof times about the condition of some of the schools in this country. I \nwon't go into that at great length, but let me just describe a couple \nof them.\n  At the Cannon Ball Elementary School in Cannon Ball, ND, most of the \nchildren going to that school are Indian children. There are about 150 \nstudents who must share only two bathrooms and one water fountain. Part \nof the school has been condemned. Some of those students spend time in \na room down in the older part of the school that can only be used \nduring certain days of the week because the stench of leaking sewer gas \nfrequently fills that room with noxious fumes that requires it to be \nevacuated.\n  They can't connect that school to the Internet because the wiring in \nthat 90-year-old facility will not support technology. The young \nchildren who go through those schoolroom doors are not getting the best \nof what this country has to offer. And that school district simply does \nnot have the funds on its own to repair that school or build a new one.\n  I challenge anyone in this Congress to go into that school building \nand say no to young Rosie in third grade who asked me, ``Mr. Senator, \ncan you buy us a new school?'' I would challenge anyone to go into that \nschool, and decide whether that is the kind of school you want your \nchildren to go to. Can you say that your children are entering a \nclassroom that you are proud of? I don't think so.\n  That school district doesn't have the capacity to repair that school \non its own. It has a very small tax base that will not support a \nbonding initiative for building a new school. There are schools like \nthat--the Cannon Ball Elementary School, or the Ojibwa Indian School on \nthe Turtle Mountain Reservation--all over this country, and we ought to \ndo something about it. We can do something about it we enacted a number \nof proposals on school construction. That ought to be a priority for \nthis Senate. So, too, ought this Senate have as its priority trying to \nhelp State and local governments and school districts reduce class \nsize. It makes a difference.\n  I have two children in public schools, in grade school. One goes to \nschool in a trailer, a portable classroom. The other is in a class with \n28 or 29 students. And it has almost always been that way. Would it be \nbetter if they were in schools with class sizes of 15, 16 or 18 \nstudents? Of course, it would. Does a teacher have more time to devote \nto each student with smaller classrooms? Of course. Of course. Can we \ndo something about that? Only if this U.S. Senate determines that \neducation is a priority. Only if we decide to do something about it. I \nam not suggesting that we decide that we ought to run the local school \nsystems; that is not\n\n[[Page S12276]]\n\nthe case at all. But we should decide that we as a nation have the \ncapability and the will to modernize and help construct the kind of \nschools that all of us would be proud to send our children to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12275-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12276-S12277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NEED FOR URGENT ACTION ON HOME HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as we reach the conclusion of this 105th \nCongress, I note that there are a good many issues yet to be discussed \nand resolved. I wanted to come to the floor to talk about one issue \nthat is very important, the issue of home health care. It is vitally \nimportant that Congress take action on this issue before adjourning.\n  I am very familiar with home health care. This is not theory to me. \nIt is not an issue that I just read about and only understand from \nbooks and manuals and rules and regulations.\n  One snowing Wednesday evening in January a number of years ago, my \nmother was killed in a tragic manslaughter incident in North Dakota. \nShe had gone to the hospital to visit a friend and on her drive home, \nfour blocks from home, a drunk driver going 80 to 100 miles an hour and \nbeing chased by the police hit her and killed her instantly.\n  During this same period, my father was having significant health \nproblems, and as so often is the case, my mother was providing the bulk \nof his care at home in Bismarck, ND. I will perhaps never forget the \nmoment of having to wake my father up and tell him that my mother had \nlost her life.\n  In addition to the shock of losing our mother, my family understood \nthat we were also going to have to struggle to make sure my father got \nthe care he needed. In the days ahead, we began talking about what we \ncould do to help my father in his fragile state of health. One of the \nthings we discovered was that there is in this country a system of home \nhealth care. Through this system, skilled health care providers will \ncome into the home on a routine basis to help to meet the health care \nneeds of those who desperately need it.\n  My family used the home health care system and the services of \nwonderful nurses and others who worked in home health to care for my \nfather. It allowed us to keep my father out of a nursing home and in \nthe home that he had lived in for so many years with my mother.\n  Was that important? Yes. It was very important and made life much, \nmuch better for him. And it occurred because we have a home health care \nsystem that could provide the routine health care needed to allow my \nfather to continue to live at home. My father is gone now, but I still \nremember how important that home health care was and still is to \nmillions of families all across this country.\n  Home health care is a wonderful Medicare benefit because it allows \nolder Americans to remain at home and to be independent where they are \nmost comfortable, rather than having to go into more costly hospitals \nor nursing homes.\n  But at this time, we have in our country a very serious financing \nproblem with home health care that is jeopardizing this Medicare \nbenefit. Before we end this session of the Congress, we need to do \nsomething to address it. I would like to describe just for a moment \nwhat that problem is.\n  Congress, last year, passed the Balanced Budget Act, something I \nsupported. This legislation made a lot of changes to Medicare and to \nthe home health care program. Some of those changes were warranted \nbecause the home health care program had mushroomed, and we had to \nconstrain the rate of growth of home health care spending, which had \nmore than tripled in the early 1990s.\n  But Congress went too far and, in my judgment, made a mistake in the \nway it implemented what is called the interim payment system, which is \nnow having a devastating impact on home health care agencies and \nMedicare beneficiaries. The current interim payment system penalizes \nthe very home health care agencies that have operated most efficiently \nin the past, and it locks in the payment inequities that currently \nexist. The result is that 1,100 home health agencies nationwide have \nclosed their doors.\n  Unfortunately, the very Medicare beneficiaries who are being harmed \nthe most by this interim payment system that is so unfair are those \nAmericans who need home health care the most. That is because, under \nthis interim payment system, more than 80 percent of home health \nagencies will be paid a capped amount called the ``per-beneficiary \nlimit.''\n  In my home State, the average per-beneficiary limit is $2,247, not \nnearly enough to cover the cost of care needed by the sickest and the \nmost frail of Medicare beneficiaries.\n  The home health care folks have a Hobson's choice. They can close \ntheir doors, or they can start a kind of cherry-picking with respect to \nthose who need home health care service. In other words, they can \nchoose to serve only the less ill or less sick Medicare beneficiaries \nwhom they know will not exceed the per-beneficiary cap.\n  I am told cherry-picking is not yet occurring in my home State. But I \nam afraid it is only a matter of time before home health agencies have \nno choice and begin to do that.\n  I don't believe it was Congress' intention to cause efficient home \nhealth agencies to close or to stop caring for sicker patients, and I \nthink it is imperative that this Congress solve this problem.\n  In the negotiations on the budget, I hope very much that will happen. \nIf we wait until next year, it is going to be too late. Hundreds of \nagencies will probably not be there and a good many of the sickest and \nthe most frail health care beneficiaries who need home health care will \nnot get it.\n  I have cosponsored a bill introduced by Senator Collins and others, \nthe Medicare Home Health Equity Act, that would make the home health \npayment system more fair to the historically efficient providers, and \nreduce the incentive for dropping sick patients.\n  Let me emphasize again that the purpose is to make the home health \ncare system more fair to the historically efficient home health care \nproviders.\n  There have been dozens of bills introduced to solve the problem, and \nto date more than two-thirds of the Senate from both political parties \nhave cosponsored one or more of these bills, or have gone on record in \nsupport of efforts to address the problem.\n  With nearly 70 Senators cosponsoring or supporting legislation of \nthis type, I think we ought to, before Monday evening or whenever we \nadjourn, fix this home health care payment system.\n  I know my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee have been \nworking to develop legislation that will at least deal with the most \npressing problems in this interim payment system and to tide the home \nhealth agencies over until permanent changes can be implemented.\n  One of the challenges they face is to do this in a fiscally \nresponsible way that will not harm other areas of Medicare.\n  It is also important, I think, not to be asking older Americans, \nespecially those who have reached the age of declining income, to \nshoulder the cost for this change through a new copayment on home \nhealth services.\n  I know that the Congress can meet this challenge if it decides this \nis a priority between now and perhaps Monday evening. Congress must, in \nmy judgment, begin to select the right priorities.\n  We seem to be at loggerheads here in negotiations between the House \nand the Senate, the Congress and the President, Democrats and \nRepublicans. Between now and when we complete the final omnibus \nspending bill, we must make choices about what our priorities are, what \nis more important, and what is less important.\n  I ask that we decide that dealing with the home health care payment \nsystem is more important. That it be one of the priorities.\n  This is something we can do. It is not something that is terribly \ndifficult. It is simply a choice that we will make--Democrats, \nRepublicans, liberals, conservatives, all of us deciding together how \nwe spend limited resources on nearly unlimited wants in this country.\n  Mr. President, I know others wish to speak, and I would say to the \nmajority leader that this will be an interesting couple of days. He, I \nam sure, will have a significant challenge working with all of us to \ntry to figure out what the priorities will be in the closing hours of\n\n[[Page S12277]]\n\nthis session. It is my fervent hope that one of those priorities will \nbe to address the interim payment system in home health care.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on \nthe Senate floor this afternoon about matters which I am very hopeful \ncan be addressed and will be addressed and I think should be addressed \nin the remaining hours before the Congress actually recesses. And this \nis in the area of education and what we are going to do finally in \ntrying to meet the responsibilities that we have to assure a smaller \nclass size for the 53 million Americans who will be attending and are \nattending schools across this country, which means an expansion in \nterms of the total number of teachers.\n  I am very hopeful that in the ultimate and final budget agreement \nthere will be an agreement on the President's recommendation of 100,000 \nteachers over the period of the next 5 years, and that we will also \nembrace the very, very important and, I think, essential school \nmodernization program which effectively would provide about $22 billion \nin interest-free bonds to local communities all over this country in \norder to modernize their schools.\n  What we have seen now is a rather dramatic change in the demography \nand the growth in the total number of children who are going into the \nschool systems all across this country, and at the same time you have \nseen a continued deterioration in many of the school buildings across \nthe country. That is certainly true in my State, which has many of the \noldest school buildings in the country, but it is also true in many of \nthe other States across this country, and even in a number of the rural \ncommunities.\n  As a matter of fact, the General Accounting Office did a study in \nterms of what would be necessary in our country in order to make sure \nthat we are going to have good classrooms for the students, and it was \nestimated to be $110 billion. That is what the need is according to a \nnonpartisan evaluation of what the conditions are in our school \nbuildings across the country.\n  Therefore, the recommendation the President has made for $122 billion \nis a very modest recommendation. We have not embraced that \nrecommendation at the present time. The urging of the President of the \nUnited States is that before we move out from this Congress, we ought \nto be about the business of addressing that particular education need. \nEducation is of prime importance to every family in this country. It is \nof essential importance to every young person in this Nation, and it is \na matter of enormous importance in terms of our country being able to \ncompete in a global economy.\n  So the urgency of these proposals--one is to have a reduced class \nsize and the second is to be able to modernize our classrooms--is \nenormously important. If we look over the amount of resources we devote \nto education in the budget of this country, we will find that it is \nonly about 2 percent. It is only 2 percent of our national budget.\n  This is the 1998 Federal budget, and you can see from this pie chart \nthe allocations of resources. The area of education is only 2 percent. \nIf you ask people what percent of a dollar they believe goes to \neducation, I think most Americans would think 10 or 12 percent, or 10 \nor 12 cents should be going to education. If you ask what they believe \nthey would like to be the number, it would be even higher.\n  We are only talking about 2 percent. So the real question is, in a \ntime now when our appropriators and negotiators are meeting to have \nfinal resolution on what will be a $1.7 billion budget, will we be able \nto find the resources to provide for the reduced class size for K \nthrough 3--$1 billion for fiscal 1999, $7 billion over the next 5 \nyears--to see a dramatic reduction in the number of students per class \nin K through 3, that is what we are trying to do, and to modernize our \nschool buildings all across this country.\n  Those are two priorities. I must say I strongly agree with the \nPresident, with Senator Daschle, and with Leader Gephardt who said we \nshould not leave this city until we respond in a positive way to make \nsure those requirements are fulfilled, because there is nothing that is \nmore important than meeting the needs of the children of this country.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I think this is important to do for a number \nof reasons. Every day that children go into the school systems of this \ncountry, they go into dilapidated schools, they go into old schools, \nthey go to classrooms with windows broken or with poor heating or poor \nair-conditioning in the course of the early fall and the late spring \nand early summer in many other parts of the country, or where the pipes \nare leaking, or where some schools are actually closed in the \nwintertime because of the failure of the heating system, we are sending \na very powerful message to those children.\n  On the one hand, we as parents are saying that education counts, that \nwe believe it ought to be a priority, that we think the future of this \nNation is\n\n[[Page S12278]]\n\nour children and we ought to be about the business of looking out for \nthe interests of these children to make sure they are going to have a \nwell-qualified teacher in every classroom in this country. That ought \nto be our hope, that ought to be our challenge, and that is what we are \nworking for. And that ought to be an effort made in the local \ncommunity. It ought to be an effort made at the State level. But we \nshould not say we are going to abandon our national interest by saying \nwe are not going to interfere if there are inadequate capabilities, or \nan inability, which is too often the case, to help and assist local \ncommunities, particularly when so many local communities such as we \nhave seen in the recent times in Chicago and many other communities--my \nown city of Boston--are making this extraordinary effort to enhance the \nacademic achievement for the children of this country and in those \ncommunities.\n  We ought to be able to say we will be a partner with you, we are \nwilling to be a partner with the local community, we are willing be a \npartner with the State, and we are going to be a partner in helping to \nmodernize our facilities. Otherwise, the promise that we are going to \nconvince this next generation that we are serious about their education \nis going to be a hollow one. No child will go into a classroom and see \nthat it is in a deteriorated condition and then be exposed to other \nareas where everything is bright and shiny and new because of greater \nexpenditures and not say, ``What is really important? What do our \nparents really think is important? Where they are spending the money is \nwhat is bright and shiny and new.''\n  When we are not expending the resources in the classrooms, we send a \nvery powerful message--it may be a subtle message but it is a powerful \none--that we are not prepared as a nation to do what needs to be done \nto upgrade the classrooms in this country.\n  I hope in the remaining hours of this process, as our leaders, our \nappropriators and leaders, members of those committees, get together to \nwork out the final budget, as we are starting over for the next year, \nthat the education budget is going to have the priority that every \nAmerican family wants it to have, and that is priority No. 1. I hope \nwhen we come to that No. 1 we are going to say, ``The size of our \nclasses is of enormous importance and consequence in terms of the \nability of the teacher to relate to the children.''\n  We have just heard an eloquent statement to that effect from some \nwonderful teachers from the State of South Dakota, as well as from \nMissouri, talking about the relationship between the teacher and the \nstudent and how it is enhanced to such an extraordinary degree when we \nhave smaller class sizes. It ought to be self-evident and it ought to \nbe intuitive. It is, in fact, true.\n  I am not taking the time this morning--although I have at other times \nand will again--to talk about the progress that has been made in \nacademic achievement in a number of communities when they have seen the \nsignificant reduction in the number of students per teacher that has \ntaken place in communities and States across this country. The evidence \nis overwhelming that it has an enormously important positive impact.\n  So let's get about doing what we know works, and that is to increase \nthe number of teachers that we need in our schools. Even with the \nexpansion of the number of students in our schools, let us increase the \nnumber of teachers, and let us enhance the quality of those teachers to \nmake sure we are going to have good, qualified teachers in every \nclassroom. Let's make sure the number of students in those classrooms \nwill be such that the teacher is going to be able to identify and spend \nsome moments with each child in that classroom. That is the hope and \ndesire of the teachers who have committed themselves to excellence, to \ntrying to enhance that academic achievement and accomplishment. Let's \nbe a partner with the local communities and the States that are \nembarking on that effort.\n  Let us, as we are going through the final days now--let's not leave \ntown. Let's not say we will take whatever is served up to us in the \nbudget. Let us say education is important. We can go about the business \nof trying to make a difference in the classrooms and in the quality of \nthe people who will be in those classrooms. Let us resolve that we will \ndo that before we leave this town. That is, I think, an important \nresponsibility that we have. We should not fail our children.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts).

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the work of \ndomestic violence shelters and centers in my home state of Minnesota. \nAs my colleagues may know, October is recognized as ``National Domestic \nViolence Awareness Month.'' This is a time to strengthen our resolve to \nend domestic violence and sexual assault. More importantly, it is also \na time to remember those who have suffered and died as a result of \nthese terrible crimes.\n  I am very concerned about the number of domestic violence incidents \nin our society. Americans should not have to live in fear of being \nabused by anyone, let alone a family member.\n  In my view, community-based domestic violence shelters and centers \nshould be commended for their support for victims of physical, \nemotional, and sexual abuse. Their efforts to provide shelter, \ncounseling, and assistance to battered women and children have helped \nfamilies and communities escape domestic violence.\n  I ask unanimous consent the names of these Minnesota organizations be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n       Advocates For Family Peace.\n       African American Family Services.\n       Aitkin County Advocates Against Domestic Abuse.\n       Alexandra House.\n       Anishinable Circle of Peace.\n       Anne Pierce Rogers Home.\n       Asian Women United of Minnesota.\n       B.

Mr. President, we should also note that this year marks the fourth \nanniversary of the Violence Against Women Act. Through increased \nsentences, grants to State governments for prevention programs and \nother services, and the new national domestic abuse hotline, the \nViolence Against Women Act has contributed significantly toward \nprotecting individuals from sexual offenses and domestic abuse. I am \nproud to have supported this landmark legislation as a member of the \nHouse of Representatives during the 103rd Congress.\n  Since the passage of the Violence Against Women Act, funding provided \nfor these programs has led to the further development of policies to \nprevent and respond to domestic abuse incidents. This includes \nspecialized domestic violence court advocates who obtain protection \norders, in conjunction with greater support to enhance the ability of \nprosecutors and law enforcement to punish those who commit these \ncrimes.\n  Despite these important achievements, the number of siblings, \nspouses, and children subjected to domestic abuse remains too high. \nRegrettably, most victims of domestic violence are women.\n  According to the Minnesota Coalition for Battered Women, 210 \nMinnesota women died from domestic abuse between 1988 and 1997. Sadly, \nthis loss of life underscores the importance of increasing public \nawareness regarding domestic violence and the community-based \norganizations that are working to prevent others from falling victim to \nthis violence.\n  Mr. President, domestic abuse is not limited to the privacy of \nhouseholds. In many places of businesses, battered individuals are \nsubjected to emotional abuse in the form of threatening phone calls and \nharassment.\n  Fortunately, companies have begun to recognize that employees who are \nsubject to domestic violence at home are more likely to be absent from \nwork and less productive at their jobs.\n  In fact, a recent survey of corporate senior executives by Roper \nStarch Worldwide on behalf of Liz Claiborne, Inc. found that: Fifty-\nseven percent of those surveyed believe that domestic violence is a \nmajor problem in society; thirty-three percent feel that domestic abuse \nhad a negative impact on their bottom lines; and four out of ten \nexecutives surveyed were personally aware of employees and other \nindividuals affected by domestic violence.\n\n  I commend efforts by private sector employers who have responded to \nthis problem by establishing Employee Assistance Programs and other \nservices that will safely protect employees who have become domestic \nviolence victims.\n  Mr. President, Minnesotans will have the opportunity this month to \nparticipate in a variety of National Domestic Violence Awareness Month \ninitiatives. Throughout October, citizens will raise public awareness \nthrough candlelight vigils, rallies, and marches throughout our \ncommunities.\n  One of the more creative programs will be an art exhibit honoring 30 \nMinneapolis public high school students who are finalists in the \n``Speak Up'' domestic violence awareness poster contest.\n  This initiative, co-sponsored by the Harriet Tubman Center and \nIntermedia Arts in Minneapolis, will encourage students to increase \npublic awareness and prevention of family violence. The competition \nwill award scholarships to twelve individuals who present various \ndomestic violence themes in their artwork.\n  Next fall, these works will be part of the Annual Domestic Violence \nArt exhibit in the Russell Senate Office Building sponsored by my \ncolleague, Senator Paul Wellstone.\n  I am certain many Members of Congress will visit this exhibit to \nadmire the important contributions of these young Minnesotans toward \nraising the consciousness of our communities about the issue of \ndomestic abuse.\n  Domestic violence is not an insurmountable problem facing our \nsociety. We must work together to curb this problem that crosses over \neconomical, cultural, and political boundaries.\n  Through the efforts of community groups, families, and law \nenforcement, Americans can take meaningful steps toward eradicating the \npresence of this crime in their daily lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12278-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12279-S12281]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    PRINCIPLE, COURAGE, AND TAX CUTS\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I want to take the remaining part of my \ntime this morning to talk about a subject I have worked on for the 6 \nyears I have been in Congress, and that is trying to raise the \nawareness of the issue of taxes in this country, that we are now taxed \nat an all-time high, and that Americans need and deserve some form of \ntax relief.\n  So, Mr. President, I wanted to take time to rise today to express my \ndisappointment over the Senate's failure to fulfill its obligations to \nthe taxpayers to consider and to pass any kind of tax relief bill this \nyear.\n  Fiscally, socially, morally, this is a tremendous mistake, and I \nbelieve my colleagues are wrong. I am equally disappointed at President \nClinton's threats to veto this important legislation had it passed. It \nis the same case as last year when, in the State of Virginia, when \nthen-candidate for Governor Gilmore was pledging a tax cut of his own. \nThe President said at that time that Virginians would be ``selfish'' to \nvote for tax relief. This year he says ``to squander money on a tax \ncut''--again, that is how President\n\n[[Page S12280]]\n\nClinton is describing our attempt this year to let working Americans \nkeep more of their money--``to squander money on a tax cut.''\n  Unfortunately, there is a pattern here, and apparently neither \nPresident Clinton nor the rest of Washington has changed their mind. \nBoth want as much money as they can get from the taxpayers, so they can \nspend it the way they think is best.\n  According to Webster's Dictionary, the definition of ``squander'' is \n``to spend extravagantly or foolishly.'' I say to President Clinton \nthat I am shocked that you actually believe taxpayers squander their \nsalaries in this way and that only Washington can spend the money \nwisely. With such highly placed disregard for the fiscal abilities of \nthe American people, I believe it is no wonder that Washington has been \nunwilling to give the taxpayers more control over their own dollars.\n  Let me focus first this morning, Mr. President, on the budget \nsurplus. In a recent series of high-profile celebrations, folks here in \nWashington could hardly wait to rush to the cameras to claim credit for \nthe $70 billion budget surplus, watching them slap their own backs with \ntheir hands. Politicians have been humming happy ditties all around \nthis town while approving big-ticket spending items right and left. \nMeanwhile, those same politicians pontificate about preserving the \nsurplus to ``save Social Security first.''\n  The truth is, the White House didn't generate this surplus, nor did \nthe U.S. House or the Senate. The politicians have no rightful claim to \nthe surplus. Washington should not be allowed to sit around and dream \nup ways to spend even more money because a surplus has arrived. Working \nAmericans are responsible for propelling our economy forward and \ngenerating this budget surplus, and they deserve to get it back as tax \nrelief. There should be no debate. Taxpayers have overpaid, and, like \nany other time a person overpays for anything, they ought to get it \nback. If you go into a store and pay too much for an item, you expect \nto get the change back. But somehow in Washington, if you overpay, that \nis just too bad, Washington wants to pocket your money.\n  The surplus is the product of the recent revenue surge--a surge, I \nbelieve, generated directly by increased productivity and increased \nindividual income tax payments, including the payment of capital gains \ntaxes as investors took advantage of the lower capital gains rate--\nagain, proving that reducing the tax rates can actually increase \nrevenues, because the economy will grow. Very little of the surplus \ncomes from policy changes, however, related to deficit reduction.\n  On the other hand, there are others in this Chamber who claim there \nis no surplus, that if we subtract the dollars Washington has routinely \nraided from the Social Security trust fund, the Government is still in \nthe red. Therefore, they oppose using the unified budget surplus for \nany kind of tax relief.\n  Mr. President, they are right on the facts, but I believe they are \ndead wrong about the conclusion. Washington's big spenders are the ones \nwho have exhausted every penny of the Social Security surplus. They \nhave already exhausted every penny of the Social Security surplus on \nother Government programs. They have wish lists. The taxpayers \nshouldn't be denied relief from a stifling tax burden just because \nWashington has managed to juggle the Nation's bank accounts.\n  I urge my colleagues to review the CBO's ``August Economic and Budget \nOutlook,'' which shows precisely where revenues will come from in the \nnext 10 years. The data shows that the greatest share of the projected \nbudget surplus comes directly from income taxes paid by the taxpayers, \nnot the FICA taxes. In 1998, individual income, corporate, and estate \ntaxes make up nearly 80 percent of total tax revenue growth, while the \nshare of FICA tax is about 20 percent. General tax revenues are \nexpected to grow by $723 billion, or 60 percent, over the next 10 \nyears.\n  What I am saying, Mr. President, is that the taxpayers generated the \nsurplus, outside the money earmarked for Social Security, and the \nGovernment has no right to absorb it. It is only moral and fair to \nreturn at least a part of it to the taxpayers.\n  If we don't return at least a portion of the surplus to the \ntaxpayers, and do it soon, Washington is going to spend it, leaving \nnothing then for tax relief for the vitally important task of actually \ntrying to preserve and save Social Security. Such spending will only \nenlarge the Government, and if the Government is enlarged today, it \nwill make it even more expensive to support it in the future.\n  Mr. President, the situation we find ourselves in today reflects two \nvery fundamentally different principles of government: Are we going to \nembrace tax cuts for working Americans, or are we going to embrace more \nspending for social engineering?\n  I am proud to serve here as a member of the Republican Party--a party \nwhich, since its creation, has firmly held that a person owns himself, \na person owns his labor, and a person owns the fruits of his labor. We \nbelieve the pursuit of individual and States rights and a restricted \nrole for the Federal Government create economic growth and prosperity.\n  The two parties have traditionally offered a marked choice--a choice \nbetween the Democratic Party belief that people should work for the \nGovernment or our vision of a Government that works for the people. One \nparty believes that it has a right to spend every penny that it can \ntake from working Americans--again echoing the President's words that \npeople are ``selfish'' to want to cut taxes or to ``squander money on a \ntax cut.''\n  The Republican Party, on the other hand, believes Government should \nbe limited only to that amount needed for necessary services, and this \nis, indeed, a choice between two futures: a choice between small \nGovernment or big Government, a choice between fiscal discipline or \nirresponsibility, a choice between individual freedom or servitude to a \nbigger Government, responsibility or dependency, long-term economic \nprosperity for the Nation or some short-term benefits for the special \ninterest groups and the politicians who feed them.\n  Mr. President, that is exactly why the American taxpayers ushered in \nan era of Republican congressional leadership in 1994, a new majority \nthat pledged to provide fiscal discipline, individual freedom, personal \nresponsibility, and prosperity for all people.\n  Unfortunately, Congress has so far delivered on only a small portion \nof that pledge, blocked by the competing forces of tax-and-spend versus \ntax relief and personal empowerment. The choice I spoke of a moment ago \nhas become blurred as both parties fight in a misguided effort to \npurchase some measure of the people's trust.\n  They think you can run out and with their own money buy the trust of \nthe American people. But in doing so, Congress has allowed annual \nFederal spending to increase from $1.5 trillion in 1994 to $1.73 \ntrillion today. In fact, Federal spending has never been higher. During \nthe same period, the national debt has grown from $4.9 trillion to $5.7 \ntrillion, an $810 billion increase in our national debt.\n  Mr. President, take a look at the current debate over the \nsupplemental spending to be included in the omnibus appropriations \nbill. A week ago, we were hearing encouraging words that much of this \nwould be offset by cuts in other programs. Now, as we careen toward \nadjournment, it appears there will be as much as $20 billion in \nemergency spending--out of the surplus, of course--and the report this \nmorning is that there could be even more as we work and maybe have to \ngive in to the administration demands for more money to be spent in \norder to avoid a Government shutdown.\n  Mr. President, despite a $70 billion budget surplus, total taxation \nis at an all-time high. The tax relief Congress enacted last year does \nnot go nearly far enough. I am proud we had the courage to enact the \n$500 per-child tax credit, which I authored in 1993, but when our tax \nbill overall returns to the taxpayers only one cent for every dollar \nthey send to Washington--especially now, during a time of surpluses--I \nbelieve we have failed them miserably.\n\n  Working Americans see their earnings taxed, and then re-taxed \nrepeatedly. Washington taxes their income when they first earn it. It \nis then subject to excise taxes when they spend it. And their savings \nand investments are also taxed. And when they die, the Government is \nthe first to put their hands into the estate.\n\n[[Page S12281]]\n\n  Farmers and small business owners cannot easily pass their businesses \non to their families because the huge estate and gift taxes still \nexist. The government imposes a 43 percent tax on all American couples \nsimply because they are married. Even seniors--retired people in our \ncountry, our senior citizens--they have their earned benefits taxed.\n  If the 105th Congress was supposed to be about cutting taxes and \nforever reforming the tax system--and I believe that was our mandate--\nthe 105th Congress did not complete the job.\n  Our progress has fizzled not because our efforts have lost the \nsupport of the people--in fact, two thirds of the American people \nsupported tax relief during the 1996 elections, and broad tax relief \nstill enjoys overwhelming support today--but because some in Congress \nhave lost their backbones. They have lost the courage to make a stand \non principle and not abandon their moral compass at the first sign of \nresistance.\n  In too many instances, this Congress has become a willing \ncollaborator of President Clinton's tax-and-spend policies. We have \nhelped to build a bigger, more expensive government, and in doing so \nhave abandoned our promise of tax relief for working Americans.\n  Mr. President, each time Congress makes a promise to the taxpayers--\nand then deserts them--Congress comforts itself by saying it would come \nback next year and enact an even larger tax cut. This is self-deceiving \nat best.\n  If we do not take a stand today, what is going to happen to make us \nmore courageous a year from now? Besides, each year we wait, the \nGovernment takes an ever-greater bite of the earnings of working \nAmericans and the Government gets bigger and becomes harder to trim in \nthe future.\n  Another point I would like to make, Mr. President, is that a tax cut \nis not spending. Only in convoluted bookkeeping practices of Washington \nwould we consider a cut in tax rates to be spending. The reason is \nsimple: first, it is the taxpayers' money that supports and keeps the \nGovernment running; second, tax relief not only ensures a healthy and \nstrong economy, but also generates more revenues for the Government.\n  In a recent study, economists at the Institute for Policy Innovation \nconcluded that the House-passed tax relief bill of $80 billion--an \nunforgivably moderate tax relief measure, in my view--would add an \nadditional $300 billion to our GDP and create more than 135,000 jobs. \nThis economic growth would in turn generate about $80 billion in \nadditional revenues to the Federal Government.\n  Mr. President, when it comes to federal spending, Washington rarely \nasks how the American taxpayers can afford to give up more of their \nincome to the government, and how such excessive spending will affect a \nworking family's budget and finances. Equally upsetting is the fact \nthat when it comes to tax relief, Washington is always reluctant to \nact.\n  Oh, they say it is easy to give an election year tax cut. That is \nimpossible around here. It is hard to get a tax cut. It is easy to \nspend; it is very hard to give tax relief. Congress even goes so far as \nto compel tax cut advocates to pay for any tax relief via Washington's \nPAYGO rule. That is a rule that requires increasing taxes on some or \nlowering entitlement benefits in order to cut tax relief to others. \nNothing is more ridiculous than the requirement of the PAYGO rule. We \nmust repeal it so we can do the job of shrinking the size of the \nGovernment and let working families keep more of the money, the money \nthey earn in order to spend it on their priorities--not Washington \npriorities.\n  One major reason for the failure of this year's tax relief bill is \nthat Washington's spin doctors took full advantage of Americans' \nanxiety about Social Security. ``Save Social Security first'' is just \nanother Washington lie. Mark my word, Mr. President, Social Security \ncrisis or not, Washington has spent, and will continue to spend, \nsurplus dollars whenever it can for its pet programs.\n  Since 1983, Washington has raided more than $700 billion from the \ntrust funds for non-Social Security programs, and Congress approved \nthat spending every time. In the next 5 years, the Federal Government \nwill raid another $600 billion from the Social Security trust funds. \nThose politicians who insist on using the surplus for Social Security \nhave voted for most, if not all, of those spending bills, and so it is \nthose politicians who in the last 15 years have stripped the trust \nfunds of any surplus.\n  Mr. President, despite the rhetoric about saving Social Security, few \nhave come up with a concrete plan to save it. The problem is that by \nlaw, the Social Security surplus has to be put into Treasury \nsecurities. That means Washington can legally use the money to fund its \nfavorite non-Social Security programs, rendering these ``assets'' \nlittle more than Treasury IOUs. Unless we change the law, Washington \nwill continue to abuse Social Security until it goes broke.\n  I agree that reforming Social Security to ensure its solvency is \nvitally important. Any projected budget surplus should be used partly \nfor that purpose. In fact, I have introduced a bill to just do that. \nYet, I believe strongly that the surplus alone will not save Social \nSecurity and therefore fundamental reform is needed to change it from a \npay-as-you-go system to a fully funded one.\n  Mr. President, the States offer us an excellent model of how we \nshould use the budget surplus. In recent years, many Governors have cut \ntaxes and shrunk the size of their governments, and in the process have \nturned budget deficits into surpluses. They are now using those \nsurpluses to provide even further tax relief. Some States, such as \nMissouri and Florida, even have constitutional or statutory \nrequirements to return to taxpayers any revenues that exceed income \ngrowth.\n  The States have proved that if government performs only legitimate \nand necessary functions, and does so without waste, it can leave much \nmore money in the pockets of the people. And it is the people who can \nbest spend their money, whether it is for their children's health care, \nsaving for a college education, giving more to their church and \ncharities, or just helping to set something aside for their retirement.\n  Now, Mr. President, back to the question of the budget surplus and \nwho should spend this money--the Government or the workers who earned \nit?\n  In conclusion, Washington's tax and spending policies have \nsystematically ignored our children's future and severely undermined \nthe basic functions of the family. We must abandon those policies and \nhelp restore the family to an economic position capable of fulfilling \nits vital responsibilities. In answer to my own question, we must \nprovide American families with meaningful tax relief, allowing them to \nkeep more of their hard-earned money.\n  It is their money. Let us give it back.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I can think of few issues that are more \nimportant to the average American than the safety and health of our \nNation's workers. During the last 2 years, Congress stepped up to the \nplate and confronted this important issue head-on. The end result was \nthree separate bills becoming law that amended the Occupational Safety \nand Health Act of 1970. Until this year, in 28 years, the act was \namended one time--in 1990--and that was to increase fines. The American \nworkplace has changed quite a bit over the last three decades and I'm \npleased that Congress in now changing, too.\n  During the first session of the 105th Congress, I introduced a \ncomprehensive piece of legislation with the support of\n\n[[Page S12282]]\n\nSenator Gregg and Frist and 20 other Senate cosponsors, entitled the \nSafety Advancement for Employees Act or SAFE Act. At the same time, my \ngood friend, Jim Talent, introduced similar legislation in the House \nwhich received strong, bipartisan support--a rarity for such a \npolarized issue.\n  It is important to understand that both the Senate and House versions \ndid not attempt to reinvent OSHA's wheel, just change its tires. \nTreading water for 27 years, OSHA has never seriously attempted to \nencourage employers and employees in their efforts to create safe and \nhealthful workplaces. Instead, OSHA chose to operate according to a \ncommand and control mentality. This approach has lead to burdensome and \noften incomprehensible regulations which do not relate to worker safety \nand health and are, quite often, only sporadically enforced.\n  The AFL-CIO publically acknowledges that with only 2,450 State and \nFederal inspectors regulating 6.2 million American worksites, an \nemployer can expect to see an inspector once every 167 years. In \naddition to this enormous time lapse, the sheer diversity of safety and \nhealth concerns stemming from restaurants to funeral homes across \nAmerica prohibits an inspector from fully understanding each worker's \nneeds and concerns.\n  OSHA seems more concerned about collecting fines each year than it is \nabout improving worker safety. OSHA proposes over $140 million in fines \nto be paid by the regulated public each year--over $100 million of that \ntotal gets assessed. Even more troubling is that OSHA's existing \nvoluntary and cooperative compliance programs impact a mere fraction of \nworksites and consume only a small share of the agency's annual budget. \nDespite OSHA's claim that it is ``putting a lot of resources into \ncompliance assistance and partnership initiatives,'' only 22 percent of \nOSHA's 1997 fiscal appropriation was spent on federal and state plan \ncompliance assistance. It is difficult for anyone to say that current \ninitiatives are having an impact on the number of workplace fatalities \nand injuries when OSHA spends so little of its annual funds on \npreventive measures.\n  It is important to point out that the SAFE Act would not have \ndismantled OSHA's enforcement capabilities. It was that approach \nthat kept Congress from amending the 1970 statute for so long. \nEnforcement alone, though, will never ensure the safety of our nation's \nworkplaces and the health of our working population. By encouraging \nemployers to seek individualized compliance assistance from OSHA \nqualified third party consultants, the SAFE Act would ensure that more \nAmerican workplaces are in compliance with existing law while allowing \nOSHA to concentrate its enforcement resources on those worksites that \ntruly need immediate attention. America would be better served by an \nOSHA that manages its resources more wisely and the SAFE Act was \ncrafted to strike that balance.\n\n  In addition to establishing OSHA qualified third party consultations, \nthe SAFE Act included additional voluntary and technical compliance \ninitiatives to assist employers in deeming their worksites ``safe'' for \ntheir employees. I firmly believe that it is this approach that will \nultimately bring a greater number of workplaces into compliance with \nexisting law and help prevent more workers from being injured or killed \non the job.\n  The SAFE Act would ensure that federal occupational safety and health \nstandards are based on sound, scientific data that all vested parties \ncan live with. By injecting independent scientific peer review into the \nrule-making process, future regulations would reflect greater clarity \nand simplicity--helping businesses to better understand what they are \nrequired to do. I also believe that scientific peer review will help \nspeed up the implementation process for OSHA's rules by eliminating \nconflicts of interest. Under the present system, draft rules can idle \nin the process for more than 15 years, because no one agrees on the \nrule's scientific validity. At the same time, annual funding continues \nto be channeled toward research at the expense of the taxpayer. That \nmust change.\n  Last October, we marked up the SAFE Act in the Senate Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources and favorably reported the bill out of \ncommittee. In the following months, I continued to work with Senators \nKennedy, Dodd, Wellstone, and Reed--as well as with Assistant Secretary \nof Labor, Charles Jeffress, to find common ground that would result in \na bill that would pass the House and Senate and be signed by the \nPresident into law. A number of good suggestions were made to improve \nthe bill, but remaining differences and the lack of floor time quickly \nbecame an insurmountable obstacle.\n  I was pleased to have the opportunity to testify at a hearing chaired \nby Chairman Talent in the House Small Business Committee. As the House \nauthor of the SAFE Act, Representative Talent understood the importance \nof third party consultations. He invited specialists in occupational \nsafety and health to share their candid opinions of the bill. Having \nwitnessed the testimony firsthand, I was pleased that safety and health \nprofessionals--those who have the most education, training, and field \nexperience in abating occupational hazards--embraced this bill so \nenthusiastically.\n  In both Chambers, the SAFE Act gained considerable momentum after its \nintroduction. The bill stuck to a theme--advancing safety and health in \nthe workplace. Maintaining this spirit of cooperation, it is my \nintention to promote this theme well into the 106th Congress. Until \neach of the SAFE Act's provisions become law, this debate is far from \nover.\n\n  Despite the Senate's inability to complete its consideration of the \nSAFE Act, legislative successes were still abundant. Last June, I was \npleased to have had the opportunity to pass two bills in the Senate \nthat were authored by Representative Ballenger. One was the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration Compliance Assistance \nAuthorization Act, and the other was H.R. 2877, which eliminated the \nimposition of quotas in the context of OSHA's enforcement activities. \nBoth bills are now law and have already been implemented by OSHA.\n  Following the same lines as the SAFE Act, these two bills were \nwritten to increase the joint cooperation of employees, employers, and \nOSHA in the effort to ensure safe and healthful working conditions. It \nwill never be productive to threaten employers with fines for non-\ncompliance when millions of safety conscious employers don't know how \nthey are supposed to comply. Nor is it effective to burden employers \nwith more compliance materials than they can possibly digest or \nunderstand, many of which have no application to their business. To \nachieve a new, cooperative approach, the vast majority of employers who \nare concerned about worker safety and health must have compliance \nassistance programs made more accessible to them and more related to \ntheir actual operation. Passage of H.R. 2864 was a good, first step in \nproviding employers just that.\n  H.R. 2877 eliminated enforcement quotas for OSHA compliance \ninspectors. This bill prohibits OSHA from establishing a specific \nnumber of citations issued, or the amount of penalties collected. I \nbelieve that inspectors must not face institutional pressure to issue \ncitations or collect fines, but rather they should work to identify \npotential hazards and assist the employer in abating them. OSHA's \nsuccess must depend upon whether the nation's workforce is safer and \nhealthier, and not upon meeting or surpassing goals for inspections, \ncitations, or penalties.\n  In July, both the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources and \nfull Senate unanimously passed S. 2112, the Postal Employees Safety \nEnhancement Act. The bill was written to bring the Postal Service and \nits more than 800,000 employees under the full jurisdiction of OSHA. \nGovernment must play by its own rules. Although all federal agencies \nmust comply with the 1970 Occupational Safety and Health statute, they \nare not required to pay penalties issued to them by OSHA. The lack of \nany enforcement tool renders compliance requirements for the public \nsector ineffective at best.\n  My first look at this issue occurred when Yellowstone National Park \nwas cited by OSHA last February for 600 violations--92 of them serious. \nOne of those serious violations was the park's failure to report an \nemployee's death to OSHA. In fact, Yellowstone posted five employee \ndeaths in the past three\n\n[[Page S12283]]\n\nand one-half years. Although there are these and other serious problems \nnoted in the park's safety and health record, overall federal injury, \nillness, lost work-time, fatality and workers's compensation rates show \nthe United States Postal Service leading the pack in almost every \ncategory.\n\n  Postal workers injuries and illnesses represent 42 percent of the \ngovernment's lost-time cases. From 1992 to 1997, the Postal Service \npaid an annual average of $505 million in workers' compensation costs \nand its annual contribution accounted for almost on-third of the \nfederal program's $1.8 billion price tag. These alarming statistics \nmade my decision to slowly bring the federal government into compliance \nrather easy.\n  In 1982, the Postal Service became fiscally self-sufficient--\ndepending entirely on market-driven revenues rather than taxpayer \ndollars. They should be congratulated for that. Today, the United \nStates Postal Service handles over 43 percent of the world's mail--\ndelivering more mail in one week than Federal Express and the United \nParcel Service combined deliver in an entire year. With annual profits \nthat exceed $1.5 billion, if the Postal Service were a private company, \nit would be the 9th largest business in the United States and 29th in \nthe entire world.\n  Realistically speaking, the Postal Service is hardly a federal \nagency. It's better characterized as a self-sufficient, quasi-\ngovernment entity. It is the only federal agency where its employees \ncan collectively bargain under the 1935 National Labor Relations Act. \nIt's the only federal agency that posts annual profits exceeding $1.5 \nbillion. In fact, the Postal Service exhibits almost every \ncharacteristic of a private business, yet it never had to fully comply \nwith federal occupational safety and health law--until now. Last month, \nRepresentative Greenwood, author of the House bill, took the initiative \nto pass the Postal Employees Safety Enhancement Act in the House and \nsent it on to the President.\n  Since the bill's enactment, I learned that OSHA and the National Park \nService, have entered into safety pact. I commend both agencies for \nthis commitment to workplace safety and health. It is my understanding \nthat other federal agencies could do the same. I hope that such \nagreements with OSHA represent a way to introduce third party \nconsultations as a means of bringing a greater number of federal \nworksites into compliance.\n  The enactment of S. 2112 and the previous two bills marks the first \nsignificant step toward modernizing the nation's 28 year-old \noccupational safety and health law. I believe that these incremental \naccomplishment were achieved because this Congress is committed to \nimproving conditions for America's workers. We have a long road ahead \nof us and that road, so far, had been too slow to save American lives. \nThis debate will not end when Congress completes its work this year. I \nfully intent to press forward--well into the 106th Congress. More \nhearings on this important issue are necessary. We need a bipartisan \neffort--making headway in every area we can reach agreement. We need to \ndedicate some time to reaching that agreement. This will not happen by \naccident! Good legislation will ultimately be achieved and increased \ncompliance will undoubtedly result if we simply remain committed to it.\n\n  I want to conclude my remarks by thanking members and staff for \nmaking occupational safety and health such a successful issue during \nthe last two years. I want to first thank my House colleague and friend \nJim Talent. His impressive knowledge of labor law, complemented by his \nlabor counsel, Jennifer Woodbury, helped bring the SAFE Act to the \nattention of all House members. I look forward to work on many more \nbills with Jim Talent in the coming years. I would also like to thank \nCongressmen Ballenger, Greenwood, and McHugh and their staff. They, \ntoo, should be complimented for their efforts. Senators Gregg, Frist, \nand Jeffords also deserve tremendous thanks. Their staffs spent many \nhours considering OSHA legislation. Finally, I want to thank my \nDemocratic colleagues on the Senate Labor Committee. Senator Kennedy \nwas especially considerate in listening to my concerns and I want to \nextend my appreciation to him and his staff. I am confident that this \nrelationship will pick up next year where it left off.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12281-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12283-S12284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PASSAGE OF COALBED METHANE LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I want to take a minute before the Senate \nadjourns to thank a few Members who have been very helpful on an issue \nof critical importance to my state.\n  Yesterday evening, the Senate adopted by unanimous consent, S. 2500, \na bill to preserve the sanctity of existing leases and contracts for \nproduction of methane gas from coal beds. An affirmative U.S. \nGovernment policy has been the legal basis for these contracts for \nnearly eighteen years and it was the intent of this bill to preserve \nthe existing rights of all the parties in light of legal uncertainties \ncast by a July 20, 1998, 10th Circuit Court of Appeals decision.\n  On September 18, I introduced the bill to protect these people, with \nmy colleagues, Senator Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico and Senator Craig \nThomas of Wyoming. The affected people live all across America, but \nmost of the actual lands are in the western states, primarily New \nMexico, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, and Montana.\n  The circumstances faced by interest owners would be severe. Personal \nand corporate bankruptcies would have led to local bank insolvencies \nand the multiplying effect on unemployment and loss of confidence in \nwestern states would have been devastating. In this time when Congress \nis working to offer a $4-7 billion aid package to provide certainty for \ncrop farmers, I am pleased that we have been able to reach agreement to \nprovide some certainty for people in the oil patch--and we did it \nwithout spending a single federal dime.\n  The 1998 Circuit Court decision has clouded all existing lease and \nroyalty agreements for production of gas out of coal where the \nownership of the oil and gas estate differs from ownership of the coal \nestate. This uncertainty jeopardizes the expected income of all royalty \nowners and the planned investment and development of all existing \nlessees.\n  The legislation we passed yesterday addresses that problem faced by \nowners and lessees by preserving the policy status quo for valid \ncontracts in effect on or before the date of enactment. The legislation \napplies only to leases and contracts for ``coalbed methane'' production \nout of federally-owned coal. It does not apply to leases and contracts \nfor gas production out of coal that has been conveyed, restored, or \ntransferred to a third party, including to a federally recognized \nIndian tribe.\n  It is important to note that many older leases and contracts for gas \nproduction on coal lands were negotiated prior to ``coalbed methane'' \nbecoming a term of art. It is, therefore, necessary to clarify that we \ndo not mean to exclude those valid leases and contracts that convey \nrights to explore for, extract and sell ``natural gas'' from applicable \nlands simply because they do not include the term ``coalbed methane.'' \nThat is a possible ambiguity that arose very late in the process, after \nthe time when we could have reasonably perfected the bill, but it is \nimportant to note because before this year, ``coalbed methane'' has \nbeen considered in the field, to be part of the gas estate. We chose \nthe term ``coalbed methane'' because using the term ``natural gas from \nthe coalbed,'' left uncertainty about the gas rights in light of the \n10th Circuit ruling. The Department of Interior suggested we use \n``coalbed methane'' so as to be very clear regardless of whether the \nCourts rule ``coalbed methane'' to be part of the coal estate or part \nof the natural gas estate in the future.\n  While the bill has yet to be completed in the House, I want to thank \nsome of the members who have helped us craft legislation that addresses \nwhat we intended to cover. Without any of them, we would not have been \nable to go forward. Because of very limited time, we had to expedite \nthe process, and we could not have done it without an enormous amount \nof help. Senator Campbell, and his Indian Affairs Committee staff, were \nsupportive in working out the provisions covering the tribes. Senator \nMurkowski, and his Energy Committee staff, were very helpful in working \nout the details of the bill and moving it through that Committee. \nSenator Bumpers, and his com-\n\n[[Page S12284]]\n\nmittee staff, were very cooperative and provided many helpful \nsuggestions.\n  The Department of Interior Solicitor's office provided good counsel \nand worked with us through the process. And the people out in the \nfield, the coal companies, who have valid concerns about their existing \nand future leases to main federal coal, were great to work with. \nNothing in this bill should be construed to limit their ability to mine \nfederal coal under valid leases, nor should anything be construed to \nexpand their liabilities to coalbed methane owners covered by the bill. \nThe gas producers and land owners really came together and proposed \nreasonable solutions to solve the problems. Without their cooperative \neffort, this bill would not have happened.\n  So again, my appreciation goes out to all the people who helped us \nremove the possibility of devastating situation--extensive private \nproperty takings, retroactive liabilities, and mountains of combative \nlitigation. On behalf of thousands of Wyomingites, thank you.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12283-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ROLE OF THE SENATE SUBCOMMITTEE ON COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I want to take this time to recognize the \nimportant role and work of the Senate's Subcommittee on Communications \nthis Congress and emphasize the challenges that lie ahead.\n  The communications world encompasses so many areas that personally \ntouch the lives of practically every person in America--from the \ntelephone to the television to the computer. The ways we interact is a \nfitting reflection of the fast times in which we live and the constant \nevolution of technologies. Traditional systems are changing. Options \nare expanding. Companies continue to shift gears and take the necessary \nrisks to bring fruition of the landmark 1996 Telecommunications Act to \nthe marketplace and to consumers.\n  Enacting policies to encourage, and not hinder, such activity is \nCongress' challenge. Mr. President, I believe the members of this \nsubcommittee are ready and willing to embrace that challenge.\n  I want to express my sincere gratitude to my colleague and friend, \nSenator Conrad Burns of Montana, for his yeoman's work as chairman of \nthe subcommittee during the course of this Congress. His guidance has \nbeen instrumental in bringing focus to the many issues that merit \nattention. His inclusive and enthusiastic approach has engaged all who \nwork with him, and I appreciate that.\n  Mr. President, many contentious policy areas were considered by the \nsubcommittee during the 105th, and consensus proved elusive. I am \nconfident, though, that the stage has been set for several productive \ndebates in the first session of the 106th--from Federal Communications \nCommission reauthorization, to international satellite privatization, \nto transition to digital, to competition issues, to Internet privacy \nand content.\n  Speaking of the Internet, let me take this opportunity to mention my \ndeep admiration for the contributions made by retiring Senator Dan \nCoats in this area. Although not a member of the Commerce Committee, he \nhas tirelessly advocated against the Internet becoming a dirty book for \nour children, while responsibly taking into account first amendment \nconcerns. I have the utmost respect for his efforts, and will truly \nmiss his wisdom and his counsel.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the contributions of each of my \nsubcommittee colleagues this Congress, and look forward to working with \nthem next year in tackling some tough issues and ushering in a truly \nnew era of communications.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12284-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL BIBLE WEEK\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, one of our country's most important \nobservances is National Bible Week sponsored by the National Bible \nAssociation. This year, as in the past, it will be observed by houses \nof worship and individuals of all faiths during the week in which \nThanksgiving Day falls. That will be from Sunday, November 22 through \nSunday, November 29.\n  It is my great and underserved honor to be this year's congressional \nco-chair of that observance. In that capacity, I would like to \nrecommend to all my colleagues, and to the American people, that, in \nthis season of strife and division we look to National Bible Week as an \nopportunity to join together in prayerful reflection.\n  The German poet Heinrich Heine called the Bible ``that great medicine \nchest of humanity,'' the greatest cure for the worst ills of mankind. \nAnd he observed how--during the great fire that destroyed the Second \nTemple of ancient Israel--the Jewish people rushed to save, not the \ngold and silver vessels of sacrifice, not the bejeweled breastplate of \nthe High Priest, but their Scriptures. For the Word of God was the \ngreatest treasure they had.\n  It remains our greatest treasure today. The lessons it teaches, and \nthe morality it commands, are the foundation on which a free people \nbuild self-government. In that sense, the Bible is the charter of our \nliberties. Daniel Webster put it this way: ``If we abide by the \nprinciples taught by the Bible, our country will go on prospering.''\n  That has never been a partisan sentiment, and neither should it be so \ntoday. Two great political rivals of the early twentieth century, both \nof whom achieved the Presidency and attained world leadership, agreed \non this one point.\n  Teddy Roosevelt said, ``A thorough knowledge of the Bible is worth \nmore than a college education.'' And Woodrow Wilson, a university \npresident at Princeton before reaching the White House, counselled, \n``When you have read the Bible, you will know it is the word of God, \nbecause you will have found in it the key to your own heart, your own \nhappiness and your own duty.''\n  Here in the Senate, as in the House of Representatives, there are \nseveral small Bible study groups. Members of all faiths regularly come \ntogether, away from the public spotlight, to learn from one another and \nseek inspiration from sacred Scripture.\n  For my part, I find in those sessions both enlightenment and \nchallenge. For any time we read the Bible with an open heart, we may \nfind ourselves falling short, in some way, of the standard it sets for \nus and the promise it offers us.\n  In that way, reading the Bible can be like a spiritual work-out. And \nif, in the process, we feel the spiritual equivalent of a few sore \nmuscles, we can remember the saying, ``No pain, no gain.'' And the gain \nthat Scripture offers lasts a lifetime--and even longer.\n  For that reason, it is especially appropriate that Thanksgiving Day \ncomes during National Bible Week, for the Bible itself is something for \nwhich we should give thanks, on that day and every day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12284-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TITLE BRANDING LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Today I express my appreciation to the majority leader, \nSenator Ford, Senator Gorton, and Senator McCain for their hard work \nand efforts on S. 852, the National Salvage Motor Vehicle Consumer \nProtection Act. I believe S. 852 will deter automobile theft and \nprotect consumers by providing them with notice of severely damaged \nvehicles. I would like to emphasize one provision contained in the \nbill. It is my understanding that the process of reducing salvage and \nnonrepairable vehicles to parts cannot begin before receipt of a \nsalvage title, nonrepairable vehicle certificate, or other appropriate \nownership documentation under state law. If a vehicle could be \ndismantled prior to the receipt of the appropriate ownership documents, \nthen the parts from a severely damaged vehicle could skirt the titling \nsystem which this bill has put in place to deter automobile theft. Is \nmy understanding correct?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes, that is correct. A vehicle that would qualify as a \nnonrepairable or as salvage vehicle cannot be taken apart for its parts \nbefore appropriate ownership documentation has been received for that \nvehicle.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate that the Senator from Colorado has taken \nthe time to address this important issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12284-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12284-S12286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MEDICARE HOME HEALTH FAIR PAYMENT ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as we begin to wrap-up the 105th Congress,\n\n[[Page S12285]]\n\nthere remains one essential item of business which I strongly believe \nwarrants Senate action before we adjourn for the year.\n  Over the past year, numerous concerns have been raised by home health \ncare agency officials and Medicare beneficiaries over the new Medicare \npayment system established in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n  As a strong home health care advocate in the Senate for virtually my \nentire career, I am well aware of the importance home health care is \nfor Medicare beneficiaries with acute needs such as recovering from \njoint replacements and chronic conditions such as heart failure.\n  Utahns have consistently told me they prefer to receive care in their \nhomes rather than in institutional settings such as hospitals and \nnursing homes.\n  In fact, patients actually do better in their recovery while at home \nthan in a nursing home or hospital. And, clearly, the costs associated \nwith home care are far less than what is charged in an institutional \nsetting.\n  As a member of the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over the \nMedicare program, I am also well aware of the impending financial \ncrisis Medicare was facing last year. Home health care was the fastest \ngrowing component in Medicare.\n  Between 1989 and 1996, Medicare spending for home health services \nrose from $2.5 billion to $16.8 billion. Concurrently, according to the \nGAO, the number of home health agencies grew from 5,700 in 1989 to more \nthan 10,000 in 1997.\n  Indeed, home health care spending threatened to consume more and more \nof the limited Medicare dollars.\n  Last year, Congress was faced with an extraordinary and daunting \ntask--namely, the financial survival of the Medicare program.\n  No less than President Clinton's own advisors who serve as his \nappointed Trustees for the Medicare Trust Fund warned Congress that \nabsent immediate action Medicare Part A would be insolvent by the year \n2001.\n  Clearly something had to be done. The status quo was unacceptable.\n  To control the rapid cost growth in all components of Medicare, \nCongress passed the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, or the BBA, which \nrequired the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), the agency \nresponsible for administering the Medicare program, to implement a \nProspective Payment System that sets fixed, predetermined payments for \nhome health services.\n  Until that system could be developed and implemented, agencies would \nbe paid through an Interim Payment System, or IPS, which imposes limits \non agencies' cost-based payments. These limits were designed to provide \nincentives to control per visit costs and the number and mix of visits \nfor each user.\n  Since the implementation of the IPS on October 1, 1997, numerous \nconcerns have been raised about severe equity issues in the payment \nlimit levels.\n  For instance, wide disparities exist in reimbursement levels ranging \nfrom $760 to $53,000 on average per beneficiary. The payment limits are \nfurther exacerbated by a major distinction in the payment rules between \nthe so-called ``new'' verses ``old\" agencies.\n  The impact of the IPS has caused comparable home health agencies \nproviding comparable home health services to receive very different \nreimbursement payments. The payment limit issues are further \nexacerbated by the imposition of a 15% across the board cut in payment \nrates which is scheduled to take effect in October 1999.\n  According to a September 1998 report from the General Accounting \nOffice, at least 12 home health agencies in my state of Utah have been \nforced to close their doors since the implementation of the IPS.\n  This leaves just 75 agencies to serve the entire estimated home \nhealth care population of 22,000 home health beneficiaries throughout \nmy state.\n  And, I note for my colleagues who have not had the pleasure of \nvisiting Utah, with its spectacular vistas and magnificent mountains, \nessentially is a rural state with population centers far apart.\n  So if you live in Panguitch or Vernal, and your home health agency \ncloses its doors, you will be very lucky if there is any other service \noption available.\n  Home health care is particularly vital in improving efforts to \ndeliver health care in rural areas where quality, long term care has \nbeen deficient for too long.\n  As my colleagues recall last year, there was no disagreement on the \nneed to move to the PPS. The home health care industry was supportive \nof the new system--and remains supportive to this day.\n  The problem is with moving to the PPS from the current cost-based \npayment system. Data which was not available to accurately develop the \nPPS would be needed before such a system could be put into place.\n  Accordingly, the IPS was proposed as a mechanism to provide HCFA was \nthe necessary baseline information to develop the PPS.\n  As we now know, the IPS has resulted in new cost limits causing many \nhome health agencies to close and resulted in beneficiaries, \nparticularly those with high-cost needs, to have difficulty in \nobtaining care.\n  I am especially mindful of the situation in my state of Utah where \nmany of my constituents have talked to me about the problem.\n  I have met with officials from Utah's home health agencies from \naround the state as well as with beneficiaries who depend on the \nservices performed by these agencies.\n  Moreover, the Senate Small Business Committee held a hearing on July \n15, 1998 on the impact of the IPS on small home health businesses. One \nof my constituents, Mr. Marty Hoelscher, CEO of Superior Home Care in \nSalt Lake City testified at the hearing. He stated:\n\n       The IPS provides a flat payment to agencies for each \n     patient, regardless of the amount of care the patient \n     medically requires. What happens to the really sick patients? \n     What happens to the agencies who don't turn their backs on \n     them? In Utah, the patients of the 18 free standing agencies \n     which have recently ceased operations are filling our \n     emergency rooms, intensive care units, nursing homes or \n     morgues.\n\n  I have been working concertedly with my Senate colleagues to resolve \nthese problems. For example, in July, I joined with 20 of my colleagues \nin the Senate on July 16, 1998 to cosponsor S. 2323, the ``Home Health \nAccess Preservation Act of 1998.''\n  This legislation was designed to alleviate the problems created by \nthe IPS, and specifically, to address the problems associated with the \nhigh costs of caring for the sickest patients and those who need care \non a long term basis.\n  After Senator Grassley introduced S. 2323, it became evident that the \nbudget neutrality provision--which necessitated that S. 2323 incur no \nnew spending--was requiring us to reallocate resources in a way that \ndisadvantaged some home health providers in order to assist others.\n  Many members expressed concerns that because of the problems inherent \nin such a reallocation, we should just repeal the IPS totally. I was \nextremely sympathetic to those concerns, but unfortunately, the \nCongressional Budget Office advised us that such a repeal was very \ncostly; in fact, it was so costly that a total repeal was clearly out \nof question if we are to maintain the balanced budget which is so \nimportant to our country.\n  I am pleased that as a result of several months work by the Chairman \nand ranking minority member of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth and \nSenator Moynihan along with those of us on the committee have developed \nthis bipartisan proposal which is supported by the home health \nindustry.\n  The legislation we are introducing today, while not a perfect \nmeasure, is a responsible bill that will improve problems inherent in \nthe current law and which will work to the benefit of thousands of \nAmericans who rely on very valuable home health care services.\n  Under this legislation, several steps will be taken to improve the \nIPS.\n  First, the bill will reduce the extreme variations in payment limits \napplicable to old agencies within states and across state lines.\n  The bill also provides for a reduction in the payment level \ndifferences between ``old'' and ``new'' agencies. Such provider \ndistinctions exist nowhere else in the Medicare system and contribute \nto the arbitrary nature of the payment system for health care services.\n  Moreover, the bill delays for one year the 15% across the board cut \nin payment limits for all agencies that was to\n\n[[Page S12286]]\n\ntake effect in October 1999. Home health agencies in my state tell me \nthis is perhaps the most significant and important feature of the bill.\n  The bill further directs the Health Care Financing Administration to \ntake all feasible steps necessary to minimize the delay in the \nimplementation of the PPS. Specifically, HCFA will be required to \naccelerate data collection efforts necessary to develop the case-mix \nsystem which is at the heart of the PPS model.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to add my name as an original cosponsor \nto this vitally needed legislation.\n  As we are all too painfully aware, our budget rules require that any \nlegislation such as this which proposes ``new'' Medicare spending be \naccompanied by a reduction in spending to offset the costs.\n  While I understand the need to maintain budget neutrality, I am \nconcerned about the offsets in the Roth bill, but I am pleased Senator \nRoth has agreed to consider other offsets in order to address my \nconcerns. We cannot move forward without an offset since the \nCongressional Budget Office has scored the bill at a cost of $1 \nbillion.\n  With the assurance that I now have received from the Chairman of the \nFinance Committee, I am lending my support to this important bill.\n  Our overriding objective at this late time with only hours left in \nthe 105th Congress is to get this bill passed by the Senate and into \nconference with the House.\n  I am pleased that the House approved its version of the legislation \njust moments ago, and while the House legislation is not the measure I \nwould want, its passage does move us substantially closer toward \nenactment of a final bill prior to adjournment.\n  I can assure my constituents in Utah who depend on home health care \nservices that I will continue to pursue legislative resolution of these \nfinancing issues to preserve the home health care benefit for all \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  And finally, let me also assure the dedicated and hard working people \nof Utah who provide home health care services that I will continue to \nwork with them to bring some logic to the new Medicare payment system.\n  I especially want to thank Marty Hoelscher, Steve Hansen, Grant \nHowarth, Vaughn McDonald, Dee Bangerter and the many others in Utah, \nespecially the Utah Association of Home Health Agencies, for their \ncounsel and leadership over the past year in working on this very \ncomplex issue.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto proceed in morning business for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there are two subjects that I wish to bring \nto my colleagues' attention this afternoon. First, I want to talk about \nan issue of enormous international consequence--the situation with \nrespect to Iraq. For the last 2 months, as we know, Saddam Hussein has \nbeen testing, yet again, the full measure of the international \ncommunity's resolve to force Iraq to eliminate its weapons of mass \ndestruction. That has been the fundamental goal of our policy toward \nIraq since the end of the gulf war and is reflected in the U.N. \nagreements reached in the aftermath of the war.\n  Two months ago, on August 5, Saddam Hussein, formally adopting a \nrecommendation that had been made by the Iraqi parliament 2 days \nearlier, announced that Iraq would no longer permit U.N. weapons \ninspectors to conduct random searches in defiance of its obligations \nunder those U.N. resolutions that were adopted at the end of the war, \nand also in violation, I might add, of its agreement last February with \nU.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, to give UNSCOM teams, accompanied by \ndiplomatic overseers, unconditional access to all sites where UNSCOM \nbelieved that Iraq may be stockpiling weapons or agents to make those \nweapons.\n  Let's understand very clearly that ever since the end of the war, it \nhas been the clear, declared, accepted, and implemented policy of the \nUnited States of America and its allies to prevent Saddam Hussein from \nbuilding weapons of mass destruction. And as part of that agreed-upon \npolicy, we were to be permitted unlimited, unfettered, unconditional, \nimmediate access to the sites that we needed to inspect in order to be \nable to make that policy real.\n  Iraq's defiance and the low-key--some would say weak--response of the \nUnited States and the United Nations initially went unnoticed, in part \nbecause of other events, including the dual bombings of our embassies \nin Kenya and Tanzania, as well as the obvious fascination with domestic \nevents that have dominated the headlines now for so many months. Those \nevents, frankly, have continued to obscure the reality of what is \nhappening in Iraq; and, accordingly, the reality of the potential \nthreat to the region--a region where, obviously, the United States, for \n50 years or more, has invested enormous amounts of our diplomatic and \neven our domestic energy.\n  Press reports of the administration's efforts to intervene in, or at \nminimum, to influence UNSCOM's inspection process and the resignation \nof American UNSCOM inspector, Scott Ritter, focused the spotlight \nbriefly on our Iraqi policy and raised some serious and troubling \nquestions about our efforts to eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass \ndestruction. The principal question raised was a very simple one: Are \nthose efforts still intact, or has our policy changed?\n  Last month, press reports suggested that administration officials had \nsecretly tried to quash aggressive U.N. inspections at various times \nover the last year, most recently in August, in order to avoid a \nconfrontation with Iraq--this despite repeatedly demanding the \nunconditional, unfettered accesses that I referred to earlier for the \ninspection teams. Scott Ritter, the longest serving American inspector \nin UNSCOM, charged at the time that the administration had intervened \nat least six or seven times since last November when Iraq tried to \nthwart UNSCOM's work by refusing to allow Ritter and other Americans to \nparticipate on the teams, in an effort to delay or postpone or cancel \ncertain UNSCOM operations out of fear of confrontation with Iraq.\n  Those were serious charges. We held an open hearing, a joint hearing \nbetween the Armed Services Committee and Foreign Relations Committee on \nthese charges. There were some protestations to the contrary by the \nadministration and a subsequent effort to ensure that the Security \nCouncil would maintain the sanctions against Iraq, but, frankly, \nnothing more.\n  In explaining his reasons for resigning, Scott Ritter stated that the \npolicy shift in the Security Council supported ``at least implicitly'' \nby the United States, away from an aggressive inspections policy is a \nsurrender to Iraqi leadership that makes a ``farce'' of the \ncommission's efforts to prove that Iraq is still concealing its \nchemical, biological, and nuclear weapons programs.\n  Administration officials have categorically rejected the notion that \nU.S. policy has shifted, either in terms of our willingness to use \nforce or support for UNSCOM. They have also disputed Ritter's charges \nof repeated U.S. efforts to limit UNSCOM's work. Writing in the New \nYork Times on August 17, Secretary Albright stated that the \nadministration has ``ruled nothing out, including the use of force'' in \ndetermining how to respond to Iraqi actions, and that supporting UNSCOM \nis ``at the heart of U.S. efforts to prevent Saddam Hussein from \nthreatening his neighborhood.'' While acknowledging that she did \nconsult with UNSCOM's Chairman, Richard Butler, after Iraq suspended \ninspections last month, she argued that he ``came to his own conclusion \nthat it was wiser to keep the focus on Iraq's open defiance of the \nSecurity Council.'' Attempting to proceed with the inspections, in her \nview, would have ``allowed some in the Security Council to muddy the \nwaters by claiming again that UNSCOM had provoked Iraq,'' whereas, not \nproceeding would give us a ``free hand to use other means'' if Iraq \ndoes not ``resume cooperation'' with the Security Council. At that \ntime, she also stressed the importance of maintaining the comprehensive \nsanctions in place to deny Saddam Hussein the ability to rearm Iraq and \nthus threaten his neighbors.\n  I appreciate the Secretary's efforts to set the record straight. But, \nMr. President, I have to say, in all candor, that\n\n[[Page S12287]]\n\nI don't think that her op-ed or subsequent statements by the \nadministration have put to rest legitimate questions --legitimate \nquestions or concerns about what our policy is and where it is headed--\nnot just our policy alone, I might add, but the policy of the United \nNations itself, and the policy of our allies in Europe.\n\n  The fact of the matter is, in my judgment, the U.S. response and that \nof the Security Council to Saddam Hussein's latest provocations are \ndifferent in tone and substance from responses to earlier Iraqi \nprovocations.\n  Three times in the last 11 months Saddam Hussein has launched \nincreasingly bolder challenges to UNSCOM's authority and work. In \nNovember, he refused to allow American inspectors to participate on the \nteams. Although that crisis ultimately was resolved through Russian \nintervention, the United States and Britain were leading the effort to \npush the Security Council to respond strongly. In subsequent weeks, \nSaddam Hussein refused to grant UNSCOM access to Presidential palaces \nand other sensitive cites, kicked out the team that was led by Scott \nRitter, charging at the time that he was a CIA spy, and threatened to \nexpel all inspectors unless sanctions were removed by mid-May.\n  By February, the United States had an armada of forces positioned in \nthe gulf, and administration officials from our President on down had \ndeclared our intention to use military force if necessary to reduce \nIraq's capacity to manufacture, stockpile or reconstitute its weapons \nof mass destruction, or to threaten its neighbors.\n  Ultimately diplomacy succeeded again. In a sense, it succeeded again. \nIt averted the immediate crisis. One can certainly raise serious \nquestions about how effective it was with respect to the longer-term \nchoices we face. But certainly in the short term, Secretary General \nKofi Annan successfully struck an agreement with Iraq to provide UNSCOM \ninspectors, accompanied by diplomatic representatives, full and \nunfettered access to all sites. There is little doubt that this \nagreement would not have been concluded successfully without the \nSecurity Council's strong calls for Iraqi compliance combined with the \nspecter of the potential use of American force.\n  Saddam's latest provocation, however, Mr. President, strikes at the \nheart of our policy, and at the capacity of UNSCOM to do its job \neffectively. As long as the U.N. inspectors are prevented, as they are, \nfrom undertaking random no-notice inspections, they will never be able \nto confirm the fundamentals of our policy. They will never be able to \nconfirm what weapons Iraq still has or what it is doing to maintain its \ncapability to produce weapons of mass destruction.\n  Yet, when confronted with what may be the most serious challenge to \nUNSCOM to date, the administration's response, and that of our allies \nand the United Nations, has been to assiduously avoid brandishing the \nsword and to make a concerted effort to downplay the offense to avoid \nconfrontation at all costs, even if it means implicit and even explicit \nbacking down on our stated position as well as that of the Security \nCouncil. That stated position is clear: That Iraq must provide the U.N. \ninspectors with unconditional and unfettered access to all sites.\n  Secretary Albright may well be correct in arguing that this course \nhelps keep the focus on Iraq's defiance. It may well do that. But it is \nalso true that the U.N.-imposed limits on UNSCOM operations, especially \nif they are at the behest of the United States, work completely to \nSaddam Hussein's advantage.\n  They raise questions of the most serious nature about the \npreparedness of the international community to keep its own commitment \nto force Iraq to destroy its weapons of mass destruction, and the much \nlarger question of our overall proliferation commitment itself. They \nundermine the credibility of the United States and the United Nations \nposition that Iraq comply with the Security Council's demands to \nprovide unconditional and unfettered access to those inspectors. And, \nobviously, every single one of our colleagues ought to be deeply \nconcerned about the fact that by keeping the inspectors out of the very \nplaces that Saddam Hussein wants to prevent them from entering, they \nsubstantially weaken UNSCOM's ability to make any accurate \ndetermination of Iraq's nuclear, chemical or biological weapons \ninventory or capability. And in so doing, they open the door for Iraq's \nallies on the Security Council to waffle on the question of sanctions.\n  I recognize that the Security Council recently voted to keep the \nsanctions in place and to suspend the sanctions review process. But, \nMr. President, notwithstanding that, the less than maximum level of \ninternational concern and focus on the underlying fact that no \ninspections take place, the continuation of Iraq's weapons of mass \ndestruction program, and the fact that Saddam Hussein is in complete \ncontravention of his own agreements and of the U.N. requirements--that \ncontinues to be the real crisis. And Saddam Hussein continues to refuse \nto comply.\n  Since the end of the gulf war, the international community has sought \nto isolate and weaken Iraq through a dual policy of sanctions and \nweapons inspections. Or, as one administration official said, to put \nhim in a ``box.'' In order to get the sanctions relief, Iraq has to \neliminate its weapons of mass destruction and submit to inspections. \nBut it has become painfully apparent over the last 11 months that there \nare deep divisions within the Security Council particularly among the \nPermanent 5 members over how to deal with Saddam Hussein's aggressive \nefforts to break out of the box.\n  Russia, France and China have consistently been more sympathetic to \nIraq's call for sanctions relief than the United States and Britain. \nWe, on the other hand, have steadfastly insisted that sanctions remain \nin place until he complies. These differences over how to deal with \nIraq reflect the fact that there is a superficial consensus, at best, \namong the Perm 5 on the degree to which Iraq poses a threat and the \npriority to be placed on dismantling Iraq's weapons capability. For the \nUnited States and Britain, an Iraq equipped with nuclear, chemical or \nbiological weapons under the leadership of Saddam Hussein is a threat \nthat almost goes without description, although our current activities \nseem to call into question whether or not one needs to be reminded of \nsome of that description. Both of these countries have demonstrated a \nwillingness to expend men, material and money to curb that threat.\n  France, on the other hand, has long established economic and \npolitical relationships within the Arab world, and has had a different \napproach. Russia also has a working relationship with Iraq, and China, \nwhose commitment to nuclear nonproliferation has been less than \nstellar, has a very different calculus that comes into play. Iraq may \nbe a threat and nonproliferation may be the obvious, most desirable \ngoal, but whether any of these countries are legitimately prepared to \nsacrifice other interests to bring Iraq to heel remains questionable \ntoday, and is precisely part of the calculus that Saddam Hussein has \nused as he tweaks the Security Council and the international community \nsimultaneously.\n  Given the difference of views within the Security Council, and no \ndoubt the fears of our Arab allies, who are the potential targets of \nIraqi aggression, it is really not surprising, or shouldn't be to any \nof us, that the administration has privately tried to influence the \ninspection process in a way that might avoid confrontation while other \nefforts were being made to forge a consensus. But now we have to make a \njudgment about the failure to reinstate the inspection process and ask \nourselves whether or not that will destroy the original ``box'' that \nthe administration has defined as so essential to carrying out our \npolicy.\n  Is it possible that there is a sufficient lack of consensus and a \nlack of will that will permit Saddam Hussein to exploit the differences \namong the members of the Security Council and to create a sufficient \nlevel of sanctions fatigue that we would in fact move further away from \nthe policy we originally had?\n  To the extent that his efforts are successful, we will find ourselves \nincreasingly isolated within the Security Council. In fact, it is \nalready clear that some of our allies in the Security Council are very \nopen to the Iraqi idea of a comprehensive review of its performance in \ndismantling all of its nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons--a \nreview which Iraq hopes will\n\n[[Page S12288]]\n\nlead to a lifting of some if not all of the sanctions.\n  I think the question needs to be asked as to how long we can sustain \nour insistence on the maintenance of sanctions if support for sanctions \ncontinues to erode within the Security Council. If it is indeed true \nthat support is eroding--and there are great indicators that, given the \ncurrent lack of confrontation, it is true--then the question remains, \nHow will our original policy be affected or in fact is our original \npolicy still in place?\n  In April, Secretary Albright stated that, ``It took a threat of force \nto persuade Saddam Hussein to let the U.N. inspectors back in. We must \nmaintain that threat if the inspectors are to do their jobs.''\n  That was the policy in April. Whether the administration is still \nprepared to use force to compel Iraqi compliance is now an enormous \nquestion. The Secretary says it is, but the recent revelations raise \nquestions about that.\n  In addition, it seems to me that there are clear questions about \nwhether or not the international community at this point in time is as \ncommitted as it was previously to the question of keeping Iraq from \ndeveloping that capacity to rob its neighbors of tranquility through \nits unilateral development of a secret weapon program.\n  In May, India and Pakistan, despite all of our exhortations, \nconducted nuclear tests. In August, U.S. intelligence reports indicated \nthat North Korea is building a secret underground nuclear facility, and \nlast month North Korea tested a new 1,250-mile-range ballistic missile \nwhich landed in the Sea of Japan. Each and every one of these events \nraises the ante on international proliferation efforts and should cause \nthe Senate and the Congress as a whole and the administration, in my \njudgment, to place far greater emphasis and energy on this subject.\n  If the United States and the United Nations retreat in any way on \nIraq, if we are prepared to accept something less than their full \ncompliance with the international inspection requirement that has been \nin place now for 7 years, it will be difficult to understand how we \nwill have advanced the cause of proliferation in any of those other \nareas that I just mentioned.\n  Mr. President, over the years, a consensus has developed within the \ninternational community that the production and use of weapons of mass \ndestruction has to be halted. We and others worked hard to develop arms \ncontrol regimes toward that end, but obviously Saddam Hussein's goal is \nto do otherwise. Iraq and North Korea and others have made it clear \nthat they are still trying, secretly and otherwise, to develop those \nweapons.\n  The international consensus on the need to curb the production and \nuse of weapons of mass destruction is widespread, but it is far from \nunanimous, and, as the divisions within the Security Council over Iraq \nindicate, some of our key allies simply don't place the same priority \non proliferation as we do.\n  The proliferation of weapons, be they conventional or of mass \ndestruction, remains one of the most significant issues on the \ninternational agenda. Obviously, solutions won't come easily. But I am \nconvinced that in the case of Iraq, our failure would set the \ninternational community's nonproliferations efforts back enormously.\n  Our allies need to understand that the ramifications of letting \nSaddam Hussein out of the box that we put him in with respect to \ninspections would be serious and far-reaching. So I believe we need to \nkeep the pressure on them to stand firm, to stand firm with us, and \nunless we reassert our leadership and insist that Iraq allow those \ninspectors to do their job, we will have destroyed a number of years of \nour effort in ways, Mr. President, that we will regret in our policy \nfor the long haul.\n  I would point out also that there are experts on Iraq, those in the \ninspections team, those at the U.N. and elsewhere in our international \ncommunity, who are very clear that Saddam Hussein's first objective is \nnot to lift the sanctions. His first objective is to keep Iraq's \nweapons of mass destruction program--that will come ahead of all else.\n  The situation is really far more serious than the United Nations, the \nCongress or the administration have made clear to the American people \nor demonstrated through the level of diplomacy and focus that is \ncurrently being placed on this issue. It is not simply about \neliminating Saddam Hussein's capacity to threaten his neighbors. It is \nabout eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction--chemical, \nbiological, and nuclear. Failure to achieve this goal will have a \nprofound impact, I believe, on our efforts with respect to our other \nnonproliferation efforts including completion of our talks with Russia \nand the ultimate ratification of the START II treaty by the Duma.\n  In recent conversations that I had with Chairman Butler, he confirmed \nthat Saddam Hussein has only this one goal--keeping his weapons of mass \ndestruction capability--and he further stated with clarity that Iraq is \nwell out of compliance with U.N. resolutions requiring it to eliminate \nthose weapons and submit to inspections and out of compliance with the \nagreement that he signed up to in February with Kofi Annan.\n  Mr. President, I believe there are a number of things we could do, a \nnumber of things both in covert as well as overt fashion. There is more \npolicy energy that ought to be placed on this effort, and I believe \nthat, as I have set forth in my comments, it is critical for us to \nengage in that effort, to hold him accountable.\n  In February, when we had an armada positioned in the gulf, President \nClinton said that ``one way or the other, we are determined to deny \nIraq the capacity to develop weapons of mass destruction and the \nmissiles to deliver them. That is our bottom line.''\n  The fact is, Mr. President, over these last months there has been \nprecious little to prevent Saddam Hussein from developing that capacity \nwithout the inspectors there and without the unwavering determination \nof the United Nations to hold him accountable. So the question still \nstands, What is our policy and what are we prepared to do about it?\n  Mr. President, I had asked to speak also on another topic for a \nmoment. I see my colleague from New Mexico is here. Let me ask him what \nhis intentions might be now and maybe we can work out an agreement.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am on the list for 20 minutes, and I \nhave a 2:30 beginning on the budget process working with the White \nHouse on some offsets. How much longer did the Senator need?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, under those circumstances, I know that the \nchairman needs to get to those talks. I was going to speak for a longer \nperiod of time. What I will do is just proceed for another 5 minutes, \nto summarize my thoughts, if it is agreeable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12286-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12288-S12291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE EDUCATION CRISIS\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we appear to be, obviously, stuck on the \nissue of education in the Senate as in the country. We have been \ntalking about the crisis for a long time now. The fact is that there \nisn't a community in the country that isn't struggling with its public \nschool system. Vouchers gain in popularity notwithstanding the fact \nthat they are only going to solve the problem for a few of our kids. \nAnd the truth is that too many of our schools have a diminished tax \nbase and an inability through the property tax to be able to do what \nthey need to do.\n  We also know that too many of our students are graduating from high \nschool and given a degree by a principal even though principals in this \ncountry know that too many of those kids can't even read or write \nproperly. Of 2.6 million kids who graduated from high school a year and \na half ago, fewer than a third graduated with a proficient reading \nlevel. One-third were below basic reading, one third were at basic \nreading level, and only 100,000 of them had a world-class reading \nlevel. Thirty percent of our kids need remedial reading, writing, and \narithmetic in the first days when they go to college. The truth is, we \nalso have a crisis of teachers and their availability in our school \nsystem. We need some 2 million new teachers in the course of the next \n10 years. We will need to hire 60 percent of them in the course of the \nnext 5 years. This year alone, 61,000 new teachers went into our school \nsystems. But the fact is, we are not able to draw from the best \nuniversities, the best colleges, and the best students because we \nbarely pay enough for subsistence as\n\n[[Page S12289]]\n\nstarting salary and because too many kids come out of college today \nwith loan payments due and with other opportunities that draw them away \nfrom the prospect of teaching.\n\n  We really do have a major set of choices in front of us about our \neducation system. There is a great struggle here in Washington. A lot \nof people argue the Federal Government has no role whatsoever, there is \nnothing the Federal Government can do with respect to this. After all, \nonly 7 percent of the budget comes from the Federal Government, and as \nwe all know, it is a cherished notion in America that schools are run \nlocally. And that is the way we want it. I agree with that. There is \nnothing in what I propose that would suggest the Federal Government \nought to increase its relationship. In fact, it can decrease it. But we \nhave to acknowledge the reality that there are too many communities \nthat simply cannot do it on their own. There is a whole new set of \nrelationships that need to be created in our education system between \nteachers and the principals, the school boards and the layers of \nbureaucracy that have been created for all of these years.\n  So I suggest we ought to undo the bureaucracy, think differently, \nthink out of the box and not be locked into a traditional debate \nbetween Democrats and Republicans, conservatives and liberals. We ought \nto look at a way that we can take the best practices, what works best \nin a parochial school, in a private school--or in a wonderful public \nschool. The truth is, there are some incredible public schools in this \ncountry where teaching is going on and kids are going on to the best \ncolleges in the country. When you go to those schools, you will \ninvariably find a principal, above all, who is energized, respected, \ncreative, visionary; who has the respect of the community, who is able \nto move the school into new curricula, into a new relationship with the \nschool board, into a new relationship with the students and with the \nteachers and they have worked out their own hybrid relationships with \nthe teachers' unions and with the layers of bureaucracy. They have \nliberated themselves in many ways from what stifles creativity in too \nmany of our schools. In essence, they have become a charter school \nwithin the public school system.\n  I believe what we ought to strive to do is to allow every school \nwithin the public school system to effectively become a charter school \nwithin the public school system, allow those schools to be able to have \nprincipals who run the school on a local basis, hiring teachers from \nany walk of life, being responsible for the quality of that teaching. \nIt does not make sense in America that someone who can teach at a \ncollege might not be allowed to teach in a high school or in a \nsecondary or elementary school simply because they have not gone \nthrough the structure of the education system that is now licensed to \nprovide teachers in most of our communities.\n  How is it that you can have a professor in a college who would not be \nable, on a long-term basis--yes, maybe on a provisional basis--but on a \nlong-term basis to teach in the public school system? We need to \nprovide choice and competition within the public school system. We need \nto have accountability in those systems in ways that parents and \nchildren and the community as a whole will be more involved in the life \nand breadth of that school.\n  I am going to be introducing legislation together with some \nRepublican colleagues later in the year. I will be putting it in now as \nan outline, for purposes of the Record. I look forward, I hope in the \nnext Congress, to our opportunity to engage in a stronger and more \nlively debate about real solutions to the crisis of education in \nAmerica.\n  I yield the floor and ask unanimous consent the outline be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the outline was ordered to printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                  A Plan to Educate America's Children\n\n                       (By Senator John F. Kerry)\n\n\n            Title I--Voluntary state reform incentive grants\n\n       If education reform is to succeed in America's public \n     schools, we must demand nothing less than comprehensive \n     reform effort. The best public school districts are \n     simultaneously embracing a host of approaches to educating \n     our children; high standards and accountability, sufficient \n     resources, small class sizes, quality teachers, motivated \n     students, effective principals, and engaged parents and \n     community leaders. We must not be half-hearted in our efforts \n     to make reform feasible for every school in this country. We \n     cannot address only one challenge in education and ignore the \n     rest. We must make available the tools for real comprehensive \n     reform so that every aspect of public education functions \n     better and every element of our system is stronger.\n       So let us now turn to a bold answer: Let's make every \n     public school in this country essentially a charter school \n     within the public school system. Let's give every school the \n     chance to quickly and easily put in place the best of what \n     works in any other school--private, parochial or public--with \n     decentralized control, site-based management, parental \n     engagement, and real accountability.\n       Several schools across the country have devised ways to \n     accomplish this by raising standards to improve student \n     achievement, lowering class size, improving on-going \n     education for teachers, and reducing unnecessary middle-level \n     bureaucracy. Numerous high-performance school designs have \n     also been created such as the Modern Red Schoolhouse program, \n     the Success for All program, and the New American Schools \n     program. The results of extensive evaluations of these \n     programs have shown that these designs are successful in \n     raising student achievement. Studies show that these many of \n     these successful programs cost less than the national median \n     of basic education revenues per pupil for K-12 school \n     districts. If we brought all schools up to the spending level \n     of the national median, all schools could finance these high-\n     performance school designs. Therefore, we should raise \n     spending to the state or the national median, whichever is \n     higher, thereby allowing every school district to finance and \n     implement comprehensive reform based on proven high-\n     performance models and teach students to the highest \n     standards (58 percent of school districts are below either \n     the national or their state median). Although money alone \n     will not solve the problems in poor school districts, it is \n     impossible to solve without adequate resources. Rather than \n     piecemeal, fragmented approaches to reform, the Comprehensive \n     School Reform program is intended to foster coherent \n     schoolwide improvements that cover virtually all aspects of a \n     school's operations.\n       To ensure that the vast majority of school districts could \n     engage in comprehensive school reform, Title I of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) should also be \n     fully funded. Title I is the primary federal help for local \n     districts to provide assistance to poor students in basic \n     math and reading skills. Title I currently provides help \n     to local school districts for additional staff and \n     resources for reading and math, curriculum improvements, \n     smaller classes, and training poor students' parents to \n     help their children learn to read and do math. However, \n     Title I only reaches two-thirds of poor students because \n     of inadequate funding. Since 90 percent of school \n     districts receive at least some Title I funds, fully \n     funding Title I and allowing school districts to use these \n     additional funds for comprehensive reforms would give \n     schools the ability to implement comprehensive reforms so \n     that all students reach the highest academic standards.\n       Most poor school districts lack the resources to meet the \n     vital educational needs of all of their students. A well-\n     crafted program with the federal and state governments \n     working in close cooperation with one another could make \n     major strides in closing these gaps and improving student \n     performance.\n       Comprehensive school reform will help raise student \n     achievement by assisting public schools across the country to \n     implement effective, comprehensive school reforms that are \n     based on proven, research-based models. No new federal \n     bureaucracy would be established--the program would be \n     implemented at the state level. Furthermore, no funds could \n     be used to increase the school bureaucracy. School districts \n     would implement a comprehensive school reform program and \n     evaluate and measure results achieved. Schools would also \n     provide high-quality and continuous teacher and staff \n     professional development and training, have measurable goals \n     for student performance and benchmarks for meeting those \n     goals, provide for meaningful involvement of parents and the \n     local community in planning and implementing school \n     improvement, and identify how other available federal, state, \n     local, or private resources will be utilized to coordinate \n     services to support and sustain the school reform effort.\n       The funding for the program would move towards the goal of \n     providing every school district in the country enough funds \n     to implement a high quality, performance-based model of \n     comprehensive school reform at a cost of $4,270. This would \n     mean providing enough funds to bring every district up to the \n     state or the national median, whichever is higher (it is \n     estimated that $30 billion annually would be needed to bring \n     the per-pupil expenditure of every school district up to the \n     national or state average). To move towards this goal, the \n     federal government would provide funds and states would match \n     this money (states would provide 10 to 20 percent with poorer \n     states providing a smaller match). To receive these funds, \n     states would have to provide a minimum spending effort based \n     on state and local school spending relative to the state's \n     per capita income. Funding would be $250 million in FY99, \n     $500 million in FY2000, $750 million in FY2001, $1 billion in \n     FY2002, and $4 billion in FY2002.\n\n[[Page S12290]]\n\n       Fully fund Title I so almost all school districts would \n     receive some funds to implement comprehensive school reform \n     (90 percent of all local school districts receive Title I \n     funds). Funding would be $200 million in FY99, $400 million \n     in FY2000, $600 million in FY2001, $1 billion in FY2002, and \n     $4 billion in FY2002.\n\n\n       Title II--Ensure That Children Begin School Ready To Learn\n\n       Recent scientific evidence conclusively demonstrates that \n     enhancing children's physical, social, emotional, and \n     intellectual development will result in tremendous benefits. \n     Many local communities across the country have developed \n     successful early childhood efforts and with additional \n     resources could expand and enhance opportunities for young \n     children. We must enhance private, local, and state early \n     successful support programs for young children by providing \n     resources to expand and/or initiate successful efforts for \n     at-risk children from birth to age six.\n       Provide funds to States to make grants to local early \n     childhood development collaboratives. States would fund \n     parent education and home visting classes and have great \n     flexibility to decide whether to also support quality child \n     care, helping schools stay open later for early childhood \n     development activities, or health services for young \n     children. Communities would be required to document their \n     unmet needs and how they would use the funds to improve \n     outcomes for young childen so they begin school ready to \n     learn. Funding would be $100 million in FY99, $200 million in \n     FY2000, $300 million in FY2001, $400 million in FY2002, and \n     $1 billion in FY2002.\n\n\n            Title III--Excellent Principals Challenge Grant\n\n       Principals face long hours, high stress, and too little \n     pay. To overcome these obstacles, principals in successful \n     schools must have effective leadership skills. However, too \n     few principals get the training they need in management \n     skills to ensure their school provides an excellent education \n     for every child. Attracting, training, and retaining \n     excellent principals is essential to helping every local \n     school district become world class.\n       Establish a grant program to states to provide funds to \n     local school districts to attract and to provide professional \n     development for elementary and secondary school principals. \n     Activities would include developing management and business \n     skills, knowledge of effective instructional skills and \n     practices, learning about educational technology, etc. \n     Funding would be $20 million per year. States and local \n     school districts would contribute 25 percent of the total \n     although poor school districts would be exempt from the \n     match.\n\n\n  Title IV--Establish ``Secone Chance'' Schools For Troubled Students\n\n       Parents, students, and educators know that serious school \n     reform cannot succeed without an orderly and safe learning \n     environment. The few students who are unwilling or unable to \n     comply with discipline codes and make learning impossible for \n     the other students need behavior management programs and high \n     quality alternative placements. Suspending or expelling \n     chronically disruptive or violent students is not effective \n     in the long run since these students will fall behind in \n     school and may cause additional trouble since they are \n     frequently completely. unsupervised; these students need \n     alternative placements that provide supervision, \n     remediation of behavior and maintenance of academic \n     progress. Although some may resist this program for fear \n     that it will be used to isolate disabled students, the \n     purpose is to provide additional interventions for \n     troubled students, not to change disciplinary actions \n     against disabled students.\n       Add a new title to the Elementary and Secondary Education \n     Act (ESEA) to establish a competitive state grant program for \n     school districts to establish ``Second Chance'' programs. To \n     receive the funds school districts must enact district-wide \n     discipline codes which use clear language with specific \n     examples of behaviors that will result in disciplinary action \n     and have every student and parent sign the code. \n     Additionally, schools may use the funds to promote effective \n     classroom management; provide training for school staff and \n     administrators in enforcement of the code; implement programs \n     to modify student behavior including hiring school \n     counselors; and establish high quality alternative placements \n     for chronically disruptive and violent students that include \n     a continuum of alternatives from meeting with behavior \n     management specialists, to short-term in-school crisis \n     centers, to medium duration in-school suspension rooms, to \n     off-campus alternatives. Funding would be $100 million per \n     year and distributed to states through the Title I formula.\n\n\n  Title V--Teacher Recruitment and On-going Education Incentive Grant\n\n       Approximately 61,000 first-time teachers begin in our \n     nation's public schools each year. Since the average starting \n     salary for teachers is a little more than $21,000 per year, \n     we need to raise their compensation to attract a larger group \n     of qualified people into the teaching profession. Since the \n     average student loan debt of students graduating college who \n     borrowed money for college is $9,068, the most effective way \n     to provide federal assistance to states to raise teachers' \n     salaries is to provide loan forgiveness. In addition, \n     scholarships ought to be available to the most talented high \n     school students in every state in return for a commitment to \n     teach in our public schools (North Carolina has successfully \n     recruited future teachers from within public high schools \n     with the lure of college scholarships).\n       States would be given funds to provide poor school \n     districts the ability to raise teacher salaries to attract \n     and retain the best teachers. Funding would be provided \n     through the Title I ``targeted grant'' formula (the minimum \n     threshold would be 20% poor children or 20,000 poor \n     children). Funding would be $500 million for FY 99, $500 \n     million in FY 2000, $1 billion in FY 2001, $1 billion in FY \n     2002, and $2 billion in FY 2003. Additionally, full-time \n     state certified public school teachers who teach in low-\n     income areas or who teach in areas with teacher shortages \n     such as math, science, and special needs would have 20 \n     percent of their student loans forgiven after two years of \n     teaching, an additional 20 percent after three years, an \n     additional 30 percent after four years, and the remaining 30 \n     percent after five years. The program would be funded at $50 \n     million each year. Finally, an additional $10 million would \n     be provided as grants to states that wish to provide signing \n     bonuses for first-time teachers who teach in low-income areas \n     or areas with teacher shortages.\n       Provide $10 million in grants for states to establish a \n     program to provide college scholarships to the top 20 percent \n     of SAT achievers or grade point average in each state's high \n     school graduating class in return for a commitment to become \n     a state certified teacher for five years. States would \n     contribute 20 percent of the funds for the scholarships. Five \n     percent of the total funds could be used by local school \n     districts to hire staff to recruit at the top liberal arts, \n     education, and technical colleges (districts would be \n     encouraged to establish a central regional recruiting office \n     to pool their resources). One percent of the total funds \n     would be used by the Secretary of Education to create a \n     national hotline for potential teachers to receive \n     information on a career in teaching.\n\n\n              title vi--teacher quality enhancement grants\n\n       We need to provide on-going education in teaching skills \n     and academic content knowledge, establish or expand \n     alternative routes to state certification, and establish or \n     expand mentoring programs for prospective teachers by veteran \n     teachers (according to the National Commission on Teaching \n     and America's Future, beginning teachers who have had the \n     continuous support of a skilled mentor are more likely to \n     stay in the profession).\n       Establish Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants, a competitive \n     grant awarded to states to improve teaching. The grants would \n     have a matching requirement and must be used to institute \n     state-level reforms to ensure that current and future \n     teachers possess the necessary teaching skills and academic \n     content knowledge in the subject areas they are assigned to \n     teach. In addition, establish Teacher Training Partnership \n     Grants, designed to encourage reform at the local level to \n     improve teacher training. One of the uses of these funds \n     would be for states to establish, expand, or improve \n     alternative routes to state certification for highly \n     qualified individuals from other occupations such as business \n     executives and recent college graduates with records of \n     academic distinction. Another use would be to mentor \n     prospective teachers by veteran teachers. Provide $100 \n     million per year for these new teachers training programs so \n     that states can improve teacher quality, establish or expand \n     alternative routes to state certification for new teachers, \n     and mentor new teachers by veteran teachers.\n\n\n   title vii--invest in community-based schools and community service\n\n       As many as five million children are home alone after \n     school each week. Most juvenile involvement in crime--either \n     committing crime or becoming victims themselves--occurs \n     between 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. Children who attend quality after-\n     school programs, however, tend to do better in school, get \n     along better with their peers, and are less likely to engage \n     in delinquent behavior. Expansion of both school-based and \n     community-based after school programs will provide safe \n     developmentally appropriate environments for children and \n     help communities reduce the incidents of juvenile delinquency \n     and crime. In addition, many states and localities such as \n     Maryland and the Chicago public school system require high \n     school students to perform community service to receive a \n     high school diploma. The real world experience helps \n     prepare students for work and instills a sense of civic \n     duty.\n       Expand the 21st Century Learning Centers Act by providing \n     $400 million each fiscal year to help communities provide \n     after-school care. Grantees will be required to offer \n     expanded learning opportunities for children and youth in the \n     community. Funds could be used by school districts to \n     provide: literacy programs; integrated education, health, \n     social service, recreational or cultural programs; summer and \n     weekend school programs; nutrition and health programs; \n     expanded library services, telecommunications and technology \n     education programs; services for individuals with \n     disabilities, job skills assistance; mentoring; academic \n     assistance; and drug, alcohol, and gang prevention \n     activities.\n       Provide $10 million in grants to states that have \n     established or chose to establish a state-wide or a district-\n     wide program that requires high school students to preform\n\n[[Page S12291]]\n\n     community service to receive a high school diploma. States \n     would determine what constitutes community service, the \n     number of hours required, and whether to exempt some low-\n     income students who hold full-time jobs while attending \n     school full-time. The grants would be matched dollar for \n     dollar with half of the match coming from the state and local \n     education agencies and half coming from the private sector.\n\n\n    title viii--expand the national board certification program for \n                                teachers\n\n       The National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, \n     which is headed by Gov. Jim Hunt, established rigorous \n     standards and assessments for certifying accomplished \n     teaching. To pass the exam and be certified, teachers must \n     demonstrate their knowledge and skills through a series of \n     performance-based assessments which include teaching \n     portfolios, student work samples, videotapes and rigorous \n     analyses of their classroom teaching and student learning. \n     Additionally, teachers must take written tests of their \n     subject-matter knowledge and their understanding of how to \n     teach those subjects to their students. The National Board \n     certification is offered to teachers on a voluntary basis and \n     complements but does not replace state licensing. The \n     National Commission on Teaching for America's Future called \n     for a goal of 105,000 board certified teachers by the year \n     2006 (since the exam began recently, only about 2,000 \n     teachers are currently board certified). Since the exam costs \n     $2,000, many teachers are currently unable to afford it.\n       Provide $189 million over five years so that states have \n     enough money to provide a 90% subsidy for the National Board \n     certification of 105,000 teachers across the country.\n\n\n       title ix--help communities to modernize america's schools\n\n       More than 14 million children in America attend schools in \n     need of extensive repair or replacement. According to a \n     comprehensive survey by the General Accounting Office (GAO) \n     requested by Senator Moseley-Braun, Senator Kerry and others, \n     the repair backlog totals $112 billion. Researchers at \n     Georgetown University found that the performance of students \n     assigned to schools in poor condition fall by 10.9 percentage \n     points below those in buildings in excellent condition.\n       To help rebuild, modernize, and build over 5,000 public \n     schools, provide federal tax credits to school districts to \n     pay interest on nearly $22 billion in bonds at a cost of $5 \n     billion over five years.\n\n\n                title x--encourage public school choice\n\n       Many public schools have implemented public school choice \n     programs where students may enroll at any public school in \n     the public school system. In contrast to vouchers for private \n     schools, public school choice increases options for students \n     but does not use public funds to finance private schools \n     which remain entirely unaccountable to taxpayers.\n       Provide $20 million annually in grants to states that \n     choose to implement public school choice programs. School \n     districts could spend the funds on transportation and other \n     services to implement a successful public school choice \n     program. Up to 10 percent of the funds may be spent by a \n     school district to improve low performing school districts \n     that lose students due to the public school choice program.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Under the previous order, the Chair \nrecognizes the Senator from New Mexico for up to 20 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Sessions from Alabama. \nHe was here ahead of me and, frankly, had a more legitimate right to \nspeak now than I, and I appreciate his permitting me to proceed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12288-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SENATOR DALE BUMPERS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First let me talk for a moment, since he is present on \nthe floor, of Senator Bumpers, the senior Senator from Arkansas. Let me \nuse a couple of minutes of my time to say a few words about him before \nI proceed to talk about the budget and a few other matters.\n  First, I want to say to Senator Bumpers, I don't think he needs me to \nrepeat again what I have said in committee. He is going to be missed. \nHe has been a real credit to this place called the U.S. Senate. I have \nnever known him to behave, act, or in any way conduct himself as to \ndemean this place. He has held it in respect, and that makes it a \nbetter place when we do that.\n  But I also want to remind the Senate, since it has not been stated \nhere on the floor as I know of, that in the energy and water \nappropriations bill it was my privilege, at the behest of some of Dale \nBumpers' good friends here in the Senate, with the help of his staff \nand others, to include a resolution honoring him for his diligent and \nhard work on behalf of the public domain in the United States--the \nforest lands, the wilderness, the parks. In that bill, the resolution \nsays we want him to be known for as long as there is an Arkansas. Thus, \nwe took eight wilderness areas that are in his State that he had a lot \nto do with, and for name purposes we made all of them part of one \nwilderness called the Dale Bumpers Wilderness Area.\n  That is now 91,000 acres in total that will bear your name. I know \nmany other things could be done to indicate our esteem for you, but \nmany of us thought that this might just be one that would strike you as \nquite appropriate. And we hope so. It is now the law of the land. The \nPresident signed it about 22 hours ago. Thus, I am here saying it in \nyour presence.\n  I thank you personally on behalf of our side of the aisle for \neverything you have done.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield just a moment \nfor me to say: I want that to be my legacy, Senator. You couldn't have \ndone anything that would please me more. I have had a few accolades in \nmy 24 years in the Senate. I have had several things named after me. \nBut I can tell you that what you did in that Energy and Water Committee \ngives me unbelievable satisfaction. The reason I sponsored that \nlegislation and fought so hard for it several years ago is because I \nwanted my children and my grandchildren to know what my values were. I \nwas trying to save something for them.\n  I thank you very much.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Then, might I say to Senator Bumpers, that aisle, from \nyour podium on down here to the first step into the well, is going to \nget a deserved rest when you leave. That aisle and the carpet there is \ngoing to take a new breath and say there is nobody walking up and down \non top of us, because Dale Bumpers is not walking, walking the floor \nthere as he delivers his eloquent speeches on the Senate floor. I only \nsay that by way of the great respect we have for the way you talk to \nus, and talk to the American people. I am very pleased that you used \nthat little 30 feet of carpet and hall as your place to talk.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Thank you, Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12291-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12291-S12293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ADDRESSING PRESIDENT CLINTON\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to talk about three or four \nthings. I am going to try my very, very best to be factual. I am \nconcerned that here, in these waning days, considering the situation \nthat exists on Pennsylvania Avenue, that the President finds himself in \na very supercharged political environment. I don't think I had to say \nthat. I think everybody knows that. But I want to suggest that \nyesterday afternoon, or whatever time of day it was that the President \nhad a quickly called press conference to talk about the Congress of the \nUnited States and what we have and haven't done, and particularly to \nsay that we aren't taking care of his education programs, and unless we \ndo, he is going to keep us here.\n  Normally, when I say ``Mr. President,'' I am addressing the Chair, \nbecause that is what we are supposed to do. If we care to address \nanyone here, we do it through ``Mr. President.''\n  Permit me to address the Mr. President on Pennsylvania Avenue, \nPresident Bill Clinton.\n  President Clinton, you have been known to have a fantastic memory. As \na matter of fact, I think you acknowledged that at one point recently, \nalthough, as with many of us who grow older, you did indicate that with \nthe passage of time and the pressure of many things to do, that that \ngreat memory fails every now and then.\n  Now, Mr. President--Bill Clinton--I am suggesting that maybe your \nmemory failed you when you gave that speech yesterday. So let me tell \nyou what I remember about your education programs that you claim we \nhave not funded.\n  I want everybody to know that on many things regarding budgets and \nprograms, you can look to the budget that the President sends up here \nto see what it asks for and what we are giving him. This is the budget \nfor the year we are now appropriating, which started technically on \nOctober 1. Here it is.\n  I had occasion, shortly after it was issued, to have the education \nparts of this reviewed. I remember coming to the floor of the U.S. \nSenate to say to the President, which OMB agreed to, ``Mr. President, \nthe official scorekeeper and official evaluator of budgets for the U.S. \nCongress says that\n\n[[Page S12292]]\n\nyour request for money for two education programs--interest reduction \nso that schools can afford buildings they need and so-called 100,000 \nteachers so we can lower the classroom ratio--those two programs were \nfound by the official budget analysts to not properly have been placed \nin this budget. What they said is, they break the budget that you just \nsigned, Mr. President.'' Point No. 1.\n  Point No. 2: If they are so important--and I am not denying that the \nPresident feels they are, and maybe many Senators feel they are--do you \nknow what the President did in asking us to pay for them? He didn't \nprovide the money to pay for them. He did not. It is not in this \nbudget. He said, ``When you pass the cigarette tax, I would like you to \nuse some of it for education.''\n  Let me just say, that sort of says to me, ``I couldn't find room in \nthe budget for these things that I am telling you are very important. \nSo if we get a cigarette tax, we'll pay for them.''\n  Do you know what happened? After weeks of debate, we didn't get a \ncigarette tax.\n  Mr. President, what I know is that the appropriators in the U.S. \nSenate, in the bill that takes care of education--so there will be no \nmisunderstanding, in this regular budget you asked for $31.4 billion \nfor education. Look at the appropriations bill, Mr. President. Ask OMB, \nyour official people who look at it. See how much the Senate gave you \nfor education funding for the year you are complaining about. \nInteresting, $31.4 billion--exactly what you asked for. Now, Mr. \nPresident, you tell the American people you are going to keep us here \nuntil we do this, as if we are the ones to blame for it not being \ndone--that is, those two programs.\n  I am living in a different world, or the President's memory has \nfailed him, because do you understand, I say to my fellow Senators, \nthat the President is asking for that money now for these two \nprograms--and for many Senators it is doubtful whether that is the way \nto help education, but, nonetheless, let's just follow it. He is now \nsaying he is going to keep us here until we do it. But guess what. He \nknows, his helpers know, that he has to find programs within the \nGovernment to cut, which are called offsets, in order to pay for those \ntwo programs. He knows that, because this budget says he didn't have \nroom for it in here. He was making room through a cigarette tax that \nnever happened.\n  As of right now, 2:25 p.m., I am not aware that the President has \nsubmitted a means to pay for those programs. I am not aware that the \nPresident has told us how to pay for them if we wanted to adopt them. \nAll I am asking is that we depoliticize a few of these issues, or at \nleast state the facts correctly. We do not deserve blame for not \nincluding two programs, which, I repeat, are not paid for in this \nbudget, when as of today, 11 days into the fiscal year, we don't know \nhow the President intends to pay for them. All right? That is the first \npoint I would like to make today.\n  Second point: There has been a lot of discussion this morning on the \nfloor of the Senate by some Senators about this issue of a Patients' \nBill of Rights. I think the country understands, but just so it won't \nbe left unaddressed here this morning, let me again refresh our \ncollective memories. With everything that we have to do, we took 3\\1/2\\ \nweeks to debate the Patients' Bill of Rights on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  The minority can say we didn't let it pass, but, Mr. President, the \nmajority can say, they didn't let it pass. They had a bill; we had a \nbill. We had more than 50 votes; they did not. They kept our bill from \npassing which had more than sufficient votes. So I ask, who is to blame \nfor a bill not passing? Again, I want to be practical, I can't say it \nis all their fault, the minority's fault, but clearly it is certainly \nnot all the Republicans' fault.\n  What was the really big issue between the two parties? And I leave \nthis one to the American people. The principal issue that divided us \nwas the lawyers of the United States. They support the minority \nheavily--not all of them, not all of them, but those who litigate. What \ndid they want in the bill that we didn't want in the bill? We didn't \nwant a new right to go to court to sue managed care entities, HMOs. We \nleft the right to sue the doctors and the professionals, but we didn't \nwant to create a new right to sue the HMOs in courts of law for \ndamages.\n  We, on this side, for the most part--not unanimously, but for the \nmost part--have adopted a sense about health care, and it says lawyers \nand lawsuits don't deliver health care; lawyers and lawsuits make \nhealth care cost more. We could not see why, if the minority and the \nPresident think it is such an enormous new status and set of rights \nthat we should adopt--and we tend to agree--why would the minority that \ndidn't have the votes to pass here but we had the votes to pass ours--\nwhy would they deny a bill's passage based upon, they want lawyers back \nin the loop and we don't want lawyers back in the loop? I leave it to \nthose listening and those who will look at the Record. See if I am \ncorrect that that was the biggest stumbling block, and see whether the \nPresident and the minority caused the Patients' Bill of Rights bill to \nfail or not.\n  Those are two points, and I want to make a third.\n  Mr. President, in the election past, two things worked for the \nPresident. He is probably the best public relations President we have \never had. Two things worked for him as certain--as certain--as when you \nwrite a name in ink on a piece of paper with indelible ink; it will be \nthere. And those two things that he has used over and over--you need \nnot think; they will pop into your mind--Social Security and education. \nRight?\n\n  What we have seen, I say to my friend from Alabama, we have seen the \nSocial Security card played. How? ``No tax cuts out of the surplus \nbecause it jeopardizes Social Security.'' That is the typical every 2-\nyear issue. It is raised again.\n  Let me suggest to Mr. President, Bill Clinton, you know, Mr. \nPresident, that we are about, in the next 72 hours, to pass a very big \nappropriations bill. Maybe Pennsylvania Avenue does not know this, but \nhere is the best estimate I have. We are about to spend--spend; not \ntax, spend--$18 billion of the surplus that was supposed to be saved \nfor Social Security. Got it? The same pot that the President says, \n``Don't touch it. It's for Social Security,'' we are about to spend $18 \nbillion of it for so-called ``emergencies.'' And I will get to that in \na moment.\n  Friends here in the Senate and those listening, you cannot have it \nboth ways. You cannot say to Republicans, ``You can't use the surplus \nto give back to the American people in taxes, even if it's a tiny \namount, but you can spend the surplus for bigger Government.'' You \nknow, it just does not wash. Both are diminishing, to some extent, the \nsurplus of $1.6 trillion that we expect in the next decade.\n  I do not think it will be that much. In fact, the year we are in \nright now is supposed to have an $80 billion surplus. I think it will \nbe $20 billion off because of economics. And then we will spend $18-, \n$20 billion of it that we did not plan to spend. Then we will have \nsomething for defense next year that we need, and there will probably \nbe none left for tax cuts. That is what it looks like.\n  So I want to just talk about one of the emergencies.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. One of the ``emergencies'' is a real emergency. That is \nto help agriculture in the United States. But let me suggest, to help \nagriculture in the United States, we sent the President a bill. We had \n$4 billion in the emergency funding for the farmers of the United \nStates.\n  When the President of the United States asked us for emergency \nmoney--which he knew people like Senator Domenici would start adding up \nto see how much more you are spending of the surplus than the \nRepublicans planned to use in tax cuts--the President asked for $2.3 \nbillion for agriculture. We gave him $4 billion.\n  But in the meantime, a distinguished Senator on the minority side, \nwhom I have great respect for, the minority leader, Senator Daschle, \nintroduced a bill saying, ``We want $7.2 billion as an emergency for \nagriculture. And we want to wipe out the new law which is only 18 \nmonths old called Freedom to Farm because we currently have an \nemergency''--$7.2 billion. The President asked for $2.3 billion. Now we \nget a communication from the President that says, ``I asked you for \n$2.3 billion,\n\n[[Page S12293]]\n\nbut essentially I want Daschle's bill, too.'' Now, believe it or not, \nwe sent him a bill with $4 billion. He vetoed it and said, ``Now you've \ngot to give me what Senator Daschle's bill has.''\n  Mr. President, we have had the best people in this body working on \nagriculture who put this emergency package together. And believe me, \nthe $4 billion package would make the American agriculture whole. There \nwould be no net loss of income to the agriculture community. They know \nit. The experts know it. But because it is an election year, and \nbecause of the turmoil that exists that I have alluded to earlier in my \nconversation with the Senate here, the President now holds agriculture \nprograms hostage. If we do not do it his way, we will close down the \nDepartment of Agriculture. Frankly, if we did, it would be the \nPresident's--it would be on his shoulders, not ours. But you know, it \nwill get worked out. I just thought everybody ought to know how these \nthings work.\n  Now, should it matter? We have worked for 20 years to get a balanced \nbudget and a balanced budget agreement. The result has been nothing but \ngood news for America. Almost everybody that even touched the issue \nlays claim to having done it all, including the President who claims \nthe entire economic well-being of the country is because he is \nPresident. He can do that. That is fine.\n  The truth of the matter is, there are plenty--plenty--who deserve \ncredit, including the Federal Reserve, including Republicans in the \nSenate, Democrats in the Senate, the same in the House. But it really \nstarted happening, in terms of restraining the budget, when both bodies \nbecame Republican. And we can go back and trace that. That is when we \nfixed welfare to save money, that is when we changed Medicaid to save \nbig dollars, and on and on.\n  Let's go home, let's wrap this up in the next few days, but let's \nremember the facts. And let's not let this superheavy, politically \ncharged environment color things such that we are going to take that \nsurplus we take so much pride in, and find out in 3 or 4 months that \nthere is only 25, 30, 40 percent of it left, even though we were told, \n``You're going to really use it up if you cut taxes.'' What happened? \nWe did not cut taxes, and it got used up. Interesting.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nArkansas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12291-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12293-S12295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FAREWELL SPEECH\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak, for what \nmay be the last time, on the floor of the Senate. It is a very \nbittersweet time for me, after 24 years, most of which have been spent \nat this very desk. I might say at this moment that I have been blessed \nby having Senator Kennedy as my seatmate these many years, and before \nhim Senator Gore--both truly outstanding men.\n  In order to deliver a speech such as I am about to deliver, Mr. \nPresident, I do not think there is anything wrong with listing some of \nthe defining moments in my life, because this speech is really more for \nthe benefit of my children and grandchildren than it is for my \ncolleagues or the people of America.\n  First of all, I was blessed by my parents. I remind my brother from \ntime to time that everybody was not so lucky in choosing their parents \nas he and I were. And that really is the reason that I stand here as \none of 1,843 men and women ever to serve in the U.S. Senate. We were \ntaught when we were children that when we died we were ``going to \nFranklin Roosevelt''. And the reason we were taught that is because we \nwere very poor. Most people do not realize that the South, from 1865 \nuntil about the time Franklin Roosevelt became President, was still \nliving almost as a conquered nation. National politicians paid very \nlittle attention to the South.\n  In our household, we were poor during the Great Depression. And I \nmight say, the Great Depression is certainly one of the most important \ndefining moments of my life. But it was during the Great Depression \nthat Franklin Roosevelt began to provide all kinds of things for people \nin the South that they had previously thought unthinkable.\n  We didn't have indoor plumbing. We didn't have running water. We \ndidn't have paved streets. We didn't have much of anything. The people \nin our community died of typhoid fever in the summertime because the \nouthouse was just a few steps away from the well from which we drew our \ndrinking water. Then Franklin Roosevelt began to provide immunizations \nfor children against smallpox and typhoid. It was free. We got those \nshots at school.\n  We had then what we called hobos or tramps; today we call them \nhomeless people. My mother always saved a few scraps after breakfast \nknowing that some tramp was going to knock on the back door and ask for \nfood. That was back before welfare came into existence. So we were very \npoor.\n  I remember when I was 12 years old my father heard that Franklin \nRoosevelt was coming to Arkansas. He was a great believer in America \nand the political system and public service. He wanted my brother and \nme to see Franklin Roosevelt. So we drove over a gravel road 20 miles \nto Booneville, AR, and when the train on the Rock Island line pulled \nin, Franklin Roosevelt came out on the back platform, obviously being \nheld up by a couple of Secret Service men. I tugged on my father's arm \nand I said, ``Dad, what's wrong with him?'' He said, ``I will tell you \nlater.'' On the way home, he told us that Franklin Roosevelt had \ncontracted polio when he was 37 years old, he couldn't walk, and he \ncarried 12 pounds of steel braces on his legs.\n  Then he told my brother and me that if Franklin Roosevelt could \nbecome President and couldn't even walk, there was no reason why my \nbrother and I, with strong minds and bodies, couldn't become President, \ntoo. I never took my eye off that goal until many, many years later.\n  In the following year, my father was president of the Arkansas Retail \nHardware Association. They gave our family $300 to go to Los Angeles to \nthe national convention. I can remember the big party at the Biltmore \nHotel in Los Angeles in 1937. I had never stepped on a carpet before in \nmy life, and the Biltmore was filled with thick carpet. We just loved \nit. We didn't stay at the Biltmore. We were staying at the $2-a-night \ncabin.\n  But the night of the big party, everybody was in tuxedos and long \ndresses, except my parents. And all the children were dressed in \ntuxedos, too, even in that Depression year of 1937. But I can remember \nmy brother and I had on long pants and white shirts, no tie, no coat. \nWe were terribly embarrassed. My father sensed that, and so the next \nday he told us that he knew we were embarrassed but he reminded us that \nthe most important thing was that we were clean, our clothes were \nclean, our bodies were clean, and the kind of clothes you wore really \nwere not all that important. He made it OK.\n  When I was 15 years old, I had a high school English and literature \nteacher named Miss Doll. Every member of the U.S. Senate has been \ninfluenced by a college professor or high school teacher, maybe a \npreacher or somebody else. She was my influence.\n  I remember my mother, who had a tendency--not to denigrate my \nmother--to not build our self-esteem. My father was working against \nthat, trying to teach us self-esteem, not ego, but esteem.\n  We were reading Beowulf in English, a great piece of literature. We \nwould read a paragraph and discuss it. One time it came my time to \nread. I started reading, and all of a sudden--I read about 2 pages and \nMiss Doll still hadn't stopped me--I looked up and she was standing \nthere. She looked at me and she looked at the class and she said, \n``Doesn't he read beautifully?'' ``Doesn't he have a nice voice?'' And \nshe said, ``And wouldn't it be tragic if he didn't use that talent.'' \nAt first I thought she was making fun of me, but she did more for my \nself-esteem in 10 seconds than anybody, except my father, ever did. \nSome of my political detractors think she overdid it.\n  And then just out of high school, but only after 6 months at the \nUniversity of Arkansas, I went into the Marine Corps. World War II was \nraging. It was a terrifying time. I fully expected to be killed in that \nwar. The Marines were taking terrible casualties in the South Pacific. \nHappily, I survived that. The best part of it was when I got home there \nwas a caring, generous, compassionate Federal Government, waiting with \nthe GI bill.\n\n[[Page S12294]]\n\n  While my father would have stolen to make sure we had a good \neducation, my brother went to Harvard Law School and I went to the \nUniversity of Arkansas and later Northwestern University Law School--\nboth expensive schools my father could never afford. I studied \npolitical science and law. The reason I did that is because my father \nwanted me to go into public service. He wanted me and my brother to be \npoliticians. He may be the last man who ever lived who encouraged his \nsons to go into politics.\n  In my first year in law school, he and my mother were killed in a car \nwreck. They were tragically killed by a drunken driver. Neither of them \nhad ever had a drink in their life. That is what made it so bizarre. \nThe big disappointment of my life was that my father didn't live to see \nme Governor or Senator.\n  The next defining moment of my life is when our children were born--\nfirst Brent, then Bill and then Brooke.\n  The next defining moment was when I was practicing law in a little \ntown of 1,200 people and decided to run for Governor. The day I filed, \na poll was taken statewide. It was the last day of the filing deadline. \nI found that of the eight Democrats in the primary, I had 1-percent \nname recognition. It was probably the most foolhardy thing I had ever \ndone in my life. But I was trying to keep faith with my father, and I \nbelieve strongly in our country and I believe in public service.\n  The next defining moment in my life was shortly after I was elected \nGovernor I got an invitation to go to Kansas City to speak at a Truman \nDay dinner. I told them I couldn't go, the legislature was in session. \nI just assumed those legislators would screw the dome off the capital \nif I left town. They came back and said, ``If you will agree to do \nthis, we will let you spend an hour with President and Mrs. \nTruman,'' and that was more than I could resist. So I went and spent \nthat hour with President Truman and he asked me how I liked being \nGovernor. I said, ``I don't like it, it's a real pressure cooker. I am \njust a country lawyer. This is all new to me and the press is driving \nme crazy.''\n\n  I was telling him what a terrible job being Governor of Arkansas was, \nand it suddenly dawned on me I was talking to a man who had to make the \ndecision to drop the atomic bomb that ended World War II. And so I shut \nup. And then he told me, as I left, ``Son, while you are looking at the \nceiling every night in the Governor's mansion, wondering what you are \ngoing to do, remember one thing: The people elected you to do what you \nthink is right and that is all they expect out of you. They have busy \nlives. So, remember, always tell people the truth; they can handle \nit.''\n  That didn't sound like very profound advice to me at the time. But \nindeed it was. I have thought about it every day of my life since then.\n  Secondly, he said, ``When you are debating in your own mind the \nissues that you have to confront, you think about this: Get the best \nadvice you can get on both sides of the issue, make up your mind which \none is right, and then you do it. That is all the people of the State \nexpect of you--to do what you think is right.''\n  So when I drove off the mansion grounds 4 years later, coming to the \nSenate, as I told my Democratic colleagues the other night, most of \nwhom know this, I came here with the full intention of running for \nPresident. I had a very successful 4 years as Governor. I thought the \nworld was my oyster and I fully intended, as I say, to run. The reason \nI didn't run is because after I had been here for a year, I realized \nthat this whole apparatus was much more complex than I thought it was.\n  I told my children, if I had three lives to live, at the end of the \nlast one, I would look back prior to 10 years at the end of it and \nrealize how dumb I was. I was so smart when I graduated from high \nschool, I could hardly bear it. When I got out of law school, the \nproblem was compounded. When I drove off the mansion grounds, I was \nquite sure I was ready to be king of the world.\n  The other night I told Senator Sarbanes I really regret that I have \nnot been as effective a legislator as I should have been. He said, \n``Everybody feels that way.'' What I was really saying, I suppose, is I \nwish I had known then what I know now. In my dying breath I will look \nback and think about, really, how I was not as smart this Saturday \nafternoon as I thought I was. That is what a living, learning \nexperience is.\n  So I chose not to run for President. By the time I felt that I was \nqualified to be President, I decided that it demanded a price that I \nwas not willing to pay. Not to be purely apocalyptic about our future, \nbecause I am not, I must say, in all candor, partisanship has reached a \npoint in this country, and the demands for political money have become \nso great--two very insidious things--that good men and women are opting \nout of public service, and not to enter public service. Money is \ncorrupting the political process and it threatens our very democracy.\n  Since I announced that I would not run last year, I confess to you, \nMr. President and colleagues, that I have voted in ways that I would \nnot have if I were running. I think of the few times when I would have \nhad to worry about what kind of a 30-second spot that vote would \ngenerate.\n  I have cast my share of courageous votes since I have been here, as \nHarry Truman admonished me to do. I have always tried to use simple \ntests as to how I voted; How would my children and grandchildren judge \nme? Did it make me stronger or the Nation stronger? Did it do any \nirreversible damage to the environment? Is it fair to the less \nfortunate among us? Does it comport with the thrust of our \nConstitution, the greatest document ever conceived by the mind of man? \nOr does it simply make me stronger politically because it satisfies the \npolitical whims of the moment? Or does it simply keep the political \nmoney supply flowing?\n  Speaking of courageous votes, I voted for the Panama Canal Treaties \nin 1978 and, in all fairness, in 1980, had I had a strong opponent, I \nwould not be standing here right now. I lucked out. But I can tell you, \npeople were absolutely livid about my vote on the Panama Canal \nTreaties--a fabricated political issue. I ask the American people and \nmy colleagues, who today has been inconvenienced by the Panama Canal \nTreaties? Is this country any weaker? The truth is that it is stronger. \nOur relationship with Panama is much stronger. It was the Quemoy and \nMatsu issue of 1978.\n  Incidentally, Henry Bellmon of Oklahoma voted against the Panama \nCanal Treaties and made a minute-and-a-half speech in doing it, while \nthe rest of us were pontificating for hours trying to justify our \npositions. He announced he would not run again because, coming from the \nconservative State of Oklahoma, he knew he didn't have a prayer of \nbeing reelected, so hot was that issue.\n  When I voted against Ronald Reagan's prayer in school amendment--the \nonly southern Senator to do so, my opponent tried to take advantage of \nit. But the American people and the people of my State--once you \nexplained what was involved to them, where the school prayers would be \nwritten or adopted by the school board and required saying in the \nschools--came to understand the perils of the amendment. I always tell \nyoungsters, and college groups particularly, when you think about that, \nyou tell me which country that has an official state religion you want \nto live in.\n  Mr. President, one of the greatest moments of my life was when I was \nGovernor and a man came into my office wanting me to talk to the \nhighway department about a late penalty they were going to assess him \nfor being 60 days late in completing a highway job. To shorten the \nstory, I said, ``If I do this for you, how do I explain to the next guy \nwho walks in the door why I can't do it for him? I don't want to start \ndown that road.'' After a long conversation, when he started to walk \nout after I told him I could not, under any circumstances, comply with \nthe request, he said, ``Governor, that's the reason I voted for you.''\n  This institution is a great place. It is supposed to be the \ndeliberative body. The Founding Fathers intended the lower House, the \nHouse of Representatives, to be the House of the people. They expected \nthis place to be the deliberative body. It is a curious thing--and the \nminority leader here knows this--every amendment, every bill that comes \nup, we immediately start trying to figure out, how stringently can we \nlimit the debate on this issue? There are times when that is fully \njustified,\n\n[[Page S12295]]\n\nand there are times when only if you fully air something do the Senate \nMembers really come here well enough informed to vote on it.\n  We are still the oldest democracy on Earth. We are still living under \nthe oldest Constitution on Earth, and without men and women of goodwill \nbeing willing to offer themselves for service, there is absolutely no \nassurance that that will always be. Thomas Jefferson said, ``The price \nof liberty is eternal vigilance.'' He was not just talking about \nmilitary vigilance. We are still woefully inadequate in this country in \nthe field of education. If I were the President of the United States \nand I were looking at a $70 billion surplus, I would make sure the \nfirst thing we did was to pass a bill that said no child in this Nation \nshall be deprived of a college education for lack of money. Look at all \nthe statistics where we rank among the developed nations in education. \nAnd look at the state of health care. It is good for those who can \nafford it. And 45 million who have no health insurance and no health \ncare do the best they can.\n\n  Mr. President, I have been richly blessed in my life, as I said, \nmostly by devoted parents, and good Methodist Sunday school teaching. \nMy mother wanted me to be a Methodist preacher and my father wanted me \nto be a politician. Think about growing up with that pressure. I am \npersonally blessed with a great family. If I died tomorrow, the people \nof Arkansas would take note of it, and there would be headlines in all \nof the papers in the State. But if Betty died tomorrow the people of \nour State would grieve. She has founded two organizations.\n  When Ronald Reagan announced to this country that we might just fire \none across the Soviet Union's bow to get their attention, he terrified \nher. She and a group of congressional wives met around my kitchen table \nfor about 6 months. Finally, I came home one night, and she said, ``We \nare forming an organization. And we feel so strongly about it that we \nare going to put `peace' in the name. We are going to call it Peace \nLinks''. Ultimately, she had almost 250 congressional wives conscripted \ninto that organization.\n  I told her ``you are going to get your husband beat.'' We are from a \nconservative State. People in Arkansas believe in a strong defense. \nPeople across this Nation believe in a strong defense. She said, ``You \nmen are going to get my children killed.''\n  She had already spent all of her public life, from the time I was \nGovernor until this day trying to immunize all of the children in this \ncountry. And I am not going to go through all of the successes that she \nhas had, which have been staggering.\n  The Western Hemisphere is free of polio. Africa will be free of polio \nby the year 2002. Asia will be free of polio by the year 2004. And \nmeasles is next.\n  I tell you, she deserves a lot of credit for the virtual elimination \nof childhood diseases in this country. She went to see President Carter \nwhen he first came to power. She said, ``I tell you something you can \ndo that will have a lasting effect on the health of this Nation, and it \nwill help you a lot when you run again.'' He put Joe Califano at her \ndisposal. And today she and Rosalynn Carter have an organization called \n``Every Child By Two.'' She is still going at it--peace and children.\n  I have three beautiful children, and six beautiful, healthy \ngrandchildren. I have been blessed with exceptional staff members, most \nof whom are more than staff members. They are very good friends. I have \nbeen blessed with the support of the people of my State in winning \nalmost every election by 60 percent or more of the vote. I was much \nmore liberal than my constituents. I like to believe that they \nrespected me because they knew what I stood for is what I believed \ninstead of what was politically expedient at any given time. But, for \nwhatever reason, I will always be grateful to them.\n  Our State does not deserve to have been torn apart for the past 6 \nyears. I know so many innocent people who have been destroyed, \nfinancially and mentally, by a criminal justice system gone awry. You \nwould have to go back to the Salem witchcraft trials to find anything \ncomparable.\n  I do not, nor does any Senator, condone the President's conduct. Call \nit whatever you want--reprehensible, indefensible, unconscionable. Call \nit anything you want. But most of us take pride in President Clinton's \nPresidency. And the American people are still saying they like him. But \ncompletely aside from that, as I say, I weep sometimes for the unfair \ntreatment to my State, and so many innocent people in it.\n  I have been blessed by unbelievable friendships of colleagues. Those \nfriendships will probably wane. It is almost impossible to maintain a \nrelationship with a colleague once you leave here. That is really \ntragic. But I am realistic. And I know that is what it will be. I know \nwe will have a difficult time having the same kind of relationship, if \nany at all. But I want them to know that I value their friendship. I \nvalue my service with them. I have served with some truly great men and \nwomen. And, as Senator Byrd likes to say, only 1,843 men and women have \never been so privileged to serve in this body.\n  I am already nostalgic about this Chamber--24 years in this Chamber, \nthe Cloakroom, the hearing rooms, the Capitol itself. For 24 years, the \nfirst 20 of which I went home almost every weekend and came back on \nSunday night, I never failed, as we flew by the Washington Monument, to \nget goose bumps. And I hope I never do. So, colleagues, I thank you for \nbeing my friend. To the people of my State, I thank you for allowing me \nto serve here.\n  I want to teach, in order to teach children that politics is a noble \nprofession. My father said it long before Bobby Kennedy did. It is a \nnoble calling. And the minute it becomes what so many people think it \nis, who do you think suffers? All of us do. So I want to inspire this \noncoming generation, as my father did me, to get involved in the \npolitical process and public service. You have a duty and a \nresponsibility.\n  So, to the U.S. Senate, to all of my colleagues, God bless and \nGodspeed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12293-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12295-S12297]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SENATOR DALE BUMPERS\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this is one of those moments that one \nfeels a bit overwhelmed--to follow Dale Bumpers in a discourse that he \ngives here on the floor. This is a task that I never liked--to get on \nthe floor after Dale Bumpers moved us with his oratory and described \nhis feelings for this institution and our responsibility. But there is \nanother reason that I am really feeling uneasy; that is, the prospect \nthat this place will be without Dale's voice, without his wit, his \nhumor, but more importantly, his commitment to the people of this \ncountry.\n  I want you to know, Dale, what a sacrifice I make today. I decided to \nstay here rather than to go to a budget conference down the hall trying \nto wrestle with the issues of the day. So I sacrificed that time just \nso I could stand on this floor to hear your terminal speech. That is \ndevotion and friendship, I assume.\n  I have to say that one could see the position that Dale has earned \nover the years, because people were as generous and as warm and as \nfriendly from the other side of the aisle. That doesn't mean that we \nalways agree, and it doesn't mean that we always share a similar \ndirection for our country.\n  But Dale has succeeded in winning friends, in making sure that we \nnever forgot about who it is we are here to serve. We could make lots \nof jokes, but one never wants to compete with Dale's humor. I think \nabout the only close match was with Dale Bumpers and Alan Simpson. That \nwas a good team. The jokes were always better when we were off the \nfloor somehow. But beyond the wit, beyond the humor, beyond the jokes \nwas always this incredible pursuit of what is right for our country and \nwhat is right for our people.\n  I have submitted a written statement without the kind of eloquence I \nwish I could have borrowed from Dale. He was right, he was accurate \nwhen he said his impression of his IQ was overblown. All of us agree \nwith that.\n  We know Dale well. We love him. We love to tease him a little bit. \nThere were very few times on this floor when Dale could not get \nattention from others, and it wasn't just the volume; it\n\n[[Page S12296]]\n\nwas the substance of his mission that we all paid attention to. They \nkid him about stretching the cord that holds our microphones, but \neverybody was anxious to hear what Dale had to say or read what was in \nthe Record.\n  So I just wanted to have a chance to say how pleased I am for the \nopportunity to be here at the last speech Senator Dale Bumpers was \ngoing to make in this Chamber. It has been an honor to serve with Dale \nas well as to serve with people such as John Glenn. John Glenn is one \nof the finest people who, it is fair to say, has ever left this Earth. \nBut we are going to see John Glenn at the end of the month and witness \nhis heroic and incredible mission into the sky. John Glenn was with me \nwhen I was sworn into the Senate. We happened to be in Colorado on a \nvacation just 16 years ago, and he stood while I found a magistrate to \nswear me in because there was an opportunity based on the resignation \nof the then-appointed Senator.\n  At the same time we are saying goodbye to Wendell Ford. Wendell is \nsomeone who you could fight with, get your blood pressure up, more \noften than not you would lose the argument and lose the debate. But \nWendell Ford got things done. And I want to tell you, if I had to be \nserved by a Senator, I would want that Senator to have the same concern \nabout my State and my well-being and my family and my future as did \nWendell Ford. He never let an opportunity go by without defending his \npeople and the State of Kentucky. Although we disagreed on lots of \noccasions, I always walked away with a high degree of affection and \nrespect for Wendell Ford.\n  So when I listen to Dale Bumpers summarize his life, I think about \nwhere we are, because too often the arguments here overtake the purpose \nof our functioning. But Dale Bumpers, Senator Dale Bumpers reminds us \nthat the mission is almost a holy one and that we have to step back and \ntake a deep breath and get down to the business of the American people.\n  I wish to thank the Democratic leader for giving me these few \nminutes. I also wanted to take an opportunity to say so long to Senator \nDan Coats. Dan Coats was a formidable opponent for me when New Jersey \npersisted in sending its trash out to Indiana where it was welcomed by \nthe communities that had the certified landfills and all that. But Dan \nCoats didn't object when New Jersey sent its All-American football \nplayers to Notre Dame or to the University of Indiana. But serving with \nDan also has been a privilege.\n  Mr. President, I wrap up just by saying that Dale Bumpers, if you \nlistened to his words, arrived here encouraged by a father who saw the \nvalue of Government service, and it is an interesting and touching \nexplanation of what it is that provided his motivation. My father also \nmotivated me to engage in whatever enterprise I could to serve the \npublic. But he didn't know it then. He worked. He tried to survive with \nhis family during the lean and tough years, ashamed that he had to \nresort to a job with the WPA. I will never forget how discouraged he \nwas when he came home, but, he said, he needed the job; he had to feed \nhis family. My father died at the age of 43, after a year of illness \nwith cancer. I had already enlisted in the Army. He disintegrated in \nfront of our eyes, leaving not only an empty house but an empty wallet. \nMy mother had to work. I had to send home my allotment to help pay the \nbills that were accumulated during that period of time.\n  But we both got here because we were encouraged by things that \noccurred in our families, messages that were sent by our parents, mine \nperhaps less articulate than the one I heard Dale Bumpers describe. But \nwe are here because they were able to give us that opportunity and we \nare here because we want to serve, to do something, to give something \nback as a result of having that opportunity.\n  To Senator Dale Bumpers and the others, we say farewell. This place \nwill be a lesser place without your presence, but because of your \npresence this place will continue to gain strength and to do what we \nhave to do for the future. Rest assured that America will be strong. It \nwill be different forces and different faces, but the work will \ncontinue to be done here.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator will suspend for just a minute, \nI am going to stretch the prerogatives of the Chair to say I came over \nto talk about Senator Bumpers, whom I have gotten to know recently. We \nworked on park bills. I know no one more committed nor more easy to \nwork with and who keeps his word any better.\n  I am sorry to say that, but I needed to.\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I don't think anyone could say it any \nbetter than that, and I appreciate the Presiding Officer's comments. \nThey are certainly well spoken and very appropriate. I join my \ncolleague from New Jersey in expressing feelings that are very hard to \nexpress in public. Senator Bumpers and I have some things in common. I \nam not as eloquent as he is, but I feel at times such as this probably \nas emotional.\n  I love his sense of humor. I have used more Bumpers material in my \npublic career than anybody else in this Chamber. I don't think this is \nhis story, but I might as well start with it. There was a time when \nSenator Bumpers was at a dinner. We all go to these banquets over and \nover and over. We all drag our wives along. And they are so good to \ncome with us so often. Betty was at this particular dinner with Senator \nBumpers, sitting, as she always does, at his side supportive and \nsmiling.\n  The emcee introduced Senator Bumpers as one who is a model \nlegislator, a model politician, a model spokesperson for Arkansas, just \na model person all the way around. On the way home, Dale commented to \nBetty about what a wonderful introduction that was. They got home; \nBetty brought the dictionary to Dale, sitting now in his own study, and \nread to him the word ``model,'' as it is defined in Webster's. There it \nis defined as ``a small replica of the real thing.''\n  Senator Bumpers is a model in the truest sense of the word. In many \nrespects I call him my model, for how he speaks, for what he stands \nfor, for how he interacts with his colleagues, for how he represents \nhis State, for all of the courageous positions he has taken. I don't \nknow how you do better than that. I don't know who it was who once \nsaid, ``If we are to see farther into the future, we must stand on the \nshoulders of giants.'' Dale Bumpers is a giant. And it is upon his \nshoulders that we have stood many, many, many times to see into the \nfuture, as I have seen. He persuades us, he cajoles us, he humors us, \nhe always enlightens us.\n  As I heard Senator Domenici, the senior Senator from New Mexico, say \nearlier: ``He does it in a way that is not in fashion perhaps, not in \nkeeping with what the normal rules of the body are.'' The normal rules \nare, you are supposed to stay at your desk. Not Senator Bumpers. \nSenator Bumpers has the longest cord in Senate history. I joked the \nother night, when we finally see Senator Bumpers depart, we are going \nto cut up his cord and give 10 feet to every Senator and save 10 more \nfor the next. He goes up and down that aisle.\n  Since, as we are prone to do in this body, we name things after our \ncolleagues--I happen to be fortunate enough to reside in the Byrd \nsuite--I am going to start referring to that as the Bumpers corridor. \nAnd I am pointing, for the record, to my left. For anybody who has \nserved with Dale, I don't have to point at all. We all know what the \nBumpers corridor is.\n  So it is a bittersweet moment. We recognize the time comes for all of \nus to depart, to say goodbye. As others have noted, and I am sure more \nwill note before the end of the session, we say goodbye not only to our \ndear, wonderful friend Dale, but to his wife Betty as well. There is no \nquestion, as we all know, he over-married. There is no question who the \nreal force in the family is. There is no question who the visionary and \nthe giant is. As Senator Bumpers so capably noted, there is no question \nwho is beloved in the State of Arkansas. We will miss Betty Bumpers and \nher vision and her humor and all of her contributions.\n  I asked my staff to put some thoughts together and I really want to \nshare some of them because I think, for the record and for our \ncolleagues and for those who may be watching, it is important to \nremember who it was we just have heard from.\n  We heard from a Marine. We heard from a man who volunteered to serve\n\n[[Page S12297]]\n\nduring World War II. We heard from a person who grew up in a small \ntown, Charleston, AR--I don't have a clue where it is--where he worked \nas a smalltown lawyer and taught Sunday school. He may not have been a \nMethodist preacher, but he was a Sunday school teacher. He told us \nabout his decision, in 1970, to run for Governor. What he did not say \nis that he was one of eight candidates vying for the Democratic \nnomination. He did indicate that polls taken at the start of the race \ngave him a 1-percent approval rating. That is half of what it is right \nnow. He sold a herd of Angus cattle for $95,000 to finance his TV ad \ncampaign. You couldn't get that much for Angus cattle today.\n  He finished the primary in second place, behind someone whose name we \nall know, Orville Faubus, whose race-baiting brand of politics still \ndominated much of Arkansas Democratic politics. He beat Orville Faubus \nin a runoff and went on to beat the incumbent Republican, Governor \nWinthrop Rockefeller, in a general election by a margin of 2 to 1.\n  After being elected Governor, Dale Bumpers was asked by Tom Wicker, \nthen a reporter for the New York Times, to explain how a man would come \nfrom obscurity to beat two living legends. He answered simply, ``I \ntried to appeal to the best in people in my campaign.'' And that is \nwhat he has done his entire public career; he has appealed to the best \nof people.\n  As Governor, he worked aggressively and successfully to modernize the \nState government. He put a tremendous emphasis on improving education \nand expanding health services. Then, in 1973, with 1 year remaining in \nhis term, he made the decision to challenge another living legend, \nWilliam J. Fulbright, for the Democratic nomination for the U.S. \nSenate. Senator Fulbright was, at that time, a 30-year incumbent \nSenator. It probably did not come as any surprise to people in \nArkansas, but it must have to the Nation, because when all the votes \nwere counted, Dale won that race too, 2 to 1.\n  In the Senate, there is not a colleague in this Chamber who has not \nbeen affected by his eloquence and his reasoning on everything from \narms control to the environment. He has been a champion for rural \nAmerica. He has been a consistent advocate for fiscal discipline. In \nthe 1980s he voted against the tax cuts, arguing that they would \nexplode the Federal deficit. In the 1990s he took the tough votes \nneeded to eliminate those deficits.\n  He has been a tireless defender of the U.S. Constitution and the \nseparation of powers it guarantees. He did not mention this, but he \nshould have. In 1982 he was the only Senator from the Deep South to \nvote against a proposal stripping the Federal courts of their right to \norder school busing. He said at the time, while he opposed the use of \nbusing to achieve racial balance, he opposed even more ``this sinister \nand devious attack on the Constitution . . . [this] erosion of the only \ndocument that stands between the people and tyranny.''\n  This past July, shortly before launching the last of his annual \nattempts to kill the international space station, Senator Bumpers told \na reporter that he expected to lose again but he would try anyway \nbecause he thought it was the right thing to do. Then he added, ``I \nprobably lost as many battles as anybody who ever served in the U.S. \nSenate.''\n  I want to tell my friend as he prepares to end his Senate career, if \nyou did in fact lose more battles than someone else who may have served \nhere, it is only because you chose tougher and more important battles. \nEven more than the outcome of your battles, you have earned your place \nin history for the dignity and the courage and the eloquence with which \nyou have waged those battles.\n  I remember, having just arrived--I was elected in 1986, sworn in in \n1987--by the end of the year, in 1987, I had already decided who my man \nfor President was. I remember the conversation as if it took place \nyesterday. I was reminded again, as our colleague spoke on the Senate \nfloor, about his ambition. That was the ambition for many of us as \nwell. He would have been the same kind of outstanding President that he \nhas been the outstanding Governor and Senator we know today. That was \nnot to be. But in the eyes of all of us, Dale Bumpers will always stand \nas the giant we knew, as the respected legislator we trust, and as the \nfriend we love.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I compliment my colleagues on their fine \nremarks about our colleague, Senator Bumpers. I already made a speech \ncomplimenting him for his service to the Senate. I noticed my speech \nhad several things in common with the speech of Senator Daschle. I \nalluded to the fact of Senator Bumpers' sense of humor, which all of us \nhave enjoyed, Democrats and Republicans, and I also referred to the \nfact that he had the longest microphone cord in the Senate. He has used \nit extensively, and we have all enjoyed that as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12295-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12297-S12299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to make several comments \nconcerning some of the negotiations that are going forward. I remind my \ncolleagues in the Congress that the Constitution gives the Congress, \nnot the President, the authority and the responsibility to appropriate \nmoney, to pass bills. As a matter of fact, article I of the \nConstitution says:\n\n       All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a \n     Congress of the United States. . . .\n\n  Not in the executive branch, in the Congress, in the people's body.\n  It also says under article I, section 9:\n\n       No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in \n     Consequence of Appropriations made by law.\n\n  Again, made by Congress. I think some people in the administration \nthink that they are Congress now, that they can write appropriations \nbills. That is not constitutional. The President has his constitutional \nauthority, and if he wants to veto appropriations bills, he has a right \nto do so. Let him exercise that right. He doesn't have a right to write \nappropriations bills.\n  For some reason, some people have gotten this idea that the \nadministration is an equal partner. They are an equal branch of \nGovernment, but we have different functions in Government. The \nexecutive branch can submit a budget, they can confer, they can \nconsult, but Congress passes the appropriations bills, and we need to \ndo so.\n  Now we have the President making ever-extending demands: ``Well, I'm \nnot going to sign that bill if you don't spend so much money.'' Fine. \nVery good. He vetoed the Agriculture Department appropriations bill \nbecause he said we didn't spend enough money and didn't spend enough \nmoney under the guise of emergency agriculture assistance.\n  He requested $2.3 billion for emergency assistance. We appropriated \n$4.2 billion, and he vetoed it and said, ``We want to spend $7 \nbillion.'' In a period of a couple of weeks, he more than doubled his \ndemands. He has a right to veto the bill; fine. He doesn't have a right \nto write the bill.\n  Many people in his administration, maybe the President himself, seem \nto think, ``We are going to write the bill; we're just not going to \nsign it; if they don't give us more money, we are going to shut down \nthe Government.'' Fine, he can shut down the Government.\n  I stated to the press, and I will state it again, this Congress will \npass as many continuing resolutions as necessary, and it may last all \nyear. We may be operating under continuing resolutions all year long. I \npersonally don't have any desire, any intention of funding all of the \nPresidential requests that are coming down the pike, for which, all of \na sudden, he is making demands. I hope that our colleagues will support \nme in that effort.\n  I am not in that big a hurry to get out of town. I heard the \nPresident allude to that in a very partisan statement that he made \nyesterday with Members of Congress: ``We need to keep Congress in.'' \nMr. President, we will stay in. We will pass resolutions continuing \nGovernment operations at 1998 levels, this year's levels. We will pass \nthat as long as necessary.\n\n[[Page S12298]]\n\n  We passed one for a week. We passed one for 3 days. We may have to \npass another one. We may have to pass it for the balance of this year, \nmaybe into next year, whatever is necessary. But I do not intend on \nbeing held hostage. The President said, ``Well, give me more money; I \nwant to spend the surplus, whether it be for education, whether it be \nfor Head Start.'' He has a whole laundry list. He calls them \ninvestments, but, frankly, they are a lot of new social spending. I \ndon't have any desire to spend that money.\n  I am quite happy and willing to stay here all year, all year next \nyear, if necessary, but I don't want us to succumb to his demands. I \nhave no intention of succumbing to his demands. I am, frankly, bothered \nby the fact that at this stage in time, the President is really \nratcheting up the partisan rhetoric. Frankly, that is not the right \nthing to do if he wants to work together.\n  It is interesting, the President made a very nice bipartisan speech \nsaying, ``Yes, I compliment the Congress, they worked together and we \npassed the International Religious Freedom Act.'' I was involved with \nthat. We worked with the administration. We did do bipartisan work. It \ntook bipartisan work. But you don't get that kind of cooperation on the \nbudget when you have the President making all kinds of partisan \nstatements. I will give you an example.\n  In his radio address given to the Nation today, the President said:\n\n       This week, unfortunately, we saw partisanship defeat \n     progress, as 51 Republican Senators joined together to kill \n     the HMO Patients' Bill of Rights.\n\n  One, I just disagree with that. The majority of Republican Senators--\nas a matter of fact, unanimous Republican Senators--said, ``We are \nwilling to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights,'' not defeat one. ``We are \nwilling to pass one.''\n  We made that offer to our colleagues on the Democratic side. We made \nit several times in June and several times in July. We said we were \nwilling to pass this bill. As a matter of fact, we wanted to pass it \nbefore the August break. We made unanimous consent requests and said, \n``We will pass either your bill or our bill. You have the best bill \nthat you can put together. You worked on yours for months; we worked on \nour bill for months. Let's vote, let's pass it, let's go to conference \nwith the House.''\n  But, no, the Democrats wouldn't agree with it. The Democrats kept us \nfrom passing a Patients' Bill of Rights. You don't pass a bill this \ncomplicated the last day of the session. Senator Daschle offered some \namendment and said, ``Oh, let's run this through.'' That was nothing \nbut for show.\n  Yet we even find an e-mail from the House Democrat events coordinator \nthat said, ``Hey, let's put on a real show; let's have everybody get \ntogether; Senator Daschle can orchestrate this; we will have a bunch of \ncolleagues.''\n  Sure enough, they had a bunch of colleagues go over in some show of \nsupport on the last day of the session. Bingo.\n  If they wanted to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights, they should have \nsaid ``Yea, we agree, we will pass them, find out where the votes \nare.'' The Democrats would never agree to a unanimous consent request \nto pass Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  They are the ones who killed the bill. When the President said, ``. . \n. we saw partisanship defeat progress . . .'' he forgot to say the \nDemocrats wouldn't agree to a process to pass the bill, which we \noffered in June and several times in July. He forgot to mention that. \nIt kind of bothers me because, again, he says, ``We want \nbipartisanship,'' and he makes a partisan statement on a national radio \naddress.\n  I have also heard the President state, ``We can't have a tax cut \nbecause we're going to reserve every dime of the surplus to protect \nSocial Security.'' All the while--he knows it and we know it--he has \nhis staff members running around the Congress saying, ``We want more \nmoney and we want to declare everything an emergency so it won't count \non the budget, so it won't be part of the budget agreement'' that he \nadopted and agreed to in 1997. ``We want more money.''\n  The totals are right in the $18 billion, $20 billion-plus range. ``We \nwant more money for a lot of things and, oh, yes, it is all off budget; \nit doesn't count; it's an emergency.'' What a great game.\n  Again, I remind my colleagues that the Congress is responsible for \npassing appropriations bills, and we need to pass them. If he vetoes \nthem, fine, he can shut down the Government. We can pass continuing \nresolutions, and we can do that as much as necessary.\n  The President in his weekly radio address said:\n\n       Our Nation needs 100,000 new, highly qualified teachers to \n     reduce class size in early grades.\n\n  He said, ``We need more teachers, more buildings.''\n  The President said:\n\n       So again today, I call on Congress to help communities \n     build or modernize 5,000 schools with targeted tax credits.\n\n  Mr. President, I want more money for education. I want a lot better \neducation, but I really don't want the President of the United States \nor some bureaucrat in the Department of Education deciding which school \nin Oklahoma gets a new teacher or which building in Oklahoma is going \nto be rebuilt or which classroom is going to be modernized or updated.\n  Why should we have that decision made in Washington, DC? Why should \nFederal bureaucrats be involved? Maybe our schools in Oklahoma need \nmore teachers or maybe they need new buildings or maybe they need new \ncomputers. Why don't we trust Oklahomans to make that decision? Why \ndon't we trust the parents and the teachers and the school boards? No, \nthis administration does not trust local school boards, local teachers, \nparents, Governors to be making that decision.\n  He wants to mandate it from Washington, DC. This is a new demand. \nGuess what? We have had votes on these issues. He did not win. The \nPresident's program did not win. We had two or three votes earlier this \nyear. He did not win on the school building program; did not win on the \n100,000 new teachers. But yet this is a new demand, that he is going to \ntry to get it, he is not going to sign the bill unless we fund it.\n  I am going to tell you right now, at least as far as this Senator is \nconcerned--and maybe I do not control the conferences--but I do not \nhave any intention to ever fund those programs. I think decisions on \nhiring teachers and building school buildings should be made in the \nlocal school districts, by the local school boards, by the parent/\nteacher associations, by the Governors--not by those of us in Congress \nor, frankly, by some bureaucrat in the Department of Education.\n  So maybe we will be here for a long time. Again, the President has \nthe right to veto the bill. Fine. Let him veto the bill. Maybe we will \nbe operating on continuing resolutions for the rest of the year. If \nthat is what happens, that is what happens. I will, again, repeat that \nwe will pass enough continuing resolutions as necessary to keep \nGovernment open.\n  Maybe we will have to pass one every day. Maybe we will have to pass \none every week. Maybe we will have to pass one every month. But we are \nnot going to shut Government down. We are not going to demand anything. \nWe will pass the continuing resolutions to keep Government operating at \nfiscal year 1998 levels as long as necessary. We will stay here. We are \nhappy to stay next week. We are happy to stay the following week. We \nare happy to stay all year, if that is necessary. But I hope, and I \nbelieve, we are not going to succumb to this last-minute politicization \nof, ``We want more money. Let's spend the surplus.''\n  I have even heard, in the President's radio or in his speech \nyesterday--``We've got the first balanced budget in 29 years. Our \neconomy is prosperous. This budget is purely a simple test of whether \nor not, after 9 months of doing nothing, we're going to do the right \nthing about our children's future.''\n  ``We want more money'' is basically what he is saying. I also heard \nhim say we should save the surplus for Social Security. Now he is \ntalking about new investments. In his speech yesterday, he said we need \nnew investments for everything I have mentioned, but he also runs \nthrough a whole list of other new spending, social spending, that he is \ntrying to crowd through in the last minute.\n  I do not have any intentions of succumbing to these demands. I hope \nmy colleagues will not. I just say this, with all respect, how the \nPresident\n\n[[Page S12299]]\n\ncould demagog that we cannot have a tax cut because of the Social \nSecurity surplus and then in the next minute, propose to spend the so-\ncalled surplus on all these investments is beyond me. I just have no \nintention whatsoever of going along with that.\n  I think we should abide by the budget. I do not think we should \nsquander the surplus with new Federal spending. Some of us were \ninterested in tax cuts because we knew that if we did not allow \ntaxpayers to keep their money, that Congress and/or the administration \nwould say, ``Well, let's have more spending.'' There is a real \npropensity around the place to spend money.\n  I just hope that our colleagues will resist that temptation. I hope \nthat they will resist these new overtures by the administration that \nseems to think they should be an equal body with Congress in writing \nappropriations bills. I think we should have legitimate negotiations \nbut, frankly, that does not make people equal partners.\n  We have equal branches of Government with divisions of powers. Again, \nthe Constitution says that Congress shall write the laws and Congress \nshall appropriate the money. We need to get on with our business and do \nthat, send the appropriations bills to the President. If he vetoes \nthem, fine, then let's pass a continuing resolution to keep Government \nopen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12297-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR WENDELL FORD\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I have given accolades to a couple of my \ncolleagues for their service in the Senate, including Senator Bumpers. \nI see Senator Ford is on the floor. I have had the pleasure of serving \nwith Senator Ford for 18 years on the Energy Committee. We worked \ntogether on a lot of things. And, in my opinion, some of the most \nsignificant legislation that passed Congress, in my tenure, we have \nworked together on.\n  One was the Natural Gas Deregulation Act that President Bush signed \nafter about 6 years of negotiations and hard work, but probably one of \nthe most difficult pieces of legislation that we have passed.\n  And if you go back on the history of natural gas regulation and \nderegulation, it was a very, very difficult task. It was a pleasure for \nme to work with Senator Ford in that respect. We worked together on \nother issues as well.\n  I compliment him for his 24 years of service in the Senate. Anyone \nthat spends almost a quarter of a century of service in the Senate, I \nthink, is to be complimented. I compliment him for his leadership and \nfor his representation of the people of Kentucky. Again, it was a \npleasure and honor for me to serve with him. I compliment him and wish \nhim every best wish as he returns to his State of Kentucky.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12299-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12299-S12300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO UNITED STATES SENATOR DALE BUMPERS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in the bustling commotion of the ending days \nof the 105th Congress, members are preoccupied with efforts to enact \nsought after objectives important to their constituents. We are busy \ntying up loose ends, putting the finishing touches on projects, and \nlooking forward to going home to our constituents and to a break in the \nhectic schedule of the United States Senate. Regrettably, as this \nsession of Congress adjourns, we are also faced with the difficult task \nof saying goodbye to colleagues who have chosen to follow a new path in \nlife.\n  As I reflect on my years in Congress and on my association with its \nmany members and their various personalities, their goals and, yes, \nsometimes, their eccentricities, I am reminded of some very important \nmilestones in history made possible by these fine Americans. I am \nreminded of my good fortune to have been associated with men and women \nrepresenting the American people from all walks of life and from all \ncorners of the United States.\n  In my reflections, I have thanked my Creator for allowing me to serve \nmy country with such fine men and women, and I am, indeed, sorrowful at \nthe upcoming loss of some of the finest men I have ever known.\n  I pay tribute today to an exceptional United States Senator, a man \nwith whom it has been my honor to serve and to have been associated \nwith--a man of unusual conviction, passion, and resolve. He has been \ncalled the last Southern liberal, and he is proud of it. He often \nquotes from ``To Kill a Mocking Bird.'' He is THE commanding foe \nagainst the space station.\n  The above discourse clearly references the actions of only one man--\nSenator Dale Bumpers, Democrat from Arkansas. He is the United States \nSenator responsible for ``right-turn-on-red,'' his first legislative \nvictory and one for which, I am told, he received devilish teasing from \na colleague who warned that ``many people might want to drive \nstraight!''\n  I will miss my friend, who is retiring following twenty-four years of \nservice. He leaves a legacy that has made a difference, not only to the \npeople of Arkansas, but to all Americans. His tireless efforts to end \nfederal policies that he believes give away resources that belong to \nthe taxpayer will long be remembered by certain mining and ranching \ninterests out West. And more than a few NASA space station contractors \nwill continue to run when they hear his name! Contractors who worked on \nthe now-terminated Superconducting Super Collider can only wish that \nSenator Bumpers had chosen to retire earlier.\n  While many a press story covered his crusades against alleged lost \ncauses, Senator Dale Bumpers is a man that leaves this Senate with a \ntriumphant record for the American people. In particular, Senator \nBumpers has been a national leader in protecting the health of \nchildren. In fact, along with his wife, Betty, Senator Bumpers has long \npromoted childhood immunizations, known safeguards in protecting the \nhealth of millions of children.\n  As the ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on \nAgriculture, formerly the Chairman, Dale Bumpers has represented the \nrural heart of America. He has fought for policies to help rural \nfamilies, including securing funding for basic infrastructure projects \nthat provide water and sewer facilities to small towns throughout the \nnation. I personally wish to thank Senator Bumpers for being a leading \nadvocate for funding on these vital projects, and I share his concern \nfor the millions of Americans who do not have access to a clean, ample \nsupply of drinking water.\n  Senator Bumpers has further made a significant mark on efforts to \nprotect family farmers. In particular, we owe our gratitude to Dale \nBumpers for his efforts to initiate programs to help young Americans \nbecome this nation's next generation of family farmers, a dwindling \nbreed at risk of extinction. In honor of his service to rural America, \nI am proud that this Congress, in the Fiscal Year 1999 Agriculture \nAppropriations Bill, is formally paying tribute to his work by \ndesignating an Agricultural Research Service facility as the Dale \nBumpers National Rice Research Center. This action follows the \nrecognition by the people of Arkansas in dedicating the Dale Bumpers \nCollege of Agricultural, Food, and Life Sciences at the University of \nArkansas.\n  Senator Bumpers' noteworthy record also extends to many other \nconstituencies. Through his ranking membership on the Senate Small \nBusiness Committee, he has fought to help self-employed people obtain \nhealth care. He has also been an advocate of funding for rural \nhospitals; for Medicaid; for the Women, Infants and Children feeding \nprogram. The list goes on and on.\n  Dale Bumpers' legislative skills and record are clear. He is a modern \nhero to the underdog. But there is yet another side of the Senator from \nArkansas that deserves recognition--the Dale Bumpers who is a husband, \na father, and a grandfather. Married to Betty Lou Flanagen, Dale's \n``Secretary of Peace,'' for 49 years, he is devoted to his marriage and \nhis family. Dale and Betty have three children and six grandchildren, \nand Dale often speaks affectionately of his family and of their \ninfluence on his consideration of legislative issues. Yes, Senator Dale \nBumpers of Arkansas has a personal record of which he can be proud.\n  It is with regret that I bid farewell to my friend and colleague, who \nis now departing the United States Senate. I believe that the Senate \nhas deeply benefited from the work of U.S. Senator Dale Bumpers. As I \nsay my farewell to Dale Bumpers, I want him to know that when the 106th \nCongress convenes, I will remember his thoughtful recital\n\n[[Page S12300]]\n\nof the fictional Atticus Finch in ``To Kill a Mocking Bird,'' ``For \nGod's sake, do your duty.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12299-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOHN GLENN\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to bid farewell to an \nAmerican hero, a great Senator and a wonderful friend--Senator John \nGlenn. Senator Glenn is retiring after serving the people of Ohio for \nfour terms.\n  But his service to our country did not begin in the Senate, nor will \nit end here. Senator Glenn served in the Marine Corps during World War \nII and fought in combat in the South Pacific. He also fought with valor \nin the Korean conflict and ended up flying 149 missions in both wars. \nHe has received numerous honors including six Distinguished Flying \nCross and the Air Medal with 18 clusters.\n  He later became a test pilot and set a transcontinental speed record \nin 1957 for this first flight to average supersonic speed from Los \nAngeles to New York. In 1959, he was selected to be one of seven \nastronauts in the space program. Three years later, he made history as \nthe first American to orbit the earth, completing a 5 hour, three orbit \nflight.\n  His heroism inspired me and all of the American people. He received \nthe Space Congressional Medal of Honor for his service.\n  After 23 years in military service, he retired in 1965 and went into \nthe private sector. Despite his outstanding service to his country, it \nwas not enough for John Glenn. He ran for the Senate in 1974 and is now \ncompleting his 24th year.\n  Despite his fame, Senator Glenn was a workhorse, not a showhorse in \nthe Senate. He took on complicated issues like nuclear proliferation, \ntroop readiness, government ethics, civil service reform and campaign \nfinance reform. He did his work with great diligence and thoroughness, \nwith his eye on accomplishment not partisanship.\n  If you add his 23 years of military service to his 24 years of \nService to the people of Ohio, that is 47 years of dedication to our \nnation.\n  But even this is not enough for John Glenn. On October 29th of this \nyear, he will return to space on a shuttle mission. He will be the \noldest person ever to travel in space but even then his journey will \nnot be over.\n  He will continue to represent the best of the American spirit and be \nan informal ambassador for scientific exploration.\n  I wish him, his wife Annie, his children and grandchildren the very \nbest for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12300-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RETIREMENT OF DALE BUMPERS\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an \nextraordinary person, a respected and honorable man, a true friend, and \none whom I am truly saddened to see leave the Senate--Senator Dale \nBumpers.\n  Mr. President, Senator Bumpers is, more than most, a true advocate \nfor the citizens of the United States. I know of no better person who \nembraces issues with the passion and intellect that he demonstrates. \nHis oratory skills are well-known and rarely matched. Dale is a true \nchampion of the public's interests, and particularly when that clashes \nwith special interests.\n  Throughout his decades of public service, as Governor of Arkansas and \nUnited States Senator, Senator Bumpers has carried with him a strong, \nunyielding belief in a few basic ideas, ideas that have driven him in \nhis tireless efforts to make our country--and the world--a better \nplace.\n  Senator Bumpers believes in ensuring equal opportunities for all, \nincluding the poor and indigent. He believes in providing high quality, \ncomprehensive education and health care. He believes in the sanctity of \nour Constitution. He believes in the value of the arts and humanities \nin developing human creativity and a national culture. He believes in \nthe importance of environmental conservation and preserving our natural \nresources. He believes in eliminating needless corporate subsidies and \nreducing wasteful defense spending. And he believes in the need to slow \nthe growing gap between the rich and the poor.\n  Senator Bumpers has never shied away from taking on the powerful \nspecial interests, year after year, even when he knows the odds are \nstacked against him and he is often disappointed with the results. But \nhe has kept on trying.\n  We have all been witnesses to his eloquent and powerful discourses on \na number of subjects. Every one of his presentations before us and \nbefore the country have been grounded in personal experience and \nintellectual strength. When Senator Bumpers speaks, we know that he \nspeaks from his heart.\n  Mr. President, in 1995, the Senate debated an amendment that would \nrequire zero tolerance for youth who had any amount of alcohol in their \nblood. Senator Bumpers revealed his personal story about his parents \nand their friend who were killed by a drunk driver while returning from \ntheir small farm, just across the Arkansas River. Senator Bumpers was \nin law school at the time, far away in Chicago.\n  Dale, more than most, has the power to sway with his words. That \namendment was swiftly adopted.\n  Mr. President, also three years ago, the Senate was considering an \namendment to add funds to the National Endowment for the Humanities. \nNow, the NEH is a small agency that can, and does, often come under the \nbudget knife as an insignificant agency. Not to Senator Bumpers. \nSenator Bumpers took to the Senate floor, and told all of us about his \nhigh school English teacher, Miss Doll Means. He touched us with a \npersonal story that was a turning point in his life. When he was a \nsophomore, Miss Doll Means told him, after he had read a page of \n``Beowulf\" that he had a nice voice and he read beautifully. That one \nstatement, from an English teacher in a town of 1,000 people, did more \nfor his self-esteem than anybody, except, he said, his father. Not only \ndoes he indeed have a nice voice and he reads beautifully, he is among \nthe best orators this Senate has ever seen.\n  Mr. President, earlier this year during the Appropriations Committee \npassed an amendment naming a vaccine center at NIH after Dale and Betty \nBumpers. For almost 30 years, the two of them have worked tirelessly on \na crusade to vaccinate all children--and because of their efforts and \nothers, we have made great progress toward that goal.\n  Mr. President, when the Senior Senator from Arkansas leaves this body \nin a few weeks, there will be a noticeable void. We will lose a \ntireless champion for the underserved; a champion for the public's \ninterest; a champion for responsible spending, not wasteful spending; \nand a champion for equal opportunity, for our environment, and for the \narts and humanities. Senator Bumpers has our respect, and he has the \npeople's respect. We will miss him.\n  Mr. President, I wish my friend and his wife Betty, their children \nand grandchildren the very best for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12300-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12300-S12301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO WENDELL H. FORD\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President I rise today to pay tribute to our \nesteemed colleague from Kentucky, the Minority Whip, Senator Wendell H. \nFord. I wish him well. All of us know that we have not heard the last \nfrom this dedicated and effective public servant.\n  His retirement from the Senate will end a formal career of public \nservice to the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the United States which has \nlasted over three decades. After first serving in the Kentucky Senate, \nhe was elected Lieutenant Governor in 1967 and then Governor of \nKentucky in 1971. In 1974, he was elected to serve in the United States \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, in the history of this body, few Senators have \nprotected the interests of his or her state as doggedly as Wendell \nFord.\n  Whether the issue was aviation, tobacco, telecommunications or farm \nlegislation, Senator Ford has always put the people of Kentucky first. \nAnd even though we have disagreed on a key issue or two, I know that he \nis guided by what he believes is best for the people of his state.\n  As the senior Senator from Kentucky put it himself: ``If it ain't \ngood for Kentucky, it ain't good for Wendell Ford.''\n  And the people of Kentucky have shown their deep appreciation to \nSenator Ford in return. In 1992, he received the largest number of \nvotes ever\n\n[[Page S12301]]\n\nrecorded by a candidate for elected office in the Commonwealth.\n  In March of this year, he became the longest serving United States \nSenator from Kentucky in history.\n  Mr. President, although New Jersey and Kentucky are very different \nstates, Senator Ford and I share many things in common. First of all, \nour vintage--we were born in the same year. We both fought for our \ncountry in World War II. We both ran businesses before we entered \npublic life.\n  These common experiences helped make Wendell Ford an instant friend \nand mentor to me when I arrived in the Senate. His extensive knowledge \nand public service experience has made him an invaluable asset to our \ncaucus' leadership.\n  And he has been quite a leader, now as Minority Whip, first as \nChairman and then Ranking Member of the Rules Committee, and in prior \nyears, the Chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n  Mr. President, Senator Ford has left a formidable legacy to the \nnation as a whole, in addition to his legendary status in Kentucky. He \nwas the chief sponsor of the National Voter Registration Act, also \nknown as the ``motor voter'' law.\n  This law helps ensure that more of our citizens are officially \nregistered to participate in our democracy. He was also instrumental in \nthe enactment of the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Age \nDiscrimination in Employment Act Amendments of 1986, and many other \nlandmark aviation and energy laws.\n  The Senior Senator from Kentucky will be greatly missed here in the \nUnited States Senate. We will miss his leadership, his experience and \nalso his great wit. But our personal loss will be the Commonwealth of \nKentucky's gain.\n  I wish him, his wife Jean, their children and grandchildren Godspeed \nas he returns to Owensboro.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12300-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR DAN COATS\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \ndistinguished Senator from Indiana, Dan Coats. While he has only been \nin the Senate ten years, he has made an important contribution. One \nexample is the work he put into developing the historic, bipartisan \nFamily and Medical Leave Act.\n  Mr. President, believe it or not, even though I am a Democrat from \nthe Northeast and Senator Coats is a Republican from the Midwest, we \nhave worked together on legislation. Senator Coats has consistently \nfought to improve the lives of our nation's children. This commitment \nled him to join me in support of the Juvenile Mentoring Program--\notherwise know as JUMP. This program supports mentoring programs across \nthe country, including Big Brothers and Big Sisters. We have fought \ntogether for funding and reauthorizing the program because we share the \nbelief that all children can succeed if we lend a helping hand.\n  Senator Coats also became a leading expert in the Senate on military \nissues as a member of the Armed Services Committee. He also worked hard \non education and poverty legislation as a member of the Senate Labor \nand Human Resources Committee.\n  Mr. President, during Senator Coats' tenure in the Senate, we did \nhave disagreements over policy issues. One environmental issue \nconsistently put the State of Indiana at odds with the State of New \nJersey. We always had a vigorous debate when this issue came to the \nfloor. Despite our differences, he showed me great respect and courtesy \nduring these deliberations. I left these debates with a great respect \nfor his energy and determination to help his state.\n  Mr. President, I wish Senator Coats, his wife Marcia, and their \nchildren and grandchildren the very best for the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12301-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12301-S12302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         A GOOD SENATOR DEPARTS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, first appointed to the United States Senate \nin 1989 by Governor Robert Orr to succeed Vice President Dan Quayle, \nSenator Coats subsequently won reelection and has served this body \nduring these past nine years with knowledge, skill, and a true \ndedication to his Senatorial duties. As he departs this great \ninstitution to pursue future endeavors, we bid him farewell and best \nwishes.\n  Prior to joining the United States Senate, Senator Coats made his \nmark in several arenas. In his early years, he served as a staff \nsergeant in the U.S. Army, experience he drew on as a member of the \nArmed Services Committee. With a passion for law and politics, he \nworked full-time as a legal intern while attending the Indiana \nUniversity School of Law at night and serving as Associate Editor of \nthe Law Review. Later, in an effort to gain business experience, he \nswitched tunes from barrister to become a vice president for an Indiana \nlife insurance company, all before embarking on his legislative career \nin the House of Representatives, where he was elected in 1980 to \nrepresent Indiana's Fourth District.\n  During his tenure in the Senate, Senator Coats has served on three \npowerful and influential Senate Committees--Armed Services, \nIntelligence, and Labor and Human Resources, and has crafted sound \neducation, health care, and national security policy for the nation. I \nhave had the pleasure of working with Senator Coats on the Armed \nServices Committee, where he has served on the Personnel, Readiness, \nand the Airland Forces Subcommittees. There have been a variety of \nnational defense issues on which we have concurred, always keeping in \nmind the best interests of our national security and the importance of \na strong and well equipped line of defense. Just this year, I \nappreciated his insight and support of my amendment to the Department \nof Defense Authorization bill to require separate training units for \nmale and female recruits during basic training.\n  And, of course, there have been the issues on which we have not seen \neye-to-eye. I distinctly remember tangling this year on the Senate \nfloor over Constitutional issues relating to the deployment of troops \nin Bosnia and Herzegovina. And, on the balanced budget amendment and \nthe line item veto, we have been on opposite sides of the coin as well. \nYet, Senator Coats always carries himself well, demonstrating the \nutmost respect for his colleagues on both sides of the aisle. For this, \nI hold him in high regard.\n  Perhaps, Senator Coats' greatest contribution to the United States \nSenate has been as a member of the Labor and Human Resources Committee. \nHis dedication to strengthening families began long before his \npolitical career. He is a longstanding member of Big Brothers/Big \nSisters of America, and was recently elected national president of that \norganization. His service in the House included serving as a leading \nmember of the Select Committee on Children, Youth, and Families. On \nappointment to the Senate, he became Ranking Member of the Subcommittee \non Children and Families, where he has served as Chairman since 1995. \nHe has been the author of the ``Project for American Renewal'' to \nrevive civil society and America's character-forming institutions, and \nhe is a passionate advocate for school choice, unpaid leave for family \nand medical emergencies, and prayer in schools.\n  Most recently, Senator Coats shepherded legislation through Congress \nto reauthorize the Head Start and Low Income Home Energy Assistance \nprogram. In appreciation of his efforts and compassion for our nation's \nchildren and families, it was only fitting that this piece of \nlegislation was named in his honor. The Coats Human Service \nReauthorization Act is but just one example of his fine work here in \nthe United States Senate.\n  In speaking of his ``Project for American Renewal,'' he says, ``The \ngoal of public policy should be to revive the institutions of civil \nsociety that build character. Arguably, it is the erosion of those \ninstitutions--the family, community organizations, and private and \nreligious charities--that has led to the most severe pathologies we now \nsuffer.'' I commend Senator Coats for his tireless efforts in behalf of \nthese fundamental institutions, and, as he departs this body, I wish \nhim well.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I understand we are under an order that the \nSenate go into recess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. We were going to go into recess at 3 \no'clock. However----\n\n[[Page S12302]]\n\n  Mr. BURNS. I ask unanimous consent that I be able to make some \nremarks about our departing colleagues at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12301-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO FIVE SENATORS LEAVING THE SENATE: SENATORS DIRK KEMPTHORNE, \n         JOHN GLENN, DAN COATS, WENDELL FORD, AND DALE BUMPERS\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, five Senators will move on at the closing \nof this session of the 105th Congress. And they are Senators that have, \nwith the exception of one, been here ever since I joined this body back \nin 1989.\n  Dirk Kempthorne from Idaho was elected after I was. And now after one \nterm he has elected to go back to his home State of Idaho.\n  It seems like it becomes more and more difficult, as time goes by, to \nattract men and women to public service, and especially to public \nservice when there are elections.\n  He brought a certain quality to this Senate. On his work on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, he was sensitive to the \nenvironment and all the public infrastructure that we enjoy across this \ncountry. It just seemed to fit, because he had come here after being \nthe mayor of Boise, ID. And his very first objective was to tackle this \nbusiness of unfunded mandates. He took that issue on and provided the \nleadership, and finally we passed a law that unfunded mandates must be \nadhered to whenever we tell local government, State government that it \nis going to take some of your money to comply with the laws as passed \nby the Federal Government.\n  He, like me, had come out of local government. He knew the stresses \nand the pains of city councilmen and mayors and county commissioners \nevery time they struggle with their budget in order to provide the \nservices for their people, when it comes to schools and roads and \npublic safety--all the demands that we enjoy down to our neighborhoods.\n  We shall miss him in this body.\n  To my friend, John Glenn of Ohio, who has already made his mark in \nhistory that shall live forever, he has left his tracks in this body. \nAnd not many know--and maybe not even him--but I was a lowly corporal \nin the U.S. Marine Corps when he was flying in the Marine Corps. So my \nmemory of John Glenn goes back more than 40 years to El Toro Marine \nCorps Air Station in Santa Anna, CA.\n  As he goes into space again at the end of this month, we wish him \nGodspeed. He gave this country pride as he lifted off and became the \nfirst American to orbit the Earth. And he carried with him all of the \nwishes of the American people.\n  To Dan Coats of Indiana, a classmate, we came to this body together \nin 1989. Our routes were a little different, but yet almost the same--\nhe coming from the House of Representatives and me coming from local \ngovernment.\n  He is a living example of a person dedicated to public service. But \nit never affected his solid core values. He has not changed one iota \nsince I first met him back in 1989.\n\n  The other principal is on the floor today. It is Wendell Ford of \nKentucky. I was fortunate to serve on two of the most fascinating and \nhard-working committees in the U.S. Senate with Senator Ford: The \nCommerce Committee and the Energy Committee. Those committees, folks, \ntouch every life in America every day.\n  We flip on our lights at home or in our businesses. We pick up the \ntelephone, listen to our radio, watch our televisions, move ourselves \nfrom point A to point B, no matter what the mode --whether it is auto, \ntrain or plane. Yes, all of the great scientific advances this country \nhas made, and research and the improvement of everyday life and, yes, \neven our venture into space comes under the auspices of the Commerce, \nScience and Transportation Committee and the Energy Committee. Those \ntwo committees play such a major role in the everyday workings of \nAmerica.\n  Wendell Ford was one great champion and one of the true principals in \nformulating policies that we enjoy today. He played a major role in \neach and every one of them.\n  Again, it was my good fortune to work with Senator Bumpers on two \ncommittees: The Small Business Committee and the Energy Committee. \nThere is no one in this body that has been more true to his deeply held \nbeliefs than Senator Bumpers. Our views did not always mesh--and that \nis true with Senator Ford. It was their wisdom and the way they dealt \nwith their fellow Senators that we worked our way through difficult \nissues and hard times with a sense of humor. I always say if you come \nfrom Arkansas you have to have a pretty good sense of humor. My roots \ngo back to Missouri; I know we had to develop humor very early. \nNonetheless, it was the integrity and the honesty that allowed us to \nsettle our differences, even though we were 180 degrees off plumb.\n  I think I have taken from them much more than I have given back to \nthem. This body has gained more than it can repay. This Nation is a \nbetter Nation for all of them serving in the U.S. Senate.\n  In our country we don't say goodbye, we just say so long. But we say \nso long to these Senators from our everyday activities on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate. I am sure our trails will cross many times in the \nfuture. Should they not, I will be the most disappointed of all.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, let me thank my distinguished friend from \nMontana for his kind remarks. I understand Montana a little bit. My \nmother's brother married a lady from Montana and she persuaded him to \nmove there. So I have been to Montana on many occasions and have \nenjoyed the friendship, the rugged mountains, the pristine areas and \nthe big blue sky. I have enjoyed it very much--and the trout are not \nbad when you catch them and have a shore dinner. I understand Montana \nand I can understand why you love it. I can understand why anything we \nmight copy from you would make our State a little bit better.\n  I say to my friend from Montana, I thank him for his kind remarks. I \nthank him for his friendship. I thank him for his ability to sit down \nand talk things through where we might move forward and help the \ncountry and talk about those things we couldn't agree upon at a later \ndate. I thank him for his friendship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12302-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12302-S12303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SENATE BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, a few moments ago the distinguished \nassistant Republican leader was on the floor chastising the President, \nchastising Democrats, chastising people that were trying to be helpful \nor influential, and I heard him say more than once, ``Get on with our \nbusiness.''\n  Mr. President, this is October 10th and the budget for next year \nshould have been completed April 15 of this year. April, May, June, \nJuly, August, September, October--we still don't have a budget. We are \nrunning on last year's budget. Somehow or another, this train hasn't \nbeen running as efficiently and as effectively as some think it should.\n  If you haven't had a budget, it makes it difficult to set the levels \nfor next year's spending. We are already into the next fiscal year by \n10 days and we only had one appropriations bill on the President's \ndesk.\n  The distinguished Senator from Oklahoma says let's get on with our \nbusiness; then he says that the President should not be involved in \nnegotiations. Mr. President, I have been around here 24 years. I have \nnever gone through any negotiations involved with the White House that \nthey didn't call me. I have gone to the White House to talk with \nPresident Reagan; I have gone to the White House to talk with President \nBush in order to try to find a way to be helpful, and they were trying \nto find a way to persuade me to be helpful. I don't see anything wrong \nwith that. And I don't believe the President wants to veto bills. That \nis one reason that everybody agreed to the group--if that is a good \nterm, or the Members of the group--so they might be able to work out \nbills that can be signed. I don't see anything wrong with the \nadministration playing a part in what they believe is the proper \ncourse.\n  We talk about a budget. Going back to 1993, there wasn't a Republican \nthat\n\n[[Page S12303]]\n\nvoted for President Clinton's budget at that time. I wonder how those \nnow who are saying we have a great surplus can be breaking their arm \npatting themselves on the back for that great vote that they didn't \ncast in 1993.\n  The President has every right to be part of the negotiations. I \nwanted to say to my colleague who had to leave, what is wrong with \nwanting more for education? What is wrong with wanting to improve our \nschool system? What is wrong with having smaller classes? What is wrong \nwith having more teachers? I don't see anything wrong.\n  What is wrong with seeing that every child that leaves the third \ngrade can read? What is wrong with that? The 21st century will be full \nof technology and we have to have educated children. So what is wrong \nwith trying to improve education in this country? Public education \nteaches 90 percent of all of our children. It has to be the best \neducational system we can give them. We need to be able to improve \neducation all across this country.\n  How in the world can the Senator from Oklahoma say that the Federal \nGovernment will appoint their teachers? We give money to the States. \nThe States, then, make the selection. The States, then, set the \ncriteria. The States, then, have the vacancy. The States do that. I \nhave never known a Federal Government to hire a teacher in my State. I \nhave been Governor. I understand writing a budget. I understand what we \ndo. I still understand it. But I don't believe the Federal Education \nDepartment hires teachers in my State or any State. So we are not \ntelling them who to hire and who not to hire.\n  That is just a straw man, or whatever, to try to say we don't want \nBig Brother involved. We sure want Big Brother's money, we sure want \nBig Brother to pay it, but we don't want them to have anything to do \nwith any kind of guidelines.\n  So, when we come out on the floor and chastise the President and the \nadministration for wanting to work out pieces of legislation, you talk \nto the farmers in the Midwest, talk to farmers in my State; they have \nhad a tough several years. Sure, it may have been less a year ago than \nit is now and times have changed. We have had a bad summer. We have had \nreal problems. So why not help our farmers?\n  So, Mr. President, I suggest to those who want to come to the floor \nand have press conferences saying that the administration ought to stay \nout of our business and we will pass the legislation, well, where is \nit? Where is the legislation? What have we passed? The Patients' Bill \nof Rights? No; that was killed yesterday. Education? No. Where are the \nbills they were supposed to pass? ``Let us get on with our business,'' \nthe Senator from Oklahoma said. Well, let's get on with our business.\n  Here we are on Saturday, and we are lucky we are not in on Sunday \nafternoon. We will be here Monday. That is a holiday. They set a sine \ndie date of October 9, and we don't even have the appropriations bills \ndone. So let's not be too harsh on the administration for wanting to \ntry to get it done.\n  I regret that I am here. I wish all 13 appropriations bills had been \non the President's desk and signed before October 1, which begins the \nfiscal year. I remember how hard Senator Robert Byrd, when he was \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, worked to be sure that all 13 \nof the appropriations bills were on the President's desk by September \n30. And they were. That is what we are supposed to do. Those are the \nrules.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope that over the weekend we can find some way \nthat those who are responsible for the appropriations bills can bring \nthem together, that they will find a way that we can say we have worked \ntogether, that we have used Henry Clay's advice and we have \ncompromised. Henry Clay said, ``Compromise is negotiated hurt.'' \nNegotiated hurt. Clay said, ``You have to give up something and it \nhurts, and I have to give up something and it hurts. Once we agree, \nthen I am willing to sign a social contract.''\n  Clay was saying he was willing to support legislation to move the \ncountry forward and on another day we will argue the things we had to \ngive up. So that is what we are all about here --the Henry Clay era of \ncompromise, and the ability to sign a social contract and move forward \nin the best interest of this country. I hope that we can see the light \nat the end of the tunnel by the end of the week. I hope to be here to \ncast a vote in favor of a compromise and agreement that will make this \ncountry a better country. It is my last one, Mr. President. I would \nlike to see as good a piece of legislation in all areas passed, so that \nwhen we look back on this session, we will have said we did a good job.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12302-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12303-S12304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              A GOOD SENATOR RETURNS TO THE HILLS OF HOME\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, over the next few days, as the Senate \nconcludes its legislative business, one of the finest individuals it \nhas been my privilege to know will bring to a close yet another chapter \nin what has been, by any measure, an extraordinary public service \ncareer. When that time comes--when the senior Senator from the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky walks out of this chamber for the last time as \na United States Senator--this institution, and all who serve in it, \nwill feel a great and lasting loss.\n  When Wendell Ford came to this body on December 28, 1974, thus \nbecoming the 1,685th individual to have served in the Senate, he did so \nnot as a political neophyte but as an accomplished entrepreneur and a \ndedicated and seasoned public servant. Following service in World War \nII, our friend from Kentucky returned to his home state and launched a \nsuccessful insurance business. But it was the call of public service, \nthe chance to reach out and help all of his fellow Kentuckians, that \nmeant the most to this young executive.\n  And, so, in 1964, Wendell Ford began what was to become a successful \npolitical career by winning election to the Kentucky State Senate. Two \nyears later, in 1966, he successfully ran for the position of \nLieutenant Governor, and, in 1970, against all odds, he became \nKentucky's Governor, a position from which he served with distinction \nas the chairman of the National Democratic Governors Caucus.\n  Mr. President, despite his selfless service within his state, it is, \nof course, the near quarter-century he has spent here in the United \nStates Senate that has earned Wendell Ford the admiration, the respect, \nand the undying affection of his colleagues. And, having been elected \nto four terms in the Senate, it is obvious that the good people of \nKentucky also understand and appreciate the skill, the dedication, and \nthe flawless integrity that Wendell Ford brings to his work. He serves \nKentucky and the Nation with a wit and candor that are as timely and as \nrefreshing as a cool Kentucky breeze on a hot summer day.\n  In fact, in 1992, he began a string of historical achievements when \nhe received the largest number of votes ever recorded by a candidate \nfor elected office in the state of Kentucky. On November 14, 1996, \nWendell Ford broke Alben Barlkey's record for the longest consecutive \nservice in the United States Senate as a Senator from the Commonwealth, \nwhile becoming the overall longest serving Senator from Kentucky in \nMarch of this year.\n  Mr. President, such milestones are not just proud, personal moments, \nalthough they are that. Rather, they speak to the immense respect, and \nthe tremendous trust that the citizens of Kentucky have for their \ndistinguished senior Senator. Of course, to those of us who know \nWendell Ford, such respect and trust are not unfounded.\n  As a Member of this body, Senator Ford has become a recognized leader \nin such diverse areas as aviation, federal campaign finance reform, and \nenergy. He has, through dedication and hard work, shaped such important \nlegislation as the National Voter Registration Act, the Federal \nAviation Administration Authorization Act of 1994, the Family and \nMedical Leave Act, the National Energy Security Act of 1992, and the \nEnergy Security Act of 1977.\n  The commitment shown by our colleague from Kentucky in working on \nthese and other profound and troubling problems that face this Nation \nis emblematic of the devoted public servant that Wendell Ford has shown \nhimself to be. There will be few who will match the accomplishments of \nour friend; few who will bring to this body a deeper passion; and few \nwho will legislate with greater skill.\n\n[[Page S12304]]\n\n  Mr. President, as he prepares to leave the Senate, I offer my sincere \ngratitude to Senator Wendell Ford for his professionalism, for his \nfriendship, for his leadership, for his candor, and for his many years \nof dedicated service to our Nation. I would also like to express my \nadmiration, and that of my wife, Erma, to Wendell's gracious and \ndedicated wife, Jean. Few know, of course, of the tremendous sacrifices \nmade by our spouses. But those of us who serve in this body understand \nthe price paid by these selfless, silent partners. None has done so \nwith greater dignity, or with more grace, than has Jean Ford.\n  And, so, I say to my friend from the Commonwealth of Kentucky, I have \ntreasured the time we have worked together, and I wish him good luck \nand God's speed. He is coming home.\n\n       Weep no more, my lady,\n       Oh! weep no more to-day!\n       We will sing one song for the Old Kentucky Home,\n       For the old Kentucky Home far away.\n\n       ``My Old Kentucky Home,'' Stephen Collins Foster, 1826-\n     1864.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I appreciate you presiding as you do \nin such a class fashion. I would like to make a few comments here. I \nhave been touched and impressed by the fact of colleagues coming to the \nfloor and paying tribute to those Members who are departing. I have \nlistened because, as one of those Members who are departing, I know \npersonally how much it means to hear those kind comments that are made.\n  Senator Ford, who just spoke, is leaving after a very illustrious \ncareer. I remember when the Republican Party took over the majority 4 \nyears ago and I was new to the position of Presiding Officer, it was \nnot unusual for Wendell Ford, who knows many of the ropes around here, \nto come and pull me aside and give me a few of the tips of how I could \nbe effective as a Presiding Officer. I think probably one of the \nhighest tributes you can pay to an individual is the fact that you see \ntheir family and the success they have had. I remember when Wendell \nFord's grandson, Clay, was a page here. I think Clay is probably one of \nthe greatest tributes paid to a grandfather.\n  Dale Bumpers, often mentioned here on the floor about his great sense \nof humor, is an outstanding gentlemen. He is someone whom I remember \nbefore I ever became involved in politics. I watched him as a Governor \nof Arkansas and thought, there is a man who has great integrity, \nsomeone you can look up to. And then to have the opportunity to serve \nwith him has been a great honor.\n  John Glenn. Whenever any of the astronauts--the original seven--would \nblast off into space, my mother would get all the boys up so we could \nwatch them. I remember when John Glenn blasted off into space. Again, \nthe idea that somehow a kid would end up here and would serve with John \nGlenn is just something I never could dream of at the time. In fact, \nJohn Glenn became a partner in our efforts to stop unfunded Federal \nmandates. You could not ask for a better partner.\n  Speaking of partners, he could not have a better partner than Annie. \nI had the great joy of traveling with them approximately a year ago \nwhen we went to Asia. That is when you get to know these people as \ncouples. I remember that we happened to be flying over an ocean when it \nwas the Marine Corps' birthday. On the airplane we had a cake and \nbrought it out, to the surprise of John Glenn. But you could see the \nemotion in his eyes. I know the Presiding Officer is a former U.S. \nMarine, so he knows what we are talking about.\n  Dan Coats. There is no more genuine a person than Dan--not only in \nthe Senate but on the face of the Earth. He is a man of great \nsincerity, a man who can articulate his position so extremely well. He \nis a man who, when you look into his eyes, you know he is listening to \nyou and he is going to do right by you and by the people of his State \nof Indiana, and he has done right by the people of the United States. \nHe is a man who has great faith, a man to whom I think a number of us \nhave looked for guidance.\n  When you look at the Senate through the eyes of a camera, you see \njust one dimension. But on the floor of the Senate we are just people. \nA lot of times we don't get home to our wives and kids and sometimes to \nthe ball games or back-to-school nights. There are times when some of \nthe issues don't go as we would like, and it gets tough. At these \ntimes, we hurt. There are people like Dan Coats to whom you can turn, \nwho has said, ``Buddy, I have been there and I am with you now.'' So, \nagain, he is an outstanding individual.\n  Also, Mr. President, I have been really fortunate with the quality of \nthe staff I have had here in the U.S. Senate during the 6 years I have \nbeen here. As I have listened so many times to the Senate clerk call \nthe roll of those Senators, they have answered that roll. I would like \nto just acknowledge this roll of those staff members whom I have had. \nThis is probably the first and only time their names will be called in \nthis august Chamber:\n  Cindy Agidius, Marcia Bain, Jeremy Chou, Camy Mills Cox, Laurette \nDavies, Michelle Dunn, Becky English, Gretchen Estess, Ryan Fitzgerald, \nLance Giles.\n  Charles Grant, Ernie Guerra, Julie Harwood, Laura Hyneman, Meg Hunt, \nCatherine Josling, Ann Klee, Amy Manwaring, John McGee, Liz Mitchell.\n  Heather Muchow, Jay Parkinson, Phil Reberger, Rachel Riggs, Shawna \nSeiber Ward, Orrie Sinclair, Mark Snider, Glen Tait, Jim Tate, Kelly \nTeske.\n  Salle Uberuaga, Jennifer Wallace, Brian Whitlock, Suzanne Bacon, \nBecky Bale, Stan Clark, Tom Dayley, Tyler Dougherty, Carolyn Durant, \nGeorge Enneking.\n  Buzz Fawcett, Margo Gaetz, Erin Givens, Jim Grant, Wendy Guisto, \nJennifer Hayes, Al Henderson, Heather Irby, Steve Judy, Jeff Loveng.\n  Brian McCormack, Darrell McRoberts, Peter Moloney, Scott Muchow, Dan \nRamirez, Dixie Richardson, Stephanie Schisler, Carrie Stach, Gary \nSmith, Michael Stinson, Sally Taniguchi, Julie Tensen, Mitchell \nToryanski, Brian Waidmann, Vaughn Ward.\n  That is a lot of staff. But over 6 years, some of those have come and \ngone.\n  I have also received valuable assistance from interns who have worked \nin my state and Washington offices. I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing list of interns for the past six years be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                Interns\n\n       Angie Adams, Tara Anderson, Jennifer Beck, Matthew \n     Blackburn, Emily Burton, Emilie Caron, Michelle Crapo, Matt \n     Freeman, Amy Hall, Rick Hansen.\n       Michelle Hyde, Paul Jackson, Beth Ann Kerrick, Heather \n     Lauer, Jennifer Ludders, Karen Marchant, Kendal McDevitt, Jan \n     Nielsen, Bryan James Palmer, Tracy Pellechi.\n       Tyler Prout, James Rolig, Dallas Scholes, Robin Staker, \n     Meghan Sullivan, Omar Valverde, Franciose Whitlock, James \n     Williams, Curt Wozniak, Tim Young.\n       Kim Albers, Chris Bailey, Kevin Belew, David Booth, Matt \n     Campbell, Stephen Cataldo, Pandi Ellison, Andrew Grutkowski, \n     Chad Hansen, Sarah Heckel.\n       Laura Hyneman, Michael Jordan, Lisa Lance, Keith Lonergan, \n     Lori Manzaneres, Wade Miller, Kate Montgomery, Rocky Owens, \n     Kurt Pipal, Alan Poff.\n       Nichole Reinke, Don Schanz, Nathan Sierra, Jacob Steele, \n     David Thomas, Curtis Wheeler, Brian Williams, Angie Willie, \n     Darryl Wrights.\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, this will probably be the last time \nofficially on this floor as a U.S. Senator that I look at the faces of \nthese people that you and I have worked with--the clerks, and \nParliamentarians, the staff. It is family. The young pages that we see \nhere with that sparkle in their eye and the enthusiasm that they have \nfor this process--it is fun to talk to you and to see your sense of \nenthusiasm for this. As I said, you are going to have a sense of the \nU.S. Senate like few citizens, because you have been here, you have \nexperienced it, and you have been up close in person.\n  But to those of you that I see now as I look to the desk, those who \nhave sat in your places that I have worked with through these years, I \nthank you. America is well served by you, by your professionalism and \nyour dedication.\n\n[[Page S12305]]\n\n  So I thank you. I thank the Cloakroom again; all of the family; the \nstaff, from the police officers and the waiters and waitresses, and the \nfolks who make this place work; the Senate Chaplain; and, Mr. \nPresident, again I thank you for your courtesy, and I bid you farewell.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thank you, Senator. The people of Idaho and \nthe people of the country are very proud of your service. We wish you \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12304-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:30 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hanrahan, one of its reading clerks, announced that pursuant to \nthe provisions of section 703 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n903) as amended by section 103 of Public Law 103-296, the Speaker \nreappoints Ms. Jo Anne Barnhart of Virginia as a member from private \nlife on the part of the House to the Security Advisory Board to fill \nthe existing vacancy thereon.\n  The message also announced that the House has agreed to the following \nconcurrent resolution, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.

The United States shall not recognize the \n     jurisdiction of any international tribunal to prosecute a \n     United States citizen for a violation of the Protocol or the \n     Convention on Conventional Weapons.\n       (9) Technical cooperation and assistance.--The United \n     States understands that--\n       (A) no provision of the Protocol may be construed as \n     affecting the discretion of the United States to refuse \n     assistance or to restrict or deny permission for the export \n     of equipment, material, or scientific or technological \n     information for any reason; and\n       (B) the Amended Mines Protocol may not be used as a pretext \n     for the transfer of weapons technology or the provision of \n     assistance to the military mining or military counter-mining \n     capabilities of a State Party to the Protocol.\n\n     SEC. 4. CONDITIONS.\n\n       The Senate's advice and consent to the ratification of the \n     Amended Mines Protocol is subject to the following \n     conditions, which shall be binding upon the President:\n       (1) Pursuit deterrent munition.--\n       (A) Understanding.--The Senate understands that nothing in \n     the Amended Mines Protocol restricts the possession or use of \n     the Pursuit Deterrent Munition, which is in compliance with \n     the provisions in the Technical Annex and which constitutes \n     an essential military capability for the United States Armed \n     Forces.\n       (B) Certification.--Prior to deposit of the United States \n     instrument of ratification, the President shall certify to \n     the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations of the Senate and to the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives that the Pursuit Deterrent Munition shall \n     continue to remain available for use by the United States \n     Armed Forces at least until January 1, 2003, unless an \n     effective alternative to the munition becomes available.\n       (C) Effective alternative defined.--For purposes of \n     subparagraph (B), the term ``effective alternative'' does not \n     mean a tactic or operational concept in and of itself.\n       (2) Export moratorium.--The Senate--\n       (A) recognizes the expressed intention of the President to \n     negotiate a moratorium on the export of anti-personnel mines; \n     and\n       (B) urges the President to negotiate a universal ban on the \n     transfer of those mines that does not include any restriction \n     on any mine that is primarily designed to be exploded by the \n     presence, proximity, or contact of a vehicle, as opposed to a \n     person and that is equipped with an anti-handling device, as \n     defined in the Amended Mines Protocol, or a tilt rod or \n     magnetic influence sensor, such mine not being considered an \n     anti-personnel mine despite being so equipped.\n       (3) Humanitarian demining assistance.--\n       (A) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (i) United states efforts.--The United States contributes \n     more than any other country to the worldwide humanitarian \n     demining effort, having expended more than $153,000,000 on \n     such efforts since 1993.\n       (ii) Development of detection and clearing technology.--The \n     Department of Defense has undertaken a substantial program to \n     develop improved mine detection and clearing technology and \n     has shared this improved technology with the international \n     community.\n       (iii) Expansion of united states humanitarian demining \n     programs.--The Department of Defense and the Department of \n     State have significantly expanded their humanitarian demining \n     programs to train and assist the personnel of other countries \n     in developing effective demining programs.\n       (B) International support for demining initiatives.--The \n     Senate urges the international community to join the United \n     States in providing significant financial and technical \n     assistance to humanitarian demining programs, thereby making \n     a concrete and effective contribution to the effort to reduce \n     the grave problem posed by the indiscriminate use of non-\n     self-destructing landmines.\n       (4) Limitation on the scale of assessment.--\n       (A) Limitation on assessment for cost of implementation.--\n     Notwithstanding any provision of the Amended Mines Protocol, \n     and subject to the requirements of subparagraphs (B) and (C), \n     the portion of the United States annual assessed contribution \n     for activities associated with any conference held pursuant \n     to Article 13 of the Amended Mines Protocol may not exceed \n     $1,000,000.\n       (B) Recalculation of limitation.--\n       (i) In general.--On January 1, 2000, and at 3-year \n     intervals thereafter, the Administrator of General Services \n     shall prescribe an amount that shall apply in lieu of the \n     amount specified in subparagraph (A) and that shall be \n     determined by adjusting the last amount applicable under that \n     subparagraph to reflect the percentage increase by which the \n     Consumer Price Index for the preceding calendar year exceeds \n     the Consumer Price Index for the calendar year three years \n     previously.\n       (ii) Consumer price index defined.--In this subparagraph, \n     the term ``Consumer Price Index'' means the last Consumer \n     Price Index for all-urban consumers published by the \n     Department of Labor.\n       (C) Additional contributions requiring congressional \n     approval.--\n       (i) Authority.--Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the \n     President may furnish additional contributions for activities \n     associated with any conference held pursuant to Article 13 of \n     the Amended Mines Protocol which would otherwise be \n     prohibited under subparagraph (A) if--\n\n       (I) the President determines and certifies in writing to \n     the appropriate committees of Congress that the failure to \n     make such contributions would seriously affect the national \n     interest of the United States; and\n       (II) Congress enacts a joint resolution approving the \n     certification of the President under subclause (I).\n\n       (ii) Statement of reasons.--Any certification made under \n     clause (i) shall be accompanied by a detailed statement \n     setting forth the specific reasons therefor and the specific \n     activities associated with any conference held pursuant to \n     Article 13 of the Amended Mines Protocol to which the \n     additional contributions would be applied.\n       (5) United states authority for technical cooperation and \n     assistance.--Notwithstanding any provision of the Amended \n     Mines Protocol, no funds may be drawn from the Treasury of \n     the United States for any payment or assistance (including \n     the transfer of in-kind items) under Article 11 or Article \n     13(3)(d) of the Amended Mines Protocol without statutory \n     authorization and appropriation by United States law.\n       (6) Future negotiation of withdrawal clause.--It is the \n     sense of the Senate that,\n\n[[Page S12309]]\n\n     in negotiations on any treaty containing an arms control \n     provision, United States negotiators should not agree to any \n     provision that would have the effect of inhibiting the United \n     States from withdrawing from the arms control provisions of \n     that treaty in a timely fashion in the event that the supreme \n     national interests of the United States have been \n     jeopardized.\n       (7) Prohibition on de facto implementation of the ottawa \n     convention.--Prior to the deposit of the United States \n     instrument of ratification, the President shall certify to \n     Congress that--\n       (A) the President will not limit the consideration of \n     alternatives to United States anti-personnel mines or mixed \n     anti-tank systems solely to those that comply with with the \n     Ottawa Convention; and\n       (B) in pursuit of alternatives to United States anti-\n     personnel mines, or mixed anti-tank systems, the United \n     States shall seek to identify, adapt, modify, or otherwise \n     develop only those technologies that--\n       (i) are intended to provide military effectiveness \n     equivalent to that provided by the relevant anti-personnel \n     mine, or mixed anti-tank system; and\n       (ii) would be affordable.\n       (8) Certification with regard to international tribunals.--\n     Prior to the deposit of the United States instrument of \n     ratification, the President shall certify to Congress that \n     with respect to the Amended Mines Protocol, the Convention on \n     Conventional Weapons, or any future protocol or amendment \n     thereto, that the United States shall not recognize the \n     jurisdiction of any international tribunal over the United \n     States or any of its citizens.\n       (9) Tactics and operational concepts.--It is the sense of \n     the Senate that development, adaptation, or modification of \n     an existing or new tactic or operational concept, in and of \n     itself, is unlikely to constitute an acceptable alternative \n     to anti-personnel mines or mixed anti-tank systems.\n       (10) Finding regarding the international humanitarian \n     crisis.--The Senate finds that--\n       (A) the grave international humanitarian crisis associated \n     with anti-personnel mines has been created by the \n     indiscriminate use of mines that do not meet or exceed the \n     specifications on detectability, self-destruction, and self-\n     deactivation contained in the Technical Annex to the Amended \n     Mines Protocol; and\n       (B) United States mines that do meet such specifications \n     have not contributed to this problem.\n       (11) Approval of modifications.--The Senate reaffirms the \n     principle that any amendment or modification to the Amended \n     Mines Protocol other than an amendment or modification solely \n     of a minor technical or administrative nature shall enter \n     into force with respect to the United States only pursuant to \n     the treaty-making power of the President, by and with the \n     advice and consent of the Senate, as set forth in Article II, \n     section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United States.\n       (12) Further arms reductions obligations.--The Senate \n     declares its intention to consider for approval an \n     international agreement that would obligate the United States \n     to reduce or limit the Armed Forces or armaments of the \n     United States in a militarily significant manner only \n     pursuant to the treaty-making power as set forth in Article \n     II, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution of the United \n     States.\n       (13) Treaty interpretation.--The Senate affirms the \n     applicability to all treaties of the constitutionally-based \n     principles of treaty interpretation set forth in condition \n     (1) of the resolution of ratification of the INF Treaty, \n     approved by the Senate on May 27, 1988, and condition (8) of \n     the resolution of ratification of the CFE Flank Document, \n     approved by the Senate on May 14, 1997.\n       (14) Primacy of the united states constitution.--Nothing in \n     the Amended Mines Protocol requires or authorizes the \n     enactment of legislation, or the taking of any other action, \n     by the United States that is prohibited by the Constitution \n     of the United States, as interpreted by the United States.\n\n     SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this resolution:\n       (1) Amended mines protocol or protocol.--The terms \n     ``Amended Mines Protocol'' and ``Protocol'' mean the Amended \n     Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Mines, \n     Booby-Traps and Other Devices, together with its Technical \n     Annex, as adopted at Geneva on May 3, 1996 (contained in \n     Senate Treaty Document 105-1).\n       (2) CFE flank document.--The term ``CFE Flank Document'' \n     means the Document Agreed Among the States Parties to the \n     Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) of \n     November 19, 1990, done at Vienna on May 31, 1996 (Treaty \n     Document 105-5).\n       (3) Convention on Conventional Weapons.--The term \n     ``Convention on Conventional Weapons'' means the Convention \n     on Prohibitions or Restriction on the Use of Certain \n     Conventional Weapons Which May be Deemed to be Excessively \n     Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects, done at Geneva \n     on October 10, 1980 (Senate Treaty Document 103-25).\n       (4) Ottawa convention.--The term ``Ottawa Convention'' \n     means the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, \n     Production, Stockpiling, and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines \n     and on Their Destruction, opened for signature at Ottawa \n     December 3-4, 1997 and at the United Nations Headquarters \n     beginning December 5, 1997.\n       (5) United states instrument of ratification.--The term \n     ``United States instrument of ratification'' means the \n     instrument of ratification of the United States of the \n     Amended Mines Protocol.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12307-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second time by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Mack, and Mr. \n             Lieberman):\n       S. 2617.

A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to authorize the President \nto enter into agreements to provide regulatory credit for voluntary \nearly action to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n                  credit for early action act of 1998\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am proud to join with Senators Mack and \nLieberman today to introduce the Credit for Early Action Act of 1998. \nThis bipartisan legislation is designed to encourage voluntary, \nmeaningful, and early efforts by industry to reduce their emissions of \ngreenhouse gases. This is a bill to address the threat of global \nclimate change.\n  Before I get into the details of this legislative proposal, let me \nspend a few moments discussing the science of climate change.\n  Human influence on the global climate in an extraordinarily complex \nmatter that has undergone more than a century of research. Indeed, in \nan 1896 lecture delivered to the Stockholm Physics Society by the Nobel \nPrize-winning chemist, Svante Arrhenius, it was predicted that large \nincreases in carbon dioxide (CO2) would result in a \ncorresponding warming of the globe.\n  Professor Arrhenius was the first to predict that large increases in \nCO2 would result in a warming of the globe. What have the \nworld's scientists told\n\n[[Page S12310]]\n\nus at different intervals over the last one hundred years, since Mr. \nArrhenius identified the warming effects of CO2?\n  In 1924, a U.S. physicist speculated that industrial activity would \ndouble atmospheric CO2 in five hundred years, around the \nyear 2424. Current projections, however, call for a doubling sometime \nbefore 2050--some four hundred years earlier than predicted just \nseventy years ago!\n  In 1957, scientists from the Scripps Institute of Oceanography \nreported for the first time that much of the CO2 emitted \ninto the atmosphere is not absorbed by the oceans as some had argued, \nleaving significant amounts in the atmosphere. They are said to have \ncalled carbon dioxide emissions ``a large-scale geophysical \nexperiment'' with the Earth's climate.\n  In 1967, the first reliable computer simulation calculated that \nglobal average temperatures may increase by more than four degrees \nFahrenheit when atmospheric CO2 levels are double that of \npreindustrial times. In 1985, a conference sponsored by the United \nNations Environment Program (UNEP), the World Meteorological \nOrganization (WMO), and the International Council of Scientific Unions \nforged a consensus of the international scientific community on the \nissue of climate change. The conference report warned that some future \nwarming appears inevitable due to past emissions, regardless of future \nactions, and recommended consideration of a global treaty to address \nclimate change.\n  In 1987, an ice core from Antarctica, analyzed by French and Russian \nscientists, revealed an extremely close correlation between \nCO2 and temperature going back more than one hundred \nthousand years. In 1990, an appeal signed by forty-nine Novel prize \nwinners and seven hundred members of the National Academy of Science \nstated, ``There is broad agreement within the scientific community that \namplification of the Earth's natural greenhouse effect by the buildup \nof various gases introduced by human activity has the potential to \nproduce dramatic changes in climate . . . only by taking action now can \nbe ensure that future generations will not be put at risk.''\n  Also in 1990, seven hundred and forty-seven participants from one \nhundred sixteen countries took part in the Second world Climate \nConference. The conference statement reported that, ``. . . if the \nincrease of greenhouse gas concentrations is not limited, the predicted \nclimate change would place stresses on natural and social systems \nunprecedented in the past ten thousand years.''\n  Finally, Mr. President, in 1995, the Intergovernmental Panel on \nClimate Change, representing the consensus of climate scientists \nworldwide, concluded that ``. . . the balance of evidence suggests that \nthere is a discernible human influence on global climate.''\n  This last development is significant, because the overwhelming \nmajority of climate scientists concluded, for the first time, that man \nis influencing the global climate system. That conclusion, while \ncontroversial in some quarters, was endorsed unanimously by the \ngovernments of the ninety-six countries involved in the panel's \nefforts.\n  Are these forecasted outcomes a certainty? They are not. The \npredictions of climate change are indeed based on numerous variables. \nAlthough scientists are improving the state of their knowledge at a \nrapid pace, we still have a lot to learn about the role of the sun, \nclouds and oceans, for example.\n  The question is, will we ever have absolute certainty? Will we ever \nbe able to eliminate all of the variables? The overwhelming majority of \nindependent, peer-reviewed scientific studies indicate that we do not \nhave such a luxury. By the time we finally attain absolute certainty, \nit would likely take centuries to reverse atmospheric damage and \noceanic warming.\n  Mr. President, I am not alone in this thinking. There are an \nincreasing number of business leaders in our country who have arrived \nat the same conclusion that we need to act swiftly.\n  In a ``dear colleague'' letter sent out this week under my signature, \nI repeated a remarkable statement issued by an impressive group of \ncompanies that have joined with the newly established Pew Center on \nClimate Change. American Electric Power, Boeing, BP America, Enron, \nLockheed Martin, 3M, Sun, United Technologies, Toyota, Weyerhaeuser, \nand several others said that, ``we accept the views of most scientists \nthat enough is known about the science and environmental impacts of \nclimate change for us to take actions to address its consequences.''\n  The legislation to be introduced today by Senator Mack, Senator \nLieberman and I proposes an exciting framework that would appropriately \nrecognize real and immediate action to combat climate change. While the \nclimate debate will indeed continue over the next few years, we \nstrongly believe that there is a voluntary, incentive-based approach \nwhich can be implemented now. Congressional approval of this approach, \nwhich the three of us and others will work for early next year, will \nprovide the certainty necessary to encourage companies to move forward \nwith practical, near-term emission reductions.\n  Specifically, this legislation would provide a mechanism by which the \nPresident can enter into binding greenhouse gas reduction agreements \nwith entities operating in the United States. Once executed, these \nagreements will provide credits for voluntary greenhouse gas reductions \neffected by those entities before 2008, or whenever we might have an \nimposition of any domestic or international emission reduction \nrequirements.\n  Importantly, this program is designed to work within the framework of \nwhatever greenhouse gas control requirement may eventually become \napplicable within the United States. The credits would be usable \nbeginning in the first five-year budget period (2008-2012) under the \nKyoto Protocol, if the Kyoto Protocol is ratified. If the Protocol is \nnot ratified, and we end up with a domestic program to regulate or \notherwise control greenhouse gas emissions, the credits would be usable \nin that program.\n  This sort of approach makes sense for a wide variety of reasons. \nEncouraging early reductions can begin to slow the rate of buildup of \ngreenhouse gases in the atmosphere, helping to minimize the \npotential environmental risks of continued warming. Given the longevity \nof many climate gases, which continue to trap heat in the atmosphere \nfor a century or more, it just makes sense to encourage practical \nactions now.\n\n  By guaranteeing companies credit for voluntary early reductions, the \nbill would allow companies to protect themselves against the potential \nfor steep reduction requirements or excessive costs in the future. For \ncompanies that want to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, providing \ncredit for action now adds years to any potential compliance schedule, \nallowing companies to spread costs over broader time periods. A focus \non early reductions can help stimulate the American search for \nstrategies an technologies that are needed worldwide. Development of \nsuch strategies and technologies can improve American competitiveness \nin the $300 billion dollar global environmental marketplace.\n  This ``credit'' program may also make the greenhouse gas reductions \nachieved before regulations are in place financially valuable to the \ncompanies who make such reductions. Given the likely inclusion of \nmarket based approaches to any eventual domestic regulatory \nrequirements, similar to the successful acid rain program of the 1990 \nClean Air Act, credit earned could be traded or sold to help other \ncompanies manage their own reduction efforts.\n  Under a ``no credit'' approach, the status quo, it is more likely \nthat early reduction companies will be penalized if greenhouse gas \nreductions are ultimately required, because their competitors who wait \nto reduce will get credit for later reductions. Such a ``no credit'' \napproach could even create perverse incentives to delay investments \nuntil emissions reductions would be credited.\n  In anticipation of a potential global emissions market, decisions re \nbeing made now by entrepreneurial companies and countries. For example, \nRussia and Japan have already concluded a trade of greenhouse gas \nemission credits. Private companies such as Niagara-Mohawk and Canada-\nbased Suncor are moving forward with cross-boundary trades. Aggressive \nglobal energy companies, such as British Petroleum, AEP, and PacifiCorp \nare already implementing agreements in Central and\n\n[[Page S12311]]\n\nSouth America--sequestering carbon and developing credits against \nemissions--by protecting rain forests.\n  Mr. President, America can and should reward companies that take such \npositive steps to position themselves, and the US, for the \nenvironmental and economic future.\n  On the international side, passage by the U.S. Congress of a program \nto help stimulate early action will be clear example of American \nleadership and responsibility. Developing countries currently argue \nthat nations such as the United States, with huge advantages in quality \nof life and dramatically higher per capita emissions of green house \ngases, should take a leadership role in the reduction of greenhouse gas \nemissions. And they argue that developing countries should not be asked \nto take steps until the U.S. begins to move forward. This bill can work \ndirectly to change that situation, therefore removing a barrier to \nessential developing country progress.\n  There it is, Mr. President. We are here today because we believe that \nclimate change presents a serious threat. We believe it makes sense to \nget started now. And, as many leading American companies do, we believe \nthat there are sensible, fair and voluntary methods to get on the right \ntrack.\n  We encourage our colleagues to use the time between now and next \nJanuary to review this legislation carefully. We are open to \nsuggestions. Most importantly, we are looking for others to join us in \nthis effort.\n  Ms. MACK. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of the \nCredit for Early Action Act, I rise to congratulate Senator Chafee on \nits introduction, as well as the other original cosponsor, Senator \nLieberman, and to make several points about the bill.\n  The purpose of the act is simple. It is to encourage and reward \nvoluntary actions which businesses may take to reduce emissions of \n``greenhouse gases'' such as carbon dioxide. It would not require \nactions, but it would provide encouragement in the form of credit, \ncredit that could be used by companies to manage future regulatory \nrequirements, or in a market-based approach, traded or sold to other \ncompanies as they worked to meet their own obligations.\n  Given the uncertainty that surrounds the discussion of greenhouse \ngases and global warming, I can understand why some may question the \nneed for such a bill. As one who is not convinced that we understand \nthis issue well enough, I can understand that question. In fact, it is \nprecisely because of the uncertainty that I think such a bill makes \nsense.\n  Of course there is a great deal of uncertainty surrounding such \npossible results, and frankly, as I said, I am not convinced that we \nknow enough yet. The complexities and uncertainties associated with \ntrying to understand the vast interactions of our climate, our \natmosphere and our human impact on both, are enormous. And the \nconsequences of actions targeted at changing our patterns of energy use \ncan be dramatic.\n  But uncertainty cuts two ways, and the possibility always exists that \nsome of these projections about impacts could be more right than wrong. \nPerhaps then it makes sense to provide some appropriate encouragement, \nso that those who want to invest in improved efficiency, those who want \nto find ways to make cars and factories and power production cleaner, \nthose companies can receive some encouragement, not based on government \nfiat or handout, but based on getting credit for their own initiative \nand actions. The environmental result will likely be some lessening of \nthe potential problems associated with possible global warming, and \nthat just makes sense.\n  There is, of course, another uncertainty that gives me pause as well, \nand that serves as another strong reason for my interest in this bill. \nIt is clear to me today that there is no desire on the part of this \nCongress to legislate requirements on carbon dioxide or any of the \nother ``greenhouse gases.'' I think that is the correct position.\n  But we cannot know today what some future Congress, perhaps a decade \naway, might decide to do. Perhaps the science will become more \ncompelling. Perhaps the majority will shift back to a more regulatory \nminded party. Perhaps a future Senate will decide to ratify the Kyoto \nProtocol. Perhaps a future administration and a future majority will \ncombine to put a regulatory structure in place that will require \nsubstantial reductions of these gases. And while we may oppose such \naction today, we cannot know the outcome of this future debate.\n  Given this regulatory uncertainty, I think a compelling argument can \nbe made to provide protection for companies today, so that they are \nprotected against the possibility of future requirements. What this \nbill will do is just that. By allowing companies to earn credit for \nactions that they take over the next few years, the bill will make sure \nthat if a regulator comes to see them in the future, they can say, ``I \nalready did my part.'' Companies can make decisions based on their own \nbest interest, they can work to improve efficiency and reduce waste. \nAnd if this bill becomes law, they can get credit for those actions \nagainst any future regulatory controls on greenhouse gases. That seems \nlike a good idea to me.\n  In closing Mr. President, I again want to congratulate Senator \nChafee, along with our other original co-sponsor Senator Lieberman, for \nthis thoughtful, balanced approach to the uncertainty presented by the \nclimate change issue. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this \nbill, and I want to urge my colleagues to take a good look at this \napproach so that we can begin to move forward in earnest in the next \nCongress.\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am delighted to join today \nwith my colleagues Senator Chafee, the chairman of the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, and Senator Mack in introducing this \nlegislation. It will provide credit, under any future greenhouse gas \nreduction systems we may adopt, to companies who act now to reduce \ntheir emissions of greenhouse gases. This is a voluntary, market-based \napproach which is a win-win situation for both American businesses and \nthe environment. Enactment of this legislation will provide the \ncertainty necessary to encourage companies to move forward with \nemission reductions now. I'm particularly pleased that the legislation \ngrows out of principles developed in a dialog between the Environmental \nDefense Fund and a number of major industries.\n  The point of this legislation is simple. Many companies want to move \nforward now to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. They don't want \nto wait until legislation requires them to make these reductions. For \nsome companies reducing greenhouse gases makes good economic sense \nbecause adopting cost-effective solutions can actually save them money \nby improving the efficiency of their operations. Companies recognize if \nthey reduce their greenhouse gas emissions now they will be able to add \nyears to any potential compliance schedule, allowing companies to \nspread their costs over broader time periods. Acting now can help U.S. \ncompanies protect themselves against the potential for significant \nreductions that may be required in the future. This bill ensures they \nwill be credited in future reduction proposals for action now.\n  Early action by U.S. companies will also have an enormous benefit for \nthe environment. Early reductions can begin to slow the rate of buildup \nof greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, helping to minimize the \nenvironmental risks of continued global warming. Given that once \nemitted, many climate change gases continue to trap head for a century \nor more in the atmosphere, it just makes sense to encourage practical \naction now.\n  Climate change is neither an abstraction nor the object of a science \nfiction writer's imagination. It is real and affects us all. More than \n2,500 of the world's best scientific and technical experts have linked \nthe increase of greenhouse gases to at least some of the increase in \nsea level, temperature and rainfall experienced worldwide in this \ncentury. Last year was the warmest year on record, and 9 of the last 11 \nyears were among the warmest ever recorded.\n  The point of this legislation is to provide an incentive for \ncompanies that want to make voluntary early reduction in emissions of \ngreenhouse gases by guaranteeing that these companies will receive \ncredit, once binding requirements begin, for voluntary reductions they \nhave made before 2008. These\n\n[[Page S12312]]\n\ncredits will enable US companies to add years to any potential \ncompliance schedule for reductions, allowing them to spread costs over \nbroader time periods. These credits may also be financially valuable to \ncompanies who make the reductions. Credits earned likely could be \ntraded or sold to help other companies manage their own reduction \nrequirements. A focus on early reductions can also help stimulate the \nsearch for and use of new, innovative strategies and technologies that \nare needed to help companies both in this country and worldwide meet \ntheir reduction requirements in a cost-effective manner. Development of \nsuch strategies and technologies can improve American competitiveness \nin the more than $300 billion global environmental marketplace.\n  I'm pleased that this legislation builds on section 1605(b) of the \nEnergy Policy Act which allowed companies to voluntarily record their \nemissions in greenhouse gas emissions, which I worked hard to include \nin the Energy Policy Act.\n  Mr. President, the debate about climate change is too often vested--\nand I believe wrongly so--in false choices between scientific findings, \ncommon sense, business investments and environmental awareness. The \napproach of this bill again demonstrates that these are not mutually \nexclusive choices, but highly compatible goals.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCain. \n  S. 2618. a bill to require certain multilateral development banks and \nother leading institutions to implement independent third party \nprocurement monitoring, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n\n\n          THE FAIR COMPETITION IN FOREIGN COMMERCE ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce the Fair \nCompetition in Foreign Commerce Act of 1998, to address the serious \nproblem of waste, fraud and abuse, resulting from bribery and \ncorruption in international development projects. This legislation will \nset conditions for U.S. funding through multilateral development banks. \nThese conditions will require the country receiving aid to adopt \nsubstantive procurement reforms, and independent third-party \nprocurement monitoring of their international development projects.\n  During the cold war, banks and governments often looked the other way \nas pro-western leaders in developing countries treated national \ntreasuries as their personal treasure troves. Information technologies \nand the resulting global economy have transformed the world in which we \nlive into a smaller and smaller community. For example, economic \nturmoil in Indonesia hits home on Wall Street. Allegations of \nmisconduct in the White House negatively impact Wall Street, which \ncauses capital flight to other nation's stock exchanges. In today's \nincreasingly interdependent global economy, nations are ill-advised to \nignore corruption and wrongdoing in neighboring countries.\n  The U.S. is a vital part of the global economy. We cannot afford to \nlook the other way when we see bribery and corruption running rampant \nin other countries. Bribery and corruption abroad undermine the U.S. \ngoals of promoting democracy and accountability, fostering economic \ndevelopment and trade liberalization, and achieving a level playing \nfield throughout the world for American businesses. Developing nations \ndesperately need foreign economic assistance to break the devastating \ncycle of poverty and dependence.\n  The United States is increasingly called upon to lead multilateral \nassistance efforts through its participation in various lending \ninstitutions. However, it is critical that we take steps to ensure that \nthe American taxpayer dollars are being used appropriately. The Fair \nCompetition in Foreign Commerce Act of 1998 is designed to decrease the \nstifling effects of bribery and corruption in international development \ncontracts. The Act will achieve this objective by mandating that \nmultilateral lending institutions require that nations receiving U.S. \neconomic assistance subject their international development projects to \nindependent third-party procurement monitoring, and other substantive \nprocurement reforms.\n  By decreasing bribery and corruption in international development \nprocurements, this legislation will (1) enable U.S. businesses to \nbecome more competitive when bidding against foreign firms which secure \ngovernment contracts through bribery and corruption; (2) encourage \nadditional direct investment to developing nations, thus increasing \ntheir economic growth, and (3) increase opportunities for U.S. \nbusinesses to export to these nations as their economies expand and \nmature.\n  Multilateral lending efforts are only effective in spurring economic \ndevelopment if the funds are used to further the intended development \nprojects. The American taxpayers make substantial contributions to the \nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the \nInternational Development Association, the International Finance \nCorporation, the Inter-American Development Bank, the International \nMonetary Fund, the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American \nInvestment Corporation, the North American Development Bank, and the \nAfrican Development Fund. These contributions provide significant \nfunding for major international development projects. Unfortunately, \nthese international development projects are often plagued by fraud and \ncorruption, waste and inefficiency, and other misuse of funding.\n  This inefficient use of valuable taxpayer dollars is bad for the U.S. \nand the nation receiving the economic assistance. When used for its \nintended purpose, foreign economic aid yields short and long term \nbenefits to U.S. businesses. Direct foreign aid assists developing \nnations to develop their infrastructure. A developed infrastructure is \nvital to creating and sustaining a modern dynamic economy. Robust new \neconomies create new markets for U.S. businesses to export their goods \nand services. Exports are key to the U.S. role in the constantly \nexpanding and increasingly competitive global economy. Emerging \neconomies of today become our trading partners of tomorrow. However, \nforeign economic assistance will only promote economic development if \nit is used for its intended purpose, and not to line the pockets of \nforeign bureaucrats and their well-connected political allies.\n  The current laws and procedures designed to detect and deter \ncorruption after the fact are inadequate and meaningless. This bill \nseeks to ensure that U.S. taxpayers' hard-earned dollars contributed to \ninternational projects are used appropriately, by detecting and \neliminating bribery and corruption before they can taint the integrity \nof these vital international projects. Past experience illustrates that \nit is ineffective to attempt to reverse waste, fraud, and abuse in \nlarge scale foreign infrastructure projects, once the abuse has already \nbegun. Therefore, it is vital to detect the abuses before they occur.\n  The Fair Competition in Foreign Commerce Act of 1998 requires the \nUnited States Government, through its participation in the multilateral \nlending institutions and in its disbursement of non-humanitarian \nforeign assistance funds, to: (1) require the recipient international \nfinancial institution to adopt an anti-corruption plan that requires \nthe aid recipient to use independent third-party procurement monitoring \nservices, at each stage of the procurement process, to ensure openness \nand transparency in government procurements, and (2) to require the \nrecipient nation to institute specific strategies for minimizing \ncorruption and maximizing transparency in procurements at each stage of \nthe procurement process.\n  If these criteria are not met, the legislation directs the Secretary \nof the Treasury to instruct the United States Executive Directors of \nthe various International Development Banks to use the voice and vote \nof the United States to oppose the lending institution from providing \nthe funds to the nations requesting economic aid which do not satisfy \nthe procurement reforms criteria. This Act has two important \nexceptions. First, it does not apply to assistance to meet urgent \nhumanitarian needs such as providing food, medicine, disaster, and \nrefugee relief. Second, it also permits the President to waive the \nfunding restrictions with respect to a particular country if making \nsuch funds available is important to the national security interest of \nthe United States.\n\n[[Page S12313]]\n\n  Independent third-party procurement monitoring is a system where an \nindependent third-party conducts a program to eliminate bias, to \npromote transparency and open competition, and to minimize fraud and \ncorruption, waste and inefficiency and other misuse of funds in \ninternational procurements. The system does this through an independent \nevaluation of the technical, financial, economic and legal aspects of \neach stage of a procurement, from the development and issuance of \ntechnical specifications, bidding documents, evaluation reports and \ncontract preparation, to the delivery of goods and services. This \nmonitoring will take place throughout the entire term of the \ninternational development project.\n  Mr. President, this system has worked for other governments. \nProcurement reforms and third-party procurement monitoring resulted in \nthe governments of Kenya, Uganda, Colombia, and Guatemala experiencing \nsignificant cost savings in recent procurements. For instance, the \nGovernment of Guatemala experienced an overall savings of 48% when it \nadopted a third-party procurement monitoring system, and other \nprocurement reform measures, in a recent procurement of \npharmaceuticals.\n  Independent third-party procurement monitoring is effective because \nit monitors each stage of the procurement process during and prior to \neach stage's completion, as opposed to following completion of a \nparticular stage of the procurement process. Independent third-party \nprocurement monitoring also improves transparency and openness in the \nprocurement process. Increased transparency helps to minimize fraud and \ncorruption, waste and inefficiency, and other misuse of funding, and \npromotes competition, thereby strengthening international trade and \nforeign commerce.\n  Mr. President, bribery and corruption have many victims. Bribery and \ncorruption hamper vital U.S. interests. Both harm consumers, taxpayers, \nand honest traders who lose contracts, production, and profits because \nthey refuse to offer bribes to secure foreign contracts. Bribery and \ncorruption have become a serious problem. A World Bank survey of 3,600 \nfirms in 69 countries showed 40% of businesses paying bribes. More \nstartling is that Germany still permits its companies to take a tax \ndeduction for bribes. A recent comment by Commerce Secretary Daley sums \nup the serious impact of bribery and corruption upon American \nbusinesses ability to compete for foreign contracts:\n\n       Since mid-1994, foreign firms have used bribery to win \n     approximately 180 commercial contracts valued at nearly $80 \n     billion. We estimate that over the past year, American \n     companies have lost at least 50 of these contracts, valued at \n     $15 billion. And since many of these contracts were for \n     groundbreaking projects--the kind that produces exports for \n     years to come--the ultimate cost could be much higher.''\n\n  Exports will continue to play an increasing role in our continued \neconomic expansion. We can ill afford to allow any artificial \nimpediments to our ability to export. Bribery and corruption, \nsignificantly hinder American businesses' ability to compete for \nlucrative overseas government contracts. American businesses are simply \nnot competitive when bidding against foreign firms that have bribed \ngovernment officials to secure overseas government contracts. Greater \nopenness and fairness in government procurement will greatly enhance \nopportunities to compete in the rapidly expanding global economy. \nExports equate to jobs. Jobs equate to more money in hard-working \nAmericans' pockets. More money in Americans' pockets means more money \nfor Americans to save and invest in their futures.\n  Bribery and corruption also harm the country receiving the aid \nbecause bribery and corruption often inflate the cost of international \ndevelopment projects. For example, state sponsorship of massive \ninfrastructure projects that are deliberately beyond the required \nspecification needed to meet the objective is a common example of \nwaste, fraud, and abuse inherent in corrupt procurement practices. \nHere, the cost of corruption is not the amount of the bribe itself, but \nthe inefficient use of resources the bribes encourage.\n  Bribery and corruption have short and long term negative effects upon \nthe nation receiving aid. The short term effect is that bribery and \ncorruption drive up the cost of the infrastructure project. Companies \nare forced to increase prices to cover the cost of bribes they are \nforced to pay. A 2% bribe on a contract is said to raise costs by 15%. \nThe aggregate or long term effect of this type of corruption is that, \nover time, tax revenues will have to be raised or diverted from other \nmore deserving projects to fund the excesses in these projects. Higher \ntaxes and the inefficient use of resources both hinder growth.\n  The World Bank and the IMF both recognize the link between bribery \nand corruption, and decreased economic growth. Recent studies also \nindicate that high levels of corruption are associated with low levels \nof investment and growth. These studies illustrate that corruption \ndiscourages direct investment, which results in decreased economic \ngrowth. Furthermore, corruption lessens the effectiveness of industrial \npolicies and encourages businesses to operate in the unofficial sector \nin violation of tax and regulatory laws. Most important, corruption \nbegins a cycle where corruption breeds more corruption and discourages \nlegitimate investment. In short, bribery and corruption create ``lose \nlose'' situation for the U.S. and developing nations.\n  The U.S. recognizes the damaging effects bribery and corruption have \nat home and abroad. The U.S. continues to combat foreign corruption, \nwaste, and abuse on many fronts: from prohibiting U.S. firms from \nbribing foreign officials, to leading the anti-corruption efforts in \nthe United Nations, the Organization of American States, and the \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development (``OECD''). The \nU.S. was the first country to enact legislation (the Foreign Corrupt \nPractices Act) to prohibit its nationals and corporations from bribing \nforeign public officials in international and business transactions.\n  However, we must do more. Our current efforts must expand. The FCPA \nprevents U.S. nationals and corporations from bribing foreign \nofficials. It does nothing to prevent foreign nationals and \ncorporations from bribing foreign officials to obtain foreign \ncontracts. Valuable taxpayer resources are often diverted or squandered \nbecause of corrupt officials or the use of non-transparent \nspecifications, contract requirements and the like in international \nprocurements for goods and services. Such corrupt practices also \nminimize competition and prevent the recipient nation or agency from \nreceiving the full value of the goods and services for which it \nbargained. In addition, despite the importance of international markets \nto U.S. goods and services providers, many U.S. companies refuse to \nparticipate in international procurements that may be corrupt.\n  This legislation is designed to provide a mechanism to ensure, to the \nextent possible, the integrity of the U.S. contribution to the \nmultilateral lending institutions and other non-humanitarian U.S. \nforeign aid. Corrupt international procurements, often funded by these \nmultilateral banks, weaken democratic institutions and undermine the \nvery opportunities that multilateral lending institutions were founded \nto promote. This bill will encourage and support the development of \ntransparent government procurement capacity, which is vital for \nemerging democracies constructing a government procurement \ninfrastructure that can sustain market economies in the developing \nworld.\n  Mr. President, I am committed to combating the waste, fraud and abuse \nresulting from bribery and corruption in international development \nprojects. Procurement reforms and independent procurement monitoring \nare key to policing complicated international procurements, which are \noften plagued by corruption, inefficiency and other problems. These \nproblems thwart the economic development purpose of multilateral \nassistance and make it more difficult for U.S. companies to compete for \nvaluable large-scale international development projects.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the millions of Americans who will \nbenefit from increased opportunities for U.S. businesses to participate \nin the global economy, and the billions of people in developing nations \nthroughout the world who are desperate for economic assistance, I urge \nmy colleagues to support this legislation and demonstrate their \ncontinued commitment to the orderly evolution of the global economy\n\n[[Page S12314]]\n\nand the efficient use of American economic assistance.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2618\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Competition in Foreign \n     Commerce Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) The United States makes substantial contributions and \n     provides significant funding for major international \n     development projects through the International Bank for \n     Reconstruction and Development, the International Development \n     Association, the International Finance Corporation, the \n     Inter-American Development Bank, the International Monetary \n     Fund, the Asian Development Bank, the Inter-American \n     Investment Corporation, the North American Development Bank, \n     the African Development Fund, and other multilateral lending \n     institutions.\n       (2) These international development projects are often \n     plagued with fraud, corruption, waste, inefficiency, and \n     misuse of funding.\n       (3) Fraud, corruption, waste, inefficiency, misuse, and \n     abuse are major impediments to competition in foreign \n     commerce throughout the world.\n       (4) Identifying these impediments after they occur is \n     inadequate and meaningless.\n       (5) Detection of impediments before they occur helps to \n     ensure that valuable United States resources contributed to \n     important international development projects are used \n     appropriately.\n       (6) Independent third-party procurement monitoring is an \n     important tool for detecting and preventing such impediments.\n       (7) Third-party procurement monitoring includes evaluations \n     of each stage of the procurement process and assures the \n     openness and transparency of the process.\n       (8) Improving transparency and openness in the procurement \n     process helps to minimize fraud, corruption, waste, \n     inefficiency, and other misuse of funding, and promotes \n     competition, thereby strengthening international trade and \n     foreign commerce.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to build on the \n     excellent progress associated with the Organization on \n     Economic Development and Cooperation Agreement on Bribery and \n     Corruption, by requiring the use of independent third-party \n     procurement monitoring as part of the United States \n     participation in multilateral development banks and other \n     lending institutions and in the disbursement of \n     nonhumanitarian foreign assistance funds.\n\n     SEC. 3.

EXCEPTIONS.\n\n       (a) National Security Interest.--Section 4 shall not apply \n     with respect to a country if the President determines with \n     such respect to such country that making funds available is \n     important to the national security interest of the United \n     States. Any such determination shall cease to be effective 6 \n     months after being made unless the President determines that \n     its continuation is important to the national security \n     interest of the United States.\n       (b) Other Exceptions.--Section 4 shall not apply with \n     respect to assistance to--\n       (1) meet urgent humanitarian needs (including providing \n     food, medicine, disaster, and refugee relief);\n       (2) facilitate democratic political reform and rule of law \n     activities;\n       (3) create private sector and nongovernmental organizations \n     that are independent of government control; and\n       (4) facilitate development of a free market economic \n     system.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DASCHLE:\n  S. 2619. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve \naccess of veterans to emergency medical care in non-Department of \nVeterans Affairs medical facilities; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n\n\n       The Veterans' Access to Emergency Health Care Act of 1998\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as we near the end of the 105th Congress, \nI would again like to voice my frustration about the fact that the \nUnited States Senate failed to consider and pass important legislation \nthis year that could have greatly benefited the American people. \nUnfortunately, the highway leading to adjournment is littered with \nlegislation that should have been considered, passed and enacted long \nago, including efforts to prevent teen smoking, modernize our public \nschools, and increase the minimum wage.\n  I am particularly disappointed that my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle prevented the United States Senate from considering \nmanaged care reform legislation. Yesterday, Senate Republicans even \nprevented us from proceeding to their own HMO reform bill. Time and \nagain, the American people have said they want a comprehensive, \nenforceable Patients' Bill of Rights. Toward that goal, several of my \nDemocratic colleagues and I introduced the Patients' Bill of Rights Act \nof 1998. That legislation addressed a growing concern among the \nAmerican people about the quality of care delivered by health \nmaintenance organizations. Despite enormous public support for HMO \nreform, Democratic efforts to consider the Patients' Bill of Rights \nwere stymied at every turn.\n  For months, it has been my intention to offer an amendment to the HMO \nreform legislation regarding a serious deficiency in veterans' access \nto emergency health care. I was prepared to do so yesterday. Since the \nSenate was again precluded from debating managed care reform, however, \nI would like to call attention to this matter before the 105th Congress \nadjourns by introducing the Veterans' Access to Emergency Health Care \nAct of 1998 as a separate bill. I hope my colleagues will\n\n[[Page S12315]]\n\nsupport this legislation when I introduce it again in the 106th \nCongress, when I am confident the United States Senate will finally \nhave the opportunity to consider meaningful HMO reform legislation.\n  The problem addressed in this bill stems from the fact that veterans \nwho rely on the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) for health care \noften do not receive reimbursement for emergency medical care they \nreceive at non-VA facilities. According to the VA, veterans may only be \nreimbursed by the VA for emergency care at a non-VA facility that was \nnot pre-authorized if all of the following criteria are met:\n  First, care must have been rendered for a medical emergency of such \nnature that any delay would have been life-threatening; second, the VA \nor other federal facilities must not have been feasibly available; and, \nthird, the treatment must have been rendered for a service-connected \ndisability, a condition associated with a service-connected disability, \nor for any disability of a veteran who has a 100-percent service-\nconnected disability.\n  Many veterans who receive emergency health care at non-VA facilities \nare able to meet the first two criteria. Unless they are 100-percent \ndisabled, however, they generally fail to meet the third criterion \nbecause they have suffered heart attacks or other medical emergencies \nthat were unrelated to their service-connected disabilities. \nConsidering the enormous costs associated with emergency health care, \ncurrent law has been financially and emotionally devastating to \ncountless veterans with limited income and no other health insurance. \nThe bottom line is that veterans are forced to pay for emergency care \nout of their own pockets until they can be stabilized and transferred \nto VA facilities.\n  During medical emergencies, veterans often do not have a say about \nwhether they should be taken to a VA or non-VA medical center. Even \nwhen they specifically ask to be taken to a VA facility, emergency \nmedical personnel often transport them to a nearby hospital instead \nbecause it is the closest facility. In many emergencies, that is the \nonly sound medical decision to make. It is simply unfair to penalize \nveterans for receiving emergency medical care at non-VA facilities. \nVeterans were asked to make enormous sacrifices for this county, and we \nshould not turn our backs on them during their time of need.\n  There should be no misunderstanding. This is a widespread problem \nthat affects countless veterans in South Dakota and throughout the \ncountry. I would like to cite just three examples of veterans being \ndenied reimbursement for emergency care at non-VA facilities in western \nSouth Dakota.\n  The first involves Edward Sanders, who is a World War II veteran from \nCuster, South Dakota. On March 6, 1994, Edward was taken to the \nhospital in Custer because he was suffering chest pains. He was \nmonitored for several hours before a doctor at the hospital called the \nVA Medical Center in Hot Springs and indicated that Edward was in need \nof emergency services. Although Edward asked repeatedly to be taken to \na VA facility, he was transported by ambulance to Rapid City Regional \nHospital, where he underwent a cardiac catheterization and coronary \nartery bypass grafting. Because the emergency did not meet the criteria \nI mentioned previously, the VA did not reimburse Edward for the care he \nreceived at Rapid City Regional. His medical bills totaled more than \n$50,000.\n  On May 17, 1997, John Lind suffered a heart attack while he was at \nwork. John is a Vietnam veteran exposed to Agent Orange who served his \ncountry for 14 years until he was discharged in 1981. John lives in \nRapid City, South Dakota, and he points out that he would have asked to \nbe taken to the VA Medical Center in Fort Meade for care, but he was \nsemi-unconscious, and emergency medical personnel transported him to \nRapid City Regional. After 4 days in the non-VA facility, John incurred \nnearly $20,000 in medical bills. Although he filed a claim with the VA \nfor reimbursement, he was turned down because the emergency was not \nrelated to his service-connected disability.\n  Just over one month later, Delmer Paulson, a veteran from Quinn, \nSouth Dakota, suffered a heart attack on June 26, 1997. Since he had no \nother health care insurance, he asked to be taken to the VA Medical \nCenter in Fort Meade. Again, despite his request, the emergency medical \npersonnel transported him to Rapid City Regional. Even though Delmer \nwas there for just over a day before being transferred to Fort Meade, \nhe was charged with almost a $20,000 medical bill. Again, the VA \nrefused to reimburse Delmer for the unauthorized medical care because \nthe emergency did not meet VA criteria.\n  The Veterans' Access to Emergency Health Care Act of 1998, which I am \nintroducing today, would address this serious problem. It would \nauthorize the VA to reimburse veterans enrolled in the VA health care \nsystem for the cost of emergency care or services received in non-VA \nfacilities when there is ``a serious threat to the life or health of a \nveteran.'' Rep. Lane Evans has introduced identical legislation in \nHouse of Representatives.\n  Although I am extremely disappointed that the United States Senate \ndid not debate meaningful managed care reform legislation this year, I \nam hopeful the American people will continue to urge their elected \nrepresentatives to pass a comprehensive, enforceable Patients' Bill of \nRights early next year. I am equally hopeful that any meaningful HMO \nreform legislation will address this serious deficiency in veterans' \naccess to emergency health care. I look forward to continuing to work \nwith my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that veterans \nreceive the health care they deserve.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2619\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nestablish a National Clean Water Trust Fund and to authorize the \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to use amounts in \nthe Fund to carry out projects to promote the recovery of waters of the \nUnited States\n\n[[Page S12316]]\n\nfrom damage resulting from violations of that act, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n              National Clean Water Trust Fund Act of 1998\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill that will \nhelp clean up and restore our nation's waters. This bill, the National \nClean Water Trust Fund Act of 1998, creates a trust fund from fines, \npenalties and other monies collected through enforcement of the Clean \nWater Act. The money deposited into the National Clean Water Trust Fund \nwould be used to address the pollution problems that initiated those \nenforcement actions.\n  Last year, a highly publicized case in Virginia illustrated the need \nfor this legislation. On August 8, 1997, U.S. District Court Judge \nRebecca Smith issued a $12.6 million judgement, the largest fine ever \nlevied for violations of the Clean Water Act, against Smithfield Foods, \nIsle of Wright County, Virginia, for polluting the James River. The \nJudge wrote in her opinion that the civil penalty imposed on Smithfield \nshould be directed toward the restoration of the Pagan and James \nRivers, tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay. Unfortunately, due to \ncurrent federal budget laws, the court had no discretion over the \ndamages, and the fine was deposited into the Treasury's general fund, \ndefeating the very spirit of the Clean Water Act.\n  Today, there is no guarantee that fines or other money levied against \nparties who violate provisions in the Clean Water Act will be used to \ncorrect water problems. Instead, some, if not all, of the money is \ndirected into the general fund of the U.S. Treasury with no provision \nthat it be used to improve the quality of our water. While the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's enforcement activities are extracting \nlarge sums of money from industry and others through enforcement of the \nClean Water Act, we ignore the fundamental issue of how to pay for \nclean up and restoration of pollution problems for which the penalties \nwere levied. To ensure the successful implementation of the Clean Water \nAct, we should put these enforcement funds to work and actually clean \nup our nation's waters.\n  This legislation will establish a National Clean Water Trust Fund \nwithin the U.S. Treasury to earmark fines, penalties, and other funds, \nincluding consent decrees, obtained through enforcement of the Clean \nWater Act that would otherwise be placed into the Treasury's general \nfund. Within the provisions of the bill, the EPA Administrator would be \nauthorized, with direct consultation from the states, to prioritize and \ncarry out projects to restore and recover waters of the United States \nusing the funds collected from violations of the Clean Water Act. This \nlegislation, however, would not preempt citizen suits or in any way \npreclude EPA's authority to undertake and complete supplemental \nenvironmental projects as part of settlements related to violations of \nthe Clean Water Act and/or other legislation. The bill also provides \ncourt discretion over civil penalties from Clean Water Act violations \nto be used to carry out mitigation and restoration projects. With this \nlegislation, we can avoid another predicament like the one faced in \nVirginia.\n  Mr. President, it only makes sense that fines occurring from \nviolations of the Clean Water Act be used to clean up and restore the \nwaters that were damaged. This bill provides a real opportunity to \nimprove the quality of our nation's waters.\n  I recognize that no action can be taken on this legislation this \nsession. I introduce it today in order to give my colleagues, the \nAdministration and others an opportunity to examine the ideas contained \nin the legislation. I will introduce this legislation early in the next \nCongress and hope we can include it in the reauthorization of the Clean \nWater Act when it is taken up next year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2620\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Clean Water Trust \n     Fund Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. NATIONAL CLEAN WATER TRUST FUND.\n\n       Section 309 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 \n     U.S.C. 1319) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(h) National Clean Water Trust Fund.--\n       ``(1) Establishment.--There is established in the Treasury \n     a National Clean Water Trust Fund (referred to in this \n     subsection as the `Fund') consisting of amounts transferred \n     to the Fund under paragraph (2) and amounts credited to the \n     Fund under paragraph (3).\n       ``(2) Transfer of amounts.--For fiscal year 1998, and each \n     fiscal year thereafter, the Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     transfer to the Fund an amount determined by the Secretary to \n     be equal to the total amount deposited in the general fund of \n     the Treasury in the preceding fiscal year from fines, \n     penalties, and other funds obtained through enforcement \n     actions conducted pursuant to this section and section \n     505(a)(1), including any amounts obtained under consent \n     decrees and excluding any amounts ordered to be used to carry \n     out mitigation projects under this section or section 505(a).\n       ``(3) Investment of amounts.--\n       ``(A) In general.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     invest in interest-bearing obligations of the United States \n     such portion of the Fund as is not, in the Secretary's \n     judgment, required to meet current withdrawals.\n       ``(B) Administration.--The obligations shall be acquired \n     and sold and interest on, and the proceeds from the sale or \n     redemption of, the obligations shall be credited to the Fund \n     in accordance with section 9602 of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986.\n       ``(4) Use of amounts for remedial projects.--Amounts in the \n     Fund shall be available, as provided in appropriations Acts, \n     to the Administrator to carry out projects to restore and \n     recover waters of the United States from damage resulting \n     from violations of this Act that are subject to enforcement \n     actions under this section and similar damage resulting from \n     the discharge of pollutants into the waters of the United \n     States.\n       ``(5) Selection of projects.--\n       ``(A) Priority.--In selecting projects to carry out under \n     this subsection, the Administrator shall give priority to a \n     project to promote the recovery of waters of the United \n     States from damage described in paragraph (4), if an \n     enforcement action conducted pursuant to this section or \n     section 505(a)(1) with respect to the violation, or another \n     violation of this Act in the same administrative region of \n     the Environmental Protection Agency as the violation, \n     resulted in amounts being deposited in the general fund of \n     the Treasury.\n       ``(B) Consultation with states.--In selecting projects to \n     carry out under this section, the Administrator shall consult \n     with States in which the Administrator is considering \n     carrying out a project.\n       ``(C) Allocation of amounts.--In determining an amount to \n     allocate to carry out a project to restore and recover waters \n     of the United States from damage described in paragraph (4), \n     the Administrator shall, in the case of a priority project \n     described in subparagraph (A), take into account the total \n     amount deposited in the general fund of the Treasury as a \n     result of enforcement actions conducted with respect to the \n     violation pursuant to this section or section 505(a)(1).\n       ``(6) Implementation.--The Administrator may carry out a \n     project under this subsection directly or by making grants \n     to, or entering into contracts with, another Federal agency, \n     a State agency, a political subdivision of a State, or any \n     other public or private entity.\n       ``(7) Report to congress.--Not later than 1 year after the \n     date of the enactment of this subsection, and every 2 years \n     thereafter, the Administrator shall submit to Congress a \n     report on implementation of this subsection.''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to authorize the acquisition of the Valles Caldera \ncurrently managed by the Baca Land and Cattle Company, to provide for \nan effective land and wildlife management program for this resource \nwithin the Department of Agriculture through the private sector, and \nfor purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                  the valles caldera preservation act\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Valles Caldera in Northern New \nMexico\n\n[[Page S12317]]\n\nis a place you visit for a day, and long to return to for a life time. \nIt is nature at its most extraordinary--an almost perfectly round bowl \nformed by a collapsed volcano. It is a place with rolling meadows, \ncrystal-clear streams, roaming elk, Ponderosa pines and quaking Aspen \ntrees, and Golden eagles. This legislation guarantees that this very \nspecial place will be there for future generations to visit and \nremember.\n  I am very proud to be introducing legislation that will authorize the \nSecretary of the Interior to acquire a truly unique 95,000 acre \n``working ranch'' in New Mexico, known alternatively as the Baca Ranch, \nthe Valle Grande, and the Valles Caldera. Independently, but as \nimportantly, this legislation also addresses longstanding problems \nencountered by Federal land managers in disposing of surplus federal \nproperty and the acquisition of private inholdings within federal \nmanagement areas.\n  The former provides a unique solution to the management of a unique \nproperty, while the latter builds on existing laws and provides \nresources dedicated to the consolidation of federal agency land \nholdings.\n  In north-central New Mexico there is a truly unique working ranch on \nan historic Mexican land grant known as Baca Location No. 1. The Ranch \nis currently owned and managed by the Baca Land and Cattle Company, and \nit comprises most of a collapsed, extinct volcano known as the Valles \nCaldera. This ranch also contains innumerable significant cultural, \nhistoric, recreational, ecological, and productive resources.\n  The bill I introduce today is the result of months of negotiation \nwith the Administration, Senator Bingaman, and Congressman Redmond. We \nhave incorporated ideas from groups interested in the acquisition of \nthe truly unique Baca Ranch. Many Americans, especially New Mexicans \nhave expressed a desire for the federal government to purchase the \nRanch. After months of research and consideration, I met with President \nClinton on Air Force One while we were both returning to Washington \nfrom New Mexico to discuss the possibility of this land acquisition. \nBecause the nature of the property requires a unique operational \nprogram for appropriate development and preservation, I approached him \nwith an innovative trust structure for the management of the Baca \nRanch. This trust would manage the ranch with appropriate public input \nand governmental oversight. I indicated that I was not interested in \nhaving the ranch managed under current federal agency practices. The \nPresident expressed enthusiasm for making this concept a reality, and \nwe agreed on a Statement of Principles to govern the acquisition of the \nBaca Ranch at the end of July.\n  This unique working ranch has been well maintained and preserved by \nthe current owners. In fact, if ever there was an example of sterling \nstewardship of a piece of property, this is it.\n  The legislation introduced today certainly cannot pass this year: \nunfortunately, time has run out for the 105th Congress, but many \nconcerns and ideas about federal purchase of the property will be \ndiscussed at hearings upon reintroduction in the 106th Congress. While \nthere is consenus that this property should be acquired, we do not yet \nknow the cost of the property. The Baca Ranch is estimated to be worth \napproximately $100 to $125 million, but the appraisal has not yet been \ngiven to the Forest Service or made public. Therefore, the exact cost \nof acquisition has yet to be determined.\n  This is the largest purchase of public land by the Forest Service in \nat least 25 years, therefore, it is imperative that careful \nconsideration is given to not only the purchase, but to the management \nof the property as well.\n  In past years, federal land management agencies have been criticized \nfor their stewardship of public lands. I find it ironic that many of \nthe groups who wish to bring this ranch into government ownership are \nthe same groups who, in recent years, have initiated relentless \nlitigation against the Forest Service and BLM alleging poor management \nof federal lands. However, diverse interests have come together to \nreach agreement on the trust management of the Ranch, and Congressman \nRedmond and I have worked hard in both Houses of Congress to obtain \nfunding for purchase. Any funding at this point should be viewed as \nearnest money, and will be subject to this authorization and agreement \non the fair market value for the property.\n  The parties have really worked hard in framing this legislation, and \nthere are still a few issues we would like to work out. Not the least \nof which includes the interest expressed by the Santa Clara Pueblo in \npurchasing land outside the Caldera, but contains the headwaters of the \nSanta Clara Creek. Negotiations between the Pueblo, the Administration, \nthe current owners of the property, and the congressional delegation on \nhow to resolve this issue was not completed prior to today's \nintroduction. However, all parties are interested in continuing \ndiscussion regarding a potential Santa Clara purchase of property \nadjacent to their pueblo. I also note that Congressman Redmond has \nexpressed specific interest in addressing other Native American issues \nregarding the Ranch acquisition.\n  I have visited the Baca Ranch, and I can tell you that it is one \nbeautiful piece of property. The Valles Caldera is one of the world's \nlargest resurgent lava domes with potential geothermal activity. The \ndepression from a hugh volcanic eruption over a million years ago is \nmore than a half-mile deep and fifteen miles across at its widest \npoint. The land was originally granted to the heirs of Don Luis Maria \nCabeza de Vaca under a settlement enacted by Congress in 1860. Since \nthat time, the property has remained virtually intact as a single, \nlarge, tract of land.\n  Historical evidence in the form of old logging camps and other \nartifacts, and a review of the history of territorial New Mexico \nclearly show the importance of this land over many generations for the \nrearing of domesticated livestock, and as a timber supply for local \ninhabitants. Several film sets have been left standing on the property, \nrepresenting a significant part of the history of the American film \nindustry and its depiction of the American West.\n  The careful husbandry of the Ranch by the Dunigan family, the current \nowners, including selective harvesting of timber, limited grazing and \nhunting, and the use of proscribed fire, have preserved a mix of \nhealthy range and timber land with significant species diversity \nproviding a model for sustainable land development and use. The Ranch's \nnatural beauty and abundant resources, and its proximity to large \nmunicipal populations could provide numerous recreational opportunities \nfor hiking, fishing, camping, cross-country skiing, and hunting.\n  Mr. President, the Baca Location is a unique working ranch. It is not \na wilderness area, as in the words of the Wilderness Act, ``untrammeled \nby man, where man is a visitor who does not remain.'' Man has been \nthere for many generations, and will remain for many to come. \nSimilarly, it is not a resource that could be run well as a national \npark. This ranch can best be protected for future generations by \ncontinuing its operation as a working asset through a unique management \nstructure. This legislation provides unique management under a trust \nthat may allow for its eventual operation to become financially self-\nsustaining.\n  Mr. President, recent indication by the current owners of the Baca \nLocation that they wish to sell the ranch has created an opportunity \nfor us to acquire it into public ownership and allow for appropriate \npublic access and enjoyment of these lands for the first time since \n1860. Because of the ranch's unique character, however, I am not \ninterested in having it managed under the usual federal authorities, as \nis typical of the Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management, or the \nNational Park Service. Under the current state of affairs on our public \nlands, Forest Service and BLM management is constantly hounded by \nlitigation initiated by some of the same groups that wish to bring this \nranch into government ownership. I do not want to take this property, \nput it in that situation, and then claim we have done a great thing.\n  This legislation represents an opportunity to experiment with a \ndifferent kind of public land management scheme. Burdensome \nregulations, and litigation resulting therefrom, have brought federal \nland management practices rapidly towards gridlock. The Valles Caldera \nNational Preserve will\n\n[[Page S12318]]\n\nserve as a model to explore alternative means of federal management and \nwill provide the American people with opportunities to enjoy the Valles \nCaldera and its many resources for generations to come.\n  This trust idea, based on similar legislation for federal management \nof the Presidio in San Francisco, sets in motion a truly unique \nmanagement scheme befitting this truly unique place. I am willing to \ntake a chance on an innovative approach because I believe that the \ncurrent quagmire of federal land management simply does not do justice \nto this very special place. The unique nature of the Valles Caldera, \nand its resources, requires a unique management program, dedicated to \nappropriate development and preservation under the principle of the \nhighest and best use of the ranch in the interest of the public.\n  Mr. President, title I of this legislation provides the framework \nnecessary to fulfil that objective. It authorizes the acquisition of \nthe Baca ranch by the appropriate Federal agency. At the same time, it \nestablishes a government-owned corporation, called the Valles Caldera \nTrust, whose sole responsibility is to ensure that the ranch is managed \nin a manner that will preserve its current unique character, and \nprovide enumerable opportunities for the American people to enjoy its \nsplendor. Most importantly to me, however, the legislation will allow \nfor the ranch's continued operation as a working asset for the people \nof north-central New Mexico, without further drawing on the thinly-\nstretched resources of the Federal land management agencies.\n  I am looking forward to hearings on this legislation next year, and \nknow that the legislative process shall enlighten us further as to the \ncomplex nature of the Ranch. I, personally, am greatly looking forward \nto seeing an value estimate of the land prior to authorization. While \nvalued between $37 and $55 million in 1980, I have heard that the Baca \nranch is currently estimated to be worth approximately $100 to $125 \nmillion. I do not know how such inflation will affect the likelihood of \nthe location's federal acquisition. I do know that we have waited \npatiently for many months for a promised appraisal from the current \nowners, but an appraisal has not yet been complete nor have any other \noffers to purchase the land been made. Therefore, the exact cost of \nacquisition has yet to be determined. Before we commit large sums of \nfederal taxpayer dollars to purchase new property, it seems prudent to \nprovide a solution for the orderly disposal of surplus federal property \nand to meet our current obligations to those who hold lands within \nfederal properties.\n  I would like to emphasize that while both portions of this bill are \nimportant to federal land management, both in New Mexico and \nnationwide, my intention is not to tie federal acquisition of the Baca \nupon disposition of surplus federal land. Instead, I feel this \nlegislation independently addresses the acquisition of this unique \nproperty for public use and enjoyment, while solving current land \nmanagement problems.\n  Currently, New Mexico has approximately one-third of its land in \npublic ownership or management. I agree that these public lands are an \nimportant natural resource that require our most thoughtful management.\n  In order to conserve our existing National treasures for future use \nand enjoyment, we must devise, with the concurrence of other members of \nCongress and the President, a definite plan and timetable to dispose of \nsurplus land through sale or exchange into private ownership.\n  Title II of this legislation addresses the orderly disposition of \nsurplus federal property on a state by state basis. It also addresses \nthe problem of what is known as ``inholdings'' within federally managed \nareas. There are currently more than 45 million acres of privately \nowned lands trapped within the boundaries of Federal land management \nunits, including national parks, national forests, national monuments, \nnational wildlife refuges, and wilderness areas. The location of these \ntracts, referred to as inholdings, makes the exercise of private \nproperty rights difficult for the land owner. In addition, management \nof the public lands is made more cumbersome for the federal land \nmanagers.\n  In many cases, inholders have been waiting generations for the \nfederal government to set aside funding and prioritize the acquisition \nof their property. With rapidly growing public demand for the use of \npublic lands, it is increasingly difficult for federal managers to \naddress problems created by the existence of inholdings in many areas.\n  This legislation directs the Department of the Interior and the \nDepartment of Agriculture to survey inholdings existing within Federal \nland management units, and to establish a priority for their \nacquisition, on a willing seller basis, in the order of those which \nhave existed as inholdings for the longest time to those most recently \nbeing incorporated into the Federal unit.\n  Closely related to the problem created by inholdings within Federal \nland management units, is the abundance of public domain land which the \nBureau of Land Management (BLM) has determined it no longer needs to \nfulfil its mission. Under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of \n1976 (FLPMA), the BLM has identified an estimated four to six million \nacres of public domain lands for disposal, and the agency anticipates \nthat additional public land will be similarly identified, with public \ninput and consultation with State and local governments as required by \nlaw.\n  Mr. President, let me simply clarify that point--the BLM already has \nauthority under an existing law, FLPMA, to exchange or sell lands out \nof Federal ownership. Through its public process for land use planning, \nwhen the agency has determined that certain lands would be more useful \nto the public under private or local governmental control, it is \nalready authorized to dispose of these lands, either by sale or \nexchange.\n  The sale or exchange of this land which I have often referred to as \n``surplus,'' would be beneficial to local communities, adjoining land \nowners, and BLM land mangers, alike. First, it would allow for the \nreconfiguration of land ownership patterns to better facilitate \nresource management. Second, it would contribute to administrative \nefficiency within federal land management units, by allowing for better \nallocation of fiscal and human resources within the agency. Finally, in \ncertain locations, the sale of public land which has been identified \nfor disposal is the best way for the public to realize a fair value for \nthis land.\n  The problem, Mr. President, is that an orderly process for the \nefficient disposition of lands identified for disposal does not \ncurrently exist. This legislation addresses that problem by directing \nthe BLM to fulfil all legal requirements for the transfer of these \nlands out of Federal ownership, and providing a dedicated source of \nfunding generated from the sale of these lands to continue this \nprocess.\n  Additionally, this legislation authorizes the use of the proceeds \ngenerated from these lands to purchase inholdings from willing sellers. \nThis will enhance the ability of the Federal land management agencies \nto work cooperatively with private land owners, and with State and \nlocal governments, to consolidate the ownership of public and private \nland in a manner that would allow for better overall resource \nmanagement.\n  Mr. President, I want to make it clear that this program will in no \nway detract from other programs with similar purposes. The bill clearly \nstates that proceeds generated from the disposal of public land, and \ndedicated to the acquisition of inholdings, will supplement, and not \nreplace, funds appropriated for that purpose through the Land and Water \nConservation Fund. In addition, the bill states that the Bureau of Land \nManagement should rely on non-Federal entities to conduct appraisals \nand other research required for the sale or exchange of these lands, \nallowing for the least disruption of existing land and resource \nmanagement programs.\n  Mr. President, this bill has been a long time in the making. For over \na year, now, I have been working with and talking to knowledgeable \npeople, both inside and outside of the current administration, to \ndevelop many of the ideas embodied in this bill. In recent weeks, my \nstaff and I have worked closely with the administration on this \nlegislation. I feel comfortable in stating that by working together, we \nhave\n\n[[Page S12319]]\n\nreached agreement in principle on the best way to proceed with these \nvery important issues involving the management of public land \nresources, namely; the acquisition and unique management plan for the \nBaca ranch in New Mexico, and just as importantly, the disposition of \nsurplus public lands in combination with a program to address problems \nassociated with inholdings within our Federal land management units.\n  Mr. President, I have committed to the administration to continue to \nwork with them on three or four areas of this bill, where concerns \nremain. I have full confidence, however, that we can address these \nissues through the legislative process in the next Congress. For \nexample, the need for additional roads, parking, visitor facilities, \nand water and mineral rights are also important issues that must be \nresolved. However, we are very luck to have the pleasure of a \nbipartisan, administration approved, legislative concept from which to \nwork.\n  The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee will schedule \nhearings to address the many issues regarding Federal purchase of the \nBaca Ranch early in the 106th Congress. Hopefully, by that time, an \nappraisal will be available for review. Congress has tried to resolve \nthe difficult challenges in acquiring this property before, and failed; \ncooperation among the parties may bring success this time around. I \nbelieve that in the end, we will be able to stand together and tell the \nAmerican people that we truly have accomplished two great and \ninnovative things with this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nStatement of Principles be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2621\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n          TITLE I--VALLES CALDERA NATIONAL PRESERVE AND TRUST\n\n     SECTION 101.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Acquisition of Inholdings \n     and Disposal of Surplus Lands Facilitation Act''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) many private individuals own land within the boundaries \n     of Federal land management units and wish to sell this land \n     to the Federal government;\n       (2) these lands lie within national parks, national \n     forests, national monuments, Bureau of Land Management \n     special areas, and national wildlife refuges;\n\n[[Page S12323]]\n\n       (3) in many cases, inholders on these lands and the Federal \n     government would mutually benefit by acquiring on a priority \n     basis these lands;\n       (4) Federal land management agencies are facing increased \n     workloads from rapidly growing public demand for the use of \n     public lands, making it difficult for federal managers to \n     address problems created by the existence of inholdings in \n     many areas;\n       (5) through land use planning under the Federal Land Policy \n     and Management Act of 1976 the Bureau of Land Management has \n     identified certain public lands for disposal;\n       (6) the Bureau of Land Management has authority under the \n     Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 to exchange or \n     sell lands identified for disposal under its land use \n     planning;\n       (7) a more expeditious process for disposition of public \n     lands identified for disposal would benefit the public \n     interest;\n       (8) the sale or exchange of land identified for disposal \n     would--\n       (A) allow for the reconfiguration of land ownership \n     patterns to better facilitate resource management;\n       (B) contribute to administrative efficiency within the \n     federal land management unit; and\n       (C) allow for increased effectiveness of the allocation of \n     fiscal and human resources within the agency;\n       (9) in certain locations, the sale of public land which has \n     been identified for disposal is the best way for the public \n     to receive a fair market value for the land;\n       (10) using proceeds generated from the disposal of public \n     land to purchase inholdings from willing sellers would \n     enhance the ability of the Federal land management agencies \n     to work cooperatively with private land owners, and State and \n     local governments and promote consolidation of the ownership \n     of public and private land in a manner that would allow \n     for better overall resource management;\n       (11) proceeds generated from the disposal of public land \n     may be properly dedicated to the acquisition of inholdings; \n     and\n       (12) to allow for the least disruption of existing land and \n     resource management programs, the Bureau of Land Management \n     may use non-Federal entities to prepare appraisal documents \n     for agency review and approval in accordance with the \n     applicable appraisal standards.\n\n     SEC. 203.

Inholdings shall be identified using \n     the means set forth under subsection (d). Inholdings shall \n     be deemed established as of the latter of--\n       (A) the date the Federal land was withdrawn from the public \n     domain, or established or designated for special management, \n     whichever is earlier; or\n       (B) the date on which the inholding was acquired by the \n     current owner.\n       (2) Public notice.--The Secretaries shall provide notice to \n     the public in the Federal Register (and through other such \n     means as the Secretaries may determine to be appropriate) of \n     a program of identification of inholdings within Federally \n     designated areas by which any owner who wants to sell such an \n     inholding to the United States shall provide to the \n     Secretaries such information regarding that inholding as is \n     required by the notice.\n       (b) Composition of the Evaluation Team.--The team shall be \n     composed of employees of the National Park Service, the Fish \n     and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the \n     Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, and other agencies \n     as appropriate.\n       (c) Timing.--The Secretaries shall establish the Evaluation \n     Team within 90 days after the enactment of this title.\n       (d) Duties of the Evaluation Team.--The team shall be \n     charged with the identification of inholdings within \n     Federally designated areas, by state, and by the date upon \n     which the lands or interests therein became inholdings. \n     Inholdings will be identified using--\n       (1) the list of inholdings identified by owners pursuant to \n     subsection (a)(2); and\n       (2) tracts of land identified through existing agency \n     planning processes.\n       (e) Report.--The Secretaries shall submit a report to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the Committee \n     on Appropriations of the Senate, and the Committee on \n     Resources and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of \n     Representatives on the status of their evaluations within one \n     year after the enactment of this title, and at the end of \n     each 180 days increment thereafter until such time as \n     reasonable efforts to identify inholdings have been made or \n     the program established in section 205 terminates.\n       (f) Funding.--Funding to carry out this section shall be \n     taken from operating funds of the agencies involved and shall \n     be reimbursed from the account established under section 206.\n\n     SEC. 205. DISPOSAL OF SURPLUS PUBLIC LAND.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Interior (in this \n     section, the ``Secretary'') shall establish a program, \n     utilizing funds available under section 207, to complete \n     appraisals and other legal requirements for the sale or \n     exchange of land identified for disposal under approved land \n     use plans maintained under section 202 of the Federal Land \n     Policy and Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1712) and in \n     effect on the date of enactment of this title.\n       (b) Sale of Public Land.--The sale of public land so \n     identified shall be conducted in accordance with section 203 \n     and section 209 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act \n     of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1713, 1719). It is the intent of Congress \n     that the exceptions to competitive bidding requirements \n     under section 203(f) of the Federal Land Policy and \n     Management Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1713(f) apply under this \n     title, where the Secretary of the Interior determines it \n     necessary and proper.\n       (c) Report in Public Land Statistics.--The Secretary shall \n     provide in the annual publication of Public Land Statistics, \n     a report of activities related to the program established \n     under this section.\n       (d) Termination of Program.--The program established by \n     this section shall terminate ten years from the date of \n     enactment of this title.\n\n     SEC. 206.

SPECIAL PROVISIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Nothing in this title shall be construed \n     as an exemption from any existing limitation on the \n     acquisition of lands of interests therein under any Federal \n     law.\n       (b) Santini-Burton Act.--The provisions of this title shall \n     not apply to lands eligible for sale pursuant to the Santini-\n     Burton Act (94 Stat. 3381).\n       (c) Exchanges.--Nothing in this title shall be construed as \n     precluding, pre-empting, or limiting the authority to \n     exchange lands under the Federal Land Policy and Management \n     Act of 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), or the Federal Land \n     Exchange Facilitation Act of 1988 (site).\n       (d) Right or Benefit.--This title is intended to provide \n     direction regarding Federal land management. Nothing herein \n     is intended to, or shall create a right or benefit, \n     substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by \n     a party against the United States, its agencies, its \n     officers, or any other person.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                        Statement of Principles\n\n\n                             i. baca ranch\n\n       The Baca ranch in New Mexico is a unique land area, with \n     significant scientific, cultural, historic, recreational, \n     ecological, and production values. Management of this working \n     ranch by the current owners has included limited grazing, \n     hunting, and timber harvesting, and it depicts a model for \n     sustainable land development and use. It is our intention to \n     continue to follow this model. The unique nature of the Baca \n     ranch requires a unique program for appropriate preservation, \n     operation and maintenance of the ranch.\n       Legislation to authorize the Federal acquisition and \n     establish a unique management framework will:\n       (1) Provide for federal acquisition of the Baca Ranch \n     property by the U.S. Forest Service, assuming agreement with \n     the current owners on a fair price based on an objective \n     appraisal;\n       (2) Provide for innovative management by a Trust, being a \n     wholly owned government corporation comprised of individuals, \n     (appointed by the President with New Mexican input), with \n     appropriate and varied expertise relevant to the unique \n     management issues. These individuals will administer the \n     operation, maintenance, management, and use of the ranch, \n     based on appropriate public input and with governmental \n     oversight;\n       (3) Provide management principles including protection of \n     the unique values of the property in all of the areas listed \n     above, and demonstration of sustainable land use including \n     recreational opportunities, selective timbering, limited \n     grazing and hunting, and the use of appropriate range and \n     silvicultural management with significant species diversity. \n     Management shall be in furtherance of these goals and provide \n     for the eventual financial self-sufficiency of the operation \n     without violating other management goals;\n       (4) Provide an opportunity for the Trust, should it not \n     achieve financial self-sufficiency by its ninth year of \n     operation, to continue operating upon agreement between \n     Congress and the President, after showing rationale for not \n     attaining a financially self-sufficient operation; and\n       (5) Provide for an initial appropriation in an amount \n     necessary for management of the property.\n       The parties further agree to work together to make \n     available the $20 million appropriated in the 1998 Land and \n     Water Conservation Fund, the $20 million in FY99 requested by \n     the President for use to purchase the Baca ranch, and \n     additional funds necessary to complete the purchase following \n     an acceptable and reasonable appraisal and agreement on price \n     between buyer and seller.\n\n\n             ii. inholder relief and surplus land disposal\n\n       Millions of acres of private land lie within the boundaries \n     of Federal land management units. BLM currently has authority \n     to exchange or sell lands identified for disposal in its \n     planning process. Using proceeds generated from the disposal \n     of these public lands to purchase inholdings in federally \n     designated areas from willing sellers would supplement funds \n     appropriated under the Land and Water Conservation Fund. \n     Legislation to address these interrelated land management \n     problems will--\n       (1) Establish a program to conduct appraisals and other \n     legal requirements for the disposal of public land identified \n     in existing BLM management plans as surplus;\n       (2) Establish a special account for the receipts generated \n     from the disposal of these lands, available to the \n     Secretaries to acquire inholdings without further \n     appropriation, provided--\n       The acquisition will be from willing sellers, with priority \n     given to lands existing as inholdings for the longest time;\n       Proceeds from the sale of surplus lands must be spent \n     within the state in which they were generated until all \n     available inholdings are purchased;\n       The proceeds in the special account are to supplement, not \n     supplant, appropriations to the Land and Water Conservation \n     Fund; and\n       An appropriate amount of the proceeds will be used to \n     conduct appraisal and other administrative steps necessary to \n     complete the sale of surplus lands; and\n       (3) Terminates the land disposal program and account after \n     ten years.\n      By Mr. ROTH (for himself, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Baucus, \n        Mr. Grassley, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Breaux, Mr. \n        D'Amato, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Graham, Mr. Jeffords, \n        Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. Mack, Mr. Bryan, and Mr. Kerrey):\n  S. 2622. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \ncertain expiring provisions, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n                  the tax relief extension act of 1998\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the ``Tax Relief \nExtension Act of 1998''. I am pleased to have as my principal cosponsor \nmy distinguished friend and Ranking Member of the Finance Committee, \nDaniel Patrick Moynihan. Fifteen Finance Committee Members have joined \nSenator Moynihan and myself on this bill.\n\n  Before I discuss the Finance Committee bill, I'd like to comment on \nthe House bill.\n  Chairman Archer and I attempted to negotiate a bill that would \naddress expiring tax and trade provisions.\n  Chairman Archer and I had many discussions and made a lot of progress \nin trying to resolve differences on extenders, but we were unable to \nreach agreement. Let me say the House bill has many worthwhile \nproposals that we in the Senate should support.\n  Mr. President, we find ourselves in a difficult situation. Although \nthe House bill has many good proposals, it is unlikely the House bill \nwill move by unanimous consent in the Senate in its present form. We \nwill not be able to obtain unanimous consent because the House resisted \nnegotiations on expiring provisions important to Members of the Senate.\n  I remain hopeful that the House and Senate can reach agreement on an \nextenders bill. I believe the Finance Committee is taking a step today \nthat can lead us to that agreement.\n  Mr. President, this bill is the product of a Finance Committee \nmeeting yesterday. At that meeting, a bi-partisan majority of the \ncommittee agreed on a package to address expiring tax and trade \nprovisions--the so-called extenders. This bill is meant to be offered \nas a substitute to H.R. 4738, the House extender bill.\n  We expect to consider the House bill together with the Finance \nCommittee bill shortly.\n  This Finance Committee bill follows three principles:\n\n       All non-controversial expiring provisions are covered;\n       No policy changes are made to the extenders--only date \n     changes; and\n       The package is fully offset.\n\n  The purpose of this bill is to leave tax policy on the expiring \nprovisions settled until the next Congress. At that time, hopefully, we \nwill be considering a major tax cut bill. When we are considering that \ntax cut bill next year, we will be able to address the policy and long-\nterm period of the various provisions.\n  This bill is necessarily narrow. There are no Member provisions in \nthis bill, including some I am interested in. In order to expedite this \nbill, the Finance Committee Members on this bill agreed to forego \nMember issues.\n\n[[Page S12325]]\n\n  This bill extends several important provisions in the tax and trade \nareas, including:\n\n       The research and development tax credit;\n       The work opportunity tax credit;\n       The welfare to work tax credit;\n       The full deductibility of contributions of appreciated \n     stock to private foundations;\n       The active financing exception to Subpart F for financial \n     services operations overseas;\n       The tax information reporting access for the Department of \n     Education for the Federal student aid programs;\n       The Generalized System of Preferences (``GSP''); and\n       The trade adjustment assistance (``TAA'') program.\n\n  In addition to extenders, the Finance Committee bill speeds up the \nfull deductibility of health insurance deduction for self-employed \npersons. This bill also addresses time sensitive farm-related issues.\n  The final provision in this bill would correct an upcoming problem \nfor millions of middle income taxpayers. The Taxpayer Relief Act of \n1997 included tax relief for America's working families in the form of \nthe $500 per child tax credit and the Hope Scholarship tax credit, and \nother benefits. Taxpayers will expect to see these benefits when they \nfile their returns on April 15th.\n  What some of these families will find is that the tax relief they \nexpected will not materialize because of the alternative minimum tax \n(``AMT''). That is, these tax credits do not count against the \nalternative minimum tax. The final provision in the Finance Committee \nbill would provide that benefits such as the $500 per child tax credit \nwould count against the alternative minimum tax.\n  This point deserves emphasis. We can correct this problem for \nmillions of taxpayers in this bill. As Chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, I consider it my responsibility to simplify the tax code \nwhenever possible. This last provision provides us with that \nopportunity. I am pleased the Members of the Finance Committee back me \nin this effort.\n  Finally, I'd like return to the Senate's procedures, schedule, and \nthe prospects for extender legislation.\n  It is important to recognize that the House and Senate are very \ndifferent bodies governed by starkly different rules and traditions. \nUnlike the House, the Senate Rules and schedule do not allow us to move \nthis bill at this point in any other way than by unanimous consent. If \nwe are to address these tax and trade provisions, we will need the \ncooperation of every Senator.\n  If we can get every Senator's cooperation, and resolve our \ndifferences with the House, I believe we can deliver an extenders bill \nthe President will sign.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this Finance Committee bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, a \nsection-by-section analysis, and revenue table of the legislation, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2622\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Extension of Expiring Provisions\n\n                       Subtitle A--Tax Provisions\n\n\n A. Extension of Research Tax Credit (sec. 101 of the bill and sec. 41 \n                              of the Code)\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     General rule\n       Section 41 provides for a research tax credit equal to 20 \n     percent of the amount by which a taxpayer's qualified \n     research expenditures for a taxable year exceeded its base \n     amount for that year. The research tax credit expired and \n     generally does not apply to amounts paid or incurred after \n     June 30, 1998.\n       A 20-percent research tax credit also applied to the excess \n     of (1) 100 percent of corporate cash expenditures (including \n     grants or contributions) paid for basic research conducted by \n     universities (and certain nonprofit scientific research \n     organizations) over (2) the sum of (a) the greater of two \n     minimum basic research floors plus (b) an amount reflecting \n     any decrease in nonresearch giving to universities by the \n     corporation as compared to such giving during a fixed-base \n     period, as adjusted for inflation. This separate credit \n     computations is commonly referred to as the ``university \n     basic research credit'' (see sec. 41(e)).\n     Computation of allowable credit\n       Except for certain university basic research payments made \n     by corporations, the research tax credit applies only to the \n     extent that the taxpayer's qualifed research expenditures for \n     current taxable year exceed its base amount. The base amount \n     for the current year generally is computed by multiplying the \n     taxpayer's ``fixed-base percentage'' by the average amount of \n     the taxpayer's gross receipts for the four preceding years. \n     If a taxpayer both incurred qualified research expenditures \n     and had gross receipts during each of at least three years \n     from 1984 through 1988, then its ``fixed-base percentage'' is \n     the ratio that its total qualified research expenditures for \n     the 1984-1988 period bears to its total gross receipts for \n     that period (subject to a maximum ratio of .16). All other \n     taxpayers (so-called ``start-up firms'') are assigned a \n     fixed-base percentage of 3 percent. \\2\\\n       In computing the credit, a taxpayer's base amount may not \n     be less than 50 percent of its current-year qualified \n     research expenditures.\n     Alternative incremental research credit regime\n       Taxpayers are allowed to elect an alternative incremental \n     research credit regime. If a taxpayer elects to be subject to \n     this alternative regime, the taxpayer is assigned a three-\n     tiered fixed-base percentage (that is lower than the fixed-\n     base percentage otherwise applicable under present law) and \n     the credit rate likewise is reduced. Under the alternative \n     credit regime, a credit rate of 1.65 percent applies to the \n     extent that a taxpayer's current-year research expenses \n     exceed a base amount computed by using a fixed-base \n     percentage of 1 percent (i.e, the base amount equals 1 \n     percent of the taxpayer's average gross receipts for the four \n     preceding years) but do not exceed a base amount computed by \n     using a fixed-base percentage of 1.5 percent. A credit rate \n     of 2.2 percent applies to the extent that a taxpayer's \n     current-year research expenses exceed a base amount computed \n     by using a fixed-base percentage of 1.5 percent but do not \n     exceed a base amount computed by using a fixed-base \n     percentage of 2 percent. A credit rate of 2.75 percent \n     applies to the extent that a taxpayer's current-year research \n     expenses exceed a base amount computed by using a fixed-base \n     percentage of 2 percent. An election to be subject to this \n     alternative incremental credit regime may be made for any \n     taxable year beginning after June 30, 1996, and such an \n     election applies to that taxable year and all subsequent \n     years (in the event that the credit subsequently is extended \n     by Congress) unless revoked with the consent of the Secretary \n     of the Treasury.\n     Eligible expenditures\n       Qualified research expenditures eligible for the research \n     tax credit consist of: (1) ``in-\n\n[[Page S12329]]\n\n     house'' expenses of the taxpayer for wages and supplies \n     attributable to qualified research; (2) certain time-sharing \n     costs for computer use in qualified research; and (3) 65 \n     percent of amounts paid by the taxpayer for qualified \n     conducted on the taxpayer's behalf (so-called ``contract \n     research expenses''). \\3\\\n       To be eligible for the credit, the research must not only \n     satisfy the requirements of present-law section 174 but must \n     be undertaken for the purpose of discovering information that \n     is technological in nature, the application of which is \n     intended to be useful in the development of a new or improved \n     business component of the taxpayer, and must involve a \n     process of experimentation related to functional aspects, \n     performance, reliability, or quality of a business component.\n       Expenditures attributable to research that is conducted \n     outside the United States do not enter into the credit \n     computation. In addition, the credit is not available for \n     research in the social sciences, arts, or humanities, nor is \n     it available for research to the extent funded by any grant, \n     contract, or otherwise by another person (or governmental \n     entity).\n     Relation to deduction\n       Deductions allowed to a taxpayer under section 174 (or any \n     other section) are reduced by an amount equal to 100 percent \n     of the taxpayer's research tax credit determined for the \n     taxable year. Taxpayers may alternatively elect to claim a \n     reduced research tax credit amount under section 41 in lieu \n     of reducing deductions otherwise allowed (sec. 280C(c)(3)).\n\n                        Description of Proposal\n\n       The bill extends the research tax credit for 12 months--\n     i.e., generally, for the period July 1, 1998, through June \n     30, 1999.\n       In extending the credit, the scope of the term ``qualified \n     research'' is reaffirmed. Section 41 targets the credit to \n     research which is undertaken for the purpose of discovering \n     information which is technological in nature and the \n     application of which is intended to be useful in the \n     development of a new or improved business component of the \n     taxpayer. However, eligibility for the credit does not \n     require that the research be successful--i.e., the research \n     need not achieve its desired result. Moreover, evolutionary \n     research activities intended to improve functionality, \n     performance, reliability, or quality are eligible for the \n     credit, as are research activities intended to achieve a \n     result that has already been achieved by other persons but is \n     not yet within the common knowledge (e.g., freely available \n     to the general public) of the field (provided that the \n     research otherwise meets the requirements of section 41, \n     including not being excluded by subsection (d)(4)).\n       Activities constitute a process of experimentation, as \n     required for credit eligibility, if they involve evaluation \n     of more than one alternative to achieve a result where the \n     means of achieving the result are uncertain at the outset, \n     even if the taxpayer knows at the outset that it may \n     be technically possible to achieve the result. Thus, even \n     though a researcher may know of a particular method of \n     achieving an outcome, the use of the process of \n     experimentation to effect a new or better method of \n     achieving that outcome may be eligible for the credit \n     (provided that the research otherwise meets the \n     requirements of section 41, including not being excluded \n     by subsection (d)(4)).\n       Lastly, the lack of clarity in the interpretation of the \n     distinction between internal-use software, the costs of which \n     may be eligible for the credit if additional tests are met, \n     and other software has been observed. The application of the \n     definition of internal-use software should fully reflect \n     Congressional intent.\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The extension of the research credit is effective for \n     qualified research expenditures paid or incurred during the \n     period July 1, 1998, through June 30, 1999.\n\n\n b. extension of the work opportunity tax credit (sec. 102 of the bill \n                        and sec. 51 of the Code)\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     In general\n       The work opportunity tax credit (``WOTC''), which expired \n     on June 30, 1998, was available on an elective basis for \n     employers hiring individuals from one or more of eight \n     targeted groups. The credit equals 40 percent (25 percent for \n     employment of 400 hours or less) of qualified wages. \n     Qualified wages are wages attributable to service rendered by \n     a member of a targeted group during the one-year period \n     beginning with the day the individual began work for the \n     employer. For a vocational rehabilitation referral, however, \n     the period begins on the day the individual began work for \n     the employer on or after the beginning of the individual's \n     vocational rehabilitation plan.\n       The maximum credit per employee if $2,400 (40% of the first \n     $6,000 of qualified first-year wages). With respect to \n     qualified summer youth employees, the maximum credit is \n     $1,200 (40% of the first $3,000 of qualified first-year \n     wages).\n       The employer's deduction for wages is reduced by the amount \n     of the credit\n     Targeted groups eligible for the credit.\n       The eight targeted groups are: (1) families eligible to \n     receive benefits under the Temporary Assistance for Needy \n     Families (TANF) Program; (2) high-risk youth; (3) qualified \n     ex-felons; (4) vocational rehabilitation referrals; (5) \n     qualified summer youth employees; (6) qualified veterans; (7) \n     families receiving food stamps; and (8) persons receiving \n     certain Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits.\n     Minimum employment period\n       No credit is allowed for wages paid to employees who work \n     less than 120 hours in the first year of employment.\n     Expiration date\n       The credit is effective for wages paid or incurred to a \n     qualified individual who began work for an employer before \n     July 1, 1998.\n\n                        Description of Proposal\n\n       The proposal extends the work opportunity tax credit, for \n     12 months, through June 30, 1999.\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The proposal is effective for wages paid or incurred to a \n     qualified individual who begins work for any employer on or \n     after July 1, 1998, and before July 1, 1999.\n\n\n C. Extension of the Welfare-To-Work Tax Credit (sec. 103 of the bill \n                       and sec. 51A of the Code)\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       The Code provides to employers a tax credit on the first \n     $20,000 of eligible wages paid to qualified long-term family \n     assistance (AFDC) or its successor program) recipients during \n     the first two years of employment. The credit is 35 percent \n     of the first $10,000 of eligible wages in the first year of \n     employment and 50 percent of the first $10,000 of eligible \n     wages in the second year of employment. The maximum credit is \n     $8,500 per qualified employee.\n       Qualified long-term family assistance recipients are: (1) \n     members of a family that has received family assistance for \n     at least 18 consecutive months ending on the hiring date; (2) \n     members of a family that has received family assistance for a \n     total of at least 18 months (whether or not consecutive) \n     after the date of enactment of this credit if they are hired \n     within 2 years after the date that the 18-month total is \n     reached; and (3) members of a family who are no longer \n     eligible for family assistance because of either Federal or \n     State time limits, if they are hired within 2 years after the \n     Federal or State time limits made the family ineligible for \n     family assistance.\n       Eligible wages include cash wages paid to an employee plus \n     amounts paid by the employer for the following: (1) \n     educational assistance excludable under a section 127 program \n     (or that would be excludable but for the expiration of sec. \n     127); (2) health plan coverage for the employee, but not more \n     than the applicable premium defined under section \n     4980B(f)(4); and (3) dependent care assistance excludable \n     under section 129.\n       The welfare to work credit is effective for wages paid or \n     incurred to a qualified individual who begins work for an \n     employer on or after January 1, 1998, and before May 1, 1999.\n\n                        Description of Proposal\n\n       The proposal extends the welfare-to-work credit effective \n     for wages paid or incurred to a qualified individual who \n     begins work for an employer on or after May 1, 1999, and \n     before July 1, 1999.\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The proposal is effective for wages paid or incurred to a \n     qualified individual who begins work for an employer on or \n     after May 1, 1999, and before July 1, 1999.\n\n\nD. Extend the Deduction Provided for Contributions of Appreciated Stock \nto Private Foundations (sec. 104 of the bill and sec. 170(e)(5) of the \n                                 Code)\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       In computing taxable income, a taxpayer who itemizes \n     deductions generally is allowed to deduct the fair market \n     value of property contributed to a charitable \n     organization.\\4\\ However, in the case of a charitable \n     contribution of short-term gain, inventory, or other ordinary \n     income property, the amount of the deduction generally is \n     limited to the taxpayer's basis in the property. In the case \n     of a charitable contribution of tangible personal property, \n     the deduction is limited to the taxpayer's basis in such \n     property if the use by the recipient charitable organization \n     is unrelated to the organization's tax-exempt purpose.\n       In cases involving contributions to a private foundation \n     (other than certain private operating foundations), the \n     amount of the deduction is limited to the taxpayer's basis in \n     the property. However, under a special rule contained in \n     section 170(e)(5), taxpayers are allowed a deduction equal to \n     the fair market value of ``qualified appreciated stock'' \n     contributed to a private foundation prior to July 1, 1998. \n     Qualified appreciated stock is defined as publicly traded \n     stock which is capital gain property. The fair-market-value \n     deduction for qualified appreciated stock donations applies \n     only to the extent that total donations made by the donor to \n     private foundations of stock in a particular corporation did \n     not exceed 10 percent of the outstanding stock of that \n     corporation. For this purpose, an individual is treated as \n     making all contributions that were made by any member of the \n     individual's family.\n\n                        Description of Proposal\n\n       The proposal extends the special rule contained in section \n     170(e)(5) for one year--for contributions of qualified \n     appreciated stock made to private foundations during the \n     period July 1, 1998, through June 30, 1999.\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The proposal is effective for contributions of qualified \n     appreciated stock to private\n\n[[Page S12330]]\n\n     foundations made during the period July 1, 1998, through June \n     30, 1999.\n\n\ne. exceptions under subpart f for certain active financing income (sec. \n           105 of the bill and secs. 953 and 954 of the code)\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     In general\n       Under the subpart F rules, certain U.S. shareholders of a \n     controlled foreign corporation (``CFC'') are subject to U.S. \n     tax currently on certain income earned by the CFC, whether or \n     not such income is distributed to the shareholders. The \n     income subject to current inclusion under the subpart F rules \n     includes, among other things, ``foreign personal holding \n     company income'' and insurance income. The U.S. 10-percent \n     shareholders of a CFC also are subject to current inclusion \n     with respect to their shares of the CFC's foreign base \n     company services income (i.e., income derived from services \n     performed for a related person outside the country in which \n     the CFC is organized).\n       Foreign personal holding company income generally consists \n     of the following: (1) dividends, interest, royalties, rents \n     and annuities; (2) net gains from the sale or exchange of (a) \n     property that gives rise to the preceding types of income, \n     (b) property that does not give rise to income, and (c) \n     interests in trusts, partnerships, and REMICs; (3) net gains \n     from commodities transactions; (4) net gains from foreign \n     currency transactions; (5) income that is equivalent to \n     interest; (6) income from notional principal contracts; and \n     (7) payments in lieu of dividends.\n       Insurance income subject to current inclusion under the \n     subpart F rules includes any income of a CFC attributable to \n     the issuing or reinsuring of any insurance or annuity \n     contract in connection with risks located in a country other \n     than the CFC's country of organization. Subpart F insurance \n     income also includes income attributable to an insurance \n     contract in connection with risks located within the CFC's \n     country of organization, as the result of an arrangement \n     under which another corporation receives a substantially \n     equal amount of consideration for insurance of other-country \n     risks. Investment income of a CFC that is allocable to any \n     insurance or annuity contract related to risks located \n     outside the CFC's country of organization is taxable as \n     subpart F insurance income (Prop. Treas. Reg. sec. 1.953-\n     1(a)).\n       Temporary exceptions from foreign personal holding company \n     income and foreign base company services income apply for \n     subpart F purposes for certain income that is derived in the \n     active conduct of a banking, financing, insurance, or similar \n     business.\\5\\ These exceptions (described below) are \n     applicable only for taxable years beginning in 1998.\n     Income from the active conduct of a banking, financing, or \n         similar business\n       A temporary exception from foreign personal holding company \n     income applies to income that is derived in the active \n     conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business by a CFC \n     that is predominantly engaged in the active conduct of such \n     business. For this purpose, income derived in the active \n     conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business \n     generally is determined under the principles applicable in \n     determining financial services income for foreign tax credit \n     limitation purposes. However, in the case of a corporation \n     that is engaged in the active conduct of a banking or \n     securities business, the income that is eligible for this \n     exception is determined under the principles applicable in \n     determining the income which is treated as nonpassive income \n     for purposes of the passive foreign investment company \n     provisions. In this regard, the income of a corporation \n     engaged in the active conduct of banking or securities \n     business that is eligible for this exception is the income \n     that is treated as nonpassive under the regulations proposed \n     under section 1296(b) (as in effect prior to the enactment of \n     the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997). See Prop. Treas. Reg. secs. \n     1.1296-4 and 1.1296-6. The Secretary of the Treasury is \n     directed to prescribe regulations applying look-through \n     treatment in characterizing for this purpose dividends, \n     interest, income equivalent to interest, rents and royalties \n     from related persons.\n       For purposes of the temporary exception, a corporation is \n     considered to be predominantly engaged in the active conduct \n     of banking, financing, or similar business if it is engaged \n     in the active conduct of a banking or securities business or \n     is a qualified bank affiliate or qualified securities \n     affiliate. In this regard, a corporation is considered to be \n     engaged in the active conduct of a banking or securities \n     business if the corporation would be treated as so engaged \n     under the regulations proposed under prior law section \n     1296(b) (as in effect prior to the enactment of the Taxpayer \n     Relief Act of 1997); qualified bank affiliates and qualified \n     securities affiliates are as determined under such proposed \n     regulations. See Prop. Treas. Reg. secs. 1.1296-4 and 1.1296-\n     6.\n       Alternatively, a corporation is considered to be engaged in \n     the active conduct of a banking, financing, or similar \n     business if more than 70 percent of its gross income is \n     derived from such business from transactions with unrelated \n     persons located within the country under the laws of which \n     the corporation is created or organized. For this purpose, \n     income derived by a qualified business unit (``QBU'') of a \n     corporation from transactions with unrelated persons located \n     in the country in which the QBU maintains its principal \n     office and conducts substantial business activity is treated \n     as derived by the corporation from transactions with \n     unrelated persons located within the country in which the \n     corporation is created or organized. A person other than a \n     natural person is considered to be located within the country \n     in which it maintains an office through which it engages in a \n     trade or business and by which the transaction is effected. A \n     natural person is treated as located within the country in \n     which such person is physically located when such person \n     enters into the transaction.\n     Income from the active conduct of an insurance business\n       A temporary exception from foreign personal holding company \n     income applies for certain investment income of a qualifying \n     insurance company with respect to risks located within the \n     CFC's country of creation or organization. These rules differ \n     from the rules of section 953 of the Code, which determines \n     the subpart F inclusions of a U.S. shareholder relating to \n     insurance income of a CFC. Such insurance income under \n     section 953 generally is computed in accordance with the \n     rules of subchapter L of the Code.\n       A temporary exception applies for income (received from a \n     person other than a related person) from investments made by \n     a qualifying insurance company of its reserves or 80 percent \n     of its unearned premiums. For this purpose, in the case of \n     contracts regulated in the country in which sold as property, \n     casualty or health insurance contracts, unearned premiums and \n     reserves are defined as unearned premiums and reserves for \n     losses incurred determined using the methods and interest \n     rates that would be used if the qualifying insurance company \n     were subject to tax under subchapter L of the Code. Thus, for \n     this purposed, unearned premiums are determined in accordance \n     with section 832(b)(4), and reserves for losses incurred are \n     determined in accordance with section 832(b)(5) and 846 of \n     the Code (as well as any other rules applicable to a U.S. \n     property and casualty insurance company with respect to such \n     amounts).\n       In the case of a contract regulated in the country in which \n     sold as a life insurance or annuity contract, the following \n     three alternative rules for determining reserves apply. Any \n     one of the three rules can be elected with respect to a \n     particular line of business.\n       First, reserves for such contracts can be determined \n     generally under the rules applicable to domestic life \n     insurance companies under subchapter L of the Code, using the \n     methods there specified, but substituting for the interest \n     rates in Code section 807(d)(2)(B) an interest rate \n     determined for the country in which the qualifying insurance \n     company was created or organized, calculated in the same \n     manner as the mid-term applicable Federal interest rate \n     (``AFR``) (within the meaning of section 1274(d)).\n       Second, the reserves for such contracts can be determined \n     using a preliminary term foreign reserve method, except that \n     the interest rate to be used is the interest rate determined \n     for the country in which the qualifying insurance company was \n     created or organized, calculated in the same manner as the \n     mid-term AFR. If a qualifying insurance company uses such a \n     preliminary term method with respect to contracts insuring \n     risks located in the country in which the company is created \n     or organized, then such method is the method that applies for \n     purposes of this election.\n       Third, reserves for such contracts can be determined to be \n     equal to the net surrender value of the contract (as defined \n     in section 807(e)(1)(A).\n       In no event can the reserve for any contract at any time \n     exceed the foreign statement reserve for the contract, \n     reduced by any catastrophe or deficiency reserve. This rule \n     applies whether the contract is regulated as a property, \n     casualty, health, life insurance, annuity or any other type \n     of contract.\n       A temporary exception from foreign personal holding company \n     income also applies for income from investment of assets \n     equal to: (1) one-third of premiums earned during the taxable \n     year on insurance contracts regulated in the country in which \n     sold as property, casualty, or health insurance contracts; \n     and (2) the greater of 10 percent of reserves, or, in the \n     case of qualifying insurance company that is a startup \n     company, $10 million. For this purpose, a startup company is \n     a company (including any predecessor) that has not been \n     engaged in the active conduct of an insurance business for \n     more than 5 years. In general, the 5-year period commences \n     when the foreign company first is engaged in the active \n     conduct of an insurance business. If the foreign company was \n     formed before being acquired by the U.S. shareholder, the 5-\n     year period commences when the acquired company first was \n     engaged in the active conduct of an insurance business. In \n     the event of the acquisition of a book of business from \n     another company through an assumption or indemnity \n     reinsurance transaction, the 5-year period commences when the \n     acquiring company first engaged in the active conduct of an \n     insurance business, except that if more than a substantial \n     part (e.g., 80 percent) of the business of the ceding company \n     is acquired, then the 5-year period commences when the ceding \n     company first engaged in the active conduct of an insurance \n     business. Reinsurance transactions among related persons may \n     not be used to multiply the number of 5-year periods.\n       Under rules prescribed by the Secretary, income is \n     allocated to contracts as follows.\n\n[[Page S12331]]\n\n     In the case of contracts that are separate account-type \n     contracts (including variable contracts not meeting the \n     requirements of sec. 817), only the income specifically \n     allocable to such contracts are taken into account. In the \n     case of other contracts, income not specifically allocable is \n     allocated ratably among such contracts.\n       A qualifying insurance company is defined as any entity \n     which: (1) is regulated as an insurance company under the \n     laws of the country in which it is incorporated; (2) derived \n     at least 50 percent of its net written premiums from the \n     insurance or reinsurance of risks situated within its country \n     of incorporation; and (3) is engaged in the active conduct of \n     an insurance business and would be subject to tax under \n     subchapter L if it were a domestic corporation.\n       The temporary exceptions do not apply to investment income \n     (includable in the income of a U.S. shareholder of a CFC \n     pursuant to sec. 953) allocable to contracts that insure \n     related party risks or risks located in a country other than \n     the country in which the qualifying insurance company is \n     created or organized.\n     Anti-abuse rule\n       An anti-abuse rule applies for purposes of these temporary \n     exceptions. For purposes of applying these exceptions, items \n     with respect to a transaction or series of transactions are \n     disregarded if one of the principal purposes of the \n     transaction or transactions is to qualify income or gain for \n     these exceptions, including any change in the method of \n     computing reserves or any other transaction or transactions \n     one of the principal purposes of which is the acceleration or \n     deferral of any item in order to claim the benefits of these \n     exceptions.\n     Foreign base company services income\n       A temporary exception from foreign base company services \n     income applies for income derived from services performed in \n     connection with the active conduct of a banking, financing, \n     insurance or similar business by a CFC that is predominantly \n     engaged in the active conduct of such business or is a \n     qualifying insurance company.\n\n                        Description of Proposal\n\n       The proposal extends for one year the present-law temporary \n     exceptions from foreign personal holding company income and \n     foreign base company services income for income that is \n     derived in the active conduct of a banking, financing, \n     insurance or similar business.\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The proposal applies only to the first full taxable year of \n     a foreign corporation beginning in 1998 and to the taxable \n     year of such corporation immediately following such first \n     full taxable year, and to taxable years of U.S. shareholders \n     with or within which such taxable years of such foreign \n     corporation end.

Those programs include--\n       (1) The general TAA program for workers provides training \n     and income support for workers adversely affected by import \n     competition.\n       (2) The TAA program for firms provides technical assistance \n     by qualifying firms.\n       (3) The third program, the North American Free Trade \n     Agreement (``NAFTA'') program for workers (established by the \n     North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act of \n     1993) provides training and income support for workers \n     adversely affected by trade with or production shifts to \n     Canada and/or Mexico.\n       All three TAA programs expired on September 30, 1998.

Other Tax Provisions\n\n\n a. increase deduction for health insurance expenses of self-employed \n     individuals (sec. 201 of the bill and sec. 162(l) of the Code)\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Under present law, self-employed individuals are entitled \n     to deduct a portion of the amount paid for health insurance \n     for the self-employed individual and the individual's spouse \n     and dependents. The deduction for health insurance expenses \n     of self-employed individuals is not available for any month \n     in which the taxpayer is eligible to participate in a \n     subsidized health plan maintained by the employer of the \n     taxpayer or the taxpayer's spouse. The deduction is available \n     in the case of self insurance as well as commercial \n     insurance. The self-insured plan must in fact be insurance \n     (e.g., there must be appropriate risk shifting) and not \n     merely a reimbursement arrangement.\n       The portion of health insurance expenses of self-employed \n     individuals that is deductible is 45 percent for taxable \n     years beginning in 1998 and 1999, 50 percent for taxable \n     years beginning in 2000 and 2001, 60 percent for taxable \n     years beginning in 2002, 80 percent for taxable years \n     beginning in 2003, 2004, and 2005, 90 percent for taxable \n     years beginning in 2006, and 100 percent for taxable years \n     beginning in 2007 and thereafter.\n       Under present law, employees can exclude from income 100 \n     percent of employer-provided health insurance.\n\n                        Description of Proposal\n\n       The proposal increases the deduction for health insurance \n     of self-employed individuals to 70 percent for taxable years \n     beginning in 2001 and to 100 percent for taxable years \n     beginning in 2002 and thereafter.\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The proposal is effective for taxable years beginning after \n     December 31, 2000.\n\n\nb. farm production flexibility contract payments (sec. 202 of the bill)\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       A taxpayer generally is required to include an item in \n     income no later than the time of its actual or constructive \n     receipt, unless such amount properly is accounted for in a \n     different period under the taxpayer's method of accounting. \n     If a taxpayer has an unrestricted right to demand the payment \n     of an amount, the taxpayer is in constructive receipt of that \n     amount whether or not the taxpayer makes the demand and \n     actually receives the payment.\n\n[[Page S12332]]\n\n       The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 \n     (the ``FAIR Act'') provides for production flexibility \n     contracts between certain eligible owners and producers and \n     the Secretary of Agriculture. These contracts generally cover \n     crop years from 1996 through 2002. Annual payments are made \n     under such contracts at specific times during the Federal \n     government's fiscal year. Section 112(d)(2) of the FAIR Act \n     provides that one-half of each annual payment is to be made \n     on either December 15 or January 15 of the fiscal year, at \n     the option of the recipient.\\6\\ This option to receive the \n     payment on December 15 potentially results in the \n     constructive receipt (and thus potential inclusion in income) \n     of one-half of the annual payment at that time, even if the \n     option to receive the amount on January 15 is elected.\n       The remaining one-half of the annual payment must be made \n     no later than September 30 of the fiscal year. The Emergency \n     Farm Financial Relief Act of 1998 added section 112(d)(3) to \n     the FAIR Act which provides that all payments for fiscal year \n     1999 are to be paid at such time or times during fiscal year \n     1999 as the recipient may specify. Thus, the one-half of the \n     annual amount that would otherwise be required to be paid no \n     later than September 30, 1999 can be specified for payment in \n     calendar year 1998. This potentially results in the \n     constructive receipt (and thus required inclusion in taxable \n     income) of such amounts in calendar year 1998, whether or not \n     the amounts actually are received or the right to their \n     receipt is fixed.\n\n                        Description of Proposal\n\n       The time a production flexibility contract payment under \n     the FAIR Act properly is includable in income is determined \n     without regard to the options granted by section 112(d)(2) \n     (allowing receipt of one-half of the annual payment on either \n     December 15 or January 15 of the fiscal year) or section \n     112(d)(3) (allowing the acceleration of all payments for \n     fiscal year 1999) of that Act.\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The proposal is effective for production flexibility \n     contract payments made under the FAIR Act in taxable years \n     ending after December 31, 1995.\n\n\nC. Permanent Extension of Income Averaging for Farmers (sec. 203 of the \n                    bill and sec. 1301 of the Code)\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       An individual engaged in a farming business may elect to \n     compute his or her current year tax liability by averaging, \n     over the prior three-year period, all or a portion of the \n     taxable income that is attributable to the farming business.\n       In general, an individual who makes the election (1) \n     designates all or a portion of his or her taxable income \n     attributable to any farming business from the current year as \n     ``elected farm income;'' \\7\\ (2) allocates one-third of the \n     elected farm income to each of the three prior taxable years; \n     and (3) determines the current year section 1 tax liability \n     by combining (a) his or her current year section 1 tax \n     liability excluding the elected farm income allocated to the \n     three prior taxable years, plus (b) the increases in the \n     section 1 tax liability for each of the three prior taxable \n     years caused by including one-third of the elected farm \n     income in each such year. Any allocation of elected farm \n     income pursuant to the election applies for purposes of any \n     election in a subsequent taxable year.\n       The provision does not apply for employment tax purposes, \n     or to an estate or a trust. The provision also does not apply \n     for purposes of the alternative minimum tax. The provision is \n     effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     1997, and before January 1, 2001.\n\n                        Description of Proposal\n\n       The proposal permanently extends the income averaging \n     provision for farmers.\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The proposal is effective for taxable years beginning after \n     December 31, 2000.\n\n\nD. Personal Credits Fully Allowed Against Regular Tax Liability During \n          1998 (sec. 204 of the bill and sec. 26 of the Code)\n\n       Present law provides for certain nonrefundable personal tax \n     credits (i.e., the dependent care credit, the credit for the \n     elderly and disabled, the adoption credit, the child tax \n     credit, the credit for interest on certain home mortgages, \n     the HOPE Scholarship and Lifetime Learning credits, and the \n     D.C. homebuyer's credit). Generally, these credits are \n     allowed only to the extent that the individual's regular \n     income tax liability exceeds the individual's tentative \n     minimum tax (determined without regard to the AMT foreign tax \n     credit).\n       The tentative minimum tax is an amount equal to (1) 26 \n     percent of the first $175,000 ($87,500 in the case of a \n     married individual filing a separate return) of alternative \n     minimum taxable income (``AMTI'') in excess of a phased-out \n     exemption amount and (2) 28 percent of the remaining AMTI. \n     The maximum tax rates on net capital gain used in computing \n     the tentative minimum tax are the same as under the regular \n     tax. AMTI is the individual's taxable income adjusted to take \n     account of specified preferences and adjustments. The \n     exemption amounts are: (1) $45,000 in the case of married \n     individuals filing a joint return and surviving spouses; (2) \n     $33,750 in the case of other unmarried individuals; and (3) \n     $22,500 in the case of married individuals filing a separate \n     return, estates and trusts. The exemption amounts are phased \n     out by an amount equal to 25 percent of the amount by which \n     the individual's AMTI exceeds (1) $150,000 in the case of \n     married individuals filing a joint return and surviving \n     spouses, (2) $112,500 in the case of other unmarried \n     individuals, and (3) $75,000 in the case of married \n     individuals filing separate returns or an estate or a trust. \n     These amounts are not indexed for inflation.\n       For families with three or more qualifying children, an \n     additional child credit is provided which may offset the \n     liability for social security taxes to the extent that tax \n     liability exceeds the amount of the earned income credit. The \n     additional child credit is reduced by the amount of the \n     individual's minimum tax liability (i.e., the amount by which \n     the tentative minimum tax exceeds the regular tax liability).\n\n                        Description of Proposal\n\n       The proposal allows the nonrefundable personal credits to \n     offset the individual's regular tax in full for taxable years \n     beginning in 1998 (as opposed to only the amount by which the \n     regular tax exceeds the tentative minimum tax, as under \n     present law).\n       The provision of present law that reduces the additional \n     child credit by the amount of an individual's AMT will not \n     apply for taxable years beginning in 1998.\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The proposal is effective for taxable years beginning in \n     1998.\n\n                  Title III. Revenue Offset Provision\n\n\n    A. treatment of certain deductible liquidating distributions of \nregulated investment companies and real estate investment trusts (sec. \n           301 of the bill and secs. 332 and 334 of the code)\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Regulated investment companies (``RICs'') and real estate \n     investment trusts (``REITs'') are allowed a deduction for \n     dividends paid to their shareholders. The deduction for \n     dividends paid includes amounts distributed in liquidation \n     which are properly chargeable to earnings and profits, as \n     well as, in the case of a complete liquidation occurring \n     within 24 months after the adoption of a plan of complete \n     liquidation, any distribution made pursuant to such plan to \n     the extent of earnings and profits. Rules that govern the \n     receipt of dividends from RICs and REITs generally provide \n     for including the amount of the dividend in the income of the \n     shareholder receiving the dividend that was deducted by the \n     RIC or REIT. Generally, any shareholder realizing gain from a \n     liquidating distribution of a RIC or REIT includes the amount \n     of gain in the shareholder's income. However, in the case of \n     a liquidating distribution to a corporation owning 80-percent \n     of the stock of the distributing corporation, a separate rule \n     generally provides that the distribution is tax-free to the \n     parent corporation. The parent corporation succeeds to the \n     tax attributes, including the adjusted basis of assets, of \n     the distributing corporation. Under these rules, a \n     liquidating RIC or REIT might be allowed a deduction for \n     amounts paid to its parent corporation, without a \n     corresponding inclusion in the income of the parent \n     corporation, resulting in income being subject to no tax.\n       A RIC or REIT may designate a portion of a dividend as a \n     capital gain dividend to the extent the RIC or REIT itself \n     has a net capital gain, and a RIC may designate a portion of \n     the dividend paid to a corporate shareholder as eligible for \n     the 70-percent dividends-received deduction to the extent the \n     RIC itself received dividends from other corporations. If \n     certain conditions are satisfied, a RIC also is permitted to \n     pass through to its shareholders the tax-exempt character of \n     the RIC's net income from tax-exempt obligations through the \n     payment of ``exempt interest dividends,'' though no deduction \n     is allowed for such dividends.\n\n                        Description of Proposal\n\n       Any amount which a liquidating RIC or REIT may take as a \n     deduction for dividends paid with respect to an otherwise \n     tax-free liquidating distribution to an 80-percent corporate \n     owner is includible in the income of the recipient \n     corporation. The includible amount is treated as a dividend \n     received from the RIC or REIT. The liquidating corporation \n     may designate the amount distributed as a capital gain \n     dividend or, in the case of a RIC, a dividend eligible for \n     the 70-percent dividends received deduction or an exempt \n     interest dividend, to the extent provided by the RIC or REIT \n     provisions of the Code.\n       The provision does not otherwise change the tax treatment \n     of the distribution to the parent corporation or to the RIC \n     or REIT. Thus, for example, the liquidating corporation will \n     not recognize gain (if any) on the liquidating distribution \n     and the recipient corporation will hold the assets at a \n     carryover basis, even where the amount received is treated as \n     a dividend.\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for distributions on or after \n     May 22, 1998, regardless of when the plan of liquidation was \n     adopted.\n       No inference is intended regarding the treatment of such \n     transactions under present law.\n\n                  Title IV. Tax Technical Corrections\n\n       Except as otherwise provided, the technical corrections \n     contained in the bill generally are effective as if included \n     in the originally enacted related legislation.\n\n[[Page S12333]]\n\n                a. technical corrections to the 1998 act\n\n     1. Burden of proof (sec. 402(b) of the bill, sec. 3001 of the \n         1998 Act, and sec. 7491(a)(2)(C) of the Code)\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       The Treasury Secretary has the burden of proof in any court \n     proceeding with respect to a factual issue if the taxpayer \n     introduces credible evidence with respect to any factual \n     issue relevant to ascertaining the taxpayer's tax liability, \n     provided specified conditions are satisfied (sec. 7491). One \n     of these conditions if that corporations, trust, and \n     partnerships must meet certain net worth limitations. These \n     net worth limitations do not apply to individuals or to \n     estates.\n\n                        Description of Proposal\n\n       The proposal removes that net worth limitation from certain \n     revocable trusts for the same period of time that the trust \n     would have been treated as part of the estate had the trust \n     made the election under section 645 to be treated as part of \n     the estate.\n     2. Relief for innocent spouses (sec. 402(c) of the bill, sec. \n         3201 of the 1998 Act, and secs. 6015(e) and 7421(a) of \n         the Code)\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       A taxpayer who is no longer married to, is separated from, \n     or has been living apart for at least 12 months from the \n     person with whom he or she originally joined in filing a \n     joint Federal income tax return may elect to limit his or her \n     liability for a deficiency arising from such joint return to \n     the amount of the deficiency that is attributable to items \n     that are allocable to such electing spouse. The election is \n     limited to deficiency situations and only affects the amount \n     of the deficiency for which the electing spouse is liable. \n     Thus, the election cannot be used to generate a refund, to \n     direct a refund to one spouse or the other, or to allocate \n     responsibility for payment where a balance due is reported \n     on, but not paid with, a joint return.\n       In addition to the election to limit the liability for \n     deficiencies, a taxpayer may be eligible for innocent spouse \n     relief. Innocent spouse relief allows certain taxpayers who \n     joined in the filing of a joint return to be relieved of \n     liability for an understatement of tax that is attributable \n     to items of the other spouse to the extent that the taxpayer \n     did not know or have reason to know of the understatement. \n     The Secretary is also authorized to provide equitable relief \n     in situations where, taking into account all of the facts and \n     circumstances, it is inequitable to hold an individual \n     responsible for all or part of any unpaid tax or deficiency \n     arising from a joint return. Under certain circumstances, it \n     is possible that a refund could be obtained under this \n     authority.\n\n                        Description of Proposal\n\n       The proposal clarifies that the ability to obtain a credit \n     or refund of Federal income tax is limited to situations \n     where the taxpayer qualifies for innocent spouse relief or \n     where the Secretary exercises his authority to provide \n     equitable relief.\n     3. Interest netting (sec. 402(d) of the bill and sec. \n         3301(c)(2) of the 1998 Act)\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Fro calendar quarters beginning after July 22, 1998, a net \n     interest rate of zero applies where interest is payable and \n     allowable on equivalent amounts of overpayment and \n     underpayment of any tax imposed by the Internet Revenue Code. \n     In addition, the net interest rate of zero applies to periods \n     on or before July 22, 1998, providing (1) the statute of \n     limitations has not expired with respect to either the \n     underpayment or overpayment, (2) the taxpayer identifies the \n     periods of underpayment and overpayment where interest is \n     payable and allowable for which the net interest rate of zero \n     would apply, and (3) on or before December 31, 1999, the \n     taxpayer asks the Secretary to apply the net zero rate.\n\n                        Description of Proposal\n\n       The proposal restores language originally included in the \n     Senate amendment that clarifies that the applicability of the \n     zero net interest rate for periods on or before July 22, 1998 \n     is subject to any applicable statute of limitations not \n     having expired with regard to either a tax underpayment or \n     overpayment.\n     4. Effective date for elimination of 18-month holding period \n         for capital gains (sec. 402(i) of the bill, sec. 5001 of \n         the 1998 Act, and sec. 1(h) of the Code)\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       The 1998 Act repealed the provision in the 1997 Act \n     providing a maximum 28-percent rate for the long-term capital \n     gain attributable to property held more than one year but not \n     more than 18 months. Instead, the 1998 Act treated this gain \n     in the same manner as gain from property held more than 18 \n     months. The provision in the 1998 Act is effective for \n     amounts properly taken into account after December 31, 1997. \n     For gains taken into account by a pass-thru entity, such as a \n     partnership, S corporation, trust, estate, RCI or REIT, the \n     date that the entity properly took the gain into account is \n     the appropriate date in applying this provision. Thus, for \n     example, amounts properly taken into account by a pass-thru \n     entity after July 28, 1997, and before January 1, 1998, \n     with respect to property held more than one year but not \n     more than 18 months which are included in income on an \n     individual's 1998 return are taken into account in \n     computing 28-percent rate gain.\n\n                        Description of Proposal\n\n       Under the proposal, in the case of a capital gain dividend \n     made by a RIC or REIT after 1997, no amount will be taken \n     into account in computing the net gain or loss in the 28-\n     percent rate gain category by reason of property being held \n     more than one year but not more than 18 months, other than \n     amounts taken into account by the RIC or REIT from other \n     pass-thru entities (other than in structures, such as a \n     ``master-feeder structure'', in which the RIC invests a \n     substantial portion of its assets in one or more partnerships \n     holding portfolio securities and having the same taxable year \n     as the RIC). A similar rule applies to amounts properly taken \n     into account by a RIC or REIT by reason of holding, directly \n     or indirectly, an interest in another RIC or REIT to which \n     the rule in the preceding sentence applies.\n       For example, if a RIC sold stock held more than one year \n     but not more than 18 months on November 15, 1997, for a gain, \n     and makes a capital gain dividend in 1998, the gain is not \n     taken into account in computing 28-percent rate gain for \n     purposes of determining the taxation of the 1998 dividend. \n     (Thus, all the netting and computations made by the RIC need \n     to be redone with respect to all post-1997 capital gain \n     dividends, whether or not dividends of 28-percent rate gain.) \n     If, however, the gain was taken into account by a RIC by \n     reason of holding an interest in a calendar year 1997 \n     partnership which itself sold the stock, the gain will not be \n     recharacterized by reason of this proposal (unless the RIC's \n     investment in the partnership satisfies the exception for \n     master-feeder structures). If the gain was taken into account \n     by a RIC by reason of holding an interest in a REIT and the \n     gain was excluded from 28-percent rate gain by reason of the \n     application of this proposal to the REIT, the gain will be \n     excluded from 28-percent rate gain in determining the tax of \n     the RIC shareholders.\n       The proposal also corrects a cross reference.\n\n\n                b. technical corrections to the 1997 act\n\n     1. Treatment of interest on qualified education loans (sec. \n         403(a) of the bill, sec. 202 of the 1997 Act, and secs. \n         221 and 163(h) of the Code)\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Present law, as modified by the 1997 Act, provides that \n     certain individuals who have paid interest on qualified \n     education loans may claim an above-the-line deduction for \n     such interest expense, up to a maximum dollar amount per year \n     ($1,000 for taxable years beginning in 1998), subject to \n     certain requirements (sec. 221). The maximum deduction is \n     phased out ratably for individual taxpayers with modified AGI \n     between $40,000 and $55,000 ($60,000 and $75,000 for joint \n     returns). Present law also provides that in the case of a \n     taxpayer other than a corporation, no deduction is allowed \n     for personal interest (sec. 163(h)). For this purpose, \n     personal interest means any interest allowable as a \n     deduction, other than certain types of interest listed in the \n     statute. This proposal does not specifically provide that \n     otherwise deductible qualified education loan interest is not \n     treated as personal interest.\n       Present law provides that a qualified education loan does \n     not include any indebtedness owed to a person who is related \n     (within the meaning of sec. 267(b) or 707(b)) to the taxpayer \n     (sec. 221(e)(1)).\n\n                        Description of Proposal\n\n       The proposal clarifies that otherwise deductible qualified \n     education loan interest is not treated as nondeductible \n     personal interest.\n       The proposal also clarifies that, for purposes of section \n     221, modified AGI is determined after application of section \n     135 (relating to income from certain U.S. savings bonds) and \n     section 137 (relating to adoption assistance programs).\n       The proposal also provides that a qualified education loan \n     does not include any indebtedness owed to any person by \n     reason of a loan under any qualified employer plan (as \n     defined in section 72(p)(4)) or under any contract purchased \n     under a qualified employer plan (as described in sec. \n     72(p)(5)).\n     2. Capital gain distributions of charitable remainder trusts \n         (secs. 402(i)(3) and 403(b) of the bill, sec. 311 of the \n         1997 Act and sec. 5001 of the 1998 Act, and sec. 1(h) of \n         the Code)\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Under present law, the income beneficiary of a charitable \n     remainder trust (``CRT'') includes the trust's capital gain \n     in income when the gains are distributed to the beneficiary \n     (sec. 664(b)(2)). Internal Revenue Service Notice 98-20 \n     provides guidance with respect to the categorization of \n     long-term gain distributions from a CRT under the capital \n     gain rules enacted by the 1997 Act. Under the Notice, \n     long-term capital gains properly taken into account by the \n     trust before January 1, 1997, are treated as falling in \n     the 20-percent group of gain (i.e., gain not in the 28-\n     percent rate gain or unrecaptured sec. 1250 gain). Long-\n     term capital gains properly taken into account by the \n     trust after December 31, 1996, and before May 7, 1997, are \n     included in 28-percent rate gain. Long-term capital gains \n     properly taken into account by the trust after May 6, \n     1997, are treated as falling into the category which would \n     apply if the trust itself were subject to tax.\n\n                        Description of Proposal\n\n       The proposal provides that, in the case of a capital gain \n     distribution by a CRT after December 31, 1997, with respect \n     to amounts\n\n[[Page S12334]]\n\n     properly taken into account by the trust during 1997, amounts \n     will not be included in the 28-percent rate gain category \n     solely by reason of being properly taken into account by the \n     trust before May 7, 1997, or by reason of the property being \n     held not more than 18 months. Thus, for example, gain on the \n     sale of stock by a CRT on February 1, 1997, will not be taken \n     into account in determining 28-percent rate gain where the \n     gain is distributed after 1997.\\8\\\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The proposal applies to taxable years beginning after \n     December 31, 1997.\n     3. Gifts may not be revalued for estate tax purposes after \n         expiration of statute of limitations (sec. 403(c) of the \n         bill, sec. 504 of the 1997 Act, and sec. 2001(f)(2) of \n         the Code)\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Basic structure of Federal estate and gift taxes.--The \n     Federal estate and gift taxes are unified so that a single \n     progressive rate schedule is applied to an individual's \n     cumulative gifts and bequests. The tax on gifts made in a \n     particular year is computed by determining the tax on the sum \n     of the taxable gifts made in that year and in all prior years \n     and then subtracting the tax on the prior years taxable gifts \n     and the unified credit. Similarly, the estate tax is computed \n     by determining the tax on the sum of the taxable estate and \n     prior taxable gifts and then subtracting the tax on taxable \n     gifts, the unified credit, and certain other credits.\n       This structure raises two different, but related, issues: \n     (1) what is the period beyond which additional gift taxes \n     cannot be assessed or collected--generically referred to as \n     the ``period of limitations''--and (2) what is the period \n     beyond which the amount of prior transfers cannot be revalued \n     for the purpose of determining the amount of tax on \n     subsequent transfers.\n       Gift and estate tax period of limitations.--Section 6501(a) \n     provides the general rule that any tax (including gift and \n     estate tax) must be assessed, or a proceeding begun in a \n     court for the collection of such tax without assessment, \n     within three years after the return is filed by the taxpayer. \n     Under section 6501(e)(2), the period for assessments of gift \n     or estate tax is increased to six years where there is more \n     than a 25 percent omission in the amount of the total gifts \n     or gross estate disclosed on the gift or estate tax return. \n     Section 6501(c)(9) provides an exception to these rules under \n     which gift tax may be assessed, or a proceeding in a court \n     for collection of gift tax may be begun, at any time unless \n     the gift is disclosed on a gift tax return or a statement \n     attached to a gift tax return.\n       Revaluation of gifts for estate tax purposes.--The value of \n     a gift is its value as finally determined under the rules for \n     purposes of determining the applicable estate tax bracket and \n     available unified credit. The value of a gift is finally \n     determined if (1) the value of the gift is shown on a gift \n     tax return for that gift and that value is not contested by \n     the Treasury Secretary before the expiration of the period of \n     limitations on assessment of gift tax even where the value of \n     the gift as shown on the return does not result in any gift \n     tax being owned (e.g., through use of the unified credit), \n     (2) the value is specified by the Treasury Secretary pursuant \n     to a final notice of redetermination of value (a ``final \n     notice'') within the period of limitations applicable to the \n     gift for gift tax purposes (generally, three years) and the \n     taxpayer does not timely contest that value, or (3) the value \n     is determined by a court or pursuant of a settlement \n     agreement between the taxpayer and the Treasury Secretary \n     under an administrative appeals process whereby a taxpayer \n     can challenge a redetermination of value by the IRS prior to \n     issuance of a final notice. In the event the taxpayer and the \n     IRS cannot agree on the value of a gift, the 1997 Act \n     provided the U.S. Tax Court with jurisdiction to issue a \n     declaratory judgment on the value of a gift (section 7477). A \n     taxpayer who is mailed a final notice may challenge the \n     redetermined value of the gift (as contained in the final \n     notice) by filing a motion for a declaratory judgment with \n     the U.S. Tax Court. The motion must be filed on or before 90 \n     days from the date that the final notice was mailed. The \n     statute of limitations is tolled during the pendency of the \n     Tax Court proceeding.\n       Revaluation of gifts for gift tax purposes.--Similarly, \n     under a rule applicable to the computation of the gift tax \n     (sec. 2504(c)), the value of gifts made in prior years is its \n     value as finally determined if the period of limitations for \n     assessment of gift tax on the prior gifts has expired.\n\n                        Description of Proposal\n\n       The bill clarifies the rules relating to revaluations of \n     prior transfers for computation of the estate or gift tax to \n     provide that the value of a prior transfer cannot be \n     redetermined after the period of limitations if the transfer \n     was disclosed in a statement attached to the gift tax return, \n     as well as on a gift tax return, in a manner to adequately \n     apprise the Treasury Secretary of the nature the transfer, \n     even if there was no gift tax imposed on that transfer.\n     4. Coordinate Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund \n         expenditure purposes with list of taxable vaccines (sec. \n         403(d) of the bill, sec. 904 of the 1997 Act, and sec. \n         9510(c) of the Code)\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       A manufacturer's excise tax is imposed on certain vaccines \n     routinely recommended for administration to children (sec. \n     4131). The tax is imposed at a rate of $0.75 per dose on any \n     listed vaccine component. Taxable vaccine components are \n     vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, measles, \n     mumps, rubella, polio, HIB (haemophilus influenza type B), \n     hepatitis B, and varicella (chicken pox). Tax was imposed on \n     vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, measles, \n     mumps, rubella, and polio by the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1987. Tax was imposed on vaccines \n     against HIB, hepatitis B, and varicella by the 1997 Act.\n       Amounts equal to net revenues from this excise tax are \n     deposited in the Vaccine Injury Compensation Trust Fund \n     (``Vaccine Trust Fund'') to finance compensation awards under \n     the Federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Program for \n     individuals who suffer certain injuries following \n     administration of the taxable vaccines. Present law provides \n     that payments from the Vaccine Trust Fund may be made only \n     for vaccines eligible under the program as of December 22, \n     1987 (sec. 9510(c)(1)). Thus, payments may not be made for \n     injuries related to the HIB, hepatitis B or varicella \n     vaccines.\n\n                        Description of Proposal\n\n       The proposal provides that payments are permitted from the \n     Vaccine Trust Fund for injuries related to the administration \n     of the HIB, hepatitis B, and varicella vaccines. The proposal \n     also clarifies that expenditures from the Vaccine Trust Fund \n     may occur only as provided in the Code and makes conforming \n     amendments.\n     5. Abatement of interest by reason of Presidentially declared \n         disaster (sec. 403(e) of the bill, sec. 915 of the 1997 \n         Act, and sec. 6404(h) of the Code)\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (``1997 Act'') provided \n     that, if the Secretary of the Treasury extends the filing \n     date of an individual tax return for 1997 for individuals \n     living in an area that has been declared a disaster area by \n     the President during 1997, no interest shall be charged as a \n     result of the failure of an individual taxpayer to file an \n     individual tax return, or pay the taxes shown on such return, \n     during the extension.\n       The Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act \n     of 1998 (``1998 Act'') contains a similar rule applicable to \n     all taxpayers for tax years beginning after 1997 for \n     disasters declared after 1997. The status of disasters \n     declared in 1998 but that relate to the 1997 tax year is \n     unclear.\n\n                        Description of Proposal\n\n       The proposal amends the 1997 Act rule so that it is \n     available for disasters declared in 1997 or in 1998 with \n     respect to the 1997 tax year.\n     6. Treatment of certain corporate distributions (sec. 403(f) \n         of the bill, sec. 1012 of the 1997 Act, and secs. 351(c) \n         and 368(a)(2)(H) of the Code)\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       The 1997 Act (sec. 1012(a)) requires a distributing \n     corporation to recognize corporate level gain on the \n     distribution of stock of a controlled corporation under \n     section 355 of the Code if, pursuant to a plan or series of \n     related transactions, one or more persons acquire a 50-\n     percent or greater interest (defined as 50 percent or more of \n     the voting power or value of the stock) of either the \n     distributing or controlled corporation (Code sec. 355(e)). \n     Certain transactions are excepted from the definition of \n     acquisition for this purpose. Under the technical corrections \n     included in the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and \n     Reform Act of 1998, in the case of acquisitions under section \n     355(e)(3)(A)(iv), the acquisition of stock in the \n     distributing corporation or any controlled corporation is \n     disregarded to the extent that the percentage of stock owned \n     directly or indirectly in such corporation by each person \n     owning stock in such corporation immediately before the \n     acquisition does not decrease.\\9\\\n       In the case of a 50-percent or more acquisition of either \n     the distributing corporation or the controlled corporation, \n     the amount of gain recognized is the amount that the \n     distributing corporation would have recognized had the stock \n     of the controlled corporation been sold for fair market value \n     on the date of the distribution. No adjustment to the basis \n     of the stock or assets of either corporation is allowed by \n     reason of the recognition of the gain.\\10\\\n       The 1997 Act (as amended by the technical corrections \n     contained in the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and \n     Reform Act of 1998) also modified certain rules for \n     determining control immediately after a distribution in the \n     case of certain divisive transactions in which a controlled \n     corporation is distributed and the transaction meets the \n     requirements of section 355. In such cases, under section 351 \n     and modified section 368(a)(2)(H) with respect to \n     reorganizations under section 368(a)(1)(D), the fact that the \n     shareholders of the distributing corporation dispose of part \n     or all of the distributed stock shall not be taken into \n     account.\n       The effective date (Act section 1012(d)(1)) states that the \n     relevant provisions of the 1997 Act apply to distributions \n     after April 16, 1997, pursuant to a plan (or series of \n     related transactions) which involves an acquisition occurring \n     after such date (unless certain transition provisions apply).\n\n                        Description of Proposal\n\n       The proposal clarifies the ``control immediately after'' \n     requirement of section 351(c) and section 368(a)(2)(H) in the \n     case of certain\n\n[[Page S12335]]\n\n     divisive transactions in which a corporation contributes \n     assets to a controlled corporation and then distributes the \n     stock of the controlled corporation in a transaction that \n     meets the requirements of section 355 (or so much of section \n     356 as related to section 355). In such cases, not only the \n     fact that the shareholders of the distributing corporation \n     dispose of part or all of the distributed stock, but also the \n     fact that the corporation whose stock was distributed issues \n     additional stock, shall not be taken into account.\n     7. Treatment of affiliated group including formerly tax-\n         exempt organization (sec. 403(g) of the bill and sec. \n         1042 of the 1997 Act)\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Present law provides that an organization described in \n     sections 501(c) (3) or (4) of the Code is exempt from tax \n     only if no substantial part of its activities consists of \n     providing commercial-type insurance. When this rule was \n     enacted in 1986, certain treatment applied to Blue Cross and \n     Blue Shield organizations providing health insurance that \n     were submitted to this rule and that met certain \n     requirements. Treasury regulations were promulgated providing \n     rules for filing consolidated returns for affiliated groups \n     including such organizations (Treas. Reg. sec. 1.1502-\n     75(d)(5)).\n       The 1997 act repealed the grandfather rules provided in \n     1986 (permitting the retention of tax-exempt status) that \n     were applicable to that portion of the business of the \n     Teachers Insurance Annuity Association and College Retirement \n     Equities Fund which is attributable to pension business and \n     to the portion of the business of Mutual of America which is \n     attributable to pension business. The 1997 Act did not \n     specifically provide rules for filing consolidated returns \n     for affiliated groups including such organizations.\n       Present law with respect to consolidated returns provides \n     for an election to treat a life insurance company as an \n     includable corporation, and also provides that a life \n     insurance company may not be treated as an includable \n     corporation for the 5 taxable years immediately preceding the \n     taxable year for which the consolidated return is filed (sec. \n     1504(c)(2)). Present law also provides that a corporation \n     that is exempt from taxation under Code section 501 is not an \n     includable corporation (sec. 1504(b)(1)).\n\n                        Description of Proposal\n\n       The proposal provides rules for filing consolidated returns \n     for affiliated groups including any organization with respect \n     to which the grandfather rule under Code section 501(m) was \n     repealed by section 1042 of the 1997 Act. The proposal \n     provides that rules similar to the rules of Treasury \n     Regulation section 1.1502-75(d)(5) apply in the case of such \n     an organization. Thus, an affiliated group including such an \n     organization may make the election described in section \n     1504(c)(2) (relating to a 5-year period) without regard to \n     whether the organization was previously exempt from tax under \n     Code section 501.\n     8. Treatment of net operating losses arising from certain \n         eligible losses (sec. 403(h) of the bill, sec. 1082 of \n         the 1997 Act, and sec. 172(b)(1)(F) of the Code)\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       The 1997 Act changed the general net operating loss \n     (``NOL'') carryback period of a taxpayer from three years to \n     two years. The three-year carryback period was retained in \n     the case of an NOL attributable to an eligible loss. An \n     eligible loss is defined as (1) a casualty or theft loss of \n     an individual taxpayer, or (2) an NOL attributable to a \n     Presidentially declared disaster area by a taxpayer engaged \n     in a farming business or a small business. Other special \n     rules apply to real estate investment trusts (REITs) (no \n     carrybacks), specified liability losses (10-year carryback), \n     and excess interest losses (no carrybacks).\n\n                        Description of Proposal\n\n       The proposal coordinates the use of eligible losses with \n     the general rule for NOLs in the same manner as a loss \n     arising from a specified liability loss. Thus, an eligible \n     loss for any year is treated as a separate net operating loss \n     and is taken into account after the remaining portion of the \n     net operating loss for the taxable year.\n     9. Determination of unborrowed policy cash value under COLI \n         pro rata interest disallowance rules (sec. 403(i) of the \n         bill, sec. 1084 of the 1997 Act, and sec. 246(f) of the \n         Code)\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       In the case of a taxpayer other than a natural person, no \n     deduction is allowed for the portion of the taxpayer's \n     interest expense that is allocable to unborrowed policy cash \n     surrender values with respect to any life insurance policy or \n     annuity or endowment contract issued after June 8, 1997. \n     Interest expense is allocable to unborrowed policy cash \n     values based on the ratio of (1) the taxpayer's average \n     unborrowed policy cash values of life insurance policies and \n     annuity and endowment contracts, issued after June 8, 1997, \n     to (2) the sum of (a) in the case of assets that are life \n     insurance policies or annuity or endowment contracts, the \n     average unborrowed policy cash values and (b) in the case of \n     other assets the average adjusted bases for all such other \n     assets of the taxpayer. The unborrowed policy cash values \n     means the cash surrender value of the policy or contract \n     determined without regard to any surrender charge, reduced by \n     the amount of any loan with respect to the policy or \n     contract. The cash surrender value is to be determined \n     without regard to any other contractual or noncontractual \n     arrangement that artificially depresses the unborrowed policy \n     cash value of a contract.\n\n                        Description of Proposal\n\n       The proposal clarifies the meaning of ``unborrowed policy \n     cash value'' under section 264(f)(3), with respect to any \n     life insurance, annuity or endowment contract. The technical \n     correction clarifies that under section 264(f)(3), if the \n     cash surrender value (determined without regard to any \n     surrender charges) with respect to any policy or contract \n     does not reasonably approximate its actual value, then the \n     amount taken into account for this purpose is the greater of \n     (1) the amount of the insurance company's liability with \n     respect to the policy or contract, as determined for purposes \n     of he annual statement approved by the National Association \n     of Insurance Commissioners, (2) the amount of the insurance \n     company's reserve with respect to the policy or contract for \n     purposes of such annual statement; or such other amount as is \n     determined by the Treasury Secretary. No inference is \n     intended that such amounts may not be taken into account in \n     determining the cash surrender value of a policy or contract \n     in such circumstances for purposes of any other provision of \n     the Code.\n     10. Payment of taxes by commercially acceptable means (sec. \n         403(k) of the bill, sec. 1205 of the 1997 Act, and sec. \n         6311 (d)(2) of the Code)\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       The Code generally permits the payment of taxes by \n     commercially acceptable means (such as credit cards) (sec. \n     6311(d)). The Treasury Secretary may not pay any fee or \n     provide any other consideration in connection with this \n     provision. This fee prohibition may have an unintended impact \n     on Treasury contracts for the provision of services unrelated \n     to the payment of income taxes by commercially acceptable \n     means.\n\n                        Description of Proposal\n\n       The proposal clarifies that the prohibition on paying any \n     fees or providing any other consideration applies to the use \n     of credit, debit, or charge cards for the payment of income \n     taxes.\n\n\n                C. Technical Corrections to the 1984 Act\n\n     1. Casualty loss deduction (sec. 404 of the bill, sec. 711(c) \n         of the 1984 Act, and secs. 172(d)(4), 67(b)(3), 68(c)(3), \n         and 873(b) of the Code)\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       The Tax Reform Act of 1984 (``1984 Act'') deleted casualty \n     and theft losses from property connected with a nonbusiness \n     transaction entered into for profit from the list of losses \n     set forth in section 165(c)(3). This amendment was made in \n     order to provide that these losses were deductible in full \n     and not subject to the $100 per casualty limitation or the \n     10-percent adjusted gross income floor applicable to personal \n     casualty losses. However, the amendment inadvertently \n     eliminated the deduction for these losses from the \n     computation of the net operating loss. Also, the Tax Reform \n     Act of 1986 provided that casualty losses described in \n     section 165(c)(3) are not miscellaneous itemized deductions \n     subject to the 2-percent adjusted gross income floor, and the \n     Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990 provided that these losses \n     are not treated as itemized deductions in computing the \n     overall limitation on itemized deductions. The losses of \n     nonresident aliens are limited to deductions described in \n     section 165(c)(3). Because of the change made by the 1984 \n     Act, the reference to section 165(c)(3) does not include \n     casualty and theft losses from nonbusiness transActions \n     entered into for profit.\n\n                        Description of Proposal\n\n       The proposal provides that all deductions for nonbusiness \n     casualty and theft losses are taken into account in computing \n     the net operating loss. Also, these deductions are not \n     treated as miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to the \n     2-percent adjusted gross income floor, or as itemized \n     deductions subject to the overall limitation on itemized \n     deductions, and are allowed to nonresident aliens.\n\n                            Effective Dates\n\n       The proposal relating to the net operating loss and the \n     deduction for nonresident aliens applies to taxable years \n     beginning after December 31, 1983.\n       The proposal relating to miscellaneous itemized deduction \n     applies taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986.\n       The proposal relating to the overall limitation on itemized \n     deductions applies to taxable years beginning after December \n     31, 1990.\n\n\n     D. DISCLOSURE OF TAX RETURN INFORMATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF \n   AGRICULTURE (SEC. 405(A) OF THE BILL AND SEC. 6103(J) OF THE cODE)\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Tax return information generally may not be disclosed, \n     except as specifically provided by statute. Disclosure is \n     permitted to the Bureau of the Census for specified purposes, \n     which included the responsibility of structuring, conducting, \n     and preparing the census of agriculture (sec. 6103(j)(1)). \n     The Census of Agriculture Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-113) \n     transferred this responsibility from the Bureau of the Census \n     to the Department of Agriculture.\n\n                        Description of Proposal\n\n       The proposal permits the continuation of disclosure of tax \n     return information for the\n\n[[Page S12336]]\n\n     purpose of structuring, conducting, and preparing the census \n     of agriculture by authorizing the Department of Agriculture \n     to receive this information.\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The proposal is effective on the date of enactment of this \n     technical correction.\n\n\ne. technical corrections to the transportation equity act for the 21st \n   century (sec. 405(b) of the bill, sec. 9004 of the Act, and sec. \n                          9503(f) of the Code)\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       The Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century \n     (``Transportation Equity Act'') (P.L. 105-178) extended the \n     Highway Trust Fund and accompanying highway excise taxes. The \n     Transportation Equity Act also changed the budgetary \n     treatment of Highway Trust Fund expenditures, including \n     repeal of a provision that balances maintained in the Highway \n     Trust Fund pending expenditure earn interest from the General \n     Fund of the Treasury.\n\n                        Description of Proposal\n\n       The proposal clarifies that the Secretary of the Treasury \n     is not required to invest Highway Trust Fund balances in \n     interest-bearing obligations (because any interest paid to \n     the Trust Fund by the General Fund would be immediately \n     returned to the General Fund).\n\n\n   f. repeal of provisions relating to district of columbia judicial \n              retirement program (sec. 405(c) of the bill)\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Section 804 of the Treasury and General Government \n     Appropriations Act, 1999, makes certain technical and \n     clarifying amendments to the Judicial Retirement Program of \n     the District of Columbia. Included in these amendments were \n     certain amendments that applied for purposes of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986.\n\n                        Description of Proposal\n\n       Section 804 of the Treasury and General Government \n     Appropriations Act, 1999, is repealed.\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The proposal is effective on the date of enactment.\n\n\n g. perfecting amendments related to withholding from social security \nbenefits and other federal payments (sec. 406 of the bill and secs. 201 \n                  and 207 of the Social Security Act)\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       The Uruguay Round Agreements Act (P.L. 103-465) contained a \n     provision requiring that U.S. taxpayers who receive specified \n     Federal payments (including Social Security benefits) be \n     given the option of requesting that the Federal agency making \n     the payments withhold Federal income taxes from the payments.\n\n                        Description of Proposal\n\n       Due to a drafting oversight, the Uruguay Round Agreements \n     Act included only the necessary changes to the Internal \n     Revenue Code (``Code'') and failed to make certain conforming \n     changes to the Social Security Act (specifically a section \n     that prohibits assignments of benefits). The proposal amends \n     the Social Security Act anti-assignment section to allow the \n     Code provisions to be implemented. The proposal also \n     allocates funding for the Social Security Administration to \n     administer the tax-withholding provisions.\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The proposal applies to benefits paid on or after the first \n     day of the second month beginning after the month of \n     enactment.\n\n\n                               FOOTNOTES\n\n     \\1\\ This document may be cited as follows: Joint Committee on \n     Taxation, Description of Provisions in S. 2622, the Tax \n     Relief Extension Act of 1998 (JCX-70-98), October 10, 1998. \n     (References in this document to the ``1997 Act'' refer to the \n     Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.)\n     \\2\\ A special rule is designed to gradually recompute a \n     start-up firm's fixed-base percentage based on its actual \n     research experience. Under this special rule, a start-up firm \n     will be assigned a fixed-base percentage of 3 percent for \n     each of its first five taxable years after 1993 in which it \n     incurs qualified research expenditures. In the event that the \n     research credit is extended beyond the scheduled expiration \n     date, a start-up firm's fix-based percentage for its sixth \n     through tenth taxable years after 1993 in which it incurs \n     qualified research expenditures will be a phased-in ratio \n     based on its actual research experience. For all subsequent \n     taxable years, the taxpayer's fixed-based percentage will be \n     its actual ratio of qualified research expenditures to gross \n     receipts for any five years selected by the taxpayer from its \n     fifth through tenth taxable years after 1993 (sec. \n     41(c)(3)(B)).\n     \\3\\ Under a special rule, 75 percent of amounts paid to a \n     research consortium for qualified research is treated as \n     qualified research expenses eligible for the research credit \n     (rather than 65 percent under the general rule under sec. \n     41(b)(3) governing contract research expenses) if (1) such \n     research consortium is a tax-exempt organization that is \n     described in section 501(c)(3) (other than a private \n     foundation) or section 501(c)(6) and is organized and \n     operated primarily to conduct scientific research, and (2) \n     such qualified research is conducted by the consortium on \n     behalf of the taxpayer and one or more persons not related to \n     the taxpayer.\n     \\4\\ The amount of the deduction allowable for a taxable year \n     with respect to a charitable contribution may be reduced \n     depending on the type of property contributed, the type of \n     charitable organization to which the property is contributed, \n     and the income of the taxpayer (secs. 170(b) and 170(e)).\n     \\5\\ The President canceled these exceptions in 1997 pursuant \n     to the Line Item Veto Act. On June 25, 1998, the U.S. Supreme \n     Court held that the cancellation procedures set forth in the \n     Line Item Veto Act are unconstitutional Clinton v. City of \n     New York, 118 S. Ct. 2091 (June 25, 1998).\n     \\6\\ This rule applies to fiscal years after 1996. For fiscal \n     year 1996, this payment was to be made not later than 30 days \n     after the production flexibility contract was entered into.\n     \\7\\ The amount of elected farm income of a taxpayer for a \n     taxable year may not exceed the taxable income attributable \n     to any farming business for the year.\n     \\8\\ The bill contains a similar amendment to section \n     1(h)(13), as amended by section 5001 of the 1998 Act, to \n     provide that, for purposes of taxing the recipient of a \n     distribution made after 1997 by a CRT, amounts will not be \n     taken into account in computing 28-percent rate gain by \n     reason of being properly taken into account before May 7, \n     1997, or by reason of the property being held for not more \n     than 18 months. Thus, no amount distributed by a CRT after \n     1997 will be treated as in the 28-percent category (other \n     than by reason of the disposition of collectibles or small \n     business stock).\n     \\9\\ This exception (as certain other exceptions) does not \n     apply if the stock held before the acquisition was acquired \n     pursuant to a plan (or series of related transactions) to \n     acquire a 50-percent or greater interest in the distributing \n     or a controlled corporation.\n     \\10\\ The 1997 Act does not limit the otherwise applicable \n     Treasury regulatory authority under section 336(e) of the \n     Code. Nor does it limit the otherwise applicable provisions \n     of section 1367 with respect to the effect on shareholder \n     stock basis of gain recognized by an S corporation under this \n     provision.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                                      ESTIMATED REVENUE EFFECTS OF S. 2626, THE ``TAX RELIEF EXTENSION RELIEF ACT OF 1998''\n                                                                        [Fiscal years 1999-2007, in millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                 Provision                              Effective                1999      2000     2001     2002     2003     2004     2005     2006     2007    1999-02    2003-07    1999-07\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI.

Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor, along with \nour esteemed Chairman, Senator Roth, a Senate Finance Committee bill to \nextend a package of expired tax provisions. Unfortunately, dealing with \nthis group of expired tax items has become a routine annual event for \nthe Committee and for the Congress. This bill extends universally \npopular items such as the credit for increasing research activities, \nthe Work Opportunity Credit, and the deduction for gifts of appreciated \nstock to private foundations through June of next year. It is my hope \nthat 1999 will be the year that the entire group of ``extenders'' are \nfinally made permanent.\n  We thank Senator Roth for ensuring that the Finance Committee is \nheard on this matter. Our action is a reminder that the United States \nCongress does not act, on tax bills or any other measures, as a \nunicameral legislature. Indeed, this Finance committee measure improves \nin several ways on the bill passed by the House Ways and Means \nCommittee yesterday:\n  First, we extend the Trade Assistance Program from October 1, 1998 \nthrough June 30, 1999. This is an important program established in the \nTrade Expansion Act of 1962 that provides training and income support \nfor workers adversely affected by import competition. It is a \ncommitment we have made to workers, and it ought to be kept.\n  Second, the bill includes a provision that prevents the tax benefit \nof nonrefundable personal credits such as the $500 per child credit and \nthe adoption credit from being eroded by the Alternative Minimum Tax. \nThis was to have been included as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of \n1997, but was dropped for some unknown reason as part of the final \ncompromise. Without the ``fix'' included in this bill, we will trap \nmany unsuspecting taxpayers who sit down to prepare their 1998 Federal \nincome tax returns next spring.\n  I applaud the work of the chairman and the committee in moving \nquickly to agree on this bill and, for the greater good, deferring \naction on a number of very important narrower items until next year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMPSON (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \n        Roth, and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 2623. A bill to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the \nFederal Government, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nthe Government for the 21st Century Act of 1998, a bill to establish a \ncommission to bring the structure of our government in line with the \nneeds of our Nation in the next century. This bipartisan legislation is \nthe result of work over several months between myself and Senators \nGlenn, Brownback, Lieberman, Roth, and Stevens. It has been carefully \ncrafted to address not just what our government should look like, but \nthe more fundamental question of what it should do.\n  We all know the old adage, ``form follows function''--but in the case \nof our government, form too often impedes function. The federal \ninfrastructure should enable it to respond to national needs and the \nneeds of individual citizens quickly, efficiently, and successfully--\nbut years of outmoded bureaucracies, procedures and red tape have \nimpeded the kind of responsible service our citizens deserve and \nexpect. The government we have today was designed for a world which has \nlong since passed into history, a world in which personal computers did \nnot exist, two-income families were the exception and no one had ever \nheard of a ``sport utility vehicle''. In short, it is time to modernize \nthe federal government, and there is no more appropriate time to do it \nthan on the eve of the next century.\n  It seems to me that the federal government is doing too many things \nto do them all well. I believe we must reevaluate the functions of \ngovernment to improve government service where it is needed, redirect \nresources where it is necessary, and get the federal government out of \nactivities in which it does not belong. Our Founding Fathers envisioned \na government of defined and limited powers. I can imagine their dismay \nif they knew the size and scope of the federal government today. We \nneed to return to the limited government that the Founders intended, \nand the Commission established in the legislation we are introducing \ntoday is a major step in that direction.\n  The Government Restructuring and Reform Commission established by \nthis legislation would take a hard look at federal departments, \nagencies and programs and ask--\n  Can and should we consolidate these agencies and programs to improve \nthe implementation of their statutory missions, eliminate activities \nnot essential to their statutory missions, and reduce duplication of \nactivities while increasing accountability for performance?\n  How can we improve management to maximize productivity, effectiveness \nand accountability?\n  What criteria should we use in determining whether a federal activity \nshould be privatized?\n  Which departments or agencies should be eliminated because their \nfunctions are obsolete, redundant, or better performed by state and \nlocal governments or the private sector?\n  We all want a federal government that is as innovative and responsive \nas the government we envision. Our challenge is to determine how to get \nthere. We must start by asking ourselves what the essential functions \nof government will be in the next century, so we may tailor the scope \nand structure of the executive branch accordingly. Some activities now \nperformed by the federal government may require more resources; others \nwill surely require less. The Commission on Government Restructuring \nand Reform will give us a blueprint for designing a federal government \nto meet our Nation's needs now and in the future.\n  I am pleased that Senators Lieberman, Brownback, Roth, and Stevens \nare joining me in introducing this bill today, and I thank them for the \ntime and staff they have devoted to the effort. I look forward to \nworking with them on this important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Government for the 21st Century Act, \nalong with the brief summary and section-by-section analysis, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2623\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

or\n       (D) reduce layers of organizational hierarchy and personnel \n     where appropriate to improve the effective implementation of \n     statutory missions and increase accountability for \n     performance.\n       (2) improve and strengthen management capacity in \n     departments and agencies (including central management \n     agencies) to maximize productivity, effectiveness, and \n     accountability;\n       (3) propose criteria for use by the President and Congress \n     in evaluating proposals to establish, or to assign a function \n     to, an executive entity, including a Government corporation \n     or Government-sponsored enterprise;\n       (4) define the missions, roles, and responsibilities of any \n     new, reorganized, or consolidated department or agency \n     proposed by the Commission;\n       (5) eliminate the departments or agencies whose missions \n     and functions have been determined to be--\n       (A) obsolete, redundant, or complete;

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator \nThompson in introducing the Government for the 21st Century Act of \n1998. Both majority and minority members of the Senate Governmental \nAffairs Committee have been working on this legislation throughout this \nCongress and have come to agreement to introduce this important bill.\n  The Government for the 21st Century Act would establish a commission \nto propose to Congress and the President a plan to reduce the cost and \nincrease the effectiveness of the Federal government by bringing its \nstructure and operations in line with the needs of America in the next \ncentury. The commission would consist of nine members appointed by the \nPresident and the congressional leadership of both parties.\n  The President may submit his recommendations to the Commission by \nJuly 1, 1999. By December 1, 1999, the Commission shall submit to the \nPresident and Congress preliminary recommendations on restructuring the \nFederal government. After a public comment period, the Commission will \nprepare a final report to the President. Legislation based on the final \nreport would be introduced in both Houses and referred to the \nappropriate committee of jurisdiction. The bill would be considered by \nboth Houses after 30 days. Once the legislation is signed into law, the \nOffice of Management and Budget would be responsible for \nimplementation.\n  The Commission would reinforce our work to maintain a balanced \nbudget. Good government must have agencies that operate efficiently and \neffectively within their core mission and within their budget. We have \nachieved one goal of operating within a balanced budget but we must \ncontinue to work towards the other. Even under a balanced budget and a \nbudget surplus, inefficiencies and rising costs remain in the Federal \ngovernment. A balanced budget and a budget surplus does not preclude \nthe Federal government from being accountable to the American people. \nThe Government for the 21st Century Act would see to it that the \nFederal government will continue to be accountable.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI:\n  S. 2624. A bill to establish a program for training residents of low-\nincome rural areas for, and employing the residents in, new \ntelecommunications industry jobs located in the rural areas, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n    The Rural Employment in Telecommunications Industry Act of 1998\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, today, with great pleasure, I introduce \n``The Rural Employment in Telecommunications Industry Act of 1998.''\n  The introduction of this Bill marks a historic opportunity for rural \ncommunities to create jobs within the telecommunications industry. The \nBill establishes a program to train residents of low income rural areas \nfor employment in telecommunications industry jobs located in those \nsame rural areas.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I have an initiative called ``rural \npayday'' and I believe this Bill is yet another step in creating jobs \nfor our rural areas. All too often a rural area is characterized by a \nhigh number of low income residents and a high unemployment rate.\n  Moreover, our rural areas are often dependent upon a small number of \nemployers or a single industry for employment opportunities. \nConsequently, when there is a plant closing or a downturn in the \neconomy or a slowdown in the area's industry the already present \nproblems are only compounded. Mr. President, I would like to take a \nmoment and talk about New Mexico.\n  While New Mexico may be the 5th largest state by size with its \nbeautiful mountains, desert, and Great Plains and vibrant cities such \nas Albuquerque, Santa Fe, and Las Cruces it is also a very rural state. \nThe Northwest and Southeast portions of the state are currently \nexperiencing difficulties as a result of the downturn in the oil and \ngas industry. Additionally, the community of Roswell has been dealt a \nblow with the closing of the Levi Straus manufacturing plant.\n  As I stated before, rural areas that simply do not have the resources \nof more metropolitan areas can be simply devastated by a single event \nor downturn in the economy. And that Mr. President is why I am \nintroducing ``The Rural Employment in Telecommunications Industry Act \nof 1998.''\n  The Bill will allow the Secretary of Labor to establish a program to \npromote rural employment in the telecommunications industry by \nproviding grants to states with low income rural areas. The program \nwill be a win win proposition for all involved because employers \nchoosing to participate in the project by bringing jobs to the rural \narea will be assured of a highly skilled workforce.\n  The program will provide residents with intensive services to train \nthem for the new jobs in the telecommunications industry. The intensive \nservices will include customized training and appropriate remedial \ntraining, support services and placement of the individual in one the \nnew jobs created by the program.\n  And that is what this bill is about, providing people with the tools \nneeded to succeed. With these steps we are embarking on the road of \nproviding our rural areas throughout our nation with a vehicle to \ncreate jobs. We are creating opportunities and an environment where our \ncitizens can succeed and our communities can be vibrant.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2684\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be \n     necessary to carry out this Act for fiscal years 1999 through \n     2003.\n  In the Record of October 9, 1998, on page S12187 the following \nstatement of Mr. Kerrey to accompany his introduced bill. S. 2613, was \nincorrectly attributed to Mr. Kerrey. The permanent Record will be \ncorrected to reflect the following:\n      By Mr. KERREY:\n  S. 2613. A bill to accelerate the percentage of health insurance \ncosts deductible by self-employed individuals through the use of \nrevenues resulting from an estate tax technical correction; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                 health care deductibility legislation\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I have a very simple proposition for the \nSenate. Let's close an accidental tax loophole for the heirs of people \nwho leave estates worth more than $17 million and use the savings to \nhelp self-employed Americans--like the thousands of entrepreneurs on \nNebraska's farms and ranches--afford the soaring cost of health care.\n  Today I am submitting legislation to accomplish that purpose.\n  The facts are very simple. Prior to 1997, when we passed the 1997 \nBalanced Budget Agreement, the first $600,000 of an estate was excluded \nfrom taxes. The old law gradually phased out this exclusion once an \nestate reached $17 million. The 1997 Act increases the value of an \nestate not subject to taxes. But a drafting error in the 1997 Balanced \nBudget Agreement failed to include the accompanying phase out of the \nexclusion on estates over $17 million.\n  Clearly this error needs to be fixed. Letting this mistake stand \nuncorrected will cost the American taxpayers nearly $900 million over \nthe next ten years. To give you an idea of how much this provision does \nto benefit the few, consider that in 1995, the Internal Revenue Service \nestimates that just 300 tax returns were filed on estates over $20 \nmillion.\n  Congress had the opportunity to correct this error during \nconsideration of the IRS Reform bill this year. Regrettably, the \nobjections of a few to making this right overcame the support of the \nmany for doing so.\n  Meanwhile, Mr. President, self-employed Americans are struggling to \ncope with the rising cost of health insurance, which they--unlike \nAmericans employed by others--cannot fully deduct from their taxable \nincome. The face of their struggle is most evident on farms and \nranches. In Nebraska, producers are facing plunging commodity prices at \nthe same time they face soaring costs of living, especially for\n\n[[Page S12343]]\n\nhealth insurance. Today they can deduct 40 percent of the cost of their \ninsurance. Under current law, they cannot fully deduct that cost until \n2007.\n  So, my proposal is simple. Let's close the loophole that everyone \nadmits was an accident, and use that money to accelerate the full \ndeductibility of health insurance for the self-employed. It's a clear \nchoice between a loophole that nobody wanted to exist and entrepreneurs \nwho--especially those on our farms and ranches--may not exist much \nlonger if we don't get them some help.\n  While I recognize time is short for passing this bill this year, I \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation and in \npursuing this goal next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12309-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12343-S12348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         MEDICARE HOME HEALTH FAIR PAYMENT ACT OF 1998--S. 2616\n\n  Statements on the bill, S. 2616, introduced on October 9, 1998, did \nnot appear in the Record.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nmake revisions in the per beneficiary and per visit payment limits on \npayment for health services under the medicare program; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n             medicare home health fair payment act of 1998\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Medicare Home Health \nFair Payment Act of 1998.\n  This legislation is the product of a great deal of hard work and \nanalysis. It has bipartisan, bicameral, support. Currently, the bill \nhas 15 cosponsors, and similar legislation was introduced in the House \nof Representatives.\n  Staff worked to make sure that the technical aspects of this bill \ncould be implemented. After technical review from the Health Care \nFinancing Administration, it is our understanding that the changes in \nhome health payments could be implemented as intended.\n  I would like to thank the many Senators who were very helpful and \ncontributed to the debate of addressing the home health interim payment \nsystem. In particular, I commend Senator Collins, Senator Grassley, \nSenator Breaux, Senator Cochran, and Senator Bond. All put forward \nlegislative proposals which we examined closely, and which helped us in \nour development of the legislation now before us.\n  With this budget neutral proposal, about 82% of all home health \nagencies in the nation will benefit from improved Medicare payments. \nAlthough I have heard concerns that we do not go far enough to help \nsome of the lowest cost agencies, it is an important step in the right \ndirection. In fact, we have received letters of support from the \nVisiting Nurse Associations of America and the National Association for \nHomecare.\n  Let's remember where we were before the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. \nHome health spending was growing by leaps and bounds, cases of fraud \nand abuse were common, and the Medicare program was headed towards \nbankruptcy in 2003.\n  Last year, Medicare spent $17 billion for 270 million home health \ncare visits so that one out of every ten beneficiaries received care at \nhome from a nurse, a physical or occupational therapist, and/or a nurse \naide.\n  Unlike any other Medicare benefit, the home health benefit has no \nlimits on the number of visits or days of care a beneficiary can \nreceive, beneficiaries pay no deductible, nor do they pay any co-\npayments.\n  Prior to BBA, home health agencies were reimbursed on a cost basis \nfor all their costs, as long as they maintained average costs below \ncertain limits. This payment system gave immense incentives for home \nhealth agencies to increase the volume of services delivered to \npatients, and it attracted many new agencies to the program.\n\n  From 1989 to 1996, Medicare home health payments grew with an average \nannual increase of 33 percent, while the number of home health agencies \nswelled from about 5,700 in 1989 to more than 10,000 in 1997.\n  In response to this rapid cost growth and concerns about program \nabuses, the BBA included a number of changes to home health care. \nCongress and the Administration supported moving toward a Prospective \nPayment System (PPS). In order for HCFA to move to a PPS, however, a \nnumber of computer system changes were necessary with respect to their \nhome health operations. The interim payment system (IPS) was developed \nto manage reimbursement until the PPS could be implemented.\n  Significant Medicare payment issues for home health care have emerged \nfrom our analysis from the impact of the IPS. There are severe equity \nissues in payment limit levels both across states and within states. \nThese wide disparities are exacerbated by a major distinction drawn in \npayment rules between so-called ``new'' versus ``old'' agencies. \n``Old'' agencies being those that were in existence prior to 1993, and \n``New'' agencies those in existence since then.\n  The effects of the current home health payment methodology are that \nsimilar agencies providing similar services in the same community face \nvery different reimbursement limits, leading to highly arbitrary \npayment differences.\n  The payment limit issues will deepen significantly more in 1999 due \nto a scheduled 15% cut in already tight and severely skewed payment \nlimit levels. Further, the prospective payment system scheduled to go \non-line in October, 1999, will be delayed by several months to one \nyear, because of year 2000 computer programming problems, according to \nthe Health Care Financing Administration.\n  This legislation takes several steps to improve the Medicare home \nhealth care IPS and addresses the 15% cut.\n  First, it increases equity by reducing the extreme variations in \npayment limits applicable to old agencies within states and across \nstates. This is achieved through a budget-neutral blend for ``old'' \nagencies.\n  Second, it increases fairness by reducing the artificial payment \nlimit differences between ``old'' and ``new'' agencies. Such \ndistinctions are contributing to the perception of arbitrariness in the \nhome health care system. And, our proposal does not create additional \nclasses of home health agencies, such as ``new-new'' agencies subject \nto even deeper, arbitrary payment limits in the future. Restricting new \nentrants to home health care is an inappropriate barrier to entry in \nunderserved areas--both in rural and inner city areas. In the \nlegislation, greater fairness is achieved by eliminating the 2 percent \ndiscount applicable to new agencies, and raising the per visit limits \nfor all agencies from 105 percent to 110 percent of the national \nmedian.\n\n  Third, the proposal lengthens the transition period for payment \nchanges by providing all agencies a longer transition period in which \nto adjust to changed payment limits. It creates a sustainable fiscal \nbase for the statutorily mandated prospective payment system (PPS) by \ndelaying the scheduled 15 percent cut and the PPS for one year.\n  The following is a summary of the Medicare Home Health Fair Payment \nAct of 1998:\n\n\n                         per beneficiary limits\n\n       1. ``Old'' agency: payment is a blended formula equal to 50 \n     percent BBA policy + 50 percent (50 percent national mean + \n     50 percent regional mean); and\n       2. ``New'' agency: payment is increased by 2 percent to \n     equal 100 percent of the national median, (which continues to \n     be regionally adjusted for wages).\n\n\n                            per visit limits\n\n       3. Increase the per visit limits from 105 percent to 110 \n     percent of the median.\n\n\n      delay both the 15 percent across-the-board cuts and the pps\n\n       4. Delay of the 15 percent across-the-board cuts in payment \n     limits and the implementation of the prospective payments \n     system now scheduled to take effect on October 1, 1999.\n\n\n                     description of offset policies\n\n       1. Reduce the home health care annual market basket (MB) in \n     the following manner: for fiscal year 2000 it is MB minus 0.5 \n     percentage point; for FY 2001 it is MB minus 0.5 percentage \n     point; for FY 2002 and FY 2003 it is full MB; and in FY 2004 \n     it is MB plus 1.0 percentage point. Savings of $300 million \n     over 5 years.\n       2. Non-Controversial Revenue Raisers--Revenues of $406 \n     million over 5 years.\n       a. Math Error Procedures--This provision would clarify the \n     math error procedures that the IRS uses.\n\n[[Page S12344]]\n\n       b. Rotavirus Vaccine--This provision will add an excise tax \n     of 75 cents on a vaccine against rotavirus gastroenteritis, a \n     highly contagious disease among young children.\n       c. Modify Net Operating Loss Carryback Rules--Certain \n     liability losses can be carried back over ten years. This \n     provision would clarify the types of losses that qualify for \n     the 10-year carryback.\n       d. Non-Accrual Based Method--This provision would limit the \n     use of the non-accrual experience method of accounting to \n     amounts received for the performance of certain professional \n     services.\n       e. Information Reporting--This provision requires reporting \n     on the cancellation of indebtedness by non-bank institutions.\n       3. Budget Pay-Go surplus for remaining offset.\n\n  At the beginning of my statement, I recognized my colleagues for \ntheir leadership on this issue. Now, I would like to especially thank \nthe staff involved for their hard work and dedication to the completion \nof this bill. This represented a herculean task on their behalf. In \nparticular, I would like to recognize the principal staff involved who \nspent many long hours putting the details of this package together, \nthey are Gioia Brophy and Kathy Means of my staff; Katie Horton and \nDavid Podoff from Finance Minority staff; Louisa Buatti and Scott \nHarrison of the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission; Tom Bradley and \nCyndi Dudzinski of the Congressional Budget Office; Jennifer Boulinger \nand Ira Bernie of the Health Care Financing Administration; John \nGoetchus of Senate Legislative Counsel; and Richard Price of the \nCongressional Research Service.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support from \nthe Visiting Nurse Association of America and the National Association \nof Homecare be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Visiting Nurse Associations\n\n\n                                                   of America,\n\n                                     Boston, MA, October 10, 1998.\n     Hon. William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Roth: The Visiting Nurse Associations of \n     America (VNAA) deeply appreciates your efforts to craft a \n     solution to the problems caused by the Medicare home health \n     interim payment system for our members and other cost \n     effective home health agencies. Urgent action is needed \n     before Congress adjourns to provide relief to these agencies \n     to assure that they can continue to care for their Medicare \n     patients.\n       We understand that one barrier to action has been the \n     difficulty in finding acceptable funding offsets to the \n     modest Medicare spending required to achieve a workable \n     package. We have been advised that the Finance Committee is \n     currently considering an adjustment to future home health \n     market baskets that would generate approximately $300 million \n     in new Medicare savings to offset in part the cost of the one \n     year delay in the automatic 15% reduction in home health \n     payments now scheduled for October 1, 1999. Specifically, \n     VNAA understands that this proposal would reduce the market \n     basket index in 2000 and 2001 by 0.5 percentage point. In \n     2002 and 2003 the full market basket index would be used, and \n     in 2004 the market basket would be increased by one \n     percentage point.\n       VNAA strongly supports the delay in the 15% cut and \n     supports the adjustment to future home health market baskets \n     as a needed partial offset to the cost of that important \n     action.\n       VNAA hopes that its support for this offset will facilitate \n     quick action by the Senate. If there are any questions about \n     our position, please contact our Washington Representative, \n     Randy Fenninger, at 202-833-0007, Ext. 111.\n       Thank you for your continued efforts on behalf of cost \n     effective home health agencies and their patients.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Carolyn Markey,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                                For Home Care,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 7, 1998.\n     Hon. William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     Chair, Committee on Finance,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Roth: The National Association for Home Care \n     (NAHC) is the largest home care organization in the nation, \n     representing all types of home health agencies and the \n     patients they serve. We have had continuing concerns over the \n     past year regarding the effects of the home health provisions \n     of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, particularly by the \n     interim payment system (IPS).\n       We are pleased that you and other members of the Senate \n     Finance Committee have shown the leadership to develop a \n     package of IPS refinements that will help to ease some of the \n     most pressing problems of the new payment system. We are \n     particularly grateful for your inclusion of a one-year delay \n     of the 15 percent reduction that is currently scheduled for \n     October 1, 1999. While there remain a number of important \n     issues relating to the IPS that we believe must be addressed \n     in the 106th Congress, your proposal will make a meaningful \n     difference in helping agencies to remain open and to serve \n     Medicare beneficiaries throughout the nation.\n       Many thanks for all of your efforts. We look forward to \n     working with you, members of the House of Representatives, \n     and others in developing additional relief legislation early \n     next year.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Val J. Halamandaris,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished \nChairman, Senator Roth, and other colleagues in introducing a bill to \nimprove the home health interim payment system.\n  Prior to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA), home health agencies \nwere reimbursed on a cost basis for all their costs, as long as they \nmaintained average costs below certain limits. That payment system \nprovided incentives for home health agencies to increase the volume of \nservices delivered to patients, and it attracted many new agencies to \nthe program. From 1989 to 1996, Medicare home health payments grew at \nan average annual rate of 33 percent, while the number of home health \nagencies increased from about 5,700 in 1989 to more than 10,000 in \n1997.\n  In order to constrain the growth in costs and usage of home care, the \nBBA included provisions that would establish a Prospective Payment \nSystem (PPS) for home health care, a method of paying health care \nproviders whereby rates are established in advance. An interim payment \nsystem (IPS) was also established while the Health Care Financing \nAdministration works to develop the PPS for home health care agencies.\n  The home health care industry is dissatisfied with the IPS. The \nresulting concern expressed by many Members of Congress prompted us to \nask the General Accounting Office (GAO) to examine the question of \nbeneficiary access to home care. While the GAO found that neither \nagency closures nor the interim payment system significantly affected \nbeneficiary access to care, I remain concerned that the potential \nclosure of many more home health agencies might ultimately affect the \ncare that beneficiaries receive, particularly beneficiaries with \nchronic illness.\n  The bill we are introducing today adjusts the interim payment system \nto achieve equity and fairness in payments to home health agencies. It \nwould reduce extreme variations in payment limits applicable to old \nagencies within states and across states and would reduce artificial \npayment level differences between ``old'' and ``new'' agencies. The \nbill would provide all agencies a longer transition period in which to \nadjust to changed payment limits.\n  Clearly, since the bill may not address all the concerns raised by \nMedicare beneficiaries and by home health agencies, we should revisit \nthis issue next year. A thorough review is needed to determine whether \nthe funding mechanism for home health is sufficient, fair and \nappropriate, and whether the benefit is meeting the needs of Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  America's home health agencies provide invaluable services that have \ngiven many Medicare beneficiaries the ability to stay home while \nreceiving medical care. An adjustment to the interim payment system and \ndelay in further payment reductions will enable home health agencies to \nsurvive the transition into the prospective payment system while \ncontinuing to provide essential care for beneficiaries.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the Medicare \nHome Health Fair Payment Act of 1998, which is a first step toward \naddressing the crisis in Medicare home health care. This is not a \nperfect bill, but it's a good bill, and it is the best we can do at \nthis moment in time. And it's a good example of the Senate listening to \nthe American people. Let's pass it right now.\n  The Senate Special Committee on Aging, which I chair, highlighted the \nproblems with the home health Interim Payment System (IPS) in a hearing \non March 31st of this year. For more than six months since that day, I \nhave been working to find a solution to these problems, because I \nbelieve that it's Congress' responsibility. It's true that the IPS \nlegislation was primarily HCFA's product. And HCFA's implementation of \nthe IPS has been questionable in many respects. But even if\n\n[[Page S12345]]\n\nHCFA proposed it, there's no denying that Congress passed the IPS. So I \nhave argued all year that it is incumbent on Congress to fix what's \nwrong with it, this year.\n  What's wrong with the IPS? In short, it bases payment on an \nindividual home health agency's historical costs from Fiscal Year 1994. \nThat means that if the agency had high costs per patient in that year, \nit can receive relatively high payment this year. That would be fine if \nHCFA knew that the agency had sicker patients this year, but the sad \ntruth is that HCFA has no idea. So IPS has been a windfall for some \nagencies, but crushing for agencies with low historical costs. We have \na lot of those in Iowa, where we still know the value of a dollar. Many \nof those hit hardest are the ``little guys,'' the small businesses that \nare the lifeblood of the program in rural areas.\n  For months, I have worked with a bipartisan group of Finance \ncommittee members, including especially Senators Breaux, Baucus, and \nRockefeller, on fixing IPS. In July we introduced the product of those \nefforts, the Home Health Access Preservation Act, and that bill clearly \ninfluenced the new Finance bill. I thank Chairman Roth and his fine \nstaff for their willingness to work with us to find a viable approach. \nIn the final months of this session, they have really gone the extra \nmile.\n  Now, this bill doesn't give anyone everything that they want. \nSenators Roth and Moynihan rightly focused on creating something that \ncould actually pass this year, and so the bill is a product of \ncompromise. One of the key features is that the bill is paid for, so \nthat it will not add another burden onto the already-burdened Medicare \nPart A trust fund. The offsets used are fair ones, and should not be \ncontroversial.\n  I am familiar with the bill the House is voting on today. Should both \nbills be passed, with all due respect to my House colleagues, I urge \nthem to recede to the Senate bill in conference. I have worked on this \nissue a long time, and I don't believe this bill can be improved upon.\n  Mr. President, this bill will not satisfy everyone. It's a \ncompromise, and in fact, it likely will not fully satisfy anyone. But \nit's the right thing to do, because it will help to keep some of our \ngood home health providers around for another year, so they can make \nsure our seniors get home care when they need it.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Medicare \nHome Health Fair Payment Act of 1998. This is an issue that I have \nworked on for several months with Senator Grassley and other Members of \nthe Senate and I am pleased that the Senate has addressed this issue \nbefore adjourning.\n  I am the first to admit that there is too much fraud, waste, and \nabuse in Medicare's home health benefit and there is probably no other \nstate where the problem is more pronounced than Louisiana. Every graph \nI see on home health shows Louisiana off the charts--Louisiana has the \nhighest per beneficiary spending in the country; we have more visits \nper patient than any other state in the country; Louisiana represents \n5.2% of all Medicare home health visits even though only 2.3% of \nMedicare beneficiaries live in the state. There are 466 home health \nagencies in Louisiana--we have more home health agencies than McDonalds \nin the state. So I know firsthand that there are problems with home \nhealth and that states like Louisiana could afford a reduction in the \nnumber of agencies. The problem is that the interim payment system \ncrafted by Congress and the Administration last year is causing the \nwrong agencies to go out of business.\n  It is clear that the IPS has had serious unintended consequences. In \nLouisiana and other states, the interim payment system has for the most \npart rewarded inefficient providers and forced many low-cost, efficient \nagencies out of the program. For example, you could have one agency \nwith a per beneficiary limit of $12,000 competing with another agency \ndown the street with a per beneficiary limit of $4,000. What we did \nwith IPS is essentially put that $4,000 agency at such a competitive \ndisadvantage that there is no way it can stay in business.\n  When we finally move home health to prospective payment, it is \ncritical that some low-cost providers be in business to treat patients \nwho need home care. The Grassley-Breaux bill that we introduced several \nmonths ago tried to level the playing field by bringing the very high \ncost providers down while raising the reimbursement for low cost \nproviders. This reflects what will happen under prospective payment \nwhen all providers will essentially be paid the same amount for \ntreating the same kind of patient. We also eliminated the distinction \nbetween old and new providers in an attempt to further level the \nplaying field. To ensure that high cost patients would still have \naccess to home health, the Grassley-Breaux bill included an outlier \npolicy so that home health agencies would not turn high cost patients \naway.\n  The interim payment reform proposal put forward by Senators Roth and \nMoynihan is an important first step towards fixing IPS and I applaud \nthe bipartisan approach the Senate used in arriving at this proposal. I \nthink most members would argue that much more needs to be done and I \nwould agree. I am hearing from many home health agencies in Louisiana \nthat this bill will only be of marginal help to the state but that it \nis important that something get done this year. As is the case with \nmost things we do around here, particularly in the waning hours of this \nCongress, getting something is better than getting nothing. I am \npleased that there is a bipartisan commitment by the Senate Finance \nCommittee to revisit this issue next year and take a much more \ncomprehensive look at the home health benefit. It is imperative that \nthe Congress address this issue again next year since this proposal \nrepresents only a temporary fix. But it is an important one. The Senate \nbill:\n  (1) Institutes a new blend for old agencies to increase \nreimbursements to low-cost agencies and reduce payments to very high-\ncost agencies. This will begin to level the playing field and prepare \nall providers for prospective payment. While the Senate proposal \nnarrows the discrepancy between old and new agencies, I think much more \nneeds to be done to restore equity to the program.\n  (2) Slightly increases payments to so-called ``new'' agencies, those \nin business since 1994. While in Louisiana this will only mean about an \nextra $52 per patient per year, it is important to recognize that new \nagencies need some relief.\n  (3) Increases the per visit cost limits from 105% of the national \nmedian to 110% of the national median.\n  (4) Most importantly, the Senate proposal delays the across-the-board \n15% reduction that is currently scheduled for October 1, 1999. HCFA was \noriginally required to institute a prospective payment system for home \nhealth agencies by October 1 of next year. Because of the Y2K problem, \nHCFA is now anticipating that it will not have PPS in place until April \n1, 2000. Delaying the automatic 15% reduction in payments to home \nhealth agencies will ensure that the agencies aren't punished for \nHCFA's inability to implement PPS in a timely manner.\n  The goal of this bill is to fix some of the problems created in the \nBBA. Again, it is certainly only a first step--there is still much more \nthat needs to be done and I am hopeful that the 106th Congress will \nrevisit this issue to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries continue to \nhave access to this very important benefit.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan measure. It may not \nbe everything everyone wants, but it certainly is better than doing \nnothing this year and it provides much-needed temporary relief to home \nhealth agencies across the country.\n  Mr. JEFFORD. Mr. President, today, I am very pleased to join in \nintroducing the Medicare Home Health Fair Payment Act, legislation that \nsignificantly improves the interim payment system to home health \nagencies established under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Over the \npast eight months, I have been working as hard as I know how to find a \nsolution for the crisis faced by our home health care agencies in \nVermont. Our 13 home health agencies are model agencies that provide \nhigh-quality, comprehensive home health care with a low price tag. \nHowever, under Medicare's new interim payment system the payments to \nthe agencies are so low that Vermont's seniors may be denied access to \nneeded home health services.\n\n[[Page S12346]]\n\n  Under the legislation, the reimbursement from Medicare to home health \nagencies will be increased, and the 15% across-the-board cut scheduled \nfor next year will be delayed by one year. Adoption of this bill will \ngive the Vermont home health agencies needed financial relief until a \nnew prospective payment system is in place.\n  For the past seven years, the average Medicare expenditure for home \nhealth care in Vermont has been the lowest in the nation. However, \nrather than being rewarded for this cost-effective program, Vermont has \nbeen penalized by the implementation of the current interim payment \nsystem. In June, 1998, Vermont's home health agencies projected that \nthe statewide impact of the current interim payment system was a loss \nof over $4.5 million in Medicare revenues for the first year. This \nrepresents a loss of over 11% on an annual base of $40 million \nstatewide.\n  Vermont is a good example of how the health care system can work to \nprovide for high quality care for Medicare beneficiaries. Home health \nagencies are a critical link in the kind of health system that extends \ncare over a continuum of options and settings. New technology and \nadvances in medical practice hospitals to discharge patients earlier. \nThey give persons suffering with acute or chronic illness the \nopportunity to receive care and live their lives in familiar \nsurroundings. Time and time again, Vermont's home health agencies have \nproven their value by providing quality, cost-effective services to \nthese patients. Yet time and again, federal policy seems to ensure that \ntheir good deeds should go punished.\n  The Medicare Home Health Fair Payment Act is the product of a great \ndeal of hard work by the Finance Committee and is carefully designed to \nease the burden of home health care agencies in the transitional years \nprior to the introduction of a new prospective payment system in 2000. \nThe bill includes several strong policy components, which promote \nequity and fairness among the agencies nationwide. Under the new \nprospective payment system, Vermont and other cost-effective agencies \ncan look forward to being rewarded rather than penalized for their \nhigh-quality, low-cost comprehensive medical care to beneficiaries.\n  It is my strong hope, that this bill will be adopted by the Senate, \nsupported by the House, and signed into law. I have worked closely with \nVermont's 13 home health agencies, Senator Leahy and the Governor's \nOffice in developing a solution to the payment crisis. The signing of \nthis bill will mark a victory for our State, and it will also reflect a \nstrong nationwide commitment to high-quality, cost-effective home \nhealth agencies such as those in Vermont.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the legislation \nintroduced by the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee. I \nwould have preferred the approach taken in my own home health bill, \nwhich I introduced last April and which has 29 Senate cosponsors, \nbecause it would have done more to level the playing field and provide \nmore relief to historically cost-effective agencies. However, I \nunderstand that the chairman faced a difficult task of balancing a \nnumber of competing issues, and the bill we are considering today is an \nimportant first step that will move the process forward and provide a \nmeasure of relief to those cost-effective agencies in every State that \nare currently being penalized by the formula used to calculate the per-\nbeneficiary limit.\n  America's home health agencies provide invaluable services that have \nenabled a growing number of our most frail and vulnerable Medicare \nbeneficiaries to avoid hospitals and nursing homes and stay just where \nthey want to be--in their own homes. However, critics have long pointed \nout that Medicare's historic cost-based payment for home health care \nhas inherent incentives for home care agencies to provide more \nservices, which has driven up costs.\n  Therefore, there was widespread support for the Balanced Budget Act \nprovision calling for the implementation of a prospective payment \nsystem for home care. Until then, home health agencies are being paid \naccording to a new ``interim payment system,'' which unfortunately is \ncritically flawed.\n  As we are all aware, the Health Care Financing Administration has \ndiverted considerable resources to solving its Y2K problem so that \nthere will be no slowdown of Medicare payments in 2000. As a result, \nimplementation of the prospective payment system for home health \nagencies will be delayed, and home health agencies will remain on IPS \nfar longer than Congress envisioned when it enacted the Balanced Budget \nAct. This makes it all the more imperative that we act now to address \nthe problems with a system that effectively rewards the agencies the \nhave provided the most visits and spent the most Medicare dollars, \nwhile it penalizes low-cost, more efficient providers.\n  Home health agencies in the Northeast are among those that have been \nparticularly hard-hit by the formula change. As the Wall Street Journal \nrecently observed, ``If New England had been just a little greedier, \nits home health industry would be a lot better off now . . . \nIronically, . . . [the region] is getting clobbered by the system \nbecause of its tradition of nonprofit community service and efficiency.\n  Moreover, there are wide disparities in payments and no logic to the \nvariance in payment levels. The average patient cap in the East South \nCentral region is almost $2,500 higher than New England's without any \nevidence that patients in the southern States are sicker or that nurses \nand other home health personnel in this region cost more.\n  Moreover, the current per-beneficiary limits range from a low of $760 \nfor one agency to a high of $53,000 at another. As such, the system \ngives a competitive advantage to high-cost agencies over their lower \ncosts neighbors, since agencies in a particular region may have \ndramatically different reimbursement levels regardless of any \ndifferences among their patient populations. And finally, this system \nmay force low-cost agencies to stop accepting patients with more \nserious health care needs.\n  Mr. President, I realize that we cannot address every home health \nissue that has been raised this year. Some matters will have to carry \nover to the next Congress, and I fully intend to work with my \ncolleagues next year on these items. Nonetheless, there are things we \ncan do this year, and I believe that it is imperative that Congress act \nnow to begin to address these problems. At least one agency in Maine \nhas closed because the reimbursement levels under this system fell so \nshort of its actual operating costs. Other cost-efficient agencies in \nmy State are laying off staff or declining to accept new patients with \nmore serious health conditions.\n  Which brings us back to the central and most critical issue--the real \nlosers in this situation are our seniors, since cuts of this magnitude \nsimply cannot be sustained without ultimately affecting patient care.\n  Mr. President, once again, I commend the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee for his efforts on this difficult issue and urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Roth, \nfor attempting to bring some resolution to the home health crisis \nbefore the end of this session and making much needed revisions to the \nMedicare home health interim payment system (IPS). I fully support \ndelaying the automatic 15 percent reduction for one year, raising the \ncost limits to 110 percent of the median, and raising payments for new \nagencies. However, I still have serious reservations about a blend \napproach which reshuffles the deck chairs on the Titanic. It is \nimperative that we restore access to home health care for medically \ncomplex patients, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to \naddress this issue in conference.\n  At this time my distinguished colleague from Mississippi, Mr. \nCochran, and I would like to engage the able Chair of the Senate \nFinance Committee, Mr. Roth, in a discussion about the problems that \nhave resulted from IPS, and further action that the Senate must take to \ncomplete the work begun this year in this important area.\n  Mr. President, there is not a single Member of the Senate or House of \nRepresentatives who has not become painfully aware of the serious \nproblems that have arisen within the home health program over the last \nyear. These problems stem from enactment\n\n[[Page S12347]]\n\nof a temporary payment system that was recommended to us by the Health \nCare Financing Administration. The fact is that the so-called interim \npayment system (IPS) was untested, and, as we have found, made such \nswift and deep cuts in reimbursements, thereby hampering the ability of \nhome care providers to serve needy patients and affecting access to \ncare for some of the most frail, oldest, and poorest of our seniors and \ndisabled.\n  The IPS is the worse case of false economy that I've ever seen. If \nthe elderly and disabled cannot get care at home, it's clear where they \nwill go for care. Emergency room costs will rise, patients will go into \nmore expensive institutionalized care, or patients simply won't get any \ncare at all. In addition to increasing Medicare costs, there will be an \nexplosion in Federal and State Medicaid budgets. I believe the Senator \nfrom Mississippi would agree that the problems brought about by IPS are \nsignificant.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the statements made by the Senator from \nMissouri are, I'm sad to say, quite true. Most recent official figures \nfrom 29 state health departments indicate that close to 800 agencies \nhave closed in those states. This number represents parent agencies; \nother data from the states indicate that the number of agencies and \nbranches that have closed is much higher. We also know that there are \nmany more agencies on the brink of closing if some relief from IPS is \nnot provided soon. If the current rate of closures continues, we could \neasily see a loss of 2,000 more home health agencies by October 1, \n1999.\n  Agency closing are resulting in significant beneficiary care access \nproblems. In fact, a recent GAO study found that two-thirds of \ndischarge planners and more than a third of the aging organizations \nsurveyed reported having had difficulty obtaining home health care for \nMedicare patients in the last year, especially those who need multiple \nweekly visits over an extended period of time. Matters will only get \nworse as agencies become more and more limited in their ability to \nprovide needed services. In fact, in testimony before the Ways and \nMeans Committee in August, Ms. Gail Wilensky, former head of the Health \nCare Financing Administration, warned that, if the Congress waits for \nproof that a crisis is occurring in home care before it acts, it will \nbe too late. She also indicated that more money was taken out of home \ncare than the Congress had expected when IPS was designed and then \nimplemented by HCFA.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I might add at this time that despite the \nfact that HCFA is responsible for this draconian system, HCFA has only \noffered technical assistance to address this crisis. HCFA must beheld \naccountable for this insane and inequitable system and face up to the \nfact that its system is wreaking havoc throughout our country.\n  Clearly the program cannot continue under this scenario and continue \nto provide quality services to eligible individuals. Some of my \ncolleagues may wonder how this all came about. Perhaps the Senator from \nMississippi can provide some insight into this.\n\n  Mr. Cochran. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. In addition to HCFA \nimposing an untested payment system with the home health IPS, the \nscoring mechanism used by CBO to estimate savings resulting from IPS \nincluded a \\2/3\\ behavioral offset. What this means is that CBO \npresumed that for every $3 saved under IPS, agencies would find some \nway, through expanding the number of beneficiaries they serve, to make \nup $2 of every $3 lost under IPS. What has become clear, as was \nindicated by the Senator from Missouri, CBO's behavioral assumptions \nabout agencies increasing the number of beneficiaries served have not \ncome to pass. Instead, we are seeing a near dismantling of the home \ncare program as the result of IPS.\n  We have already seen the devastating effects of the interim payment \nsystem in my state of Mississippi. While I applaud the Senate for its \nefforts to reform the interim payment system, we must commit ourselves \nto continuing this work as soon as the Senate reconvenes. I am \nparticularly concerned that we must address the problems that will be \ncreated by the automatic 15% reduction in payment limits which we have \nagreed to delay one year. It took this distinguished body that long to \nreach the temporary solutions which we have before us today and we \ncannot put off deliberations on this additional cut until the last \nmoment. Prudence dictates that we find ways to insure that any \nadditional cuts in reimbursement not adversely affect efficient \nproviders nor burden patients in their access to necessary home care \nservices.\n  Mr. Bond. Thank you for those insights Senator cochran. I fully agree \nthat this must be a priority of the Senate to address as soon as \npossible. There are additional issues which also need to be addressed \nat that time, particularly how to reimburse those agencies which serve \nour nation's most medically complex patients. We have a moral \nobligation to ensure that our nation's seniors and disabled are \nprovided the quality and comfortable care they deserve. In addition, we \nmust look at provisions which require that the payment limits are \nprorated where a patient is served by more than one agency. It is my \nunderstanding that the Health Care Financing Administration is not \ncapable of administering this provision, yet it is having impact on \npatient's access to care. The problem centers around the inability of a \nhome health agency to properly manage its business when it does not \nknow the ultimate payment limitation which it must budget. The home \nhealth agency has no way of knowing whether a patient has received \nservices from another home health agency during the year and cannot \npossibly figure out whether its breaking even or going broke. While we \ndo not want home health agencies to abuse the system through schemes \nthat allow them to circumvent the limits by transferring patients, we \nalso do not want to penalize patients and providers from the \nappropriate management of home care services. Another issue is the \nelimination of the periodic interim payment methodology scheduled for \nOctober, 1999. That termination date was chosen to coincide with \nimplementation of prospective payment system, which we now know, will \nnot be in operation at that stage. This Congress should recognize the \nneed to continue that system until such time as a Prospective Payment \nSystem is in place.\n  Mr. Cochran. Mr. President, I too am very concerned about the delay \nin the development and implementation of a PPS system. It is the only \nclear solution to deal with those complex patients who are having \nincreasing difficulty in gaining access to home care services. If we \ncannot have PPS soon, we must find a way to better reimburse agencies \nwhich care for these high cost patients. Home health agencies in \nMississippi report to me that this is one of the most important \nproblems that must be addressed. At the same time, putting together a \nPPS program will do no good if we destroy the foundation of our home \nhealth services delivery system. As the result of IPS, I am told that \nhome health agencies across the country will find some time in the \nmiddle of next year that they have likely been over paid by the \nMedicare program even though they delivered appropriate services to \npatients at a reasonable cost. This Congress must find a way to deal \nwith that pending crisis in order to protect those home health agencies \nthat met patient's needs yet still incurred costs beyond the arbitrary \nlimits which were developed under IPS.\n  Mr. Roth. Senator Bond and Senator Cochran, I thank you for your \nleadership within the Senate of these crucial issues affecting Medicare \nbeneficiaries across the country. Through your assistance we hope to \nensure that home health care is readily available where the needs \narise. We will continue to explore fully those issues which you have \nraised. We will also draw on the resources of Medpac, HCFA, the GAO, \nand representatives from home care patients and providers to determine \nwhether more work is required. Home health care is a crucial part of \nour health care system and the elderly and disabled protected by the \nMedicare program deserve the attention of this Congress to insure that \nwe not disrupt this important benefit without a full and accurate \nunderstanding of the consequences. Once again, I thank Senator Bond and \nSenator Cochran for the guidance that they have offered to this body in \naddressing these important issues.\n\n[[Page S12348]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to comment on the home health \nproposal that is before us and ask the Chairman of the Finance \nCommittee to clarify his intentions with regard to addressing this \nissue in the next Congress.\n  The current home health interim payment system isn't working. Under \nthe current system, those agencies that abused the system and milked \nMedicare for every possible reimbursement dollar are rewarded with \ngenerous cost limits. However, North Dakota agencies that did not abuse \nthe system, that worked hard to keep their costs down, are penalized \nwith unrealistically low limits. Not only is this terribly unfair, it \ncreates a terrible incentive for efficient, low-cost agencies to go out \nof business and transfer their employees and their customers to \nagencies that have ripped off the system.\n  This system clearly penalizes North Dakota home health agencies and \nthe beneficiaries who rely on their services. The median per \nbeneficiary cost limit for North Dakota home health agencies is the \nsecond lowest in the country--a mere $2150 per year. In fact, the \nagency in North Dakota with the highest limit has a cap that is below \nthe lowest limit in the state of Mississippi. There is no rational \nbasis for this sort of inequity.\n  Unfortunately, the proposal before us today takes only the smallest \nof steps toward correcting this inequity and leaves in place too many \nof the current incentives that favor high cost, wasteful home health \nagencies. I do not see how I can, in good conscience, go back to North \nDakota home health agencies and tell them that we can only lift their \npayments rates 2 or 3 percent when agencies in other parts of the \ncountry will continue to have payment limits 3 and 4 times as high as \ntheirs. It is not fair. It is not good policy. It is not good enough. \nFor that reason, I will feel constrained to object to this legislation \nunless I can be assured by the Chairman of the Finance Committee that \nthere will be an opportunity to do better next year.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I thank the gentleman from North Dakota for \nhis comments. He is right; this change is only a small step. It does \nnot ``fix'' the interim payment system. However, in the time remaining \nthis year, this is the best we can do. It takes an important step \ntoward making the system more fair, and it reduces the perverse \nincentives in the current system. In addition, it recognizes that the \nProspective Payment System for home health will be delayed, so it \ndelays for one year the 15% cut in payments that is currently scheduled \nto go into effect on October 1, 1999.\n  I want to assure my colleague from North Dakota, however, that I \nfully intend to revisit the home health issue next year. At that time, \nI pledge to work with him and other members of the Finance Committee to \nsee if we can come up with a system that better addresses the needs of \nNorth Dakota home health agencies.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chairman. With that assurance, I will drop my \nobjection and let this legislation move forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12343-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                S. 2130\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grams, the name of the Senator from Montana \n(Mr. Burns) was added as a cosponsor of S. 2130, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide additional retirement savings \nopportunities for small employers, including self-employed individuals.\n\n\n                       Senate Joint Resolution 56\n\n  At the request of Mr. Grassley, the names of the Senator from \nOklahoma (Mr. Nickles) and the Senator from Alabama (Mr. Sessions) were \nadded as cosponsors of Senate Joint Resolution 56, a joint resolution \nexpressing the sense of Congress in support of the existing Federal \nlegal process for determining the safety and efficacy of drugs, \nincluding marijuana and other Schedule I drugs, for medicinal use.\n\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Resolution 108\n\n  At the request of Mr. Dorgan, the name of the Senator from Minnesota \n(Mr. Wellstone) was added as a cosponsor of Senate Concurrent \nResolution 108, a concurrent resolution recognizing the 50th \nanniversary of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and for \nother purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12348-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO INDIANA STAFF\n\n Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ngroup of people that have been of tremendous service to me during my \ntenure as a United States Senator. That group is my Indiana staff.\n  As I have so often said, whatever success I have achieved during my \nservice as a Senator is greatly attributable to the tireless work of my \nstaff. Their hours are long, and they toil in relative obscurity. \nHowever, they do so for the same reason that we as Senator make the \nsacrifice. They work so hard because they believe in this great nation \nwe serve, and the ideals that are woven into the very fiber of our \nexistence as Americans.\n  So much of our work here in the Senate focuses on legislative \nactivity. For that is the stuff of headlines and news stories. However, \nit is hardly a reflection of one of the most fundamental \nresponsibilities of a United States Senator, and that is providing \ncaring and responsive service to the citizens of our state, the people \nwho's trust we are charged with protecting and serving. And, Mr. \nPresident, it is those people serving in my State and regional offices \nthat work so hard to insure that the needs and requests of my Indiana \nconstituents are met with friendly and effective service. They are the \nfront line, they are my eyes and ears in Indiana, and without their \nhard work, it would be impossible for me to serve effectively.\n  As the distinguished senior Senator from Indiana pointed out \nyesterday, we have a rather unique operation back in Indiana. The \nsenior Senator and I share a combined staff. They have served the state \nwell. I would like to take a moment now to acknowledge my Indiana \nstaff. Kathy Blane, Susan Brouillette, Sarah Dorste, Mark Doude, James \nGarrett, Amy Gaston, Michelle Mayer, Kevin Paicely, Lane Ralph, Karen \nSeacat, Libby Sims, Cory Shaffer, Angela Weston, Mike Duckworth, \nBarbara Keerl, David Graham, Pat McClain, Phil Shaull, Amy Hany, Tim \nSanders, and Barb Franz. I believe I have included everyone. If I have \nnot, let them know my appreciation.\n  As I have said, the distinguished senior Senator and I have shared \nstaff, and so many will continue to work for the citizens of Indiana. \nThough some will go on to other endeavors, that same sense of \nresponsibility and public service that has motivated them to date, I am \nsure will drive them to continue to play a positive role in the lives \nof Hoosiers for years to come.\n  I thank them and salute them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12348-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12348-S12349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JUDGE JAN SMITH\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \noutstanding Nevadan, my friend and former colleague, Judge Jan Smith. \nAt the age of seventy-one, after years of service as Justice of the \nPeace for the Jean-Good Springs community, Judge Smith will retire from \nthe bench next year. I want to take this opportunity pay tribute to Jan \nfor her efforts to improve the lives of so many Americans, because her \naccomplishments have helped us all.\n  I have been fortunate enough to be a first hand witness to some of \nJan's incredible achievements. I have watched her rise from legal aide \nand working mother in the early nineteen sixties to become one of \nNevada's most influential judicial officers.\n  After toiling away as a legal secretary for a District Attorney and a \ncounty judge, Jan became deeply involved with a variety of grass roots \ncauses. She was one of the first women in the state to be an advocate \non behalf of the environment. In the city of Henderson, she canvassed \nneighborhoods and city hall to prevent industry from inflicting \npermanent damage to the environment. As a mother of six, she was \ninsightful enough to take action so that her children could grow up \nwith an ample supply of clean air and water.\n  Judge Smith was also a champion for the underprivileged. She worked \ntirelessly to create opportunities for the poor and disadvantage in \nNevada. Like many of her contemporaries, she\n\n[[Page S12349]]\n\nmarched on behalf of women and children who needed a ``hand-up'', \nrather than a donation or handout.\n  When I served as Nevada's Lt. Governor, I began working closely with \nJan when she was chosen to run the Southern Nevada office of then \nGovernor Mike O'Callahan. Savvy and determined, she made an impression \non everyone she worked with throughout those six years. Much of her \nsuccess on the job came from her staunch work ethic and strong ties to \nboth her family and the community.\n  The people of Nevada were truly fortunate to have Judge Smith come \nout of semi retirement to accept an appointment as a Justice of the \nPeace for the Jean-Good Springs district. She single-handedly \nreorganized the court so that it eventually became a model of fairness \nand efficiency. She has subsequently been reelected with overwhelming \ncommunity support.\n  Judge Smith is one of the unsung heroes of the American justice \nsystem. Like many of our nation's Justice of the Peace Officers, she \ndoes not typically preside over big dollar, high drama cases. However, \nthose like Judge Smith are the representatives of our legal system most \nlikely to come in contact with everyday Americans. Professionals like \nJan do more to preside over basic public safety issues because they \nhandle the difficult events that are all too common in communities \nacross the country--drunk driving and domestic violence. Essentially, \nJan's career has required her or exercise judgement and make tough \ndecisions that have lasting impact.\n  Judge Jan Smith truly believes in the law, as a fellow officer of the \ncourt and United States Senator, I have relied upon on Judge Smith's \ntrademark intelligence and honesty, as well as her ability to astutely \nassess the character and behavior of the many Nevadans who visit her \ncourt.\n  Much of my admiration for Judge Smith stems from her enduring \ncommitment to people of the Silver State. Her values are reflected not \nonly in the way she lives her life, but in the many organizations she \nhas served over the past thirty years. Judge Smith's lifetime of \nachievement is truly an inspiration, and she serves as an incredible \nrole model for judicial prudence, legal acumen, and personal \nintegrity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12348-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REAUTHORIZATION OF THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT\n\n Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, on Friday, October 10th, I \nbecame a cosponsor of legislation introduced by Senator McCain that \nwould reauthorize the Older Americans Act. This Act, established in \n1965, established a series of programs to benefit older Americans. \nServices provided include nutrition, transportation, nursing home \nombudsmanship, and other senior's rights programs. Needless to say, \nArkansas, which has over 200,000 senior citizens, has benefitted \ngreatly from the services provided through the Older Americans Act. In \naddition, the organizations in Arkansas that have received funding \nthrough the Act have done an incredible job in reaching out to our \nseniors.\n  While the Older Americans Act expired in 1995, its programs have \nwidespread support, which has resulted in continued funding. \nNonetheless, authorization is critical for the long-term stability of \nthese programs and for the peace of mind of senior citizens. the McCain \nbill renews the act, without any changes, for a period of 3 years. Let \nme say that, as with any reauthorization, I strongly believe in the \nneed for congressional hearings to examine the programs contained \nwithin the act to ensure that they are working well, efficiently \nserving the needs of seniors, and that any appropriate adjustments in \nfunding are made. Regrettably, the Senate Labor and Human Resource \nCommittee, on which I serve, has not taken action on any \nreauthorization legislation this year. Until the committee does so, and \nas an indication of my very strong support for the programs contained \nin the Older American Act, I am cosponsoring the McCain bill.\n  The Older American Act has improved the quality of life for so many \nof our Nation's elderly, and it will continue to provide vital services \nas the aging population grows. I sincerely hope that the Senate will \nact on legislation to reauthorize this important act soon.\n  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12349-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12349-S12350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                FEDERAL MARITIME COMMISSION NOMINATIONS\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \ncongratulate two nominees, Mr. Hal Creel and Mr. John Moran, upon their \nconfirmation to be Federal Maritime Commissioners.\n  Hal Creel, a native of South Carolina and my former Senior Counsel on \nthe Maritime Subcommittee, has been a Federal Maritime Commissioner for \nfour years. He has served the last two and a half years as the agency's \nChairman. As Chairman, he has demonstrated a wide-ranging knowledge of \nthe maritime industry and an outstanding ability to oversee industry \nactivities. Our Nation is extremely fortunate to have such a dedicated \nindividual at the helm of this important government body.\n  Mr. Creel and the Federal Maritime Commission are responsible for \noverseeing all international liner shipping in the U.S.--over $500 \nbillion in trade. His efforts in the controversy surrounding Japan's \nrestrictive port practices come immediately to mind.\n  The Government of Japan for many years has orchestrated a system that \nimpedes open trade, unjustly favors Japanese companies, and results in \ntremendous inefficiencies for anyone serving Japan's ports. The FMC, \nunder Mr. Creel's guidance, met these problems head-on and he was \ninstrumental in bringing the two governments to the bargaining table. \nThe bilateral agreement that resulted paves the way for far-reaching \nchanges that can remove these unfair barriers to trade. The progress \nmade to date has occurred in large measure due to the Commission's \nfirm, results-oriented approach. I urge him to continue to keep the \nJapanese honest, and to perform their agreed upon obligations.\n  Hal Creel also has led the Commission in its efforts to resolve \nunfavorable trading conditions with the Peoples Republic of China and \nBrazil. These trades pose differing problems, but circumstances that \nnonetheless restrict U.S. companies or render their business dealings \nunnecessarily difficult or simply inefficient.\n  Hal Creel is widely respected by all sectors of the industry as an \ninvolved, knowledgeable Chairman who can be trusted to make impartial \ndecisions based on all relevant factors. This has been evidenced by the \nobjective, informed decisions he renders in formal proceedings, his \nvoting record on important agency matters, and the evenhanded \nenforcement program administered by the Commission. As Chairman of the \nFMC, Hal Creel has worked hard to curb harmful practices and create \nequitable trading conditions for the entire industry. He takes a \npersonal stake in these matters and works hard to obtain compliance \nwith the laws passed by this Congress. But those who willfully violate \nthe law or intentionally disregard the Nation's ocean shipping policies \nas contained in the Shipping Act are dealt with appropriately.\n  These are turbulent times in the liner shipping industry, times that \ncall for effective and respected leadership from our Nation's \nregulatory body. Mr. Creel provides that leadership now, and I am \ncertain will continue to do so as the industry enters the new \nenvironment that will result from the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998 \npassed by this body last week.\n  I am proud of the accomplishments and fine work Hal has done at the \nFMC. I am also proud that he is a native South Carolinian. He certainly \nhas continued the fine tradition and excellence he has established as a \nstaffer and senior counsel for the Senate Commerce Committee. His \nreappointment is well deserved.\n  I also wish to convey my support for John Moran to become a \nCommissioner at the FMC. John also is a former Commerce Committee \ncounsel who served all members of that Committee with distinction. John \nand Hal worked together at the Committee on a bipartisan basis, \nslugging through tough issues and serving all of the Members well.\n  For my Senate colleagues who do not know Mr. Moran, his only fault is \nthat he is not from South Carolina. He has\n\n[[Page S12350]]\n\ndemonstrated his abilities and intellect time and time again. He is \nwell suited to be a Federal Maritime Commissioner. Currently, John \nworks representing the American Waterways Operators, as their Vice \nPresident for legislative affairs. John also has an outstanding \nreputation within the maritime and transportation industry sectors.\n  I congratulate these two deserving individuals, who have been \nappointed to the agency which plays such a critical role in \ninternational trade.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12349-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12350-S12351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              THE REPUBLICAN PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS ACT\n\n Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak in strong support of \nS. 2330, the Patients' Bill of Rights Act. As an original cosponsor, \nI'm confident that this legislation is the logical step to ensure \nAmericans accessible and affordable healthcare.\n  On January 13, 1998, the Majority Leader created the Republican \nHealth Care Task Force to begin pouring the foundation for a \ncomprehensive piece of legislation that would enhance the quality of \ncare without dismantling access and affordability. For the last seven \nmonths, the task force met every Thursday--and other times as needed--\nwith scores of stakeholders prior to writing this bill. Such thorough \nsteps in writing a bill have clearly paid off. We now have legislation \nthat would provide patients' rights and quality healthcare without \nnationalized, bureaucratized, budget-busting, one-size-fits-all \nmandates.\n  In 1993, President and Mrs. Clinton launched an aggressive campaign \nto nationalize the delivery of healthcare under the guise of modest \nreform. The sales pitch was backed with scores of anecdotes illustrated \nfrom Presidential podiums across the country. The stories pulled on the \nheartstrings of all Americans and were intentionally aimed at injecting \nfear and paranoia into all persons covered or not covered by private \nhealth insurance.\n  I am quick to ask my constituents interested in the President's bill \nto carefully examine the fine print. It's no surprise to me that most \nof them already have. The American people haven't forgotten the last \ntime this Administration tried to slip nationalized healthcare past \ntheir noses. Folks in this town may be surprised to learn that the \nAmerican people aren't a bunch of pinheads. Anyone can put lipstick on \na pig, give it a fancy Hollywood title, and hope for an election-year \nslam dunk. Expecting the public to close its eyes and kiss that pig, \nhowever, is an entirely different matter.\n  The American people understand what's going on here. They know full \nwell that higher premiums mean no coverage. Why? Because affordable \naccess to healthcare is an even higher priority than quality. If it \nisn't affordable, it doesn't exist! By issuing one-size-fits-all \nmandates and setting the stage for endless litigation, the President's \nbill could dramatically raise the price of premiums--barring people \nfrom purchasing insurance. The President would be well advised to call \nhis legislation the ``Patient's Bill,'' because a costly bill is \nexactly what Americans would receive. That's the bottom line for \nAmerican families--the cost. We all want quality. There isn't a member \nin Congress who doesn't want quality. But if Americans are expected to \npay up to 23 percent higher premiums to get it, they'll most often have \nto go without insurance. It's that simple.\n  I remember the reaction Wyoming residents had to the 1993 ``Clinton \nCare'' plan. I was a State Senator living in Gillette, Wyoming at the \ntime. I recall how the President and First Lady rode a bus across \nAmerica--promoting nationalized healthcare. I also remember the detour \nthey took when they arrived at the Wyoming border. Instead of entering \nmy home state, they chose a more populated route through Colorado. That \nwas an unfortunate choice. They missed an important healthcare point. \nHad they driven all 400 miles across southern Wyoming, they would have \nseen for themselves why one-size-fits-all legislation doesn't work in \nrural, under-served states.\n  Affordable and accessible care is THE life-line for Wyoming \nresidents. I live in a city of 22,000 people. It's 145 miles to another \ntown of equal or greater size. Many of my constituents have to drive up \nto 125 miles one-way just to receive basic care. More importantly, \nthough, is the difficulty we face enticing doctors and practitioners to \nlive and practice medicine in Wyoming. I'm very proud of Wyoming's \nhealth care professionals. They practice with their hearts, not their \nwallets.\n  In a rural, under-served state like Wyoming, only three managed care \nplans are available and that covers just six counties. Once again, this \nis partly due to my state's small population. Managed care plans \ngenerally profit from high enrollment, and as a result, the majority of \nplans in Wyoming are traditional indemnity plans--commonly known as \nfee-for-service. Some folks might wonder why I am so concerned about \nthe President's healthcare package, especially since it's geared toward \nmanaged care. I'm concerned because a number of Wyoming insurers offer \nmanaged care plans elsewhere. Any premium hike spurred by mandates in \nthe Presidents' bill could be distributed across the board--causing \nincreases in the fee-for-service premiums in Wyoming. Simply put, my \nconstituents could easily end up paying for services they'll never get! \n40 percent of my constituents are self-insured--meaning they pay for \ntheir own health insurance out of their own pockets. Expecting my \nconstituents to pay more poses a clear and potential threat to exclude \nthem from health insurance coverage. The urban areas get the care--we \nget the cost. Added cost--that's it--that's all.\n  The Republican plan is the right choice for America. It would \nsafeguard 48 million people out of the 124 million now covered by the \n1974 Employee Retirement Income Security Act or ERISA by requiring that \ngroup healthcare plans provide enrollees with: access to emergency \nmedical care; point-of-service coverage; access to ob-gyn care; access \nto pediatric care; continuity of care; and, a ban on patient/doctor \n``gag'' rules. ERISA plans, whether fully-insured or self-insured, \nwould also be required to provide enrollees with information about \nplans and providers such as options, restrictions and descriptions.\n  The Republican Patients' Bill of Rights would also allow a patient to \nhold their health plan accountable. The President's bill, however, \nwould allow a patient to sue their own health plan and tie up state \ncourts with litigation for months or years. The only people that \nbenefit from this would be trial lawyers. The patient, however, would \nbe lucky to get a decision about their plan before their ailment \nadvanced or even took their life. A big settlement doesn't do much good \nif you got it, because you died while the trial lawyers fiddled with \nthe facts. Folks aren't interested in suing their health plan. They \nwatch enough court-TV shows to know how expensive that process is and \nhow long it takes to get a decision made. This isn't L.A. Law--it's \nreality. The Republican Patients' Bill of Rights avoids all this by \nincorporating an internal appeals process that doesn't exceed 72 hours. \nIf not satisfied, an enrollee would be able to access an external \nreview by independent medical experts. Getting quick decisions saves \nlives.\n  The President has repeatedly said that the Republican Patients' Bill \nof Rights should apply to all health insurance plans. Such claims are \nno different than those made by the President back in 1993. He wants \nnationalized healthcare--plain and simple. There is a reason the \nRepublican bill only amends ERISA. It's because the 124 million ERISA \nenrollees are not regulated by the states. The states, by the way, have \nbeen in the business of regulating the health insurance industry far \nlonger than Congress or any President was beating up on managed care.\n  The President wants all regulatory decisions about a person's health \ninsurance plan to be made from Washington--nationalized care. The \nreason this won't work is that it fails to take into account the unique \ntype of healthcare provided in states like Wyoming. While serving in \nthe Wyoming Legislature for 10 years, I gained tremendous respect for \nour state insurance commissioner's ability to administer quality \nguidelines and insurance regulations that cater to our state. State \nregulation and understanding is absolutely, unequivocally essential. I \nfirmly believe that decisions which impact my constituents' health \ninsurance should continue\n\n[[Page S12351]]\n\nto be made in Cheyenne--not Washington.\n  Congress has an obligation to ensure such quality services to the 124 \nmillion ERISA enrollees whose plans are currently absent these \nprotections. In doing so, however, the Republican bill stays within its \njurisdictional boundaries and doesn't trample over states' rights. As a \nresult, Americans can gain protections whether they are insured under a \nstate, ERISA, or Medicare regulated plan. I believe that this approach \nis rational and fair.\n  The Republican Patients' Bill of Rights would provide individual \nrights with respect to a person's own, personal health information. \nAccess to personal medical records is a delicate matter. Provisions, \nhowever, are included to address inspection and copying of a person's \nmedical information. Safeguards and enforcement language has also been \nadded to guarantee confidentiality. In relation to this language, group \nhealth plans and health insurance issuers in both the group and \nindividual market would be prohibited from collecting or using \npredictive genetic information about a patient with the intention of \ndenying health insurance coverage or setting premium rates.\n  The Republican plan would establish the Agency for Healthcare Quality \nResearch. This is not a new federal agency, but rather a new name for \nthe current Agency for Health Care Policy and Research within the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. This agency would be \nmodernized to improve healthcare quality throughout America. The agency \nwould not mandate a national definition of quality, but it would \nprovide information to patients regarding the quality of care people \nreceive, allow physicians to compare their quality outcomes with their \npeers, and enable employers and individuals to make prudent purchases \nbased on quality.\n  The Senate Labor Committee held a number of hearings in relation to \nwomen's health research and prevention. As a result, the Republican \nPatients' Bill of Rights includes a number of important provisions that \nrepresent women's health. These provisions will clearly benefit the \npromotion of basic and clinical research for osteoporosis, breast and \novarian cancer, the effects of aging and other women's health issues.\n  Finally, the Republican Patients' Bill of Rights broadens access to \ncoverage by removing the 750,000 cap on medical savings accounts \n(MSA's). MSA's are a success and should be made available to anyone who \nwishes to control their own healthcare costs. Moreover, persons who pay \nfor their own health insurance could deduct 100 percent of the costs if \nthe Republican plan is enacted. This would have a dramatic impact on \nfolks from Wyoming. These provisions would, without a doubt, pave the \nway for quality healthcare to millions of Americans without dismantling \naccess and affordability.\n  While the President's bill has been pitched as being essential to \nenhancing the quality of care Americans receive, I hope that my \ncolleagues will carefully evaluate the impact that any nationalized, \nbureaucratized, budget-busting, one-size-fits-all bill would have on \nour nation's healthcare system. As I have encouraged my constituents to \nread the fine print, I ask my colleagues to consider how the \nPresident's legislation impacts you and your home state. Rural states \ndeserve a voice, too. Only the Republican Patients' Bill of Rights Act \nwould give them that voice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12350-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12351-S12353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       HURRICANE GEORGES AND THE DISASTER MITIGATION ACT OF 1998\n\n GRAHAM. Mr. President, on September 30th, with my colleagues \nSenator Mack and Florida Governor Lawton Chiles, I participated in a \nhelicopter tour of Florida's Panhandle, where once again, Mother Nature \nhas subjected Florida's citizens to her wrath. After first devastating \nthe Florida Keys, Hurricane Georges moved northward and severely \nimpacted the Panhandle, producing rainfall in excess of 2 feet in some \nareas.\n  In the Florida Keys, Georges damaged over 1,500 homes destroying or \ncausing major damage to approximately 640 residences. Initial estimates \nindicate that Georges caused over $250 million in insured damage in the \nKeys, and there are millions more in uninsured damages. Many residents \nin the lower Keys have only recently had their power restored, and \nFederal, State, local, and voluntary agencies provided food, water, and \nice for more than a week as the Keys finally emerged from this \nemergency situation.\n  Unfortunately--as I was able to view firsthand--Georges path of \ndestruction did not end in the Keys. Even in its weakened state, \nGeorges caused extensive flooding and isolated tornadoes throughout the \nPanhandle. At least 20 major roads were closed or partially closed, and \nevacuations continued for days in many low-lying areas. During my visit \nto the area, 14 shelters remained open, providing safe harbor for at \nleast 400 Floridians who had been forced from their homes.\n  As a result of this hurricane, the President issued an emergency \ndeclaration for 33 Florida counties, in order to provide immediate \nFederal assistance to protect the lives and property of affected \nresidents. On September 28, the President issued a major disaster \ndeclaration for Monroe County, which authorizes Federal disaster \nrecovery assistance for local governments and citizens in the Florida \nKeys. As of today, 16 counties in and around the Panhandle have been \nadded to this declaration, and I want to acknowledge the outstanding \nefforts of both the President and the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency (FEMA) in expediting Federal assistance to the State of Florida.\n  Mr. President, throughout 1998, I have come to the Senate floor to \ndescribe the destruction and misery that Florida has experienced as a \ndirect result of natural disasters. This year, Florida has been \nsubjected to a series of unprecedented natural disasters. Even for a \nstate that is experienced in dealing with such disasters, Floridians \nhave been tested again and again by what may be one of the worst years \nin Florida meteorological history. In late January and early February--\nin the midst of our State's dry season--several Northern Florida \ncounties were deluged by massive floods. Not long after, parts of \nCentral Florida were devastated by thunderstorms and tornadoes that are \nmore typical in the summer months. Beginning in May and ending in late \nJuly, a deadly combination of intense heat and prolonged drought \nsparked more than 2,000 forest fires in Florida's 67 counties. Finally, \nover the next several weeks, Florida will begin the long and painful \nprocess of recovery from the widespread damage that has been caused by \nHurricane Georges.\n  I ask that this September 30 article from the Miami Herald--which \nsummarizes Florida's 6 Presidential disaster declarations in more \ndetail--be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n               Florida Get Federal Aid a Record Six Times\n\n                            (By Tom Fiedler)\n\n       For Floridians, this has been a banner year of hell and \n     high water. President Clinton said so.\n       Even before Hurricane Georges slapped the Keys unsilly, \n     then dumped tons of fresh rain on an already sodden \n     Panhandle, Florida had established in 1998 a new--although \n     dubious--record: recipient of the most presidential disaster \n     declarations in a single year.\n       ``It's been a very hard year,'' said Joseph Myers, state \n     director of emergency management, who on Tuesday was into his \n     seventh straight day of working around the clock monitoring \n     the latest disaster. ``But that's what we get paid to do.''\n       He would be entitled to wonder if that could possibly be \n     pay enough, at least this year.\n       Like home-run sluggers Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, Florida \n     established its new record with style, shattering the \n     previous marks by more than a couple.\n       Since New Year's Day, which Myers spent monitoring a chain \n     of tornadoes ripping their way across the central peninsula, \n     causing at least $24 million in damage to crops and homes. \n     President Clinton has declared at least parts of Florida to \n     be federal disaster areas six times.\n       That topped the previous records of three in 1992--the year \n     that included the mother of all disaster declarations. \n     Hurricane Andrew--and 1995, which featured Hurricanes Erin \n     and Opal, both concentrating their fury on the upper Gulf \n     Coast.\n       To qualify for a presidential disaster declaration, the \n     amount of damage must be beyond the ability of state and \n     local government to assist, either because of the amounts of \n     money involved or the types of assistance needed.\n       When the president issues a declaration, it makes available \n     federal money to reimburse\n\n[[Page S12352]]\n\n     the state, and local governments for the immediate costs of \n     meeting the emergency--such as in providing police and fire \n     services, maintaining shelters or in restoring vital \n     services.\n       It also activates several federal programs to aid in a \n     community's long-term recovery. That array includes \n     unemployment assistance to those whose jobs may have been \n     lost or interrupted because of the disaster; mortgage \n     assistance; low-interest loans to help businesses and farmers \n     get back on their feet; money for governments to rebuild \n     highways or restore other services--including replacing lost \n     tax revenues from damaged businesses; and money that can be \n     used to avert future disasters, such as constructing dikes \n     against floods or beach dunes against hurricanes.\n\n\n                          variety of disasters\n\n       What distinguishes 1998 from previous years is the variety \n     of disasters that has befallen the state. Besides hurricanes, \n     which can destroy people and property through high water and \n     wind, this year's declarations have included several for \n     killer tornadoes, one for massive flooding and--most dramatic \n     of all--one for infernal fires that raged for nearly two \n     months over an area that at one point stretched nearly from \n     Tallahassee to Miami.\n       Missing only were the biblical swarms of locusts and the \n     medieval bubonic plague.\n       Myers said his personal disaster calendar began last \n     Christmas, when he was summoned to the state's emergency-\n     management headquarters to monitor a winter storm exploding \n     out of the Gulf and hammering counties in Central Florida. \n     the storm--considered the shock troops of El Nino--spun off \n     dozens of tornadoes, washed out hundreds of homes and \n     virtually ruined tomato and strawberry crops that were \n     ripening. Its cost: about $24 million to taxpayers alone, not \n     counting what insurance companies paid to individuals.\n\n\n                           tornadoes in miami\n\n       Holidays seemed as magnets to these storms. On Groundhog \n     Day, another winter storm rumbled out of the Gulf to cut \n     across the lower peninsula. This one triggered tornadoes in \n     the heart of Miami.\n       The so-called Groundhog Day storm savaged 600 homes in \n     Dade, Broward and Monroe counties. It left two tugboats \n     parked on Sunny Isles Beach and caused $2 million in damage \n     to the Keys' lobstering industry.\n       Barely three weeks later, another storm hammered the \n     central part of the state, coming ashore in the Tampa Bay \n     area but spreading throughout the peninsula. Myers said the \n     president was still in the process of issuing the disaster \n     declaration for the Groundhog Day storm when the bad weather \n     hit.\n       ``So they just added this onto the one they were already \n     working with,'' he said. ``The storm kept on coming, and they \n     kept on adding.''\n       The most dramatic were bands of swarming tornadoes that \n     bracketed Orlando in March, flattening communities near \n     Kissimmee and those east of Sanford. All told, nearly two \n     dozens Floridians were killed in those weather disasters.\n\n\n                           most of the state\n\n       ``Eventually they got to 56 counties,'' only 11 short of \n     Florida's 67 counties, Myers said. ``They finally stopped \n     adding them on April 24.''\n       The lull in El Nino's wind and rain proved anything but \n     benign, however. With such a wet spring, the underbrush in \n     the state's forests grew at an incredible pace, becoming lush \n     and thick.\n       ``Then it just dried up. It didn't rain,'' Myers said. ``We \n     knew that El Nino would produce fires, but we thought they \n     would come later.''\n       June was the driest month in Florida's history. The \n     underbrush became tinder.\n       On June 6, the anniversary of D-Day, a major fire flared in \n     Flagler County between Daytona Beach and St. Augustine. It \n     raged for 48 days. President Clinton and Vice President Al \n     Gore were among those who came to inspect the disaster. Fire \n     crews from around the nation came to fight it.\n       ``We ended up getting a major disaster declaration and 15 \n     fire suppression grants to pay for the firefighting,'' the \n     first time Florida had ever received such compensation, Myers \n     said.\n       Florida's cost of fighting the fires alone hit $156 \n     million.\n Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, my experiences with disasters this \nyear--in addition to the unforgettable destruction of Hurricane Andrew \nin 1992--have motivated me to re-evaluate the policies and programs \nthat are implemented to ease the pain and economic loss caused by \ndisasters. First, we must recognize that we cannot prevent severe \nweather events. In fact, it seems that as we approach the millennium, \nthe Nation is experiencing severe weather more frequently--and more \nintensely--than ever before. Second, as our population grows, our \ncoastal and riverfront communities have greatly expanded, placing an \neven higher number of citizens at risk from floods and hurricanes. \nFinally, expanded requirements for housing and residential structures \nhave increased both the number and value of property developments in \nhigh-risk areas.\n  Taken together, these facts clearly demonstrate that we will continue \nto experience losses from natural disaster. Therefore, we must act now \nto limit these inevitable losses through a proactive, nationwide loss \nprevention and mitigation initiative. We cannot continue to respond to \nrepeat disasters in the same locations in an endless cycle of damage-\nrepair-damage-repair.\n  It is for these reasons, Mr. President, that Senator Inhofe and \nmyself introduced the Disaster Mitigation Act of 1998. Our legislation \nfocuses the energies of Federal, State, and local governments on \ndisaster mitigation, shifting the Nation's efforts toward \npreventative--rather than responsive--actions, in order to prepare our \ncitizens for disasters now and in the future.\n  I worked very closely with Senator Inhofe to develop this bipartisan \nlegislation, which has been reported out of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee. This legislation will more comprehensively and \nefficiently address the threats we face from disasters of all types. \nThe bill is composed of two titles: Title I seeks to reduce the impact \nof disasters by authorizing a ``pre-disaster mitigation'' program; \nTitle II seeks to streamline the current disaster assistance programs \nto save administrative costs, and to simplify these programs for the \nbenefit of States, local communities, and individual disaster victims.\n  To address the problems associated with the damage-repair-damage-\nrepair cycle, the legislation places its primary emphasis on \ncomprehensive pre-disaster mitigation. This bill will authorize a five-\nyear pre-disaster mitigation program, funded at $35 million per year, \nto be administered by Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. The \npre-disaster mitigation program will change the focus of our efforts, \nat all levels of government, to preventative--rather than responsive--\nactions in planning for disasters. Such a change in ideology is \ncritical to reducing the short- and long-term costs of natural \ndisasters. It will encourage both the public and the private sector, as \nwell as individual citizens, to take responsibility for the threats \nthey face by adopting the concept of disaster mitigation into their \neveryday lives. Just like energy conservation, recycling, and the \nwidespread use of seat belts, disaster mitigation should become a \nconcept that all citizens incorporate into their day-to-day existence.\n\n  Since 1993, under the leadership of Director James Lee Witt, FEMA has \ntruly changed its way of doing business. In the past five years, FEMA \nhas become more responsive to disaster victims and State and local \ngovernments, and has ``reinvented'' itself by choosing to focus its \nenergy on mitigating, preparing for, responding to, and recovering from \nthe effects of natural hazards. FEMA has already taken an important \nfirst step in advocating pre-disaster mitigation by establishing \n``Project Impact,'' their new mitigation initiative, in local \ncommunities throughout the nation. I am proud to say that Deerfield \nBeach, Florida, was the first community to be chosen as a participant \nin Project Impact. By authorizing the conduct of Project Impact for \nfive years in this legislation, we will definitively endorse both the \nprogram and Director Witt's leadership, and we expect that the \ninitiative will produce measurable results in reducing the costs of \ndisaster in the future.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is the result of coordination and \ncooperation with FEMA, the National Association of Emergency \nManagement, the National League of Cities, representatives of the \nprivate and voluntary sectors, and numerous other state and local \ngovernmental organizations. I strongly believe that this legislation \nrepresents a historic change in the nation's efforts to prevent the \neffects of natural disasters. By taking proactive steps to implement \nmitigation now, we will reduce the damage, pain, and suffering from \ndisasters in the future that have become all too familiar to us from \nthe disasters we have faced in the recent past.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support Senator Inhofe and \nmyself by joining with us in our efforts to protect the citizens of the \nU.S. from disasters now and in the future. I ask the Senators who have \nmost recently been affected by Hurricane Georges, as well\n\n[[Page S12353]]\n\nas the many Senators whose constituents have been impacted by \ncatastrophic disasters over the past several years, to support this \nlegislation and ensure its passage before the end of this \nsession.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12351-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATIONAL OPTICIANS MONTH\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, January 1999 will be celebrated \nthroughout the United States as National Opticians Month. I am pleased \nto inform my colleagues that one of my constituents, Gary R. Aiken of \nMinnetonka, Minnesota, is president of the Opticians Association of \nAmerica, which is sponsoring the observance.\n  Nearly all Americans aged 65 or older require some help to see their \nbest and sixty percent of Americans wear eyeglasses or contact lenses. \nOpticians, skilled in fitting and dispensing eyeglasses and contact \nlenses, provide the expert assistance we need to make the most of our \nvision. Technology has brought us literally thousands of possible \ncombinations of eyeglass frames and lenses and an array of contact \nlenses. Dispensing opticians play a pivotal role in guiding eyewear \ncustomers to the combination which exactly fits their need.\n  Through formal education programs, voluntary national certification \nand mandatory licensing in many states, and programs of continuing \neducation, dispensing opticians acquire the skills and competence to \ncorrectly, efficiently and effectively fill eyewear prescriptions. At \nthe same time, retail opticians are an important part of our nation's \nsmall business community and provide the competitive balance which \nkeeps eyewear affordable for all Americans.\n  It is a pleasure to acknowledge the important role of dispensing \nopticians as they assist us all in making the most of our precious \neyesight. I commend them for their efforts and congratulate Gary Aiken \nand the members of the Opticians Association of America for their \naccomplishments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12353-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12353]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MICHAEL K.

He has also been a visiting professor at the \nMaxwell School of Citizenship at Syracuse University and director of \nSyracuse's study center in Strasbourg, France.\n  In addition to his broad academic experience, Dr. Simpson has \ndedicated himself to the people of Oneida County, New York. As the \ncommunity representative and chairperson of the Health and Hospital \nCouncil of the Mohawk Valley from 1987-1992, he lead that Council \ntoward developing a hospital consolidation plan for four area \nhospitals.

As the world's fourteenth largest economic \nentity, Taiwan plays a significant role in global trade and Asian \neconomies. With its per capita income of $13,000 US dollars, Taiwan \nprovides an important market for American consumer goods.\n  In addition to its economic successes, Taiwan has embarked upon a \ndemocratic course resulting in a pluralistic society which enjoys basic \ndemocratic rights and freedoms including freedom of the press and \ndirect elections for the president and other officials.\n  The people of Taiwan and its leadership should be very proud of the \nsuccesses that they have achieved. I congratulate them on this special \nday.\n\n                          PRIVATE RELIEF BILLS\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased that key members \nof the Senate have agreed to pass all the pending private relief bills \nin one package and send it over to the House.\n  I would like to thank the principals who have been involved in this \neffort, Senators Hatch, Abraham, Leahy and Kennedy. This package will \ninclude my bill to help Vova Malofienko.\n  Let me tell you a little about Vova Malofienko and his family. Vova \nwas born in Chernigov, Ukraine, just 30 miles from the Chornobyl \nnuclear reactor.\n  In 1986, when he was just two, the reactor exploded and he was \nexposed to high levels of radiation. He was diagnosed with leukemia in \nJune 1990, shortly before his sixth birthday.\n  Through the efforts of the Children of Chornobyl Relief Fund, Vova \nand his mother came to the United States with seven other children to \nattend Paul Newman's ``Hole in the Wall'' camp in Connecticut.\n  While in this country, Vova was able to receive extensive cancer \ntreatment and chemotherapy. In November of 1992, his cancer went into \nremission.\n  Regrettably, the other children from Chornobyl were not as fortunate. \nThey returned to the Ukraine and they died one by one because of \ninadequate cancer treatment. Not a child survived.\n  The air, food, and water in the Ukraine are still contaminated with \nradiation and are perilous to those like Vova who have a weakened \nimmune system.\n  Additionally, cancer treatment available in the Ukraine is not as \nsophisticated as treatment available in the United States.\n  Although Vova completed his chemotherapy in 1992, he continues to \nneed medical follow-up on a consistent basis, including physical \nexaminations, lab work and radiological examinations to assure early \ndetection and prompt and appropriate therapy in the unfortunate event \nthe leukemia recurs.\n  Because of his perilous medical condition, Vova and his family have \ndone everything possible to remain in the United States. Since 1992, \nthey have obtained a number of visa extensions, and I have helped them \nwith their efforts.\n  In March of 1997, the last time the Malofienkos visas were expiring, \nI appealed to the INS and the family was given what I was told would be \nfinal one-year extension.\n  So we have a family battling for over six years now, to stay in this \ncountry. And why? So that they can save the life of their child, Vova.\n  Because of the compelling circumstances of their case, I introduced \nS. 1460, which was approved unanimously by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  After I introduced that bill, Senator Abraham, in his capacity as \nChairman of the Immigration Subcommittee, requested a report from the \nINS and that stayed any further INS proceedings.\n  But at the end of this Congress they would be subject to deportation. \nThat is why I have worked so hard to get this bill passed this session \nof Congress.\n  This family has endured enough. They cannot have the threat of \ndeportation hanging over their heads. They are dealing with enough \ntrauma from Vova's cancer.\n  I wish my colleagues could meet Vova--then they would understand why \nI feel so strongly about this case. He is truly a remarkable young man.\n  Throughout his battle against cancer, he has been an inspiration. He \nhas been an honors student at Millburn Middle School, and he is an \neloquent spokesperson for children with cancer. He has rallied the \ncommunity and helped bring out the best in everyone. His dedication, \ngrace, and dignity provide an outstanding example, not just to young \npeople, but to all Americans.\n\n[[Page S12354]]\n\n  Again, I want to thank Senators Hatch, Abraham, Leahy and Kennedy for \ntheir diligence.\n  I hope that we will pass this package on Monday and send it to the \nHouse and then the President. Then, Vova can continue his fight in the \nsafety of United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/10/senate-section/article/S12353-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12354]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECESS UNTIL 2 P.M.
