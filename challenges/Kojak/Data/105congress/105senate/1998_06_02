Mr. President, I returned Sunday night from a 9-day trip \nto Turkey and central Asia. I would like to share with this body and my \ncolleagues some observations from that trip and of the last year and a \nhalf.\n  There are dangerous and serious events and conflicts occurring all \nover the globe today. The most urgent and most immediate has occurred \nin Pakistan and India, but beyond Pakistan and India, beyond the \nsubcontinent of Asia, we find a continuing problem with the Asian \nfinancial crisis throughout Southeast Asia, IMF funding, China MFN \nstatus, China technology sales, Russia-Japan economic trouble. We are \nin terrible trouble in the Middle East peace process, probably at its \nlowest ebb since the process began; Bosnia-Kosovo, east Africa, central \nAsia where there is fighting now in the northwest\n\n[[Page S5528]]\n\ncorner of Georgia; Azerbaijan and Armenia are at war over Nagorno-\nKarabakh, and other areas of the world that are of great concern to the \nstability and concern of the world.\n  These situations are all connected. We must develop a foreign policy \nthat captures the completeness of this interconnect. We also must tone \ndown our rhetoric and speak and act responsibly. Actions have \nconsequences. Words have consequences. Words have consequences \nespecially overseas. We are seeing a geopolitical, military, and \neconomic structure shift like the world has never seen. With diffusion \nof power across the globe, stability and security and peace with new \nalliances and new alignments become critical to our future, the future \nof the world.\n  One element of our foreign policy--sanctions--needs to be reviewed. \nSanctions without our allies' support do not work. We are living in a \ndifferent world. Sanctions are of limited value. Withholding MFN status \nfrom China accomplishes what. Withholding additional IMF funding \naccomplishes what. We will soon be debating in this body religious \npersecution legislation to accomplish what. We are playing a very \ndangerous game here. Isolating ourselves where we have very little \nleverage over other countries and isolating other nations by driving \nthem further away makes no sense to our national interests and the \ninterests of the world.\n  This may be the most important time since World War II when a strong \nbipartisan, a strong bipartisan American foreign policy is required. \nThe world has changed at a rate unseen and unparalleled in the history \nof man. This complicates how we deal with crises and problems and \nrelationships. Technology and communications have changed the dynamics \nof the world. We must bring together the world's interests--not at the \nexpense of national sovereignty. America's strategic triad for the next \ncentury is a strong national defense, a strong trade and foreign \npolicy, and a strong economy. And I will have more to say about that \nlater.\n  Congress must be very careful in what we say and what we do as we \nproceed along a very dangerous path. We must be careful not to weaken \nor neuter the President in front of the world. The world is very \ndangerous and unpredictable. Congress must not micromanage foreign \npolicy. I have been as outspoken as any Senator on this floor about the \nconcerns and the differences I have with this administration on foreign \npolicy. It is the responsibility of the Senate to question that, to \nprobe that. But we have to understand that whatever we say and do has \nconsequences, reverberations, ramifications. America must speak to the \nworld with some sense and some semblance of unity. We cannot allow our \nforeign policy to unravel before the eyes of the world during a very \ndangerous time. The world needs American leadership, consistency, \npresence and engagement. Without it, without American leadership, the \nworld becomes an even more dangerous place.\n  America must show the world that it is resolute about its basic \nbeliefs and freedoms and human rights and God-given rights. But we must \ndo it smartly, effectively, and with the objective of realistically and \ntruly changing the world for the better. Not headlines, not \nresolutions, not campaign promises, but understanding what this arch is \nabout: to get on the other side of true change, to alter the behavior \nof totalitarian, authoritarian governments. America will find itself \nisolated in the word if we continue to moralize to others and force \nevery aspect of our lifestyle and our way of life on others as a \nblueprint for their lives and societies.\n  Again, Congress must be very careful as we proceed. Nations, like \nindividuals, lead by example and force of character.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/02/senate-section/article/S5527-8", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               DEVASTATING STORMS IN MICHIGAN COMMUNITIES\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, yesterday I toured the Michigan \ncommunities of Walker and Merrill, two of the cities in Michigan which \nsuffered considerable destruction from severe storms that swept through \nour State on Sunday. These storms devastated communities ranging from \nGrand Traverse County, which is up in the northwest part of our State, \nto Kalamazoo County, which is in the southwest part of our State, as \nwell as from one side of the State, the west side, all the way across \nto Wayne County in southeastern Michigan.\n  According to the latest count, four people were tragically killed as \na result of these storms. Thunderstorms, with winds of more than 90 \nmiles per hour, knocked out power to over 860,000 homes and businesses. \nAs of last night, more than 300,000 were still without power. School \ndistricts in Oakland and Macomb Counties closed schools because they \nhad no power. In Walker, MI, which I visited, the local officials told \nme approximately 60 people had been injured. Estimates of the costs are \nstill coming in. In the village of Spring Lake in West Michigan, for \nexample, the village manager has estimated millions of dollars in \nprivate and public losses.\n\n  Having seen firsthand the destruction wrought by this severe weather, \nI would like to say two things. First, as an elected official, I pledge \nto do everything I can to make available all possible resources of the \nfederal government to those who need help. Second, as a citizen of \nMichigan, my thoughts and prayers are with the friends and families of \nthose who lost their homes, and especially those who lost their lives.\n  Today I will contact with the head of the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency (FEMA). My first priority is to deliver to FEMA a \ndamage assessment and formally request that the federal government move \nforward in helping these communities. In the difficult days ahead my \noffices in both Washington and Michigan will offer assistance to all \nwho need help in the complex process of securing federal aid.\n  While touring Walker and Merrill I witnessed awesome destruction; \nentire properties--farm barns and homes--were reduced to rubble by the \nforces of Mother Nature. However, the greatest impression left upon me \ncame from talking with government officials, emergency workers, local \nvolunteers and affected residents. Every individual I encountered \nexhibited the same optimistic determination to recover and to rebuild. \nIt is my intention to make certain the federal government is a \nproactive partner in this effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/02/senate-section/article/S5528-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              PACIFIC LINK INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE STUDENTS\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to commend a student \nprogram, the Sino-American Youth Conference, sponsored this summer by \nPacific Link International Exchange Students (PLIES). PLIES is a \nChristian ministry with the worthy goal of providing a cultural \nexperience in the United States to students from the People's Republic \nof China.\n  Student from China have long studied in the United States, and the \nexchange of young people between our two countries has done much to \nincrease our mutual understanding and to advance liberty in China. \nPLIES hopes that its hosting of the Sino-American Youth Conference in \nWashington, D.C. this summer will continue that positive tradition of \nexchange by allowing Chinese students to witness first hand the \nworkings of democracy in our nation's capital.\n  Young people from China and the United States will be shaping the \nfuture of both of their respective countries. The exchange of ideas and \nthe building of friendships facilitated through the PLIES program will \nbenefit China and the United States in the years ahead.\n  The staff of PLIES are to be congratulated for their work in China \nand their commitment to furthering dialogue between our two countries. \nI extend my welcome to the students from China participating in the \nPLIES program. May your time in the United States be fulfilling and \nbeneficial.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/02/senate-section/article/S5528-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5529]]\n  HONORING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE 27TH \n INFANTRY REGIMENT ``WOLFHOUNDS'' AND HOLY FAMILY HOME OF OSAKA, JAPAN\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the 27th Infantry \nRegiment ``Wolfhounds'' for their 50 year relationship with the \nchildren of Holy Family Home of Osaka, Japan. This relationship is a \nsymbol of the friendship and cooperation we have with the Japanese \npeople. It has played an integral part in our lasting relationship with \nJapan and is a story that deserves to be told.\n  Fifty years ago, Catholic nuns from the Sisters of Charity of St. \nVincent de Paul stood hopeless in the streets of a battered, war-torn \nOsaka, Japan, selling buttons and trinkets to the incoming occupation \nforce soldiers in exchange for food. They were trying to keep orphaned \nchildren, who were living in abandoned, shabby, cold barracks, alive \nduring most difficult conditions. Several Wolfhound regiment soldiers, \nincluding my friend Sergeant Hugh O'Reilly, saw the sisters' dedication \nand dilemma and took the news back to their headquarters. The men \nquickly organized to provide relief for the children.\n  Over the next few months, the soldiers used materials from the \noccupation forces to build facilities, collected money to feed the \nchildren, and began to cement this lasting relationship. Interested in \ndoing more for the orphanage, Sgt. O'Reilly coordinated support from \nhis unit for the Christmas holiday of 1949. This marked the beginning \nof the current relationship. Later, Sgt. O'Reilly began collecting \nmoney on a regular basis to improve living conditions for the children. \nEvery week the collection grew, eventually averaging $3,000 a month. \nWhen the 27th Infantry deployed to Korea in 1950 the collections \ncontinued, to the surprise of the Sisters of Charity. The funds \nreceived during the years of occupation duty and the Korean conflict \nhelped build the orphanage complex that greatly improved the lives of \nthe children.\n  The 27th Infantry's generosity to the orphanage brought much public \nattention to the unique relationship the regiment had with the \norphanage. In 1955, Hollywood produced the film ``Three Stripes in the \nSun,'' which detailed Sgt. O'Reilly's efforts to assist the orphanage. \nIn 1957, the Wolfhounds invited two children from the orphanage to come \nto Schofield Barracks in Hawaii, thus beginning the tradition that \ncontinues to this day. This month, on June 8, two more orphans will be \nmaking their first trip to Hawaii.\n  Another tradition began the following year, when the Wolfhounds sent \ntwo ``Soldiers of the Year'' to the orphanage during Christmas to act \nas ``Father Christmas.'' They visited the orphanage in Osaka, bringing \ngifts and companionship during the holidays.\n  These visits have been made possible largely by the generosity of a \nspecial individual, Mr. Akio Aoyama, an industrial leader in Japan. He \nrecognized the benefits of improved United States-Japan relations that \nthe orphans' relationship with the American regiment would foster. He \nhas donated $10,000 each year to help offset the costs of travel, \nlodging, and other functions during the orphans' annual pilgrimage to \nthe Wolfhounds in Hawaii.\n  Sgt. O'Reilly is the Wolfhounds honorary sergeant major and lives in \nHawaii with his wife, whom he met at the orphanage. I would like to \nthank and commend him and the Wolfhounds for their untiring dedication \nand love for the children of Holy Family Home. Whether it be defending \nour country during times of war or promoting goodwill in peace, I know \nthe soldiers of the 27th Infantry Regiment will endure. We all say \nthank you for a job well done and wish you continued success in the \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/02/senate-section/article/S5529-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5529]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, lately we have heard a lot of hyperbole \nfrom the opponents of tobacco legislation, particularly regarding the \nnotion that the bill should be killed because it concocts new \nbureaucracies. Last week, one Senator gave the number of 17 new \nbureaucracies and another said 30 new bureaucracies; and the Senator \nfrom Missouri used a very busy chart diagraming previous tobacco \nlegislation which, unfortunately, did not represent the measure we are \ndebating. The industry is certainly determined that this is an \neffective tool to divert the issue in trying to kill the bill.\n  Interestingly, Mr. Goldstone, the CEO of RJR, has been passing out \nthe outdated diagram that was manufactured by one of our colleagues, a \ndevelopment I find to be quite curious and rather discouraging. It is \nthe type of thing that reinforces the public's perception about the \nrelationship between the Congress and the tobacco industry. In fact, \nMr. President, Mr. Goldstone was out in my home State of Arizona to \nspeak to a local civic club and passed out this same chart to many of \nmy constituents, of course, whom I do not expect to know that that \nchart was outdated when it was printed. But it is an interesting \nsymbiotic relationship that is developing between the opponents of the \nbill and the tobacco industry.\n  So, Mr. President, we developed a little chart here of our own. It \ndoes not take enormous skills--you do not have to be a genius nor be \nemployed at the space agency to figure out a chart. But I thought it \nwould be enlightening to my colleagues to look at a chart that has to \ndo with what exactly happens when we do not pass tobacco legislation--I \nemphasize ``when we do not.''\n  Of course, we begin with tobacco campaign contributions, which have\n\n[[Page S5530]]\n\nbeen $30 million since 1987 to the U.S. Congress. Now, if we stopped at \ntobacco legislation there, a result of inaction would be--the number of \nkids who are smoking is up 32.4 percent since 1991. The average young \nperson smoker begins at age 13, and 90 percent of our adult smokers in \nAmerica begin before the age of 18. That might help my colleagues \nunderstand better why we are trying to attack the problem of youth \nsmoking.\n  Adult smoking, that costs a lot of money to us who do not smoke. In \nfact, it is $50 billion a year in increased taxes on nonsmokers as well \nas smokers to pay for Medicare and Medicaid bills that are incurred as \na direct result of treating the illnesses associated with smoking.\n  Again, I think it is important to remember, 90 percent of the adults \nwho smoke in America began before the age of 18. That is why the \ncritical focus is on kids smoking. Ten million smoking-related deaths \nhave occurred since the first Surgeon General report was issued in \n1964--10 million.\n  Mr. President, I have a chart around here someplace, which I will \nshow later on, which shows the relationship between tobacco-related \nillness and all other causes of death in America. Smoking-related \ndeaths are by far--by far--the highest. So when my colleagues say, \n``Then you are going to move on to alcohol and hamburgers, and then you \nare going to move on to whatever,'' they may; I cannot predict the \nfuture; but I can argue that if you just looked at the number of \nsmoking-related deaths in America, you would see that they dwarf all \nother causes themselves.\n  And 430,730 deaths, or 20 percent of all deaths in America--430,700 \ndeaths, 20 percent of all deaths in America, are, guess what, smoking-\nrelated deaths. Premature deaths of smokers who are under age 18, in \n1995, were 5 million. The combined potential life lost is 64 million \nyears. And one-third--one-third--of all deaths by cancer in America are \nattributed to tobacco.\n\n  Mr. President, these are not my figures; these are the Surgeon \nGeneral's, the Centers for Disease Control's, and other Government and \nnongovernmental organizations.\n  And there are 136,000 lung cancer deaths every year. There are \n136,000 lung cancer deaths every year. Mr. President, that should be \ndisturbing enough. But what is more disturbing is that youth smoking is \non the rise in America--not on the decline, it is on the rise. If \n136,000 people are dying of lung cancer every year and there are \n430,700 deaths every year, those deaths eventually are going to go up. \nAnd your taxes are going to go up. The American people's taxes are \ngoing to go up, because we have to pay to treat the tobacco-related \nillnesses.\n  So when I keep hearing this malarkey about a big tax bill, my \nfriends, we are paying a big tax bill as we speak, a huge tax bill, \nthat is going to get a lot bigger if we do not attack this problem.\n  So I would ask my colleagues who keep buying and parroting the \ntobacco advertisements--according to the New York Times, now $60 \nmillion has been spent--please keep in mind the big tax bill that is \npaid every day of every year in this country to treat tobacco-related \nillnesses, not to mention the big human tax that results from premature \ndeath. Every day, today--today--3,000 kids will start to smoke, and \n1,000 of them will die early. One thousand of them will die from lung \ncancer--emphysema, pneumonia, influenza, and other terrible causes of \ndeath.\n  There are 200,000 heart disease deaths per year. One-fifth of all the \ndeaths attributed to heart disease are directly attributed to tobacco. \nThere are 90,000 coronary heart disease deaths a year.\n  There are 3,000 lung cancer deaths a year due to secondhand smoke. \nThere are 84,000 lung disease deaths every year, from pneumonia, \ninfluenza, bronchitis and emphysema, and 90 percent of all emphysema \ncases in America--90 percent--are attributed to smoking--90 percent.\n  Mr. President, one of the most heartwrenching things I have ever seen \nin my life is to go down to the VA in Phoenix, AZ, and see veterans \noutside, because they are no longer allowed to smoke inside, sitting \noutside with oxygen tanks and taking the mask away and smoking a \ncigarette. Mr. President, if there was ever a living, breathing example \nof the addictive aspects of nicotine, it is that terrible sight.\n  And 163,100 fires were caused by smoking in 1992. That is the latest \ninformation we have on that. And 2,000 deaths were caused by smoking-\nrelated fires.\n  Mr. President, that is the result of inaction on the issue of \ntobacco. That is the result. I will not go through them again, but I \nthink it should be pretty compelling. So 430,700 deaths, or 20 percent \nof all deaths for all other causes, are directly related to smoking and \ntobacco.\n  The American taxpayer, Mr. President, through the costs of Medicare \nand Medicaid--the tobacco-related costs are $130 billion, and the \nhealth care costs alone are $50 billion; that is Medicaid, Medicare, \nprivate health insurance and small business insurance.\n  Loss of economic productivity is $80 billion. Smokers cause $501 \nbillion in excess health care costs in America.\n  Maternal smoking costs in medical expenditures are $661 million, and \n6,200 children die every year as a result of parents smoking. Forty \npercent to 60 percent of children's asthma, bronchitis, and wheezing is \ndue to secondhand smoke--an extra 160,000 cases of asthma and an extra \n79,000 cases of bronchitis, and an extra 172,000 cases of wheezing.\n  Prenatal smokers raise health care costs by $175 extra per child \nunder the age of 2, and smoking-related fires cost $500 million. \nComplicated births, $1 billion per year. Pregnant women smokers are 50 \npercent more likely to have a mentally handicapped child. Prenatal \nsmokers cause 48,000 low birth weights per year. Between 150,000 and \n300,000 children under 1\\1/2\\ years must be hospitalized for secondhand \nsmoke: bronchitis, pneumonia, ear infection, and asthma. Developmental \ndifficulties for complicated deliveries in low-weight babies costs $4 \nbillion a year for children of women who smoke.\n  There are two enormous costs associated with smoking and tobacco use \nin America. Both of them are pretty compelling. One, obviously, is the \nhuge number of deaths, 20 percent of all the deaths in America that are \nattributed to it. And the problem is not getting better; it is bound to \nbe getting worse. Of course, these enormous costs go to the taxpayers, \nas well.\n  When we are arguing this debate, and sometimes it gets a little \nemotional, I think we ought to keep in mind what we are talking about \nhere. It is a compelling and very emotional situation when so many \nyoung Americans are afflicted with this addiction.\n  In Arizona, State medical costs, total medical costs from tobacco are \n$559 million; Pennsylvania, $1.982 billion. Those are the total medical \ncosts, as a result of tobacco, to the States.\n  Mr. President, according to the New York Times on May 22:\n\n       More than a third of high school students who try \n     cigarettes develop a daily smoking habit before they \n     graduate, the Government said today.\n       In a survey of more than 16,000 students nationwide, nearly \n     36 percent who had ever smoked said their smoking had \n     escalated to at least a cigarette a day, the Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention said.\n       Nearly 73 percent of the students with a daily habit said \n     they had tried to quit. Of those who tried to quit, 13.5 \n     percent were successful, the agency said.\n       Seventy percent of students surveyed said they had tried \n     cigarettes at least once. The percentage is probably higher \n     among teen-agers over all because the survey did not include \n     dropouts [Mr. Eriksen said]. Previous studies had estimated \n     that 33 percent to 50 percent of people who experiment with \n     cigarettes become regular smokers.\n\n  I just went through the costs per State of tobacco costs. Probably \nfar more compelling than that is the number of kids currently under 18 \nwho will die prematurely from a tobacco-related disease. In my home \nState of Arizona, 98,516 children will die prematurely--98,516. That is \na lot of young people. I think that, obviously, we have an obligation \nto do something about it.\n  Title I of the bill provides the Food and Drug Administration with \nauthority over tobacco, tobacco products, and nicotine. The FDA is not \na new bureaucracy. It is a fairly old agency with an important mission \nthat most Americans fully support--to protect public health and risk to \nour food supply, drugs, and other substances ingested into the human \nbody, including cigarettes. The FDA already serves as authority over \ncigarettes under their current power, something in large part\n\n[[Page S5531]]\n\nupheld in the courts. This was not made up by the bill's authors. In \nfact, the industry agreed to broad FDA authority over tobacco products \nlast June. So those who argue that this bill grants large, huge new \npowers to the FDA, please remember, as in many other aspects of this \nbill, it was modeled after the June 20 agreement last year between the \ntobacco industry and the 40 attorneys general themselves. It provided \nbroad new authority over tobacco products, as does this bill.\n  What nefarious activities will the FDA undertake with authority over \ntobacco--which I reemphasize the industry agreed the FDA should \nexercise? First, the FDA will oversee ingredients to ensure that \ncigarettes are not adulterated with ``putrid or poisonous substances.'' \nMost Americans, including smokers, don't like the idea that tobacco \ncompanies have put additives such as ammonia into cigarettes to \nincrease addictiveness. Two, the FDA will oversee branding to ensure \nhealth and other claims are true, establish youth access rules, and \noversee marketing to stop appeals to children, accept performance \nstandards to better protect health without creating demand for \ncontraband, and medically assist the developing and marketing of safer \ntobacco products.\n  The courts have already upheld that the FDA has most of these \nauthorities under current law. This bill wisely places those \nauthorities into a separate body of law so that nontobacco foods, drugs \nand devices are not affected by rules that should be targeted solely to \ncigarettes and the regulation of nicotine. I want to emphasize, those \nwho worry about the expansion of FDA authority into other products, \nthis is a separate chapter. This is a separate body of law.\n\n  I find it curious that those who believe FDA should have no such \nauthority seek greater protection for the tobacco industry than the \nindustry itself which agreed to broad overall FDA oversight last June. \nSo, we are not talking about any new bureaucracies here.\n  Title II sets underage tobacco use reduction targets. Again, not \nsomething concocted by the bill's authors. The targets are the same as \nwhat the industry agreed to last year, entailing no new bureaucracies.\n  Part (b) of title II establishes a State retailing licensing program \nwith respect to tobacco products. Retail licensing was requested by the \n40 States attorneys general and agreed to by the industry last June. It \nis designed to hold sellers accountable and to better enforce the \nprohibition in every single State against selling tobacco products to \nminors.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control, 256 million packs of \ncigarettes are illegally sold each year to underage youth--the same \nyouth that the industry so vigorously targeted in its marketing. \nRepresentatives of the National Association of Convenience Stores have \nassured me they support licensing. They don't want bad actors selling \nto kids, and licensure, in the same manner we do with alcohol, is a \nmeans of achieving that goal.\n  This brings me to another aspect of the attack on this bill, and that \nis the issue of black market and contraband. Why is it we are able to \npretty well prevent, if not totally eradicate, black market or \ncontraband as far as alcohol is concerned? One of the major reasons is \nbecause we license the sale of alcohol. So those who are concerned \nabout the increase in contraband, the so-called black market, might \nsupport rather than oppose this bill because of the licensing \nprovisions associated with it.\n  Earlier I submitted for the Record a letter from the Convenience \nStore Association expressing no opposition to this legislation. I also \nsubmitted a letter from the National Governors' Association expressing \nappreciation that the licensing program is flexible. It respects States \nrights and is paid for by the tobacco bill. We have heard much scorn \nand outrage expressed about the licensing provision, even though it is \nbasically the same mechanism in place for alcohol sales. Do Senators \nwho find tobacco licensing to be such an abomination believe we should \nhave one standard for alcohol and another for tobacco when tobacco \nkills far more people every year and over 90 percent of smokers begin \nlong before they are of legal age? Does it matter that over a quarter \nof a billion packs of cigarettes are sold to minors every year?\n  Part (c) of title II provides for the distribution of tobacco money \nfor smoke cessation and prevention activities by the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services. HHS already has an office of smoking and \nhealth--not a new bureaucracy. Over 90 percent of these moneys are \nblock granted to the States and will use existing public and private \nnonprofit organizations--not new bureaucracies.\n  Do the opponents of this bill and those opposed collectively to \nsettling the State suits truly believe we should not provide smoking \nprevention and cessation activities?\n  Again, these are the essential elements of stopping 3,000 kids a day \nfrom taking up a habit that will kill a third of them --activities that \nthe industry agreed to and that were contemplated in the June 20 \nagreement.\n  Mr. President, I want to emphasize again that every public health \ngroup in America and every living Surgeon General back to 1973--every \nexpert in the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes \nof Health--every single one of them says that if you want to stop kids \nfrom smoking or reduce the number of children who smoke in America, you \nhave to have a comprehensive approach. Part 1: Raise the price of a \npack of cigarettes which, by the way, the tobacco industry agreed to \nlast June 20--not as much as contemplated in this bill, but they agreed \nto it. The second is active cessation programs. You can't do that \nwithout a comprehensive bill.\n  Mr. President, there is an organization of people called the ENACT \nCoalition. They are a major public health organization; they formed a \ncoalition called ENACT to promote effective national action to control \ntobacco. This growing coalition has pledged to work with Congress and \nthe administration, the public health community, and the American \npeople to pass comprehensive, sustainable, effective well-funded \nnational tobacco legislation.\n  Mr. President, let me tell you who is in this coalition. They are the \nAllergy and Asthma Network; American Academy of Child and Adolescent \nPsychiatry; American Academy of Family Physicians; American Academy of \nPediatrics; American Association of Respiratory Care; American \nAssociation of Physicians of Indian Origin; American Cancer Society; \nAmerican College of Cardiology; American College of Chest Physicians; \nAmerican College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine; American \nCollege of Physicians; American College of Preventive Medicine; \nAmerican Dental Association; American Heart Association; American \nMedical Association; American Psychiatric Association; American \nPsychological Association; American School Health Association; American \nSociety of Anesthesiologists; American Society of Clinical Oncology; \nAmerican Society of Internal Medicine; Association of American Medical \nColleges; Association of Black Cardiologists; Association of Maternal \nand Child Health Programs; Association of Schools of Public Health; \nAssociation of State and Territorial Health Officials; Association of \nTeachers of Preventive Medicine; Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids; \nChildren's Defense Fund; College on Problems of Drug Dependence; \nCommunity Antidrug Coalitions of America; Council of State and \nTerritorial Epidemiologists; Family Voices; Federation of Behavioral, \nPsychological and Cognitive Sciences; HMO group; Inter-religious \nCoalition on Smoking and Health; Latino Council on Alcohol and Tobacco; \nNational Association of Children's Hospitals; National Association of \nCounty and City Health Officials; National Association of Local Boards \nof Health; National Hispanic Medical Association; National Mental \nHealth Association; Oncology Nursing Society; Partnership for \nPrevention; Society of Public Health Education; Society for Research on \nNicotine and Tobacco; Society of Behavioral Medicine, and the Summit \nHealth Coalition.\n\n  Mr. President, I would have to submit that this is a fairly reputable \nand respectable group of experts on the issue of health care in \nAmerica. This is a very impressive coalition. I have not seen one quite \nlike it. And for us to ignore their plea for a comprehensive \nsettlement, I think, would be a great disservice not only to them, but \nto the people that they represent.\n\n[[Page S5532]]\n\n  Surgeon General Koop and Dr. Kessler--and I have a letter from every \nliving Surgeon General, Republican, Democrat, liberal conservative--are \nsaying that we have to enact this bill.\n  Mr. President, this part of the bill also provides health research \nmoney to the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease \nControl, and the National Science Foundation, all of which are well-\nestablished, respected and world-renowned health research \ninstitutions--not new bureaucracies.\n  We are at a critical stage in history, on the brink of breakthrough \ntreatments and cures and treatments for scourges such as breast and \nlung cancer, heart disease, and countless other devastating human \nillnesses. I am sorry that some of my colleagues prefer to ignore the \npossibilities and opt instead for loaded buzzword attacks to change the \nsubject.\n  Finally, this title of the bill calls for a comprehensive tobacco \ncounteradvertising campaign, as agreed to by the attorneys general, \npublic health advocates, and the industry last year, and is among the \nmost important weapons in stopping kids from smoking. Every tobacco \nbill that has been introduced, including alternative measures being \nprepared by opponents of the pending legislation contemplates a large \ninvestment in counteradvertising.\n  I tell my colleagues that the advertising section does include what \nsome have characterized as a ``new bureaucracy.'' The ``bureaucracy'' \nis known as the Tobacco-Free Education Board, a part-time, bipartisan, \nunsalaried advisory committee designed to help formulate and execute a \nnationwide antismoking advertising campaign.\n  So if you want to call that a new bureaucracy, guilty as charged.\n  The alternative to this advisory panel would be to give millions of \ndollars to a political appointee to determine, unfettered, how such \npublic appeal campaigns should be designed and executed--powers that \nneither Republicans or Democrats are eager to hand over to the other.\n  Even opponents of the bill who have expressed outrage about \n``bureaucracies'' and might otherwise dedicate themselves to ridding \nthe Nation of the terrible burden imposed by a part-time advisory panel \nprobably would not prefer the alternative.\n  Title III of the bill provides for an array of new tobacco warnings \nand calls for the public disclosure of cigarette ingredients--something \nmost cigarette smokers deserve and would like to know. Both items were \nagreed to by the industry and, again, require no new bureaucracies.\n  Title IV creates a single trust fund to receive and disburse revenues \ngenerated by the bill. The fund would be administered by the Secretary \nof the Treasury--a position that has been in existence since the Nation \nwas founded, and it does not constitute a new bureaucracy. The bulk of \nthe money will go to States to reimburse their taxpayers for Medicaid \nlosses. Half of the State money, which represents the Federal share of \nMedicaid, may be used on a menu of seven options, from drug-free school \ninitiatives to children's health care, each of which is an existing \nprogram--not a new bureaucracy.\n\n  Title V contains new standards for exposure to secondary smoke. The \n40 States attorneys general who were part of the June 20 agreement \ncalled for a mandatory national environmental smoke standard to be \nenforced federally and by the States. This bill allows the State to opt \nout of the Federal program if it adopts and enforces its own. The \nestablishment and enforcement of standards can be done through existing \nagencies--not new bureaucracies.\n  Title VI of the bill deals with Indian tribes and ensures that \nreservations don't become a safe haven for youth access to tobacco. \nPrice increasing will affect reservations as they do all other areas of \nthe Nation. This section allows tribes to receive smoking prevention \nand cessation grants as States--in the same vein that we administer all \nother Federal grant programs. None of this entails new bureaucracies, \nbut simply fulfills our obligation to tribes and Native Americans to \nwhom the Federal Government has a trust responsibility.\n  Title VII, as amended, contains various civil liability provisions, \nincluding an initiative that assists individual plaintiffs in seeking \nand obtaining just commendation--no new bureaucracies.\n  Title VIII calls on the industry to submit an annual report on how \nthe companies are meeting their obligations under this act in the State \nsettlement decrees, and calls on existing Federal authorities, \nincluding the Surgeon General, to evaluate that progress. This section \nalso protects industry whistleblowers from threats and workplace \nretaliation--not any new bureaucracies.\n  Title IX calls on the industry to make available to the public \ndocuments they have been illegally hiding to avoid disclosure of their \nmisdeeds and data on the health risks of tobacco products. A panel of \nsitting judges will make determinations on the propriety of attorney-\nclient privilege assertions. Calling on sitting judges to perform a \njudicial task is not--I repeat, not--a new bureaucracy.\n  Title X contains the farm provisions which include various grant \nprograms and farm community assistance initiatives. Some feel strongly \nopposed, but let us not lose sight of the fact that the debate between \nthe LEAF Act and the Lugar alternative is not about whether we will \nhave these assistance programs. It is a debate over how much we will \nspend on them and whether buyouts should be concluded at a time \ncertain.\n  Title XI contains provisions related to international marketing, \nsmuggling, and vending machines. In the international arena, the bill \ncalls for multilateral and bilateral agreements regarding tobacco \nmarketing and advertising to kids. These agreements can be consummated \nthrough existing authorities--not new bureaucracies.\n  To address concerns raised by many of our colleagues that our Nation \nshould not simply export the problem of kids smoking to children \noverseas, this section does authorize an international tobacco control \nawareness program which is subject to appropriations and, if funded, \ncan operate through existing institutions.\n  Antismuggling initiatives are also contained in this section, \nincluding a call for tobacco package markers to distinguish licensed \nproducts from contraband, requiring licensure of manufacturers and \nwholesalers, and recordkeeping for large transactions. Will this entail \nadditional law enforcement activities? I suspect so. But we have heard \na number of our colleagues express concern about black market and \ncontraband. These provisions will address those concerns.\n  Unfortunately, many have not yet grasped the reality that with or \nwithout this legislation the cost of cigarettes will increase \ndramatically. If every State settles under the same terms as Minnesota, \nwe might well anticipate increases of $2 per pack.\n  The June 20 settlement called for a per pack increase of 65 cents \nand, I might point out, agreed to by the administration--65 cents. Some \nof the most vociferous opponents of this bill on the basis of black \nmarket and contraband are preparing alternatives that would impose an \nexcise tax of 75 cents per pack. So I trust that antismuggling \nactivities is not among the bureaucracy about which we are hearing.\n  Also included in this title is a non-Federal, private corporation to \nreimburse vending machine owners for losses due to banned cigarette \nmachines, a major conduit of tobacco to children. Again, some of those \nwho have decried bureaucracy were among those most adamant about \nensuring a mechanism to compensate vending machine owners. We do this \nwithout creating a new Federal bureaucracy.\n  Title XII authorizes appropriations from the trust fund to compensate \nasbestos victims whose conditions were exacerbated by tobacco use \nshould Congress under separate legislation establish such a process for \nso doing as the Supreme Court invited. No new bureaucracies.\n  Title XIII permits the Veterans Administration to sue tobacco \nmanufacturers to recoup the loss for treating veterans for smoking-\nrelated illnesses, a power some believe the VA already has and includes \nno new bureaucracies.\n  Finally, title XIV contains the process by which those manufacturers \nthat wish to formally settle their State suits must agree to, including \nthe up-front payment, additional advertising restrictions, et cetera, \nand no new bureaucracies.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope we are keeping an eye on the ball about \nwhat\n\n[[Page S5533]]\n\nthis is all about in addition to the bureaucracy red herring.\n\n  We have heard from opponents who object to this bill because it will \nincrease the price of tobacco. Let us stop kidding ourselves. If we \nfail to pass this bill, the States will go back to court to win in \njudgment or settlement what we might more efficiently accomplish with \nnational legislation and the price of cigarettes will increase. It was \nrecently announced by the tobacco companies as a result of the \nMinnesota settlement there would be an increase in the price of a pack \nof cigarettes in Minnesota.\n  The experts say a price increase is a critical component--not the \nonly component but a critical component--in the effort to stop 3,000 \nkids from starting to smoke. We have heard from opponents who say the \nbill is about ``tax and spend.'' Providing $195 billion to States in \nsettlement of their cases so that State taxes can be lowered and half \nof it can be used for a menu of public health-related options agreed to \nby the Nation's Governors is not ``tax and spend.''\n  Do opponents of this bill suggest that we should not dedicate a \nportion of tobacco settlement money for health research as agreed to in \nthe June 20 agreement? Should we not have additional resources for \nsmoking prevention, cessation, and counteradvertising as agreed to on \nJune 20? Should we not assist tobacco farmers and farm communities that \nwill be affected by changes in tobacco consumption, the same people who \nhave been urged to grow tobacco by the Federal Government for years?\n  And let me point out that one of the most scurrilous activities of \nthe tobacco industry is to go to the farmers and say that the passage \nof this legislation will harm you. If they were concerned about the \nfarmers, why is it that in the June 20 agreement they made with 40 \nattorneys general there was no provision for the tobacco farmers of \nAmerica--none, not one word. It is remarkable. It is remarkable that \nthey should go to the tobacco farm communities and now oppose this \nlegislation when they had no provision to take care of the farmers in \ntheir agreement of last June 20.\n  Should we not dedicate a portion of tobacco settlement money to \nassist veterans suffering from smoking-related illnesses when the \nFederal Government handed out cigarettes in their mess kits?\n  I ask my friends why we are not talking more about the real ``tax and \nspend'' associated with tobacco--tax and spend that tobacco companies \nimpose on the American people every year in the form of $50 billion in \nsmoking-related health care costs including Medicare and Medicaid--\nalmost $455 for every household in America? Every household in America, \nwhether they smoke or not, pays $455 a year in taxes every single year, \nand that is going up, to treat tobacco-related illnesses.\n  This is a tax of epic proportion paid by every taxpayer, every hard-\nworking American who must purchase health insurance for his or her \nfamily and every small business struggling to provide employees with \naffordable health care coverage. Do the tobacco companies worry about \ntaxpayers as they entice their ``youth market'' to begin a lifetime \nhabit that sickens and kills hundreds of thousands a year, the cost of \nwhich others must bear? I don't think so. This bill intends to stop \nsome of that and stop it immediately.\n  We have heard from opponents who say we don't need a comprehensive \nbill to stop kids from smoking. With all due respect to my colleagues \nwho are so wise and expert in so many areas, prudence and good sense \ndictates that the Nation take the advice of the experts who maintain \nunanimously that only a comprehensive bill will address what they refer \nto as a ``pediatric epidemic,'' including every living Surgeon General, \nRepublican and Democrat, the American Medical Association, and the \norganizations that I just quoted.\n\n  For those who wish to kill this bill, let us examine what we are \nreally talking about. We are talking about 418,000 Americans a year who \ndie of smoking-related diseases, the number one cause of preventable \ndisease and death in America by far.\n  I had the privilege of hearing a speech by the head of the National \nCancer Society who put it into perspective:\n\n       Among a graduating high school class of 1,000, 6 will die \n     from violence, 12 will die from motor vehicle accidents, 250 \n     will die in mid life from a smoking-related disease and \n     another 250 will die later in life but far earlier than \n     necessary from smoking-related illness.\n\n  Let me just repeat that.\n\n       Among a graduating high school class of 1,000--\n\n  This from the head of the National Cancer Society--\n\n     6 will die from violence, 12 will die from motor vehicle \n     accidents, 250 will die in mid life from a smoking-related \n     disease and another 250 will die later in life but far \n     earlier than necessary from smoking-related illness.\n\n  So I have great respect for my colleagues who oppose the bill, and \neverybody is entitled to their opinion, but they are not entitled to \nthe facts. It all comes down to this very simple premise: The tobacco \ncompanies target kids to sustain their cigarette sales. Kids take the \nhook; 3,000 a day start the habit, and that number is increasing. \nSmoking is the single greatest killer in the United States by far. What \nphysicians call a ``pediatric epidemic'' won't change unless we do \nsomething. This bill is a bipartisan opportunity to act. If it fails, \nthe industry will go away happy but the death march will continue. I \nask my colleagues, which it is going to be?\n  Finally, let me make one more additional comment. I know my friend \nfrom Massachusetts wants to speak as well.\n  Mr. President, over the last week or so in the formulation of the \nhighway bill, some very bad things were done to the veterans of \nAmerica. I am ashamed and embarrassed. These men and women who have \nserved our country deserve better than what they got out of that \nhighway bill. In fact, some of the money earmarked to treat their \nillness is now going to highways and bridges.\n\n  I know that fewer and fewer of my colleagues have had time in the \nmilitary. Those of us who are a little older have a vivid memory of \nsmoke breaks, of C-rations that contained cigarettes, of the end of the \nchow line where cigarettes were given out for free. If there is any \ngroup of Americans that deserves to be reimbursed for tobacco-related \nillness, it is the veterans of America.\n  We used to call, as my friend from Massachusetts recalls, smoke \nbreaks. We would have smoke breaks all the time. In times of tension in \ncombat, cigarettes were smoked for relaxation, for relief of tension. \nAnd the Armed Forces and our Government encouraged those men and women \nin the military to smoke.\n  At the appropriate time, the Senator from Massachusetts and I, along \nwith the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, who has \nplayed a very important role, will propose an amendment to put \napproximately $3 billion into treatment of veterans for tobacco-related \nillness. I urge my colleagues to support such a move. We intend to have \nsome debate on that particular amendment, and I believe it should pass \noverwhelmingly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that debate only be in order \nprior to the Senate reconvening at 2:15 today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the Senator from \nArizona, for his review of this legislation and for his summary of \nwhere we find ourselves today. I also, obviously, particularly thank \nhim for his laying out the important agenda with respect to veterans \nand what happened in the course of the last week or so. I will join \nwith the Senator, as others will, I know, in trying to remedy that \nimpact, and I am confident that the U.S. Senate will do so.\n  I also recall, not just the degree to which there was a kind of \ndependency built into the system that both of us were in in the Navy, \nbut often at the end of a particular exercise, or General Quarters, the \nannouncement would come over the loudspeaker on the ship saying, ``The \nsmoking lamp is lit,'' and there was this sort of automatic rush to \nsmoke. It was part of the doctrine, if you will--the ethic. And an \nawful lot of veterans, as a consequence of that and other things, many \nother things\n\n[[Page S5534]]\n\nthrough the course of life, are today suffering. They are suffering as \na consequence of that. So I think the Senator is right on target in his \ndesire to address that.\n  I also thank Senator McCain for his long efforts with respect to this \nparticular bill. In all of the debate on the floor of the Senate, it \nhas been lost that this is a bill that was reported out of committee by \na vote of 19 to 1, reflecting a considerable consensus about at least a \nbeginning, a starting place. I think most people would agree, as a \nreflection of the vote that took place on the floor of the Senate \nregarding the cap on liability, that the bill which came to the floor \nmoved significantly in the direction that the Senate ultimately decided \nit wanted to move, by eliminating all of the restraints on class \nactions and other limitations on liability, with the sole exception of \nthe $8 billion a year. The Senate, in its wisdom, decided to remove \nthat.\n\n  But the point is, this is a bill that I think has been improved, at \nleast in its starting point, and hopefully in the next days we can \nimprove it further. I listened carefully to the Senator from Oklahoma \nlast week, and I took the time last night to reread his criticisms of \nthis legislation. I think here and there there were some good points \nthat he made. There are ways, in amendments which I am confident the \nSenator from Arizona and I and others are willing to accept, that those \nissues could be remedied. So my hope is that in the next days we are \ngoing to be able to move to do that.\n  But the most important thing, as we reflect on where we are going, is \nto remain focused on the positive ways, the constructive ways, in which \nthis bill helps to save children's lives. That is the purpose of this \ndebate. There is not anything else that we are really trying to do \nhere.\n  There is a reason that there is a tobacco legislative effort taking \nplace. There is a fundamental reason that we have come to the floor of \nthe Senate, recognizing the work of the attorneys general around the \ncountry who brought suit because of this. There is a reason they \nbrought suit. There is a reason that the suits are settling. There is a \nreason the tobacco companies are coming to the table and agreeing to \nsettle those lawsuits. They are settling them and agreeing to do the \nvery things that we are seeking to codify in this legislation, but on a \nnational basis, so we can save time, save money, and save lives. That \nis the purpose of this legislation.\n  One cannot ignore the fact that, in Minnesota, if you extrapolate the \ncost of what the tobacco companies have agreed to in Minnesota, and \ntake that out on a State-by-State basis across the country, you \nactually have a greater expenditure than you would have under this \nlegislation. So the tobacco companies have accepted, at least in the \nlegal process, what is being fought here in the national legislative \nprocess. I think the truth is that ultimately we are going to come to \nan agreement that recognizes that fact.\n  The bottom line is that the entire legislative agenda we are engaged \nin here is to break the cycle of addiction that is hooking 3,000 \nchildren a day on a deadly drug. It is a very simple debate \nfundamentally. Yesterday, the Senator from Texas agreed that you do \nhave to raise the price, and he is prepared to raise the price in order \nto try to reduce the access. At least we are sort of chipping away at \nthe arguments here and slowly beginning to expose the truth, the facts, \nas the Senator from Arizona talked about. You can make the arguments \npolitically on the floor, but you cannot make up the facts. The fact is \nthat 3,000 kids a day get addicted to this drug and, as a consequence \nof that addiction, a third of those young children will die early of \nthroat cancer, larynx cancer, esophagus cancer, kidney disease--some \nkind of disease that will be initiated and enhanced as a consequence of \nthe addiction to this drug.\n  So we should not be diverted by the side issues here. The side issues \nare purposefully being used to obfuscate what the real focus of this \nlegislation is. There is only one reason for raising the price. The one \nreason for raising the price is that every single expert, including the \ntobacco companies themselves, have said if you raise the price you \nreduce the access of young people to cigarettes.\n  If this were merely a debate about an adult habit, I guess you would \nhear a lot of discussion about willpower, about adult choice, about \ntaking responsibility for your actions. If this were just a debate \nabout dangerous adult behavior, whether it is smoking or drinking or \ndriving too fast, we would not be talking it out on the floor of the \nSenate, I suspect. Fundamentally, we wouldn't be. But it is not a \ndebate about adults; it is a debate about people who did not make a \nrational adult decision to start smoking. It is a debate about \nchildren. And the underlying reality is that 86 percent of smokers \nbegin while they are children. Mr. President, 86 percent of America's \n40 to 50 million--what is the number?--45 million Americans who are \ndeemed addicted to cigarettes, 86 percent of them began as teenagers. \nThey began as children. So this is a discussion about underage smoking \nand that underage smoking fundamentally leads to a very sad and tragic, \nslow suicide.\n  Some of my colleagues have raised concerns about raising the price. I \nam glad the Senator from Texas has accepted the notion. I think other \ncolleagues may ultimately do that, because the concept of raising the \nprice is not something that was initiated with some Senator who came \ndown and said, ``Boy, wouldn't this be a great idea? Wouldn't it be \nwonderful? Here is another way to raise some revenue.'' That is not \nwhere it came from. It came, quite simply, from all of the analyses, \nstudies, research, polling data, focus groups, all of the experts have \ncome together and said, ``If we raise the price, we can reduce the \nnumber of children who are smoking.'' We can't eliminate it--we all \nunderstand that--but we can significantly reduce the access of young \npeople to cigarettes.\n\n  I ask my colleagues not to ask Senator McCain or myself or Senator \nKennedy or Senator Conrad or any of the other advocates of this \nlegislation to be trusted in their word that somehow that is going to \nhappen. I ask them to look at the economic analyses --at the Treasury \nanalysis, the CBO analysis--all of the analyses that have been done.\n  Among the 39,000 documents--and this is perhaps one of the most \ninteresting bases for making this judgment--among the 39,000 documents \nthat were subpoenaed over the years as the tobacco cases slowly made \ntheir way through the courts, we find a Philip Morris document that \nsays, quite simply, the following:\n\n       It is clear that price has a pronounced effect on the \n     smoking prevalence of teenagers.\n\n  That is a Philip Morris document. You will find an R. J. Reynolds \ndocument, and it says as follows:\n\n       A key finding is that younger adult males are highly \n     sensitive to price. This suggests that the steep rise in \n     prices expected in the coming months could threaten the long-\n     term vitality of the industry by drying up the supply of new \n     younger adult smokers entering the market. It could also \n     undermine the long-range growth potential of brands which \n     rely on new younger smokers, including Marlboro and Newport.\n\n  That is one of the most extraordinary documents we can ever conceive \nof reading after all of the protestations to the contrary of tobacco \nexecutives who came before the Congress and raised their hands and \nswore under oath that they don't target young people. Here is an R. J. \nReynolds document talking about how price would affect their targeting \nof younger smokers, how price was going to reduce the industry's \ncapacity to grow by depending on its ability to reach the younger \nsmokers and get them addicted, particularly to Marlboro and to Newport.\n  One might wonder why the tobacco industry conspired, therefore, for \nyears to keep those internal memos under lock and key. The secret, I \nthink, in those documents is not that price correlates strongly with \nsales, but it does. That is not the secret. The secret is that the \nnumber of young smokers, which we know translates too often into 13 and \n14-year-old smokers, is going to go down dramatically if cigarette \nprices go up. Thus spoke the industry itself.\n  That is why we are here in the U.S. Senate arguing about whether or \nnot it is appropriate on a national basis to raise the price of \ncigarettes, and the cigarette companies themselves have told us in two \nways: One, in these memos it is appropriate and it will work; and they \nhave told it to us in the\n\n[[Page S5535]]\n\nsettlements in Minnesota and in Mississippi and elsewhere where they \nhave agreed to those kinds of increases, and in the national settlement \nwhere they agreed to raise the price of cigarettes, albeit not to the \n$1.10, but they agreed to raise the price. They did that because they \nunderstood that was a component of reducing teenage smoking.\n  So this is not an idea cooked up in the U.S. Senate. Don't come to \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate and start suggesting that this is some \nDemocrat or some large-scale tax-and-spend issue. This is an idea that \nthe tobacco industry itself has written about for years. This is an \nidea that the health care industry itself has known for years would \nwork. Public health experts are united in the consensus that raising \nthe price of cigarettes is going to reduce youth smoking. Dr. Koop and \nDr. Kessler said:\n\n       Data indicate that children and youth are more price \n     sensitive than adults and that pricing has a strong and \n     immediate impact on reducing sales of tobacco products \n     overall.\n\n  The Congressional Research Service said:\n\n       Most of the evidence suggests that teenagers are about \n     three times more sensitive to cigarette prices as are adults. \n     For every 10 percent price increase, the number of underage \n     smokers drops by 5 to 7 percent.\n\n  According to the Treasury Department:\n\n       Substantial real price increases are the best way to combat \n     youth smoking.\n\n  According to the National Cancer Institute:\n\n       An increase in the cigarette excise tax may be the most \n     effective single approach to reducing tobacco use by youths.\n\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control:\n\n       Tobacco use prevention activities should be designed to \n     prevent the use of all tobacco products. Such activities \n     should include increasing tobacco prices.\n\n  That is an extraordinary consensus--a consensus of the industry, a \nconsensus of independent health analysis, a consensus of our economic \nadvisers and economic analysts. I think that speaks volumes.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to also listen to someone who is \nsuffering from a lifetime of smoking. Listen to any of the people who \nin their twenties and thirties have already begun to feel the impact, \nand they will tell you how easy it is to buy a pack of cigarettes at \nage 12 and 13 when it only costs as much as four or five candy bars. \nTalk to women who will tell you that when they were adolescents, they \ngladly made that choice about how to spend the change in their pockets \nbecause cigarettes were going to keep them thin and candy bars would \nnot.\n  That is the story of Pamela Lafland, a 27-year-old mother of two who \nlives in Boston. Several weeks ago, I met her, and I thank her for \nsharing her story with me.\n  When Pam was 11 years old, she had a lot of the same dreams that most \nyoung women have: She wanted to be attractive; she wanted to be \nsuccessful; and she wanted to, while she was younger, look older sooner \nso that she could start making what she thought were grown-up decisions \nin a grown-up life.\n  She took her pocket change down to the corner grocery store and she \nbought cigarettes. She got hooked. At 11, she was already dreaming of \nhaving children some day, and at age 22, she had her kids. At age 24, \nbecause of juvenile emphysema, she was now raising them from a \nwheelchair. At age 26, she had a lung transplant, and today her body is \nrejecting her lung. Her medical bills have exceeded $200,000, and she \nhas found out, as she says herself, that when she was young, cigarettes \nwere cheap, they were readily available, she didn't know to the \ncontrary, and today she knows she could never measure the cost of a \npack of cigarettes in quarters and dimes and nickels.\n  For Pam, the cost has been her health, and in many ways, the \nstructure of her life, the quality of her life. Pam tells me that \nraising the price of cigarettes would have made a difference to her and \nwill spare children today from a price system that allows children to \nmake the grown-up decisions that all but guarantee that when they do \ngrow up, they are not going to have a lot to look forward to.\n  I think we ought to listen to Pam, and we ought to listen to a lot of \npeople like Pam who are similarly suffering in some stage of their life \nas the consequence of the ready accessibility in the United States of \nwhat we know to be a killer narcotic substance.\n  We have heard a few Members of the Senate coming to the floor and \nsuggesting that raising the price of cigarettes is going to hurt low-\nincome people. Mr. President, there is a certain question mark, I \nguess, to put it politely, that raises when some of those people who \nhave opposed health care for children, who have opposed day care, who \nhave opposed raising the minimum wage, who have opposed student loans \nfor people who are struggling--all of these things--are all of a sudden \nhere on the floor, those very same people are the ones standing up in \ndefense of ``poor people'' who are going to be hurt because the pack of \ncigarettes is going to cost more.\n  Leaving aside that question mark about what brings them to the floor \nsuddenly as the protectors of the poor in this instance is the fact \nthat it suggests that somehow poor people do not care about their \nchildren's smoking, that it is OK to protect getting cancer on the \ncheap, that what we are going to do is somehow protect the notion that \nif we keep cigarettes cheap, poor people can buy them and get cancer, \nsince more and more people in poor areas of America, in urban areas, \nare the ones in whom we see the highest increase in smoking today.\n  So the argument is, we are going to protect you from the increase in \nthe pack of cigarettes, which is going to make it cheaper for you to \nget cancer, cheaper for you to have your kids' lives ruined. It is an \ninsult to poor people to suggest that they are not just as supportive \nof raising the price of cigarettes so their kids will not go down and \nbuy them with whatever pocket change they have. We ought to recognize \nthat. We should not be making it easier for a pack of cigarettes to be \naccessible to people for whom those cigarettes have become one of the \nbetter alternatives to some of the other problems that they have in \ntheir lives.\n  In poll after poll--in poll after poll--a large majority of those \npeople with incomes below $30,000 a year favor raising the price of \ntobacco, the price of cigarettes. And they do it because they do care \nabout their kids and because they do want to have an opportunity to \nhave those kids grow up healthy and capable of enjoying the fullness of \ntheir lives. Low-income people, just like wealthier people, understand \nthat we have to reduce youth smoking.\n  They also support raising the price because they recognize that \nspending on tobacco represents about less than 2 percent in spending in \nany income category. It isn't an issue of income or class; it has \nnothing to do with your occupation or the size of your family budget. \nIt boils down to a consensus that by far most Americans want the U.S. \nSenate to do the right thing, which is to take cigarettes out of the \nhands of children. And the way you take cigarettes out of the hands of \nchildren is partly to raise the price, which has been deemed to be the \nmost effective method, but also to engage in counteradvertising, \nresearch on addiction, cessation programs, and other things that I will \ntalk about in a minute.\n  So I believe this bill hits that mark. Senator McCain has reviewed \neach section of this legislation and laid out the ways in which it \nhelps to prevent youth from smoking.\n  Studies have shown that low-income smokers in Great Britain on \naverage reduced their expenditures on cigarettes in response to a \ntobacco tax increase there. We ought to look to other countries and \ntake the example from them. I think that is very significant, and the \nreason is that a significant percentage of low-income smokers quit \nsmoking entirely in response to the price increase. Hooray. That is \nprecisely what we want to achieve.\n  So if we can induce a whole group of people--which is part of what is \nfactored into the volume adjustments of this bill--if we can induce \nlarge numbers of people to quit, then, again, also the country will be \nbetter off. So the policy works.\n  I think my colleagues need to be wary of those companies that have \nactually targeted people in the past now coming to us and fostering \nsome kind of egalitarian argument when their\n\n[[Page S5536]]\n\nlack of a sense of egalitarian sensitivity drove them to \nactually target people in low-income communities to become addicted. \nYou cannot have it both ways. All of a sudden, this new concern is \nobviously a concern which will continue to allow people to become \naddicted and to buy cheap cancer. The only reason tobacco companies \noppose the higher prices is that they know it will diminish the number \nof people who smoke.\n\n  Mr. President, I hope the U.S. Senate is going to be united in the \neffort to reduce youth smoking. We are convinced by all the scientific \nevidence and by decades of precedent, even by the secret--now not \nsecret--memos of the tobacco industry itself, that an increase in \ncigarette price will reduce youth smoking. So we ought to end the \ndebate on the floor of the Senate about ``tax and spend.'' This did not \noriginate in the Senate, did not originate with Democrats, did not \noriginate as an idea of some political party that wanted to find \nrevenue. It originated out of scientific analysis and economic analysis \nthat tells us to a certainty that if the price of cigarettes goes up, \nthen the number of people who smoke goes down.\n  Then the next question for the Senate is, all right, if you have \nraised the price, and you have X amount of new revenue coming in, what \nis the best way to use that to continue to be able to reduce teenage \nsmoking and to have an impact on the impact of smoking itself? That is \nwhat we are doing. That is precisely what this bill seeks to have an \nimpact on. It is not, in the final analysis, a regressive burden on \nlow-income families; it is a progressive idea that literally sends a \ngeneration of American kids into a world that will be healthier and \nsafer no matter how much money their parents earn. It helps relieve all \nAmericans of $130 billion that we lose each year in medical costs, lost \nwages, sick days, and all of the fallout from smoking.\n  As my colleagues come to the floor of the Senate and talk about the \ncost of this bill--the cost of this bill is the cost of trying to limit \nyoung people from smoking. The cost of not doing that is $130 billion a \nyear that every American is paying--even nonsmokers. Every single \nAmerican is required to fork out of their tax dollars every year at \nleast $1,370 per person in America to pay for the costs of other people \nsmoking. That is what we pay now. The hidden tax on America is the tax \nof smoking itself for all of the diseases and trauma that come as a \nconsequence of that.\n  It helps--this bill--I believe, to relieve an individual smoker of \nover $19,000, on average, in lifetime smoking-related medical costs--\nmore than double the average amount of a year of tuition at a public \nuniversity.\n  I want to point, Mr. President, to the chart here that talks about \nthe annual costs of smoking. We have 1 million kids who begin smoking \nevery single year. There are already 45 million smokers in the United \nStates. And, as we know, those 45 million smokers, 86 percent of them \nstarted right here as young children smoking. The costs of this break \ndown to 420,000 deaths a year--a year. Those are people in a hospital \nbed, in a pulmonary ward, with tubes sticking out of them, can't \nbreathe, oxygen, around-the-clock nursing, extraordinary medical \ncosts--420,000 deaths a year; more people, as we know now, than died in \nall of World War II, all of Korea, Vietnam, Desert Storm, put together, \nevery year--every year--in the United States.\n  We have an opportunity to do something about that, and we are sitting \nhere playing politics about it rather than trying to find the best way \nof doing something about it--420,000 deaths every single year directly \nrelated to smoking; $80 billion in lost productivity to the country as \na consequence of the sickness and the disease that people pay the price \nfor as a consequence of smoking; $80 billion in just total health care \ncosts. That is just the cost for caring for 420,000 people dying and \nfor the people who are not dying or are not yet dead in the \noutyears. There are 420,000 people who die a year as a result, but in \nthe preceding year--and the preceding years--they are just sick, but \nvery sick, and cost enormous amounts of money.\n\n  So we are spending $80 billion a year because 86 percent of those \nadults got hooked when they were kids. Here we are in the U.S. Senate \nwith an opportunity to stop them from getting hooked as kids, reducing \nthe number of adults smoking, reducing the amount of health care, \nreducing the number of deaths. There is $24 billion just in Medicaid \nand Medicare costs that come out of the pocket of every American. That \nis the cost.\n  You want to talk about taxes? It is the cigarette tax on every \nAmerican that is obscene because most Americans didn't ask for that. At \nleast raising the pack of cigarettes is voluntary. You can choose \nwhether you are going to go in and buy them. You can choose whether you \nwill buy one pack or one carton. You can choose how much you will pay \nout of your own pocket. But these costs, no American gets a choice \nabout these costs. These are forced on every American. These are put to \nevery American as a consequence of our allowing a narcotic drug to be \nsold over the counter in America. It is time we did something about it.\n  Now, some have suggested that we ought to take some of this money and \nreduce the marriage penalty. I would like to reduce the marriage \npenalty. Even though some Americans who get married aren't affected by \nit, some are. We need to find a way to balance, how to do it smartly.\n  But if we take this money and don't put it into the effort of \nresearching addiction and don't put it into our children in terms of \nconfidence building, all of the things they need for self-esteem to \nmake judgments not to smoke, to help with child care, to help with the \nafter-school times, which is when most of these kids go out and start \nsmoking, when there is no parent home--when school lets out at 2 \no'clock in the afternoon and they are hanging out on the street corner \nwith their friends and we don't have enough time to give them something \nconstructive to do--that is when it happens.\n  Instead of providing that kind of constructive oversight with this \nmoney, some want to get rid of the marriage penalty. You get rid of the \nmarriage penalty and you will not have done anything to reduce these \nkids from smoking. I am for getting rid of the marriage penalty, but \ndon't take it out of the ``hide'' of the effort to get our kids \nunhooked from cigarettes. That doesn't make sense. That is not the \nsmartest tradeoff we have been presented with in the U.S. Senate. \nSurely we could find a way to agree to vote on the marriage penalty--\nand I will vote to get rid of it--at the appropriate time.\n  If we can't do that, then let us at least whittle down some kind of \nsensible tax rebate to the people who we are supposedly expressing the \ngreatest concern about--poor people--who are going to be paying more \nbecause they are buying cigarettes, and target that in some kind of \nresponsible way. If we did that, then, I think, we really would be \nconsistent with the effort to try to reduce teenage smoking. That is \nwhat we have to keep focused on here. Every time we get diverted, let \nus come back to what this is about: It is only about stopping our \nchildren from smoking, finding the way to reduce the numbers of kids \nwho smoke. And we have to find the most sensible ways to try to do \nthat.\n  Now, it seems to me that what the Senator from Arizona has described \nin his opening statement really lays out a series of things that we \nbelieve are able to try to do that. In the inner cities of our country, \nthere is a 78-percent likelihood that a child is going to start smoking \nbefore the age of 18. What does that mean? It means you will have a \nyoung woman who is more than two times more likely than a woman who \ndoesn't smoke to have a low-birth-weight child. It means you will have \nthe highest rates of juvenile emphysema and asthma in our urban \ncenters. It means we will have a generation on the road to cancer of \nthe mouth, throat, larynx, esophagus, pancreas, bladder, and kidney. \nCigarettes are killing more children than ever before in our most \nunderserved communities. The obligation of this legislation is to find \na way to try to reduce that.\n\n  What do we do in this bill? We hear people coming out here and \ntalking about ``bureaucracy and government.'' We have left most of the \noptions here to the States. In fact, there are minimal numbers of \nmandates. The mandates are simply sort of a Federal effort to say we \nwant to make sure they\n\n[[Page S5537]]\n\nstay on the target of trying to reduce kids from smoking but gives the \nStates a pretty fair recipe as to how to do that. And it leaves the \nStates the option of giving a tax cut. As the Senator from Arizona \nsaid, they can make their own choice. The big hand of Washington \ndoesn't have to step in and tell them what to do. If they decide they \nwant to take some of the money that comes back from this revenue and \ngive them a tax cut, they can do that. We don't stop them.\n  So it seems there is ample opportunity here. But most importantly, \nthis bill sets up a structure for some cessation programs for \ncounteradvertising, for research. Every single one of those are related \nto stopping children from smoking. We don't know all that science can \ntell us about addiction yet. Therefore, we have laid out a certain \ncomponent of funding here to fund additional research on a national \nbasis to try to learn more. Maybe we can come up with some kind of \nvaccine, Mr. President. Maybe we will come up with some kind of a \nmagical combination of education and early input that makes it \nexceedingly difficult for people to make the choice to smoke. Maybe \nthere is some easy antidote. We don't know yet. Whatever it is that \ntriggers the mechanism in the chemical structure that makes people \naddicted, we ought to be researching. That is what we do. We put money \ninto research so we can reduce the impact on our society of the $80 \nbillion a year of medical costs. We have counteradvertising. We have \nlearned that is a very, very significant way of reducing people from \nsmoking. There are very significant evidences of that. It seems to me \nthat we ought to keep our eye focused on that.\n  Let me try to document that a little bit with an example. In \nMassachusetts, we were able to fight our State's addiction to \ncigarettes by a combination of raising tobacco prices and funding \ntobacco-control programs, exactly what we are talking about doing in \nthis legislation. In 1992, Massachusetts voters approved Question 1, a \nballot initiative, to increase the excise tax on cigarettes by 25 \ncents. The funds from that 25 cents were spent on cessation, outreach, \na Smoker's Quitline, media campaigns about the dangers of tobacco, as \nwell as research. The Smoker's Quitline, which is 1-800-TRY-TO-STOP, \nreceived over 35,000 calls through June 1996. It distributed 23,000 \ncessation materials. The media campaign is entitled ``It's Time We Made \nSmoking History'' and it reached 94 percent of the children in my \nState. The Tobacco Education Clearinghouse distributed over 2 million \npieces of tobacco information literature in English, Portuguese, \nSpanish, Vietnamese, and other languages, and 66 primary health care \nsites have provided smoking cessation programs with individual \ncessation counseling and advice to 36,000 patients. Forty-nine youth \ntobacco education programs sponsored 2,570 community tobacco education \nevents, which reached 950,000 Massachusetts youth. Thirty-three \npopulation at-risk programs provided tobacco education and cessation \nactivities to targeted racial, ethnic, and gender groups.\n  What were the results of these efforts? The annual per person \ncigarette consumption in Massachusetts dropped by approximately 30 \npercent from 1992 to 1997. The plan is working. There is no denying \nthat. So what we are talking about in this bill is not pie in the sky, \nit is not some made-up notion of a do-good/feel-good concept. It works. \nIt has proven to work. The only question before the U.S. Senate is \nwhether we are prepared to maximize our efforts to reduce young people \nsmoking and reduce the tax on Americans of smoking that occurs today, \neven for those who don't smoke and haven't asked for that tax.\n  The research shows that we are not talking about some Massachusetts--\nthis is not a miracle or pie-in-the-sky. This can work all around the \ncountry. In the last 10 years, States from Minnesota to California to \nArizona have invested in similar community-based antismoking campaigns. \nThe American Stop Smoking Intervention Study for Cancer Prevention has \nprovided funding to 17 States for smoking prevention programs, and they \nhave managed to cut tobacco consumption by 10 percent in just 4 years.\n  So, Mr. President, here you have it. In our State, we have a 30-\npercent reduction. In California, Minnesota, and Arizona, where they \nhave made these efforts, small as they are, there has been a 10-percent \nreduction. What we are saying in this legislation is that if we can \ntake this tobacco revenue and apply it to teenage smoking reduction \nefforts, we will reduce the number of Americans who are addicted, we \nwill reduce the number of Americans who die each year because of this, \nwe will reduce the amazing cost to our society of the burden of our \nhealth care, and we will reduce the Medicare and Medicaid component \nthat is associated with it, the tax burden.\n  This is a tax cut plan. This will reduce the cost to America over \ntime, and that is why it makes sense. We also know that \ncounteradvertising works. We need to be empowered--and this legislation \nseeks to do that--to reach millions of young kids in ways that will \nchange their attitudes about smoking.\n  I know that my colleague from Oklahoma expressed concern last week \nabout the increase in marijuana use in the United States and the \nincrease in smoking. I share that concern with him. There is an \ninexcusable rise in the level of marijuana smoking taking place. One of \nthe reasons is that there has been a fallback on the commitment that \nwas made a number of years ago to the kinds of proactive efforts of \nsports stars, role models, advertising, and other efforts that are so \nessential to helping kids perform the roles and attitudes necessary not \nto smoke.\n  For decades, we have had the tobacco industry pushing cigarettes that \ntaste sweet. I read a Wall Street Journal article where a former \ntobacco sales representative is quoted as arguing, ``This cigarette is \nfor somebody who likes the taste of candy, if you know what I'm \nsaying.'' Well, we know exactly what he means, Mr. President. What we \nought to be doing is empowering local communities who know what he is \nsaying to deliver a countermessage against youth smoking.\n  Mr. President, in States where they have run messages against youth \nsmoking--places like Arizona--it has worked. It has brought children \nout of risk. Nationally, I don't think any one of us will ever forget \nsome of the ads we have seen, like the Marlboro Man dying in a hospital \nbed from lung cancer. He was the guy who was sitting on the horse with \nthe hat on and moustache, looking so macho, selling a generation of \ncigarettes. He died from lung cancer last year, regretting the smoking \nand regretting the image that he portrayed, and he made an \nadvertisement about it. That is effective. There was an advertisement \nof a cigarette addict who lost her larynx to smoking through her \ntracheotomy. I have talked with teenagers who quit smoking the day they \nsaw those ads. Can anybody say that the effect is going to be the same \nthe day we get rid of the marriage penalty?\n  Come on, Mr. President, let's face it. The reality is that everybody \nunderstands if we can run an effective national effort in order to try \nto counter the impact on our children, we will make a difference. It is \nup to the U.S. Senate to make that difference now. We have a choice \nabout our priorities. We can come down here and continue to wage the \nfight against the tobacco companies who continue to stand in opposition \nto a bill that tries reasonably to deal with the problem of smoking. I \nsay to my colleagues, where it isn't reasonable, let's amend it. Let's \ncome down to the floor with an appropriate substitute or amendment and \nlet's pass it, if it is worthy. If it isn't, let's complete work on \nthis legislation and do what we ought to do to reduce the access of \nsmoking to our children.\n\n  It seems to me that it is not hard to discern that the purpose of \nthis bill is genuine and it is simple: It saves children's lives. It \ncould save a generation. And it does so with minimal bureaucracy, \nminimal intrusiveness, and minimal interference. I am open to any ideas \nthat anybody has which will sustain a counteradvertising program, \nsustain the cessation programs, sustain research into addiction, but at \nthe same time do it somehow with less ``bureaucracy'' or intrusiveness. \nI am confident the Senator from Arizona and I would accept an amendment \nif it did so in a way that sustained the fundamental purposes of this \nlegislation.\n  So we have this opportunity, and there is no higher priority in the \nagenda of this Nation, there is no higher\n\n[[Page S5538]]\n\npriority in the business of the U.S. Senate. It is hard sometimes to \nmake the words as meaningful as one wants to, hard to find a way to get \nover the partisan tug-of-war that takes place here, and it is hard \nsometimes to get the full measure of what this is about. The full \nmeasure of what this is about is not the measure of a price of a pack \nof cigarettes, it is the measure of a child's life, it is the measure \nof what it is like to have emphysema and be in a hospital because you \nhaven't made the decision that was cognitive when you were young. It is \nthe measure of our responsibility as adults and as citizens to be able \nto reach our children at a stage when they are most impressionable and \nsubject to making these kinds of mistakes. That is the measure of what \nwe are doing here. I hope the U.S. Senate will measure up and do what \nevery American understands is in the interest of our Nation and in the \ninterest of our children.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nhis important statement and the important comments he has made. I will \nyield the floor in a minute to Senator Wellstone, who is waiting.\n  I want to make a couple additional points here. One of the aspects of \nthis bill that has been raised is, of course, the legal fees. There is \nno doubt that that issue has to be addressed. The President tried to \naddress it in one of his amendments, which I supported. I believe that \nhe and others are working together to try to guarantee that most of the \nmoney goes to the public and would still leave the lawyers plenty of \nroom to get rich. That is our goal here, and I think we can achieve \nthat without too much difficulty on a consensus basis.\n  On the issue of the look-back, the so-called Durbin amendment that we \nare specifically debating, let me point out that if the so-called look-\nback provisions are made strictly company-specific--remembering that in \nthe bill we have an uncapped company-by-company surcharge of $1,000 per \nyouth smoker--there can be wild gyrations in the cost of a pack of \ncigarettes, which would really drive those specific companies out of \nbusiness. If it were strictly company by company, if one company did \nnot achieve the goals and had to increase its payments by a significant \namount, those costs would have to be passed on, as we know, to the \nconsumer. That would drive the tobacco company out of business.\n  I repeat, we are not trying to drive the tobacco companies out of \nbusiness, we are trying to drive them out of the business of marketing \nto kids. What you would really end up doing if we adopted the Durbin \namendment is basically cause wild gyrations in the cost of a pack of \ncigarettes and drive companies out of business. Mr. President, what we \nhave done in the managers' amendment is basically strike a compromise \nbetween an overall penalty to the industry, but also a specific penalty \nof $1,000 per youth smoker, which, by the way, is double the amount a \nyoung person spends on cigarettes per year.\n  That is a very significant penalty. I would point out that the Durbin \namendment would also increase the cost to about $7 billion where ours \nis approximately $4 billion.\n  Mr. President, I do not see the Senator from Massachusetts in the \nChamber, but I think it is important for us to recognize something else \nhere, too, that has been going on. I know that many of my colleagues \ndislike the tobacco companies. I have to say, in all candor, I have \ngrown to like them less as I have been seeing my name splashed all over \nnewspapers, television and listened to it on radio for about the last \nmonth, but let us not forget what we are trying to do here. Are we \ntrying to just drive tobacco companies out of business, which probably \nwould not upset me if I did not believe and know that 40 million adult \nAmericans would still smoke.\n  If American tobacco companies went out of business, two things would \nhappen: One, there would be a Marlboro or a Camel or another coming out \nof Mexico, El Salvador, whatever; they would be exporting cigarettes \ninto the United States, which we would not have nearly as much control \nover. So people would not stop smoking immediately if we drove all the \ntobacco companies out of business. So it is not in our interest to \ndrive all the tobacco companies out of business, particularly since we \nwould also be deprived of the funds to be used to try to convince \nchildren in America not to smoke.\n  So with all due respect to my colleague, what I see going on here, \ninterestingly, from both ends of the political spectrum is such \npunitive amendments that we will drive the tobacco companies out of \nbusiness. Now, we will feel good; we will be able to go back and tell \nour constituents: I voted for this amendment; I voted for that \namendment; I took away any protection that they had; I voted to \nincrease the price of a pack of cigarettes; I voted to make those \npunitive provisions stronger and, by God, I showed those tobacco \ncompanies.\n  Well, that may be a short-term gain, but it will not solve the \nproblem of kids smoking. That is why this bill had better not get too \nfar out of kilter. Now, I do rely on the experts. I do rely on their \nopinion. I am not an expert. I am not an expert on smoking. I freely \nadmit that. But I listened to the Treasury Department. I listened to \nthe public health groups. I listened to the experts who told me that if \nit becomes too punitive, too big in penalties, too big a price for the \ntobacco companies to pay, they will do what the asbestos companies did \nand that is declare bankruptcy and go out of business. So it may feel \nreal good to vote for an amendment that punishes the tobacco companies \nfurther.\n  Now, I will admit, Mr. President, I have some subjectivity here \nbecause I spent weeks and my staff spent hundreds, thousands of hours \nsitting down saying, what is the best, carefully balanced package we \ncan come up with which achieves our goal. And that is why we received a \n19-to-1 vote through the committee--because it had balance. We are in \ndanger of knocking this thing way out of balance, if we haven't \nalready.\n  Now, again, I will stop because the Senator from Minnesota is on the \nfloor, but we could sit here day after day, week after week, if we want \nto, voting for amendments that punish the tobacco companies more and \nmore. But that will not stop a kid from smoking. Every day that goes by \n3,000 kids will start smoking. Today 3,000 kids will start smoking. \nTomorrow 3,000 kids will start smoking.\n  So I urge my colleagues to understand what our goal here is--not to \ndrive the tobacco companies out of business, but to stop kids from \nsmoking. If you drive the tobacco companies out of business, which may \nmake one feel good, one, you are still going to have 40 million adult \nsmokers in America and probably kids smoking, too; and, two, you are \nnot going to effectively address this problem that we are trying to \nthrough this legislation which was addressed on last June 20.\n  So I hope my colleagues will keep that in mind as we vote for \namendments and show how macho and tough we are on the tobacco \ncompanies.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, let me say to my \ncolleague from Arizona I had a chance yesterday to speak in the \nChamber, and I have been wanting to say this while he is in the \nChamber. I read a very eloquent and really beautiful piece in the \nWashington Post he had written about Senator Goldwater, who was, I \nsuppose, on the opposite side of the spectrum from where I stand, but I \ntalked about how especially in recent years--I never knew Senator \nGoldwater, never had a chance to talk with him, but in recent years as \nI have read about him and seen some of the things he said, I have so \nmuch respect for the way in which he kind of tied together personal, \nintellectual and political integrity.\n  I say to my colleague from Arizona, who will probably disagree with \nthe rest of what I say over the next several minutes, I do believe when \nit comes to conscience and integrity we do have somebody who lives up \nto that very high standard Senator Goldwater set. And that is Senator \nMcCain from Arizona. The only thing I didn't agree with in the article \nthe Senator wrote was when Senator McCain said he will\n\n[[Page S5539]]\n\njust be a mere footnote in Senate history. I do not agree with that. I \nthink Senator McCain is an enormously important force here in the \nSenate and in the country, and I better not go any further with that \nbecause I am about to disagree with the rest of what he said.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that David Vang, who as an \nintern in his last day in our office, be allowed to be in the Chamber \nduring the debate today on this piece of legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I agree with really what both my colleagues have had \nto say, the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry, and Senator McCain, \nabout what our goal is with this legislation, that we ought to keep our \neye on the prize. The goal is to reduce youth smoking and to save the \nlives of children in our country and, I would argue, also children \nthroughout the world.\n  In that regard, from my perspective, not from the point of view of \nbeing macho, I say to my colleague from Arizona, but from a point of \nview of what I think would be the best public policy that would make a \ndifference, I think we took a step backwards when we did not raise the \nprice increase of cigarettes to $1.50 per pack. Senator Kennedy's \namendment, I think, was on the mark because I think if we had done that \nover 3 years, demand, indeed, being elastic, would have gone down in a \nvery significant way especially with young people.\n  But regardless of the debate on that amendment, we move forward. \nSenator McCain has labored long and hard to make this a good bill. So \nhave other Senators--Senator Kerry and Senator Hollings and others. But \nagain we all agree that the reduction of youth smoking and the \nprotection of children's lives should be the primary goal of this \nlegislation. So let us just say we are in agreement in that goal.\n  Now, we are forced to come to the floor of the Senate--and I am going \nto speak about Senator Durbin's look-back provisions--and fight hard \nfor children and young people for some protection because big tobacco \nfor decades has employed legions of marketers who were paid to find \nways in which they could addict our children and procure them as future \nlong-term customers.\n  That is exactly what it has been all about. That was the mandate that \nthe advertising agents received from the tobacco industry. This \nindustry poured a tremendous amount of its wealth and its talent in \nwhat they viewed as their mission. And, oh boy, were they successful. \nWe have heard it many times now; we hear it every day. Senator McCain \njust recited the same statistic; 3,000 kids start smoking each day in \nour country alone, and a third of them, at least a third of them, will \ndie a premature death due to tobacco-related illness. So these tobacco \ncompanies know how to market and they know how to do it well. They are \nexperts. They have been experts at whispering in our children's ear and \nseducing them to smoke. So let us now get these companies to use their \nexpertise to change the tenor of these whispers and to have them induce \nour children not to smoke. For a long, long, long time--too long a \ntime--they targeted our children, they whispered in their ears, they \nseduced them to smoke. They have the expertise. Now what we are going \nto do is provide them with incentives to, in fact, get our children not \nto smoke. These companies are responsible, or have been responsible, \nfor what Dr. David Kessler calls the ``pediatric disease of smoking.'' \nLet me repeat that, ``the pediatric disease of smoking.''\n\n  That is what the look-back provisions are all about. They are to make \nthe tobacco companies responsible for meeting certain youth-reduction \ngoals, and they hold them financially accountable if they fail to reach \nthese goals. Senator McCain is to be commended for the inclusion of \nlook-back provisions in the bill which we have before us today. But I \nthink, not from the point of view of trying to destroy the industry but \nfrom the point of view of how we can, in fact, make sure we have the \nright incentives to get these companies to make an all-out effort not \nto target children and, in fact, reduce the number of children who are \nsmoking, I think we have to have stronger and better incentives. That \nis why I come to the floor to support the Durbin-DeWine amendment.\n  I think what this amendment does, which is most important, is that it \nmakes the payments or the penalties for missing the youth-reduction \ntargets more company specific as opposed to primarily industry-wide.\n  I am worried about the industry-wide approach for a couple of \ndifferent reasons. First of all, I think what will probably happen is \nthat the industry, as a whole, will just simply say: Look, there is no \nparticular incentive for any one company to really go all-out to reduce \nteenage smoking and we will just kind of share the additional cost. \nBut, you know what? In the long run, it will be more profitable to do \nthat.\n  The problem is that there is a negative incentive for companies to \ntry to live up to our goal. After all the goal is to reduce teenage \nsmoking. The goal is to dramatically reduce this addiction. The goal is \nto dramatically reduce the death of people in our country. Therefore, \nit would seem to me that if some companies are doing all they can to \nmeet that goal but other companies are not, and the industry as a whole \ndoesn't do the job, then everybody ends up having to pay a penalty, and \nthere is simply no incentive for a company to do right. The way it \nstands now, if a certain company does make the effort to stop children \nfrom smoking their cigarettes, but the rest of the industry doesn't, \nthen the company that did make the positive attempt is punished more \nthan any other. First, they are hit by the industry wide look back \npayments even though they made every good-faith effort to do the right \nthing. And, second of all, by doing the right thing they are \nfinancially burdened by the loss of their youth market.\n  So it seems to me the look-back provisions in the bill as they now \nstand are flawed, and I think to make the incentives or disincentives \nmore company-based, more specific-company focused, is a much more \neffective public policy way of reaching our goal, which is to have a \ndramatic reduction of teenage smoking.\n  The Durbin-DeWine amendment is also, I think, a strong improvement \nbecause it raises the 10-year reduction goal from 60 percent to 67 \npercent. In our committee, the Labor and Human Resources Committee, \nwhich for a short period of time had jurisdiction over this \nlegislation, Senator Kennedy had an amendment which passed the \ncommittee which would have raised the goal to 80 percent, an 80-percent \nreduction in youth smoking. We heard from any number of different \nexperts who said you can do that. We can do that and we should. This is \ntruly one place where we ought to set the bar as high as we can because \nwe are talking about children's lives. Children's lives are precious to \nall of us. So I think by going to 67 percent, we have made a solid \nimprovement that is easily doable and I think we should set the goal \nthis high.\n  Let me just finish up this way. I now come back to why I come to the \nfloor to support the Durbin-DeWine amendment, which I think is a much \nmore effective way of reducing youth smoking. I think the look-back \nprovisions as they now stand are flawed. I do not think they are going \nto work well. So we want to have a piece of legislation which will be \nas strong as possible and will work well.\n\n  I say to my colleague from Arizona, no company gets put out of \nexistence. Every single company that makes a good-faith, all-out effort \nto reach these achievable goals and reaches them, will not have any \nproblem at all. Those companies will have no look-back payments to \nmake. It is simple. There is no reason, no inherent reason in this \namendment that Senator Durbin and Senator DeWine have brought to the \nfloor, why any companies would have to worry about going out of \nexistence if, in fact, they make a commitment to live up to these \ngoals. And that is what it is all about.\n  I think the language of money is, in fact, the only language to which \nthis industry has responded. While the pleas of parents and children \nand dying victims might fall on deaf ears, and they have for a long \ntime, the clinking of coins is a sound to which they are most surely \nattuned.\n  So I think right now we have some provisions in the legislation that \nI do\n\n[[Page S5540]]\n\nnot think will work that well. I think this amendment that Senator \nDurbin and Senator DeWine have brought to the floor makes a lot more \nsense. Because if companies choose to use their marketing powers to \ndiscourage teenagers from smoking, which is exactly what this look-back \nprovision will encourage them to do, they will avoid any look-back \npayments and at the same time they will improve America's long-term \nhealth. I think that is what this legislation is all about.\n  Since I have some additional time here, I want to let my colleagues \nknow that I will be introducing an amendment to extend the advertising \nprotections that children here in the United States will enjoy, to \nextend those protections to children around the world. My understanding \nis that the amendment tree is filled right now, but I want to talk a \nlittle bit about this amendment. Again, as I have already said, the \npurpose of this legislation is the reduction of youth smoking. I \nbelieve the amendment I will introduce will further that goal and \nbecause it will it should have strong support from this body. What I am \nconcerned about are some of the provisions in the legislation that deal \nwith the international activities of this renegade industry. I think \nthose provisions are inadequate.\n  What I want to do is to make sure that the advertising and marketing \nrestrictions that we have in this legislation also apply to the \ninternational scope of these tobacco companies just the way Senator \nMcCain's bill was written when it passed out of Commerce Committee by a \n19-to-1 vote. So, for example, if we are going to say: Look, industry, \nyou are not going to be able to use cartoon characters to market your \ndeadly products here in the United States of America; I would like to \nsay to these companies: You are not going to be able to use these \ncartoon characters to market these deadly products in any market \noverseas.\n  I'd like to provide a little context for my colleagues. I will \naddress this subject in more depth later on, but I wanted to draw from \nsome interesting documents my State of Minnesota was able to obtain \nwhen Minnesota forced the tobacco industry to disgorge documents so \nrevealing that the industry has been hiding them for years. An R.J. \nReynolds document, penned in 1976, reads:\n\n       Evidence is now available to indicate that the 14-18 year \n     old group is an increasing segment of the smoking population. \n     RJR-(tobacco) must soon establish a successful new brand in \n     this market if our position in the industry is to be \n     maintained in the long term.\n\n  Or this from Philip Morris, in 1981:\n\n       Today's teenager is tomorrow's potential regular customer, \n     and the overwhelming majority of smokers first begin to smoke \n     while still in their teens . . . The smoking patterns of \n     teenagers are particularly important to Philip Morris.\n\n  The amendment I will introduce will basically say we need to put our \nfoot down. We ought to say: No more. No more addicting of children. \nTobacco industry, you need to cease and desist from diabolic marketing \ntactics which target children, which addict children, and which \nultimately lead to the premature death of too many people, here and \nabroad.\n  Some statistics about what Dr. Kessler has called the pediatric \ndisease of smoking. The World Health Organization projects a staggering \nglobal death and disease burden related to tobacco use. The WHO \nestimates that one-third of the world's population over the age of 15 \ncurrently smokes--one-third. This is equal to 1.1 billion smokers. Of \nthose 1.1 billion smokers, over 90 percent live outside the United \nStates and over 70 percent live in developing countries.\n  Let me simply mention a couple of other interesting statistics that I \nwill again get a chance to develop in this argument a little later on. \nI will give just a few examples. Over the last decade in which U.S. \nsales have declined by 17 percent, U.S. cigarette exports have grown by \na staggering 260 percent.\n  In 1996 alone, U.S. manufacturers exported a record 243.9 billion \ncigarettes--243.9 billion cigarettes. I have to say to my colleague \nfrom Arizona, I am not out here to bash, but I honestly and truthfully \nbelieve and can marshal evidence--and I will when we get to debate this \namendment--that big tobacco has been absolutely shameless in its \nefforts to addict children, not only in our country but abroad as well.\n  For example, if we are going to say, look, this is about reducing \nteenage smoking, this is about saving children's lives, I think a child \nis a child. We are talking about all of God's children. These \nadvertisements have been shameful. They have been irresponsible. But, \nunfortunately, they also have been very successful.\n  It is no surprise that when U.S. companies go into overseas markets, \nteenage smoking rates quickly climb. In Russia, from 1992 to 1993 \nsmoking rates among 13 to 16-year-olds increased from 31.5 percent to \n42.5 percent as a result of targeting efforts by tobacco companies.\n  Smoking rates among male Korean teenagers rose from 18 percent to 30 \npercent in just 1 year after the entry of U.S. tobacco companies. Let \nme repeat that: Smoking rates among male Korean teenagers rose from 18 \nto 30 percent in just 1 year after the entry of U.S. tobacco companies.\n  Just 2 years after Taiwan's cigarette market was opened to U.S. \ncompanies, the smoking rate among high school students increased 50 \npercent. In both Taiwan and Japan, U.S. brands jumped from 1 percent to \n20 percent of the market in less than 2 years.\n  The United States National Cancer Policy Board has noted that the \nintroduction of U.S. cigarettes in Japan ``had the regrettable effect \nof contributing to an increase in overall tobacco consumption, \nespecially among those under the age of 20.'' That is from the U.S. \nNational Cancer Policy Board.\n  My amendment will simply state that American tobacco companies, and \nthose they control, are prohibited from selling, distributing or \nmarketing tobacco products to children overseas, just as they will be \nprohibited from such activities in the United States.\n  I have to say to you, Mr. President, that the good news is the bill \nthat was passed by the Commerce Committee by a 19-to-1 vote had \nbasically the same language as this amendment. And I say let us get \nthat language back in the bill.\n  My concern, as a United States Senator from Minnesota, is how can we \ndramatically reduce smoking among teenagers, among young people? How \ncan we stop this shameless targeting of kids? Again, we had document \nafter document after document. I know my colleague who is presiding has \ndebated this. He has raised important questions--I always give that to \nhim--and he argues his case forcefully about lawyers and lawyers' fees \nand all the rest. Fair enough. We have debated that, and we will debate \nit again.\n  I will say this: In the Minnesota court case which was recently \nsettled, it is incredible the number of documents and the amount of \ninformation we were able to get out before the public.\n  Those documents tell a very disturbing story of an industry which in \na very shameless way targeted kids and went all out to addict children. \nWhat I will be doing with this amendment that I will offer is to say, \nlook, if we are going to be concerned about marketing to children in \nour country, then we also ought to be concerned about it with children \nabroad. The United States of America ought not to be known around the \nworld, especially in these poor developing countries, as a country with \nan industry that is a leading exporter of death. That ought not to be \nour identity with people in those countries. I think the same marketing \nrestrictions should apply. You no longer can use cartoon characters to \npush the buttons of children and addict them to tobacco in our country, \nand you are not going to do it in other countries either. That will be \nthe gist of the amendment I intend to introduce.\n  Mr. President, I do not see any colleagues on the floor, so I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. I rise today to speak on the amendment proposed by Senators \nDurbin and DeWine which would, in fact, strengthen the look-back \npenalty with respect to the tobacco legislation which we are \nconsidering today on the floor.\n\n[[Page S5541]]\n\n  The key element to changing the tobacco legislation is providing for \na very strong, very tough, and a very appropriate look-back provision \nwhich essentially would extract additional payments from the tobacco \nindustry if they fail to meet the goals in reducing teenage smoking. \nThis is at the heart and soul of the whole tobacco debate--preventing \nchildren from getting easy access to tobacco products, preventing them \nfrom engaging in an addiction which will lead to their premature death \nin too many cases.\n  When the tobacco industry announced their initial agreement a year \nago with the attorneys general, they indicated a sincere desire, we \nhoped, to change the culture of tobacco, to change the culture of the \nway they deal with this product. Unfortunately, for many, many years, \nperhaps the whole history of the tobacco industry, they have been \ntargeting young people as a means to boost their sales, as a means to \nenlist and, indeed, addict a whole generation of young people to be \ntheir customers. This approach, this marketing approach over many, \nmany, many years, has led to the premature deaths of thousands of \nAmericans. We have the opportunity now to stop that, if we do, in fact, \nlegislate strong protections like a good, solid look-back provision.\n  The tobacco industry has, as I indicated, spent billions of dollars \ntrying to ensure that children become addicted to tobacco. In many \nrespects, sadly, the tobacco industry has become addicted to children. \nThey just can't seem to thrive economically without them. We want to \nchange that addiction. We want to change the addiction that affects \nchildren, and we would like to change the addiction that has affected \nthe industry. We would like them, if they are to market their product, \nto do so to adults.\n  At the core of ensuring this happens is the requirement of having \nstiff assessments against the industry if they fail to meet the goals \nwe have set out. That is at the core of the amendment proposed by \nSenator Durbin and Senator DeWine. I commend them for this amendment. \nIt would strengthen significantly the protections and strengthen \nsignificantly the look-back assessments that the industry would pay if \nthey fail to meet the goals of reducing teenage smoking.\n  We have seen, over the course of many, many years, the deliberate \nattempt on the part of the industry to attract young people, to attract \nteenagers, to get them smoking early, so that by the time they thought \nabout it, they were already addicted to tobacco products.\n  The most revealing source of information about the industry's tactics \nhas been the industry itself. In various litigation proceedings around \nthe country, documents have been discovered and released publicly that \nindicate the systematic and very deliberate attempts by the industry to \naddict children. Documents obtained through the Mangini litigation \nfurther document these efforts. A presentation from a C.A. Tucker, vice \npresident of marketing for RJR Industries, concluded, ``This young \nadult market, the 14 to 24 age group, represents tomorrow's business.'' \nOnly, I think, would the industry think of ``young adults'' as 14-year-\nold children. And it is quite clear and quite obvious they were \ntargeting these young children. They have done it in so many different \nways.\n  They have also indicated in documents released by the Mangini \nlitigation that they conducted extensive surveys of smoking habits of \nteenagers. They were trying to find out essentially what makes \nteenagers tick and how they can use those psychological forces to \naddict children to cigarette smoking. This hasn't changed and won't \nchange this until we have a good, strong look-back provision.\n  The improvements which Senator Durbin and Senator DeWine are \nsuggesting are just the right approach to make this look-back \nassessment a positive and forceful one. For example, they will move \naway from the industry-wide assessment contained in the underlining \nMcCain bill and have more company-specific assessment. This makes \nsense, because if a company thinks that they can act inappropriately, \nthey can take chances, play loose with the rules, market to kids, and \ntheir competitors will help bail them out because the penalty is \nassessed across all the companies--the good and the bad equally--there \nwill be no real incentive to change the behavior of individual \ncompanies, to change the marketing approaches, to change the \nadvertising approaches, to assume and to ensure that what we have is a \nsituation where children are no longer subject to this type of \nadvertising.\n  This company-specific approach is going to be, I think, the key. That \nis what is so critical about this amendment. If we don't have an \nindustry-wide standard for the look-back assessment, we will never \neffectively change the behaviors of these companies. And, frankly, that \nis what we should be about. This legislation should not be about simply \nracking up huge payments from the industry. It should not be about how \nwe spend those payments, necessarily. It should be quite a bit about \nchanging behavior and the incentive of the industry so they stop trying \nto market tobacco products to children.\n\n  Another important aspect of this amendment that is critical is that \nthis amendment would increase the target the industry must reach in 10 \nyears from 60 percent to 67 percent. In essence, this amendment would \nrequire a 67-percent reduction in teenage smoking in 10 years. That is \ncomparable to what the industry itself agreed to when they settled with \nthe attorneys general. These two provisions--the company-specific \napproach, together with increasing the target reduction rate for teen \nsmoking--are absolutely essential to having comprehensive tobacco \nlegislation that will work and actually produce results. They will save \nthe lives of thousands and perhaps hundreds of thousands of young \npeople today, who otherwise will continue to be the targets of tobacco \nadvertising, will continue to be the targets of the industry and will, \nI fear, fall under the sway of this tobacco addiction prematurely, \nshortening their lives and impacting the public health of America.\n  I urge my colleagues to do all they can to ensure that this amendment \npasses, and that we move from this amendment to consider other \namendments that will also control the access of information that kids \nhave about tobacco. I will propose an amendment that will condition the \nreceipt of tax deductibility of advertising expenditures in compliance \nwith the FDA rules for advertising. These amendments, together, are \nsteps that we can and should take immediately to ensure that we succeed \nin changing the culture of the tobacco industry, that we succeed in \nensuring that we take historic steps so that children in America will \nno longer be the victims of an industry that has preyed on them for too \nlong.\n  I urge my colleagues to join myself, Senator Durbin, Senator DeWine, \nand the other cosponsors, in passing this act.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as we resume debate on the issue of the \ntobacco bill, I want to discuss a very serious issue that arose \nconcerning veterans and smoking and has to do with the highway bill, \nwhich some may think a little strange but probably has a lot to do with \nhow we juggle numbers around around here and the way we ``pay'' for \nthings and not ``pay'' for things.\n\n[[Page S5542]]\n\n  Let me quote from an article that was in the Washington Post on \nSaturday, ``Veterans Livid About `Willful Misconduct' Tag on Smokers.''\n\n       Veterans groups were furious last week when Congress voted \n     to finance the pending highway bill by denying billions of \n     dollars to veterans suffering from tobacco-related illnesses. \n     This week, the groups were stunned to discover that the \n     lawmakers actually went further than that and declared any \n     veteran who smoked on active duty could be considered to have \n     engaged in ``willful misconduct.''\n       That is the same standard that the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs uses to deny benefits to alcoholics and drug abusers. \n     The comparison has made veterans groups livid and yesterday \n     they vowed to force a second vote on the issue.\n       ``We're hoping to get one more shot at it,'' said Bob \n     Wallace, deputy executive director of the Veterans of Foreign \n     Wars.

The VA long has accepted those \n     individuals for care and benefits, but a spokesman said VA \n     lawyers are now debating whether the new law will allow their \n     continued care.\n\n  That is pretty remarkable, Mr. President. That is pretty remarkable.\n\n       What the Congress has done is to ``retroactively redefine \n     conduct that was not only legal but it was also encouraged by \n     the military,'' said Phil Budahn, a spokesman for the \n     American Legion, the Nation's largest veterans organization. \n     He and other veterans noted that the military provided free \n     cigarettes to service personnel as recently as the Vietnam \n     War.\n       Until the highway bill came along, Congress had avoided the \n     issue.

I ask unanimous consent that \nthe article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 30, 1998]\n\n       Veterans Livid About ``Willful Misconduct'' Tag on Smokers\n\n                          (By Bill McAllister)\n\n       Veterans groups were furious last week when Congress voted \n     to finance the pending highway bill by denying billions of \n     dollars to veterans suffering from tobacco-related illnesses. \n     This week, the groups were stunned to discover that the \n     lawmakers actually went further than that and declared any \n     veteran who smoked on active duty could be considered to have \n     engaged in ``willful misconduct.''\n       That is the same standard that the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs uses to deny benefits to alcoholics and drug abusers. \n     The comparison has made veterans groups livid and yesterday \n     they vowed to force a second vote on the issue.\n       ``We're hoping we get one more shot at it,'' said Bob \n     Wallace, deputy executive director of the Veterans of Foreign \n     Wars. The groups have sent messages out to their memberships, \n     hoping to flood Capitol Hill with protests from the nation's \n     26 million veterans.\n       ``This battle isn't over until it's over,'' said Richard \n     Fuller, chief lobbyist for Paralyzed Veterans of America. \n     ``We've got a lot of members who got bamboozled on this.''\n       The veterans groups delivered their complaints to President \n     Clinton at a Memorial Day breakfast, but they acknowledged \n     yesterday were is little likelihood that he will veto the \n     highway measure. As a result, the groups are trying to stir \n     up their members enough to lobby Congress and force major \n     changes through a ``technical corrections'' bill, which \n     normally is designed to make uncontroversial fixes in \n     legislation.\n       A spokesman for the House Transportation and Infrastructure \n     Committee said Congress will consider the technical \n     corrections bill soon. But many members may be unhappy to \n     have to vote directly on the veterans issue.\n       Besides denying compensation, the highway bill also may \n     have gone so far as to block the VA from taking care of \n     veterans who become ill on active duty with tobacco-related \n     illnesses, such as lung cancer and heart ailments, a VA \n     official suggested. The VA long has accepted those \n     individuals for care and benefits, but a spokesman said VA \n     lawyers are now debating whether the new law will allow their \n     continued care.\n       Despite rulings by VA lawyers that say the department must \n     consider tobacco-related illnesses service-connected, the \n     department has rejected virtually all the claims it has \n     processed for compensation for smoking-related ailments.\n       The VA has approved only 299 claims of the 8,391 claims it \n     has received, officials said. Thus far, 4,290 claims were \n     rejected, but a spokesman said many of those rejections were \n     considered ``temporary'' and likely to be reversed after the \n     veterans submit additional information.\n       The VA is processing another 3,802 claims. But under the \n     highway legislation, the VA would be blocked from approving \n     any more claims.\n       What the Congress has done is to ``retroactively redefine \n     conduct that was not only legal but was also encouraged by \n     the military,'' said Phil Budahn, a spokesman for the \n     American Legion, the nation's largest veterans organization. \n     He and other veterans noted that the military provided free \n     cigarettes to service personnel as recently as the Vietnam \n     War.\n       In late 1992, a Bush administration appointee declared that \n     the VA should pay for veterans' smoking-related illnesses. \n     But the Clinton Administration has sought to distance itself \n     from that position, because of the expected cost of billions \n     of dollars. Instead, it called for legislation to overturn \n     that ruling by the VA's general counsel and a subsequent \n     ruling by its own appointees that made it easier for veterans \n     to file tobacco claims.\n       Until the highway bill came along, Congress had avoided the \n     issue. Because denying the tobacco benefits would create a \n     budgetary savings of as much as $23.8 billion over five \n     years, promoters of the highway bill latched on to the idea \n     as a way to pay for increased highway spending.\n       PVA's Fuller said Congress simply saw the VA as ``a cash \n     cow'' and used the veterans' money for bridges and highways.\n       ``They saw the money and that's all they wanted to do,'' \n     said Dave Autry, associate national director of Disabled \n     American Veterans.\n       Veterans groups, renowned for their Capitol Hill clout, \n     mounted a massive campaign to derail the legislation, urging \n     their members to write and call lawmakers to demand their \n     benefits. So far, the effort has been unsuccessful.\n       In the recent past, such congressional actions would have \n     been unlikely. Some said the response from Capitol Hill may \n     reflect the smaller number of veterans in Congress and the \n     fact that the overall veterans population is declining. \n     Lawmakers apparently don't fear their wrath as they once did.\n       The veterans said House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA.) did \n     convene a meeting of veterans groups last week in an effort \n     to end their opposition by promising to increase payments for \n     education under the Montgomery G.I. Bill.\n       ``The answer was `no.' We would not cut benefits for one \n     veteran to provide benefits for another,'' said Fuller. The \n     bill contained the education increases, nonetheless.\n       VA officials said the administration's proposed legislation \n     on the veterans tobacco issue would not have classified \n     smoking as ``willful misconduct'' and would have allowed the \n     VA to continue processing and paying any pending claims for \n     tobacco-related illnesses. It would, however, block the \n     filing of new claims as soon as the law was enacted.\n       In letters of Gingrich, VA Secretary Togo D. West Jr. said \n     the administration believed that use of tobacco ``like the \n     consumption of alcohol . . . is not a requirement of military \n     service'' and that any veterans who becomes sick as a result \n     of smoking should not be given government compensation.\n       Sen. John D. ``Jay'' Rockefeller IV (D-W.VA.), ranking \n     Democrat on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, said \n     yesterday he will offer an amendment to the tobacco \n     settlement legislation to earmark $2.7 billion over five \n     years for improved VA health care. That would be a small \n     step, he said, toward compensating the VA for the cost of \n     caring for smoking-related illnesses.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Mr. President, shortly, after some consultation, we would \nlike to propose an amendment concerning veterans and tobacco. I expect \nto have that agreement shortly.\n  While we are waiting, I want to quote from some letters that we have \nreceived from some of the veterans organizations in America.\n\n[[Page S5543]]\n\n  This one is from the Disabled American Veterans:\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the more than one million \n     members of the Disabled American Veterans (DAV), I write to \n     express our extreme disappointment that Congress chose to \n     raid veterans' disability compensation to pay for an already \n     bloated transportation bill. This action was particularly \n     egregious because it also came on the eve of Memorial Day, a \n     day set aside by a grateful Nation to pay tribute and honor \n     to those men and women of our Armed Forces who made the \n     ultimate sacrifice so that all Americans, and many others \n     around the world, could savor the freedoms we so richly \n     enjoy.\n       What I find so amazing is the willingness of the leadership \n     and many others in Congress to debase the legislative process \n     to ensure an offset for huge spending increases for \n     transportation. Congress pulled out all the stops to \n     guarantee that the end justified the means. Clearly, the \n     American public, and particularly veterans, were the losers \n     in this battle.\n       To reach the unjustified end--robbing veterans' disability \n     compensation to pay for transportation programs--this \n     Congress took the unprecedented action of usurping the \n     authorizing committee's jurisdiction. As the authorizing \n     committee was considering the merits of the issue of paying \n     disability compensation for tobacco-related illnesses, the \n     Congressional leadership laid claim to all of the so-called \n     ``savings'' from veterans' disability compensation, $10.5 \n     billion, for transportation programs during the Senate Budget \n     Committee deliberations. Further, the Senate's vote to take \n     away this benefit was based on gross inaccuracies and \n     misrepresentations contained in the Republican Policy \n     Committee's talking points.\n       The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated the \n     ``savings'' from veterans' disability compensation at $10.5 \n     billion. Although that figure was used by the Senate Budget \n     Committee and passed by the full Senate by a margin of 6 \n     votes, the transportation conference report on H.R. 2400 used \n     the Administration's higher figure of $15.5 billion. This was \n     done behind closed doors and without the knowledge of many of \n     the transportation bill conferees. It was also accomplished \n     with total disregard for the sense of the Congress, passed by \n     an overwhelming majority in the House, and the motion to \n     instruct the conferees not to use veterans' disability \n     compensation to fund transportation.\n       It was appalling to watch how quickly the Administration \n     lent its support to this misguided effort to plunder \n     veterans' programs when the Congressional leadership chose to \n     use the Administration's higher cost-savings estimate, \n     thereby guaranteeing fewer cuts in the Administration's \n     favorite programs.\n       Even worse was how quickly the leadership moved the \n     transportation bill conference report to a vote to ensure \n     that members would not defect after going home and meeting \n     with their constituents on Memorial Day.\n       The vote is now a part of history, as is what Congress has \n     done to veterans. However, as Congress focuses on the \n     appropriation process in the upcoming weeks, I call upon you \n     to make your voice heard to ensure that veterans' programs \n     receive adequate funding.\n       While Congress can never make up for the injustice it \n     recently perpetrated against veterans, it can ensure that the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system \n     receives at least $1.1 billion in appropriations above the \n     Administration's proposed budget to allow VA to provide \n     necessary medical care to our Nation's sick and disabled \n     veterans. Congress must also provide sufficient funding for \n     VA to increase its employment levels in Compensation and \n     Pension above the 7 new employees provided in the \n     Administration's proposed budget. Too many veterans die \n     before their claims can be properly adjudicated and too many \n     dependents and survivors are forced to accept a small \n     fraction of what the veteran would have been entitled to had \n     he or she survived the enormous delays encountered in an \n     understaffed adjudication division.\n       Instead of the patriotic speeches that veterans hear twice \n     a year, on Memorial Day and Veterans' Day, and during tough \n     debates on the floors of Congress, I call upon you to get \n     involved, in a meaningful way, and make your voice heard to \n     ensure that VA receives adequate funding. Please do not sit \n     back and wait for others to do what is right. Let your \n     colleagues know that you support adequate funding levels for \n     VA.\n       Thank you for your support of our efforts to obtain \n     adequate resources to substantially improve the quality and \n     timeliness of the VA benefits delivery and health care \n     systems.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter and letters \nfrom the Paralyzed Veterans of America, the Veterans of Foreign Wars of \nAmerica and the Vietnam Veterans of America be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Veterans of Foreign Wars\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 9, 1998.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the 2.1 million members \n     of the Veterans of Foreign Wars and all of America's 27 \n     million veterans, I am writing to express our dismay \n     regarding your recent support of the Craig/Domenici amendment \n     to the Budget Resolution to deny VA compensation for smoking \n     related disabilities to pay for excessive spending in the \n     Transportation Bill. This amendment represented a raid on \n     veteran's entitlements.\n       The VFW views this proposal as being an egregious affront \n     to this nation's veterans. It is a matter of fact and record \n     that the government bears significant culpability for the \n     tobacco-related health conditions of many veterans. In the \n     midst of Congress's vigorous effort to hold the tobacco \n     industry accountable for the cost and disabilities brought \n     about by smoking, we would ask you why the Government is to \n     be held to a lesser standard? Prohibiting VA compensation for \n     smoking related disabilities effectively grants an \n     unwarranted pardon at the expense of ill veterans.\n       Another point, the Craig/Domenci amendment assumes such a \n     prohibition will, in fact, be enacted into law to cover the \n     cost of $10.5 billion for highway and transportation projects \n     in violation of the Budget Agreement. If this does not come \n     about, VA may be forced to make drastic cuts in the area of \n     veterans health care (funded with discretionary dollars) in \n     order to meet this obligation. This would be an absolutely \n     unconscionable assault on veterans in need.\n       We urge you to consider your position on this matter. The \n     upcoming House/Senate Conference on the budget presents a \n     clear opportunity to correct this injustice. The VFW strongly \n     believes that sick and disabled veterans should be top \n     priority and should not take a back seat to road paving.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     John E.

John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the members of Paralyzed \n     Veterans of America (PVA), I must express our outrage at the \n     egregious proposal to restrict the payment of certain \n     benefits for service-connected disabilities in the name of \n     fiscal responsibility and at the same time to using the \n     accrued ``savings'' for other programs. The Administration \n     has proposed legislation that would deny benefits to veterans \n     for disabilities relating to tobacco use in the military. The \n     rationale for slashing these benefits is that to live up to \n     its commitments will be too expensive for the federal \n     government. This alone is cause for outrage in light of the \n     years of government promoted and fostered tobacco use by \n     military personnel.\n       Compounding this travesty is the fact that we now hear of \n     members of Congress proposing to use these monies, saved in \n     the name of fiscal responsibility, to fund other programs and \n     projects including highway construction. For too long \n     veterans' benefits and programs have been cash cows for other \n     federal programs. Veterans have contributed billions of \n     dollars for deficit reduction through reduced or eliminated \n     benefits, and every year veterans are asked to do more. \n     Veterans' health care is in crisis with appropriations being \n     frozen over the five-year term of the Balanced Budget Act, \n     and in fact the requested appropriation for FY 1999 is a cut \n     even below the freeze level. It is intolerable to propose \n     cutting benefits for service-connected disabled veterans and \n     using this money for non-veteran, pork barrel, programs.\n       We strongly oppose the Administration's proposal and find \n     any attempts to use this money for programs that do not \n     benefit veterans to be duplicitous at best.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Kenneth C. Huber,\n     National President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Disabled American Veterans,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 29, 1998.\n     Hon.

As the authorizing \n     committee was considering the merits of the issue of paying \n     disability compensation for tobacco-related illnesses, the \n     Congressional leadership laid claim to all of\n\n[[Page S5544]]\n\n     the so-called ``savings'' from veterans' disability \n     compensation, $10.5 billion, for transportation programs \n     during the Senate Budget Committee deliberations. Further, \n     the Senate's vote to take away this benefit was based on \n     gross inaccuracies and misrepresentations contained in the \n     Republican Policy Committee's talking points.\n       The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated the \n     ``savings'' from veterans' disability compensation at $10.5 \n     billion. Although that figure was used by the Senate Budget \n     Committee and passed by the full Senate by a margin of 6 \n     votes, the transportation conference report on H.R. 2400 used \n     the Administration's higher figure of $15.5 billion. This was \n     done behind closed doors and without the knowledge of many of \n     the transportation bill conferees. It was also accomplished \n     with total disregard for the sense of the Congress, passed by \n     an overwhelming majority in the House, and the motion to \n     instruct the conferees not to use veterans' disability \n     compensation to fund transportation.\n       It was appalling to watch how quickly the Administration \n     lent its support to this misguided effort to plunder \n     veterans' programs when the Congressional leadership chose to \n     use the Administration's higher cost-savings estimate, \n     thereby guaranteeing fewer cuts in the Administration's \n     favorite programs.\n       Even worse was how quickly the leadership moved the \n     transportation bill conference report to a vote to ensure \n     that members would not defect after going home and meeting \n     with their constituents on Memorial Day.\n       The vote is now a part of history, as is what Congress has \n     done to veterans. However, as Congress focuses on the \n     appropriation process in the upcoming weeks, I call upon you \n     to make your voice heard to ensure that veterans' programs \n     receive adequate funding.\n       While Congress can never make up for the injustice it \n     recently perpetrated against veterans, it can ensure that the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system \n     receives at least $1.1 billion in appropriations above the \n     Administration's proposed budget to allow VA to provide \n     necessary medical care to our Nation's sick and disabled \n     veterans. Congress must also provide sufficient funding for \n     VA to increase its employment levels in Compensation and \n     Pension above the 7 new employees provided in the \n     Administration's proposed budget. Too many veterans die \n     before their claims can be properly adjudicated and too many \n     dependents and survivors are forced to accept a small \n     fraction of what the veteran would have been entitled to had \n     he or she survived the enormous delays encountered in an \n     understaffed adjudication division.\n       Instead of the patriotic speeches that veterans hear twice \n     a year, on Memorial Day and Veterans' Day, and during tough \n     debates on the floors of Congress, I call upon you to get \n     involved, in a meaningful way, and make your voice heard to \n     ensure that VA receives adequate funding. Please do not sit \n     back and wait for others to do what is right. Let your \n     colleagues know that you support adequate funding levels for \n     VA.\n       Thank you for your support of our efforts to obtain \n     adequate resources to substantially improve the quality and \n     timeliness of the VA benefits delivery and health care \n     systems.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Harry R. McDonald, Jr.,\n                                               National Commander.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I thank Senator \nBond and Senator Specter, as well as Senator Rockefeller and Senator \nCampbell, for their advocacy on this issue. I believe the amendment \nthat we are proposing, which will provide $3 billion--$600 million a \nyear--taken out of all four of the funds that are funded by this bill \nis appropriate. I don't believe it is enough, given the number of \nveterans who are afflicted by tobacco-related illnesses, but I think it \nis a step in the right direction. I hope it will provide some solace \nand comfort to the obviously outraged and injured veterans community in \nAmerica.\n  I understand that everybody has their priorities around here. \nHighways are important. Bridges and subways are important. I was up in \nMassachusetts recently, I say to the Senator from Massachusetts, and \nthe ``Big Dig'' in Boston Harbor, which may never be completed--it may \nbe one of the ongoing projects in history--is important. But I have to \nask a question that I think deserves an answer: Are our priorities such \nthat the men and women who served in the military, who we encouraged to \nsmoke up to and including the Vietnam conflict, are to have a lower \npriority than a highway or a bridge?\n  I am puzzled and obviously somewhat angered that the procedure \nhappened as it did where a veteran who incurs a tobacco-related illness \nis now labeled ``malicious conduct.'' That is just something I do not \nunderstand nor, frankly, do most of my colleagues. I hope it can be \nfixed. I understand there may be a technical corrections bill to the \nhighway bill, and I hope it can be fixed. But at the same time, I feel \nin the strongest terms that we ought to address this issue of tobacco-\nrelated illness as it applies to veterans.\n\n\n                      Unanimous Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments and motion be laid aside to consider the McCain-Kerry-\nRockefeller-Bond-Campbell-Specter amendment relative to veterans and \nthat no further amendments or motions be in order prior to the vote. I \nfurther ask unanimous consent that the vote occur on, or in relation \nto, the amendment on Thursday morning, notwithstanding rule XXII.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n        Amendment No. 2446 to the Modified Committee Substitute\n\n (Purpose: To ensure funding for Veterans' Administration treatment of \n           tobacco-related illnesses, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself, Mr. \n     Kerry, Mr. Bond, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Rockefeller and Mr. \n     Specter, proposes an amendment numbered 2446 to the modified \n     committee substitute.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 403, beginning with line 3, strike through line 19 \n     on page 407, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1301. VETERANS' ADMINISTRATION TOBACCO-RELATED \n                   HEALTHCARE AND COMPENSATION PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Veterans' \n     Administration shall use amounts under subsection (b) to \n     carry out tobacco-related healthcare activities under chapter \n     17 of title 38, United States Code, and to provide other \n     appropriate assistance for tobacco-related veterans' health \n     care illnesses and disability under such title.\n       (b) Funding.--From amounts in the trust fund established \n     under section 400, not less than $600,000,000 per year are to \n     be used to carry out Veterans' Administration tobacco-related \n     healthcare activities under subsection (a) to the extent and \n     only in the amounts provided in advance in appropriations \n     Acts, to remain available until expended.\n       (c) Public Health Service Act Amendments.--Section 1981C of \n     the Public Health Service Act (as added by section 261 of \n     this Act) is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``veterans,'' after ``uninsured \n     individuals,'' in subsection (a)(1)(D); and\n       (2) by inserting ``veterans,'' in subsection (b)(1)(H) \n     after ``low-income,''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before I yield the floor, I want to say a \nword about Senator Bond especially who has done hard work on this \nissue.\n  He defended the issue in the Veterans' Affairs Committee, along with \nSenator Specter, Senator Rockefeller, and Senator Campbell. I am very \ngrateful for his efforts. And I know the veterans of Missouri as well \nas this Nation are deeply appreciative of his efforts. I also know that \nthe Senator from Missouri, and perhaps the Senator from Pennsylvania, \nand the Senator from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, may have \nadditional requirements in order to address this issue. And as he and I \nknow, this is just a beginning to try to address this problem.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Arizona. I am \ndelighted to join with him, with Senator Rockefeller, and with others, \nin proposing this fix, which in our judgment is compelling beyond \ndescription. I think the reactions that we received from members of the \nveterans community were to be expected and, frankly, were really an \nunfortunate consequence of some of the things that happen around here.\n  I think the veterans community had every right in the world to \nquestion whether people here had lost all sense of priority and all \nsense of connection to the kinds of commitments that we make along the \nway and certainly the good faith relationship between those who have \nserved their country and had a certain set of promises made to them--I \nmight add, not things that they requested originally, not things that \nwere the conditions automatically\n\n[[Page S5545]]\n\nof their service, but were, in a sense, the rewards to that service \ngiven at a time later on. And all of a sudden to find that, in the \nhurly-burly of the moment, people are so little connected to the \nmeaning of that service, that there is sort of a grab that takes place \nfor money for bridges and roads in the transit bill, to the exclusion \nof legitimately rightfully earned benefits that come as a consequence \nof serving the country, is really quite extraordinary. I think their \nanger was well placed and understandable.\n  I am pleased that this afternoon we are going to take sort of the \nlargest step we can take, in the context at least of this bill, but \nwhich will have a significant impact in redressing that by providing \nabout $600 million available each year over a 5-year basis to the \nVeterans' Administration for the use for smoking-related disease, \ncompensation and health care. I think that that is most appropriate.\n  I am delighted that the Senator from Arizona and I were able to get \nsort of a consensus to be able to immediately move to send a very clear \nmessage to the veterans community that the Senate recognizes what \noccurred and does not concur with that particular action and is moving \nnow to try to address it.\n  As we do that, Mr. President, I also--and I know my colleague from \nMissouri wants to speak, so I will not take a long time here--but I do \nwant to also highlight that the entire purpose of this legislation is \ngeared towards children and towards reducing the level of smoking in \nour society. I will have more to say about that in the course of the \nafternoon.\n  But I think it is critical that we remain focused on the smoking-\nrelated aspects of this legislation rather than some of the other \nattempts to sort of grab some of the revenue and use it for worthy but \nnevertheless nonrelated causes. And I think it is critical that we try \nto maintain the fundamental purpose of the legislation.\n\n  This morning, out on the swamp, we met with a young group of kids who \nwere part of Smoke-Free Efforts in America. Some 18 kids joined with a \nbipartisan group of Senators--Senator DeWine, Senator Chafee, Senator \nMcCain, Senator Kennedy, Senator Conrad, and other Democrats--and, \ntogether with these kids, the point that was trying to be made was that \nthere is only one reason that the U.S. Senate has come to the point of \nconsidering this tobacco legislation. That single point is to try to do \nthe best job we can to reduce the level of teenage smoking and \nultimately reducing the number of children who, when they become \nadults, will die early as a consequence of learning how and becoming \naddicted to smoking as teenagers, realizing that, of the 45 million \nAmericans who smoke and are fundamentally addicted to smoking, 86 \npercent of them started as teenagers.\n  That is the purpose that brings us to the floor. And for those who \nhave been concerned about costs, we will reiterate again and again and \nagain, the true tax on America is not the voluntary tax paid by \nsomebody who picks up a pack of cigarettes, it is the involuntary tax \npaid by millions of Americans to pay for the $80 billion a year of \nmedical costs for those who are smoking, and to pay for the 420,000 \npeople a year who die as a consequence of smoking-related diseases, and \nthe $25 billion of health care, under Medicaid and Medicare, that is \npicked up by everybody in the United States involuntarily in order to \npay for the results of a narcotic, killing substance that we allow to \nbe sold across the counter.\n  While we are not, obviously, prepared to stop that altogether, we \nknow enough about the addiction and enough about the downside of the \ndisease that we are prepared to have the FDA finally regulate it and we \nare prepared to try to minimize the exposure of our children to this \nkiller substance.\n  That is what this debate is about. It is not about some concoction on \nthe Senate floor to try to find additional revenue. Dr. Koop, Dr. \nKessler, the American Cancer Society, the American Lung Association, \nthe Treasury Department, a host of entities, have all agreed, the \nsingle best way to reduce the level of teenage smoking is to raise the \nprice. And, most importantly, the tobacco companies themselves have \nmade that statement clear in their own memoranda, in their own \ndocuments.\n  So that is what we are here for. That is what I hope the U.S. Senate \nwill accomplish.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment by \nSenator McCain and my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kerry.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Coverdell be added as a \ncosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. He sent a message in asking to be listed as a cosponsor.\n  I want to follow up on the comments of my distinguished friend from \nMassachusetts, a distinguished veteran himself. He talks about the \npurpose of this bill being to deter teenage smoking. And I believe that \nwe must keep our focus on that as the principal goal.\n  Personally, I believe that raising the price of cigarettes alone is \nnot going to be enough. I think we have to have advertising \nrestrictions and a counteradvertising campaign. But we also must have \nsanctions on teenagers. If it is illegal, and if they purchase--\nknowingly purchase--cigarettes in violation of the law, there ought to \nbe sanctions; there ought to be graduated sanctions. There ought to be \nsanctions that apply to their parents as well, because just raising the \nprice and putting burdens only on the sellers may make this a thrill-\nseeking opportunity for some teenagers. I believe that among the \namendments, we need to adopt that there be tougher sanctions on \nteenagers.\n\n  Let me address this amendment that Senator McCain and others have \npresented. I was one who strongly objected to the use of the particular \noffset from the veterans smoking program for the highway measure. I was \njoined in that by my colleague, Senator Specter, the chairman of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee. And as I think all our colleagues know, \nSenator Specter has been temporarily sidetracked with an operation. Our \nthoughts and prayers are with him and his family. We expect him to be \nback very shortly.\n  Before he left, he and I discussed the need to offer an amendment on \nthis measure to provide adequately for veterans health care issues. And \nthis is a very good start. I will want to confer with Senator Specter's \nstaff and others to find out what else we can do to make sure that the \nveterans of this country are adequately cared for in terms of their \nhealth care.\n  Let me go back and tell people where this came from, because a lot of \npeople were surprised when this became the offset. Well, this was the \noffset because it was insisted upon by the administration in its \nnegotiations with the Congress. The smoking program for veterans came \nabout as a result of an official in the Veterans' Administration, and \nyet the OMB and the White House said, ``We're not going to pursue this \nprogram.''\n  I have the pleasure and the responsibility of appropriating money for \nthe Veterans' Administration. And over the last several years, I have \nroutinely put more money in, with the support of my ranking member, \nSenator Mikulski. The committee, and the full committee, put in more \nmoney than has been recommended for veterans health care by the \nadministration to make sure we keep our word to the veterans to take \ncare of their health care needs. And in this instance, the White House \nhas told the Veterans' Administration not to proceed with the program. \nWhen the VA officials came before our committee, I asked them if they \nwere prepared to implement the program. They said they were not.\n  I asked what they needed. They suggested hundreds of millions of \ndollars in administrative costs to handle the claims. They said they \nwere not planning on administering the program.\n  So they started the program through the action of an official in the \nVeterans' Administration, and then the higher political authority said \nit was time to cut it off. In negotiations with the relevant committees \nin the House and the Senate, they said this must be the offset for the \nhighway bill. The highway bill was passed by both Houses and it was \ntime that we spent highway money on highways and transportation needs.\n  I do oppose the use of spending offsets from the veterans health care \nto pay for it under the budget rules, but\n\n[[Page S5546]]\n\nin this amendment, and perhaps in additional amendments, we will have \nan opportunity to restore from the proceeds of the tobacco taxes money \nbadly needed for veterans health care programs. We have met with the \nveterans budget group, the representatives of veterans who have \nsuggested about a billion a year in addition is needed for veterans \nhealth care programs. That is the target that Senator Specter and I \nhave. We will work to see if we can, through this piece of legislation, \nrestore funding for veterans health care to make sure that we do care \nfor our veterans.\n  Our veterans are going through a time of change. The veterans' needs \nare different. There is more need for outpatient facilities, more need \nfor veterans homes, more need for long-term care rather than acute \ncare. I commend Dr. Kizer, the head of the veterans health side, for \nhis extraordinarily strong efforts in spite of the difficulties posed \nin reforming the Veterans' Administration health care to make sure that \nthe health care being provided to the veterans is what they need.\n  There have been some tough measures taken. In my State, they cut off \nthe surgery center in one community on our southern border because they \nsaid they weren't doing enough surgeries to maintain proficiency. \nFrankly, this was not popular when you looked at it from the community \nas a whole. But I can tell you, the veterans who were to receive \nsurgery, and their families, are certainly better served if those \nveterans can be given that service in an area where they perform \nfrequent operations and maintain their proficiency. We have opened, \ninstead, veterans primary health care facilities around the State so \nveterans don't have to travel 100 or 150 miles one way to get primary \nhealth care.\n  I commend the Veterans' Administration for moving in the right \ndirection to make health care readily accessible to those veterans who \nare entitled to health care programs. We need to continue on that path. \nWe need to continue to see that we are providing the kind of health \ncare services in the location and in the format where they are most \nneeded. This amendment by Senator McCain is an excellent step in the \nright direction.\n  I will go back to work in an hour with the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee, which is having a meeting on the technical \ncorrections, because I agree with the comments of Senator McCain that \nputting phraseology about willful misconduct as it relates to cigarette \nsmoking is totally uncalled for. At this point, no one seems to be able \nto pinpoint the draftsmanship of it. But wherever it came from, it was \nwrong. I think it was wrong to take the money as an offset in the first \nplace. But it is certainly unacceptable for us to have a policy \nstatement saying that veterans who smoked the cigarettes that were \ngiven to them by the military--at smoking times designated by the \nmilitary when they turned the smoking light on, when they provided \ncigarettes, the C rations, when they provided cigarettes in smoking \nareas--to say they were doing something wrong when they took advantage \nof the cigarettes and smoked is not only nonsensical, it is outrageous. \nWe apologize to the veterans of America. We need to change that. That \nis totally unacceptable.\n\n  We hope by passing this amendment that we will begin to get the \nresources that are needed to the Veterans' Administration to provide \nfor the health care needs of our veteran population. The Veterans' \nAdministration is doing some wonderful things. They have made great \nadvances, treating injuries that came out of wartime. They are now \nbecoming more and more experienced and more skillful in dealing with \nproblems that aging veterans have. We do have a significant aging \nveterans population. That makes the localized, primary care facilities, \nprivately contracted health care clinics for veterans much more \naccessible and therefore convenient to veterans. We need to have these \nadditional resources available to the Veterans' Administration so we \ncan meet our commitment to the veterans and make sure that they receive \nthe kind of health care they have a right to expect and which we think \nthey have earned.\n  I appreciate very much the leadership that Senator McCain has \nprovided on this. With all of the other cosponsors, I am confident we \nwill have an opportunity to get a good, strong vote on behalf of this \nmeasure. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment when it comes \nbefore the Senate on Thursday. As I indicated, we will be conferring \nwith Senator Specter as he recuperates. I know he has strongly \nsupported veterans and wanted to be here for this amendment. We are \ndoing this in his behalf and will continue to work with him to provide \nadditional resources for veterans as and where we can find them and \nthey are necessary.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I know the Senator from North Dakota, \nSenator Conrad, is coming to the floor to take a few minutes to share \nsome thoughts with colleagues. But before he arrives, I just wanted to \ntake a minute to refocus some of the discussion that we had earlier \nthis morning, and perhaps in the waning hours of a week ago, and that \nis to address this question that has been raised by a number of \nopponents to the bill.\n  The tobacco industry is now spending multimillions of dollars across \nthe country. A number of colleagues heard in their home States their \nnames being mentioned in radio ads as opponents are being ginned up to \ntry to stop this bill. Americans should understand as they listen to \nthese advertisements.\n  I heard one of the advertisements that Dr. Koop is doing. Dr. Koop \nwisely asks every American to stop and consider the source of the \nadvertising against the bill. When you hear people talk about big tax \nor big Government, or to stop the big hand of Washington from reaching \nin, all of these things try to elicit a kind of primal response that \nmost of us have in America about politics and Washington and being told \nwhat to do, and so forth. It is all a very legitimate feeling, but the \ntobacco companies are trying to once again fake it with Americans. They \nare trying to once again cloak the reality of what is happening here. \nThey are, ironically, doing so even as they settle lawsuits in certain \nparts of the country that have them doing the very things that they are \nfighting us doing on a national basis.\n  Let me be more specific. In Minnesota, they have just come to a \nsettlement for literally billions of dollars over a number of years. \nThey have agreed to most of the terms that the attorney general was \nfighting for. They are going to engage in many of the programs that we \nare hearing colleagues come to the floor saying, no, no, no, don't do \nthat. But the tobacco companies are actually entering into agreements \nwith the attorneys general to do these very things. If you take the \namount of money that the tobacco companies have agreed to in these \nStates individually and you extrapolate that and apply it to the \nconcept of a national settlement, you in fact wind up with more money \nbeing raised and dispensed than we are trying to do in this \nlegislation.\n  So there is an enormous amount of duplicity--both duplicity, I \nsuppose, and hypocrisy in what the big tobacco companies are trying to \ndo. Dr. Koop says, ``Be wary of who is sponsoring these ads.'' When you \nhear the list of sponsors, you know that the very same people who told \nAmerica that they weren't selling an addictive substance, the very same \npeople who said to America, ``Oh no, no, no, we are not targeting young \npeople,'' are back again with a series of advertisements to try to \ndistort the debate.\n  The fact is that we have also heard a lot of focus about the cost of \nraising the tax on a pack of cigarettes, raising the fee on cigarettes, \na tax, or whatever you want to call it. The price of cigarettes go up; \nthat is the bottom line. The bottom line is that the cigarette \ncompanies themselves signed onto an agreement earlier in the summer, \nlast year, that would have wound up doing exactly that. They agreed to \nraise the price. And the reason they agreed to raise the price was \nbecause\n\n[[Page S5547]]\n\neverybody agreed that by raising the price, we would reduce the numbers \nof young people who would access cigarettes. We also know, according to \nevery analysis, that the more you raise the price--every 10 cents that \nyou raise the price, there is a 5 to 7-percent reduction in the numbers \nof kids who are smoking. So these are not pennies of taxes, these are \nlives of children that you are saving because we know that every 3,000 \nkids who get hooked on smoking every day, 1,000 of them are going to \ndie early.\n\n  We know that from the statistics. We know that 420,000 people die \nevery year of tobacco-related diseases. It is a phenomenal, staggering \nnumber of people. It is phenomenal enough that we lose something like \n58,000, I think it is, in traffic accidents, or due to driving under \nthe influence, and so forth, over a year in America. We are talking \nabout, five, six times that now that we lose, as a consequence, or six \nor seven times that that we lose as a consequence of smoking--every \nyear. And every one of those people don't just suddenly die without any \ncost, except in the case, I suppose, of those who have heart disease \nrelated to smoking and suffer a massive coronary. But for those \nsuffering from cancer of the larynx, or cancer of the throat, or cancer \nof the pancreas, or any of the forms of cancer, or kidney disease, \nwhich come from smoking, those are prolonged and very expensive \ndiseases.\n  We know to a certainty that people with those diseases are paying \nmany tens of thousands of dollars more than people who aren't suffering \nfrom those smoking-related diseases. The truth is also that many of \nthose people don't have health insurance, or many exhaust their health \ninsurance. Then what happens? Mr. President, then every single American \nis taxed. It is the tobacco tax; it is the unwanted, unasked-for \ntobacco tax in America that every single one of our citizens pays to \ncover the cost of the deaths, the cost in the loss of productivity, the \ncost of the health care--$80 billion a year--and the Medicare costs of \ntobacco-related disease alone, which is $24 billion; $24 billion is \nparceled out by Americans, right out of their pockets, to cover the \ncosts of other Americans smoking.\n  So we need to stay focused and understand that all of the 98.5 \nmillion American households are each paying the unwanted tobacco tax of \n$1,370 a year for smoking. That is the cost of not passing a tobacco \nbill. That is the cost of leaving the situation the way it is today.\n  America, if you want a tax cut, you want this bill passed because \nthis bill offers tax relief by reducing the numbers of young people who \nwill become smokers and, ultimately, the amount of our hospital and \nhealth care costs in this country. This is a tax cut bill. The only \npeople who pay an additional tax are voluntary. If you go and buy a \npack of cigarettes, which nobody is forcing you to do, you pay an \nadditional amount for that pack of cigarettes.\n  Now, they pay that amount in Canada. They pay that amount in Europe. \nWhen we finish raising the price of a pack of cigarettes in the United \nStates by the $1.10 that is in this bill, we will still be lower in the \ncost of a pack of cigarettes than some European countries. We will be \nat the mean, at the average of most European countries. That will \nreduce smuggling between the United States and Europe. It will equalize \nour payments, and it will allow us to do the other things that the \nSenator from Missouri, Mr. Bond, just said we need to do--the outreach \nprograms, the cessation programs, the counteradvertising programs, all \nof the things that buttress the raising of the price and help us create \na compliance rate in this country that is significant.\n  I must say also it is a known fact that cigarettes are a gateway \ndrug, and they are a gateway to marijuana or to other drugs. It is a \nknown fact, just as marijuana is a gateway drug to other drugs. So if \nyou want to deal with the drug problem that we have heard a number of \ncolleagues come to the floor and talk about, if you want to reduce the \ndramatic increase in the number of our young people smoking marijuana, \nthen this is a way to also begin. This is not just an anticigarette \nprogram. This is an antinarcotic substance program. It is an antidrug \nprogram. And the way you provide a comprehensive drug program--just ask \nGen. Barry McCafrey--is by having a comprehensive program on the demand \nside.\n  I saw today that Admiral Kramek, Commandant of the Coast Guard, just \nretired, and I have dealt with Admiral Kramek over the last years \nthrough the Commerce Committee on the Oceans Subcommittee. Year after \nyear, he would come before our committee as the Coast Guard has been \ncharged more and more with the responsibilities for dealing with drugs \nbut less and less money has been going to them, less and less capacity \nto do the greater amount of work on the demand side and interdiction \nside.\n  So here is an opportunity for us to do something further with respect \nto the overall drug policy of this country. If our young people can be \nthe beneficiaries of the kind of cessation and self-esteem programs \nthat are part of this effort and part of our States' efforts now, we \nhave a much greater hope of having young people who will be able to say \nno--not just say no to this narcotic, smoke that goes into their lungs, \nbut say no to the other narcotic smoke that goes into their lungs.\n  So this is a program that in our best estimate is a very significant \ntax reduction, long-term investment in the young people of our country. \nIt is a way to reduce the overall costs of smoking to our Nation. It is \ntime for the Senate to take that action which hopefully can resolve \nsome of the remaining issues that we have on this legislation.\n  I am very hopeful that we can work out an approach in a number of \nthose difficult areas that still remain so that we could rapidly move \nforward. I think there is a capacity to do that if Senators are \ndetermined to try to act in good faith, and that will obviously be the \ntest of the next days.\n  I see the Senator from North Dakota is now here, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for \nthe extraordinary leadership he has brought to this issue. The Commerce \nCommittee was given jurisdiction over this matter, and the Commerce \nCommittee reported out a good beginning, a bill that provided a floor \nfrom which we could move in this Chamber to strengthen the provisions \nthat were reported out of the Commerce Committee. Indeed, over a series \nof weeks, there was a negotiation between members of the Commerce \nCommittee and representatives of the White House, and others, to \nimprove what was reported out of the Commerce Committee, and, indeed, \nthis bill was improved and improved dramatically, and in no small \nmeasure because of the leadership of the Senator from Massachusetts, \nMr. Kerry. I want to recognize the tremendous contribution he has made \nto this legislation.\n  Mr. President, sometimes I think we get lost around here as to what \nthis bill is about. Some of our colleagues talk about this as a tax \nbill. They talk about it as every other kind of legislation other than \nwhat it really intends to do. This legislation is intended to protect \nthe public health and to reduce youth smoking. That is the fundamental \nreason for this bill.\n  I know it gets confusing because we have had some of our colleagues \nwho really are the apologists for the tobacco industry who are out here \ntrying to confuse the issue, and they are talking about every subject \nunder the sun other than protecting the public health and reducing \nyouth smoking. They are talking about all kinds of issues that are \nreally sideshows, and they are doing it to try to distract attention \nfrom the fundamental question: are we going to protect the public \nhealth? Are we going to do something serious about reducing youth \nsmoking? I think it is very simple. This debate is about kids, and it \nis about health. It is about stopping the tobacco industry's cynical \nattempt to hook our kids on a deadly and addictive product.\n  At the end of the day, the hard reality is this is the only legal \nproduct sold in this country when used as intended by the manufacturer \nthat addicts and kills its customers. That is harsh language, and I am \nnot somebody who is given to harsh language. I am a Scandanavian. We \nScandanavians typically do not talk in harsh terms. But after chairing \nthe task force on tobacco on our side of the aisle for 6 months, I must \nsay I have developed a very strong view about what this industry is \ndoing to our country and\n\n[[Page S5548]]\n\nwhat it is doing to our kids. That impression was indelibly changed by \nthe release of what had been secret documents, documents we had never \nseen before. Document after document after document, that were the \nindustry's own documents, revealed what they have been up to--what they \nknew and what they told the American people. And the two are at very \ngreat variance.\n  We all remember when the executives of the tobacco industry came \nbefore Congress and swore under oath that their products did not cause \nserious disease problems. They swore under oath that their products \nwere not addictive. They swore under oath that they had not targeted \nour children. And they asserted that they had never manipulated \nnicotine levels to further addict our kids.\n  Now, with the release of their documents, we now know that each and \nevery one of those claims, each and every one of those statements, was \nfalse. I do not know how else to say it. It is just as clear as it can \nbe. They did not tell the truth. The fact is they knew at the time they \nwere here swearing under oath that their products caused serious health \nproblems. They knew that they were targeting our kids. They knew that \ntheir products were addictive. In fact, in their internal memos they \ntalked about how important that was to the effectiveness of their \nvarious campaigns to children. The fact that their products were \naddictive strengthened their position financially. And it is now \nabsolutely clear from reading their documents that they knew they were \nmanipulating nicotine levels to further hook kids.\n  All these things are very clear. Let me just show you one chart. I \ndeveloped, after the work on this task force, the ``Top Ten Tobacco \nTall Tales,'' and the corresponding truths. No. 10, the tall tale told \nby the tobacco companies was they do not market to children. That is \nwhat they said. They came to my office and said, ``Oh, no, Senator, we \ndon't market to children; it is illegal to sell to children. There is \nno way we would condone marketing to kids.''\n  Well, the truth is from their own documents. This is from a Brown & \nWilliamson document that was released in the court actions, and I \nquote:\n\n       The studies reported on youngsters' motivation for \n     starting, their brand preferences, as well as the starting \n     behavior of children as young as 5 years old . . . the \n     studies examined . . . young smokers' attitudes towards \n     addiction, and contained multiple references to how very \n     young smokers at first believe they cannot become addicted, \n     only to later discover, to their regret, that they are.\n\n  These are their documents. I could speak a whole afternoon just from \ntheir documents. They are the most damning things that could be \npresented in this debate, because one document after another indicts \nthis industry. They have lied to the American people, and their own \nwords reveal it.\n  Why is it important to take on this battle and win it now? Let me \njust review a few of the facts on tobacco use and its cost to society. \nDespite decades of misinformation, there can be no question that \ntobacco imposes enormous costs on society. Some of our colleagues have \nsaid: Look, you are going to impose a regressive price increase on \nthose who are the customers. Mr. President, this industry has been \nimposing costs on all of us, and they have been doing it for a long \ntime. That is the hard reality.\n  First, there are the human costs. Obviously, they are the most \nimportant. Tobacco is the No. 1 preventable cause of death in America \ntoday. Mr. President, 425,000 of our fellow citizens die every year \nfrom tobacco-related illness. That is a fact. That is one tobacco-\nrelated death every 75 seconds. Every 75 seconds, somebody dies in this \ncountry because of tobacco-related illnesses. That is a fact. For each \nof those deaths, there are dozens of Americans who are struggling with \nterrifying illnesses and terrifying diagnoses from their habits and \ntheir lifetime of smoking addiction. There are dozens of friends and \nrelatives and loved ones who must also pay the price and experience the \npain caused by tobacco products.\n  Second, there are future costs. Three thousand children start smoking \nevery day in this country. One thousand of them will die prematurely \nfrom smoking-related illnesses. If we don't act to stop kids from \nstarting to smoke, we condemn those children to a future painful death. \nThey are not adults making a decision fully informed; they are subject \nto a massive advertising and marketing campaign by this industry, \ntargeted directly to them.\n  Make no mistake, that is precisely what this industry has done. \nAgain, their documents reveal that they have targeted teenagers, and \nthey have targeted them because they have understood they have to have \nreplacement smokers for the 425,000 of their customers who die every \nyear. They know it is best to get them when they are young. That is \nwhen kids are looking to rebel, looking to make a statement as to their \nmaturity. What better way than to take up the habit of smoking? That \nhas been the message of the tobacco industry, and they have done it \nknowingly. Make no mistake about it, they have done it absolutely \nknowing what they were doing, and the documents reveal it.\n  Third, there are the financial costs. The Treasury Department reports \nthat tobacco use costs American taxpayers $130 billion a year. We hear \nfrom our friends, some who are on the other side, who say: Wait a \nminute, if we increase the prices, it is going to impose a regressive \ntax on those who are the customers. How about all the folks in this \ncountry who are having costs imposed on them, $130 billion a year? They \ndidn't choose to have these costs. They didn't choose to pick up the \ntab for somebody's lung cancer. They didn't choose to pick up the tab \nto cover the cost because of lost productivity in this society. Those \ncosts are being imposed on them, and those are regressive, and they are \nfar higher than the health fee that we would be imposing here to \nredress the imbalance of $130 billion a year. That is what this \nindustry is costing America, and we are asking $18 billion or $20 \nbillion as a balancing mechanism, imposing a health fee to start to ask \nthis industry to bear a fairer share of the costs they are imposing on \nall the rest of us. That is not unreasonable or unfair.\n\n  Of the $130 billion a year of costs being imposed on American \ntaxpayers by this industry, $60 billion is direct health care costs--\nhigher costs for Medicare, higher costs for Medicaid, and for private \nhealth insurance. When we hear them say: Gee, you are going to raise \nthe prices, and that is going to be regressive and have an adverse \neffect on low-income people in this country--nothing could have a more \nregressive effect, nothing could have a more unfair result than \nsticking $130 billion in costs onto the American taxpayer, costs that \nare borne disproportionately by those with low incomes, because they \nare the ones who smoke the most. They are the ones who have most of the \nhealth-related disease. They are the ones who are disproportionately \npicking up the tab. These are costs that are borne by all taxpayers, \nand, as I say, it is time to redress the imbalance.\n  As I headed this task force, we heard from the victims. We had \nhearings all across the country, and we listened to the victims. I can \nremember so well a young woman named Gina Seagraves, who testified in \nNew Jersey about her mother dying at a young age, and what it did to \ntheir family, how devastating it was when her mother died, how it \nreally disrupted their entire family.\n  I remember very well a big, tough football coach who came and \ntestified. When he testified, you could barely hear him. He spoke in a \nvery raspy voice, and he spoke that way because, as he told the \ncommittee, he had developed cancer of the larynx, and when it was \ndiagnosed the doctor said, ``We have one chance to save your life, and \nthat's for you to undergo a laryngectomy and have your larynx taken \nout. And if we do not do it now, you are going to die.''\n  This big, tough football coach told us of the terror he felt when the \ndoctor looked across the examining table from him and told him, ``If we \ndon't operate, and operate now, you are going to die.'' He told us \nabout how he feels now when he goes back to the high school where he is \nalso the assistant principal, and he sees kids lighting up. He thinks \nto himself how much he had hoped that his story could prevent some of \nthem from taking up the habit, because he started when he was 14 or 15 \nyears old, was unable to quit, was addicted. He said: ``You know, if I \ncould just convince a few of these young people that they are going to \nsuffer the same fate\n\n[[Page S5549]]\n\nI did, maybe I could make a difference. Maybe I could prevent some of \nthe suffering that I have experienced.''\n  Those were not the only victims we heard from. We heard from a Mr. \nHarold Taylor, who testified that he began smoking when he was 15, \neventually developed cancer of the throat. His larynx and his vocal \ncords were removed, much like Mr. Fravenheim. The operation left a hole \nin his neck, and he will have to live with that for the rest of his \nlife. Because of that hole in his neck, he can never again breathe \nthrough his nose or mouth. He told what it is like to have this \nparticular disability. He has lost his sense of smell. He can no longer \nenjoy the smells that we take for granted. He said he always loved to \nwalk into his wife's kitchen and smell whatever was cooking there.\n  He walks in now and doesn't smell a thing. He has also lost his sense \nof taste. He has told us he is unable to distinguish between a bowl of \nspaghetti and a bowl of beans.\n  We also had the opportunity to hear from a Ms. Janet Sackman from \nLong Island, NY. Ms. Sackman had a successful modeling career. \nIronically, she was a model for the tobacco industry. That success had \na tremendous price. In 1983, she was diagnosed with cancer of the \nlarynx and had her vocal cord and larynx removed. She completely lost \nher ability to talk. She was only able to testify because she learned \nesophagal speech, which is very, very difficult.\n  She was encouraged by the company that hired her to take up smoking. \nIn fact, it was in her contract. They required her to take up smoking \nin order to be paid to be a model for the tobacco company for which she \nworked.\n  To listen to these victims is a powerful experience. This particular \nwoman's suffering has continued. In 1990, after being diagnosed with \nlung cancer, she had one-third of her lung removed. Again, this was a \nwoman who took up smoking not because she wanted to, but because she \nwas a Lucky Strike model, and Lucky Strike in her contract required her \nto take up smoking. She did, became addicted, and now has suffered \nthese incredible health threats.\n  A third witness, Mr. Alan Landers, was a Winston man, Winston \ncigarettes. He was a representative of the company. He was told to \nportray smoking as stylish, pleasurable, and attractive. Indeed, he is \na very handsome man, a very stylish man. He was required to smoke on \nthe set to achieve the correct appearance.\n  The tobacco industry did not tell Mr. Landers what they knew at the \ntime, because as early as the 1950s, tobacco industry scientists had \nalready established from their own research that smoking caused very \nserious health risks.\n  In 1987, Mr. Landers learned the true danger of cigarette smoking \nwhen he was diagnosed with lung cancer. Although 95 percent of lung \ncancer victims do not survive, Mr. Landers has had large sections of \nboth lungs removed and is suffering from emphysema, while he waits for \nhis day in court. I can tell you, Mr. Landers knows that his chances of \never getting to court are limited because he is under a death sentence.\n  I could go on and on talking about the victims from whom we heard. \nEveryplace we went, every community we visited, people came up to us \nand said, ``You know, my father died of a tobacco-related illness;'' \n``my mother,'' ``my aunt,'' ``my brother,'' ``my sister''--the \nemotional pain that is out there brought on by the use of these \nproducts is staggering.\n  I grew up in a family where virtually nobody smoked. My grandfather \ndid. He died at a ripe old age. I don't know if a tobacco-related \nillness was a part of his death, although I wouldn't be surprised if it \nwas. He was a heavy smoker. Of the others in my family, very few ever \ntook up the habit. But in traveling around the country, holding the \nhearings of this task force, we heard over and over and over of the \naddiction, disease, and death caused by these products.\n  Some have said, ``What are you going to do about it? What business \ndoes the Government have to do anything about this? The Government \nought to stay out of it. This is a personal decision whether somebody \nsmokes or not.'' That is true, it is a personal decision. But you know \nwhat? There is more than the individual involved, because this \nindustry, as I have described, is imposing enormous costs on all the \nrest of us. I chose not to smoke, but I am picking up the tab for those \nwho have chosen to smoke. Mr. President, $130 billion a year are the \ncosts that are being imposed by this industry--$130 billion, $60 \nbillion in direct health care costs every year--$60 billion; Medicare, \n$20 billion; Medicaid, $12 billion, $13 billion a year. We are paying \nfor costs imposed by that industry, and they are not covering the tab, \nmake no mistake about that.\n\n  That is the hard reality of what is occurring. If we want to do \nsomething about it--every witness who came before our committee said \nthere is no silver bullet, you have to have a comprehensive approach. \nYou have to do all kinds of different things to reduce the level of \nyouth smoking.\n  Why is youth smoking so important? Because we know that 90 percent of \nsmokers take up the habit before they are 19, about half before they \nare age 14. When somebody is not hooked when they are young, they \nprobably are not going to get hooked. That is in the tobacco industry \ndocuments. They knew they had to get people when they were young. They \nknew when somebody didn't start when they were young, they probably \nwere not going to take up the habit.\n  Some of the comments in the tobacco industry documents are startling. \nI remember one is: How are you going to get somebody to take up what is \nreally a dirty habit and unpleasant? You have to convince them that it \nis cool, you have to convince them that it shows maturity, that it is \nstylish.\n  The cynicism of this industry in trying to hook kids is really \nincredible. Here is a 1972 Brown and Williamson document:\n\n       It's a well-known fact that teenagers like sweet products. \n     Honey might be considered.\n\n  They are thinking about putting honey in cigarettes to attract \nteenagers.\n\n       Smoking a cigarette for the beginner is a symbolic act. I'm \n     no longer my mother's child. I'm tough. I'm an adventurer. \n     I'm not square. As the force from the psychological symbolism \n     subsides, the pharmacological effect takes over to sustain \n     the habit.\n\n  That was from a 1969 draft report to the board of directors of Philip \nMorris.\n  Here is a good one. When the industry comes up here and says, ``We \nnever targeted kids,'' this is a quote from a 1973 RJR marketing memo:\n\n       Comic-strip-type copy might get a much higher readership \n     among younger people than any other type of copy.\n\n  Talk about cynical; talk about people who are thinking about \nthemselves and didn't give a hoot what the effect was on somebody else. \nAnd they say they didn't target kids?\n  I have read the documents. Document after document shows they \ndirectly targeted kids as young as 12 years old. That is who they are \ngoing after. These Joe Camel ads, do you think they designed those to \ngo after adults? No, no, no. They designed those ads because they knew \nthat they were slipping among the youth market, and they were trying to \nfigure out a way to get to the kids. So they said comic-strip-type \nmight get a much higher readership among young people. That is where \nJoe Camel came from. How brilliant that strategy was. It really worked \nto hook kids.\n  Here is another 1973 Brown and Williamson memo:\n\n       Kool--\n\n  That is a brand--\n\n       Kool has shown little or no growth in the share of users in \n     the 26-plus-age group. Growth is from 16 to 25-year-olds. At \n     the present rate, a smoker in the 16 to 25-year-age group \n     will soon be three times as important to Kool as a prospect \n     in any other broad-age category.\n\n  You have to wonder what these people thought when they went home at \nnight after writing these memos, after coming up with these strategies, \nafter coming up with these marketing schemes to hook kids. I wonder if \nthey were proud of themselves when they went home at night.\n  Here is another 1973 memo from an RJR assistant director of research \nand development. And I quote:\n\n       Because brands of the new type continue to show vigorous \n     growth in sales; because a high proportion of beginning \n     smokers are learning to like Marlboro, the leading brand of \n     the new type; and because we have no current brand in this \n     newly identified, major\n\n[[Page S5550]]\n\n     segment of the market; it has become appropriate for us to \n     consider moving our present brands in the direction of the \n     new type of cigarette.\n\n  And why? Because they needed to hook beginning smokers. Well, it goes \non and on and on. The documents are so overwhelmingly clear.\n\n       Evidence is now available to indicate that the 14- to 18-\n     year-old [age] group is an increasing segment of the smoking \n     population. RJR-T[eam] must soon establish a successful new \n     brand in this market if our position in the industry is to be \n     maintained over the long term.\n\n  That is a 1976 draft report, ``Planning Assumptions and Forecast for \nthe Period 1977-1986 for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.''\n  ``Evidence is now available to indicate that the 14- to 18-year-old \n[age] group is an increasing segment of the smoking population'' and \nthey have to establish a successful brand there if they are going to be \nsuccessful.\n  Mr. President, I go back to the basic question: What do we do? We \nknow we have a problem. We know people are suffering from addiction, \ndisease and death. As I said earlier, every witness that came before us \nsaid you have to have a comprehensive approach. No single thing will \naddress this health threat, and that is what the McCain bill does. It \npursues exactly the sort of comprehensive approach that every public \nhealth expert has testified is necessary.\n  Yes, it contains price increases. And why? Because every study, every \npublic health expert has told us that price increases are the most \neffective thing to reduce consumption and use, especially important \namong young people. The studies indicate that for every 10-percent \nincrease in price, you get a corresponding 5- to 7-percent reduction in \nconsumption among youth.\n  These studies are consistent. They are clear. They are not done by \nthe tobacco companies. They are not done by the apologists for the \ntobacco companies. They are done by the scientific community. They are \ndone by the Congressional Research Service. They are done by the \nNational Institutes of Health. They are done by the American Cancer \nSociety, the American Lung Association. Those are the people that I \nintend to listen to in this debate.\n  I am not going to be listening to the sweet swan song of the tobacco \nlobby who, by the way, have hired virtually every lobbying firm in this \ntown. In fact, I am told they have hired a lobbying firm for every U.S. \nSenator. And I would not be surprised if it is true.\n  As you look at the list, they are spending hundreds of millions of \ndollars on this attempt--hundreds of millions of dollars to mislead the \nAmerican people; hundreds of millions of dollars to influence public \nopinion; hundreds of millions of dollars to try to fool people here in \nthe Congress of the United States.\n  I had a man call me from North Dakota the other day. He got on the \nphone with me, and he said, ``Senator, I'm against that tax bill.'' I \nsaid, ``What tax bill are you talking about?'' He said, ``I don't \nknow.'' He said, ``I had somebody call me and ask me if I was against \ntaxes. I told them I was, and he said, `I'll connect you with your \nSenator right away.' '' He said, ``I didn't even have to call. They \nconnected me to your office.'' And he did not even know what the bill \nwas about, but he knew he was against it because they asked him if he \nwas against taxes.\n\n  I tell you, these guys are shameless. They are shameless in what they \nhave said up here. They are shameless in the negotiating strategy they \npursued on this legislation, and they are shameless in what they are \nsaying to people trying to mislead them about this legislation.\n  This bill, sponsored by Senator McCain--yes, it contains price \nincreases because that is central to any strategy to actually reduce \nconsumption and to save people's lives. But it does much more than \nthat. It clarifies the Food and Drug Administration's authority to \nregulate advertising targeted to children. It gives the Food and Drug \nAdministration authority to regulate the manufacture and distribution \nof tobacco products, to protect children and reduce the ill-health \neffects associated with tobacco use. It includes provisions to reduce \nyouth access to tobacco products, including a requirement that States \nenact laws to make it illegal for minors to purchase or possess tobacco \nproducts.\n  It provides look-back surcharges to create an incentive for companies \nto stop targeting children and to hold those companies accountable that \nfail to reduce youth smoking of their brands. It requires document \ndisclosure.\n  Mr. President, an awful lot of what we have learned we have learned \nonly because of the Minnesota trial. I want to commend Attorney General \nHumphrey of Minnesota who was tough and determined and who won a \nmassive lawsuit against the tobacco industry. In winning that suit, he \nwas able to release millions of documents that formed the basis of our \nknowledge of what this industry has been doing. Thank goodness for what \nhe has accomplished because, as I say, I could read from these \ndocuments for days on end, these documents that indict this industry, \nbecause this industry knew that their products were killing people. \nThey absolutely knew their products were addictive. They absolutely \nknew that they were targeting kids and they absolutely knew that they \nwere manipulating nicotine levels to further--to further--hook \ncustomers.\n  It was written across the pages of these documents time after time \nafter time. There is no question, none, about what these guys were \ndoing. It was cynical. It was manipulative. And it was targeted at \nkids.\n  I have nothing against anybody that seeks to engage in a legal \nbusiness and make a profit. That is the American way. I am proud of \npeople that do that. I come from a business family myself. I am \neducated in business. But I tell you, to make your livelihood targeting \nkids for addiction and disease is not a very proud way to conduct \noneself. This industry was so incredibly cynical in the way they \noperated. They ought to be ashamed of themselves. They say now, well, \nthey have a new culture. Well, I tell you, I do not see it. I do not \nsee their new culture. I see them operating just as they have in the \npast.\n  I have indicated some of the provisions of this bill. There are \nothers, as well, that are important. Because this legislation also \nfunds tobacco control programs, including smoking cessation, \ncountertobacco advertising, smoking prevention, education and health \nresearch. You know, if there is nothing else that comes out of this--I \nhope we are able to discourage people from smoking--but I hope we are \nalso able to fund medical research to help the victims of the past. I \nhope we are able to do some things that will be positive for those that \nhave already suffered. I hope we are able to find the cure for cancer. \nI hope we are able to find a cure for emphysema or at least treatments \nthat can reduce the suffering of people who are inflicted.\n  But this bill does more than that. It also includes environmental \ntobacco smoke provisions to protect nonsmokers in public buildings \nbecause one of the things we have learned from the research of the \nindustry itself is that secondhand smokers also suffer. And what they \nsuffer is irreversible. We did not know that before. We used to think, \nwell, not just the smoker is going to be affected and be affected \nadversely. I think all of us knew for a long time that was the case. \nBut we probably did not realize that those of us who are around smokers \nalso are affected, and the way we are affected is irreversible. It \ncannot be improved. That is what the latest scientific evidence tells \nus.\n\n  So it is important to do something about limiting where smoking can \noccur so nonsmokers are not having imposed on them the health risks \nbecause somebody else has made a choice that they are going to smoke. \nThat is fine. That is their business. But it is not their business to \nhave an adverse effect on somebody else's health, and certainly not on \na child.\n  This legislation also provides generous assistance to tobacco farmers \nand their communities for the effect they will experience. Clearly, \nthis is a comprehensive approach. It is multifaceted because that is \nwhat the experts say is necessary. We don't need experts to tell us \nwhat will be effective here. I have heard from all the experts. They \ncame before our task force. We heard from hundreds of them. I respect \nthem. This is a matter of common sense. We don't need an expert to tell \nus if you raise the price, consumption goes down. That is Economics \n101. We don't need an expert to tell us if you do\n\n[[Page S5551]]\n\ncountertobacco advertising that warns people of the health risks of \ntobacco products, that will have an effect. Why else would the industry \nspend billions of dollars a year advertising tobacco products? Because \nthey know advertising works. Countertobacco advertising, we also know, \nwill be effective. And we also know you have to fund smoking cessation \nand smoking prevention programs, because that helps people.\n  Now, it is true that very few people are able to quit. Seventy \npercent of the smokers in America today say they want to quit. Only 2 \nor 3 percent a year are actually able to. That is because smoking is \naddictive. In fact, the testimony of the experts told us that smoking \naddiction is in the same class as cocaine addiction. We went to Brown \nUniversity and had a hearing there. We had an addiction expert come \nbefore us. He said, if you think a smoking addiction is something easy \nto escape, but you think cocaine addiction is hard, don't be fooled, \ndon't be misled. Because the fact is the one is as difficult as the \nother.\n  I will talk a little more about the look-back provisions because that \nis the pending business before the U.S. Senate. We may have forgotten \nthat around here, but that is the pending business. That is the \nbusiness before this body, the look-back provisions of this bill.\n  Before I go into that, I want to talk about an issue that has been \nraised several times by the opponents of this legislation. That is the \neffect of the bill on low-income people. It is very interesting around \nhere to hear those who are the chief defenders of the tobacco industry \nall of a sudden develop a new-found concern for lower-income Americans. \nI must say, I would be more persuaded by their concern if many of those \nsame people had not spent most of their Senate careers opposing the \nminimum wages, opposing the earned-income tax credit, and opposing \nother measures that would help low-income, working Americans. I would \nbe more persuaded if these same Senators had not spent much of their \ntime in the Senate pushing for special tax breaks, tax giveaways and \ntax loopholes for the wealthiest among us at the expense of programs \nthat benefit lower-income Americans.\n  Before I talk further about the so-called regressive impact of this \nlegislation, I just want to point out that inaction imposes a cruel tax \non low-income Americans. The tobacco industry has deliberately targeted \nlower-income Americans as its customers. In fact, they are \ndisproportionately the customers of the tobacco industry. They have \ngone after that low-income market. They have succeeded. And this \nindustry that all of a sudden is so concerned about low-income \nAmericans has charged them rates of profit that are three times the \nlevel of profit in the consumer goods industry in America today. The \nprofit margins in tobacco are 30 percent--triple the profit margins of \nother consumer goods industries in America today. If they are so \nconcerned about low-income Americans in the tobacco industry, why don't \nthey cut their profits if that is their concern. That is not their \nconcern. Who are they kidding? Their concern is their bottom line. That \nis their children. And it comes out in every document that has been \nrevealed in these court proceedings. They aren't concerned about low-\nincome Americans other than trying to hook them, addict them, and let \nthem suffer the consequences of disease and death that accompany the \nuse of these products.\n\n  The simple fact is that a failure to act will kill low-income \nAmericans and their children in disproportionate numbers. The Senators \nwho now say they are concerned for low-income Americans are nowhere to \nbe found when we talk about protecting children or providing cessation \nprograms for low-income Americans. Instead, they spend their time \ntalking about the costs that this legislation will impose on lower-\nincome Americans. They completely leave out the rest of the story--the \nfact that lower-income Americans will disproportionately benefit from \nthis legislation.\n  The facts are that this legislation will reduce costs on low-income \nAmericans more than it will increase costs on them. First, the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has concluded that the income \ndistribution tables our opponents have been using exaggerate the \neffects on lower-income people. The fact is that people's incomes are \nnot the same throughout their lives, and their expenditure patterns \nreflect that. Opponents also count on what we see as a claim that this \nlegislation will hurt lower-income people because study after study has \nshown that lower-income smokers are much more likely to respond to a \nprice increase by quitting or reducing their use of tobacco products.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated the price increase will \nreduce average consumption of tobacco products by about a third. That \nmeans that lower-income Americans will reduce their consumption by even \nmore than a third. So they will actually reduce their overall spending \non tobacco products, and for every dollar they pay in increased costs \nfor each pack of cigarettes, they will save more than $1 by purchasing \nfewer packs.\n  Third, the health benefits of reduction in smoking will be largest \nfor low-income populations. By not smoking, lower-income Americans can \nreduce their lifetime health costs by $14,000, on average, because \nlower-income people are the least likely to have health insurance. The \ndirect health cost benefits to reducing smoking will go \ndisproportionately to lower-income Americans.\n  Finally, the main focus is, and should be, on our children. Lower-\nincome Americans love their children just like every other American \nloves theirs. They want to make certain that their children get a \nhealthy start in life. I don't believe they will say that a few hundred \ndollars is too much to pay to ensure that their kids don't get addicted \nto these deadly products.\n  The bottom line, nobody is going to pay the increased fees associated \nwith this bill unless they decide to go to the counter and buy these \nproducts. There is nobody saying you have to buy cigarettes in America. \nNobody has to pay this additional fee unless they decide they want to, \nunless they decide they are going to buy cigarette products. You only \npay it if you buy the product. Frankly, if you buy the product, you \nought to pay it because otherwise you are imposing costs on everybody \nelse in society. Mr. President, $130 billion a year is what is being \ntaken out of this society by the use of these products.\n  I will, at a later time, talk about the pending amendment, the \nDurbin-DeWine amendment, but I think at this point I am going to turn \nit back to the Senator from Arizona, Senator McCain, and again thank \nhim for his leadership. His courage and his character shine through in \nthis entire debate. I want to thank him very much for his leadership.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, again, I thank my friend from North Dakota \nfor his kind remarks and for all his effort on behalf of the young \npeople of America. I am very appreciative. I tell my friend from North \nDakota that I think we will prevail on this issue.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2446, As Modified\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment will be so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2446), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 407, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1302. VETERANS' ADMINISTRATION TOBACCO-RELATED \n                   HEALTHCARE AND COMPENSATION PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of the Veterans' \n     Administration shall use amounts under subsection (b) to \n     carry out tobacco-related healthcare activities under chapter \n     17 of title 38, United States Code, and to provide other \n     appropriate assistance for tobacco-related veterans' health \n     care illnesses and disability under such title.\n       (b) Funding.--From amounts in the trust fund established \n     under section 400, not less than $600,000 per year are to be \n     used to carry out Veterans' Administration tobacco-related \n     healthcare activities under subsection (a) to the extent and \n     only in the amounts provided in advance in appropriations \n     Acts, to remain available until expended.\n       (c) Public Health Service Act Amendments.--Section 1981C of \n     the Public Health Service Act (as added by section 261 of \n     this Act) is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``veterans,'' after ``uninsured \n     individuals,'' in subsection (a)(1)(D); and\n       (2) by inserting ``veterans,'' in subsection (b)(1)(H) \n     after ``low-income,''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/02/senate-section/article/S5541-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5551-S5564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY ACT OF 1997--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 4 p.m. \nhaving arrived, there will now be 2 hours of debate, equally divided \nbetween the proponents and opponents of H.R. 1270.\n\n[[Page S5552]]\n\n  Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Nevada be allowed to control the time under the agreement with \nSenator Bumpers, the senior Senator from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, will be \nconsidered as controlling time on his side.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that floor \nprivileges be extended to Bob Perret during the debate to follow \nregarding H.R. 1270.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. If the Senator will yield, I ask unanimous consent that \nPolly Synk be granted the privilege of the floor for the purposes of \nthe following debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. President, this Congress, especially the House of \nRepresentatives, has been referred to as the ``do-nothing House,'' or \nthe ``do-nothing Congress.'' Today, this debate will only add to the \nfact that it is a do-nothing Congress; it is a do-nothing House of \nRepresentatives.\n  The House is rarely in session. They vote sparingly and very \npointedly. Campaign finance was only brought up following the \nculmination of a campaign to have a discharge petition filed, which \nforced action on that issue. This issue here today is part of the aura \nof a do-nothing Congress. We have the fact that this legislation--\ninterim storage of nuclear waste--is an absolute waste of everyone's \ntime. The President has said on numerous occasions that he will veto \nthis legislation. We have had votes on this Senate floor that indicate, \nwithout any reservation or hesitation, that we have sufficient votes to \nmake sure that the President's veto is sustained.\n  In addition, we have the incomprehensible development that the \nSpeaker of the House of Representatives has stated that nuclear waste \nis dead in this Congress, that he won't touch nuclear waste. Well, I \nsay, what are we doing? The President has said that he will veto this \nlegislation. The Speaker of the House of Representatives has said that \nhe won't allow nuclear waste legislation to move in the House of \nRepresentatives this year. It seems very difficult to me why we are \nmoving forward on this. I finally figured out a reason; I am told--\ntobacco. Are we moving forward on this legislation so that there will \nbe nothing happening with the tobacco bill? I seem to have hit the nail \non the head.\n\n  The fact that this legislation stands absolutely no chance is because \nthe President said he will veto it and there are enough votes, as \nproven on the Senator floor, that the veto will be sustained. Only \nyesterday, the Speaker of the House of Representatives said that \nnuclear waste is dead. Then there must be a reason. That reason is \nthere is a movement to stop tobacco legislation.\n  Mr. President, this is a rip-off, this is a payoff for the tobacco \nindustry. They simply want to continue having kids smoke. They know \nthat every day 3,000 kids are locked in and addicted to cigarettes--\n3,000 every day. Every day we waste in this Congress on something other \nthan tobacco, we are addicting 3,000 children. Should we not be \ninvesting in public health research and programs to help smokers quit \nand protect tobacco farmers and their communities? Obviously, Mr. \nPresident, that issue has taken second fiddle to the big stall. Kids \nare most vulnerable to tobacco company tactics, and we all know that. \nWe know that tobacco companies have, for decades, targeted kids because \nthey are the most vulnerable to nicotine addiction and the most easily \naffected by the slick advertising and promotional ploys. Joe Camel just \ndidn't show up in the middle of the night. This was done in the \nboardrooms of the tobacco industry. ``What can we do to addict \nchildren, kids? We will come up with something that will be as \nnoticeable and identifiable as Bugs Bunny or Mickey Mouse.'' And they \nhave done it. Joe Camel is more noticeable than those.\n  So the evidence is overwhelming that smoking is a pediatric disease; \nit is a disease that affects kids. Almost 90 percent--that is a slight \nexaggeration--89 percent of all people who try a cigarette try one by \nage 18. Virtually nobody starts smoking during adulthood--no one. Of \nthe people who have ever smoked on a daily basis, 71 percent were \nsmoking by the age of 18. Now, if Joe Camel isn't enough \nidentification, realize that almost 37 percent of children in high \nschools throughout America smoke cigarettes. Don't we have an \nobligation to move forward on this legislation? The answer is yes. I \nrepeat, 3,000 kids start smoking every day. Is this a pediatric \ndisease? Of course it is. Mr. President, it is extremely important that \neveryone understand that this is nothing more than a transparent effort \nto kill the tobacco bill.\n  Today, the majority is setting out to reward two very powerful \nindustries--big tobacco and nuclear utilities. I think there are other \nparties we should be concerned about. Why should we not be rewarding \nchildren--3,000 children a day? That seems to be a little better \nmotive. But, no, the majority is setting out today to reward big \ntobacco and the nuclear utility lobby.\n  By invoking cloture on the motion to proceed, the Senate is taking \nthe anti-teen-smoking bill off the floor, period. We must not vote to \ninvoke cloture. Literally, without being overdramatic, Mr. President, \nby voting to invoke cloture we are signing the death warrants for kids \nin America. Adults don't start smoking, kids start smoking; the tobacco \ncompanies know that. For every day we stall this legislation, we have \nsigned death warrants for kids.\n  Mr. President, a number of years ago, my wife was in a hospital. She \nhad been there for quite a long period of time. Finally, we had no \nalternative, and she had to have some very extensive surgery. The \nsurgery took a lot longer than we thought it was going to take or \nshould have taken. We were very worried. We were waiting in the room \nwhere loved ones wait while these traumatic things go on. A physician \nwalked into the room--somebody we had never seen before--and he said, \n``I am a cardiologist. During surgery, your wife's heart \nmalfunctioned.'' Then, without a second breath, he said, ``but we are \nnot worried because she is not a smoker.'' Doesn't that say it all? Why \ndon't we in this body vote for the children of America and not invoke \ncloture?\n  Mr. President, we are talking about terrorism sweeping this country. \nToday, this is legislative terrorism. We are being asked to support big \ntobacco and nuclear utilities and, in effect, voting against kids. When \nit is all over and done with, I think we are not going to find people \nvoting with big tobacco and utilities.\n\n  Now, we do not have a lot of time, Mr. President, in the presentation \nthat we have, to get into a lot of the merits of this legislation, that \nis, the underlying legislation. We will have ample time to do that, and \neveryone knows that if cloture is not invoked, the Senators from Nevada \nwill be involved in their own legislative terrorism; that is, we feel \nso strongly about this, as does the environmental community of America, \nthat we are going to do everything we can to protect the health and \nsafety of people in this country--not only the people of the State of \nNevada but the people of this country.\n  Let me just close this part of my presentation by saying that the \nEnergy and Water Subcommittee held a hearing. I, frankly, was involved \nin other things. And the Senator, the senior Senator from New Mexico, \nspent a great deal of time working on setting up this very interesting \nset of hearings. Testimony took place last month, the middle of last \nmonth. We had a number of very important people testifying on nuclear \ntechnology but, interestingly enough, they all said that spent nuclear \nfuel--that is what we are talking about here--should be stored on-site.\n  For example, Dr. Richard Wilson was one of those who testified. He is \na professor of physics at Harvard University. He is the lead physics \nprofessor at Harvard University. I have a direct quote:\n\n       There is no doubt in my mind that the waste from a power \n     plant is much safer than operating a power plant, and you can \n     put it next to a power plant as we are doing in some places \n     without appreciably increasing any risk to anybody.\n\n  I had that confirmed on a number of other occasions during that \nhearing that took place.\n\n[[Page S5553]]\n\n  Mr. President, in short, we cannot, today, reward tobacco and the \nnuclear utilities. They have a cabal here to defeat tobacco \nlegislation, recognizing that nuclear waste legislation is all through \nanyway; the President has said he will veto it. We have enough votes to \nsustain the veto. The Speaker of the House has said that he is not \ngoing to move that legislation. It seems pretty clear to me today's \nissue here before this body is a gesture in futility.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in order to make this perfectly clear, I do \nhave a unanimous-consent request that would accommodate my desire on \nbehalf of the Senate to have a vote on this very important nuclear \nwaste issue and then return to the pending business, the tobacco bill. \nSo I do want to ask unanimous consent--and I am not propounding it \nright now--that would say that once we have this vote, notwithstanding \nrule XXII, with respect to the nuclear waste bill, we would come back \nto the tobacco bill.\n  This is not in any way intended to delay or to drag out the tobacco \nbill. There is nobody here, I do not believe, who would not like to see \nus find a way to deal with the tobacco issue and move on. At the same \ntime, as the majority leader, I have to continue doing things as we go \nalong. We have some Executive Calendar things we want to vote on. We \nhave some other bills that I believe Senators on both sides might agree \nthat we want to do as we go along. We have to think about the \nappropriations bills next week, beginning to move those appropriations \nbills.\n\n  The thing with the nuclear waste issue, the way it comes to us, \nbecause the issue was blue-slipped in the House, or the objections \nbecause we did it before they did it in the House, we have to go \nthrough a series of hoops that take time so that we can take action on \nnuclear waste and then go on about our business on the tobacco bill or \ndefense bill, whatever it may be. So my purpose here is to get this \nissue started, and then, after we have a vote, go on back to the \ntobacco bill. So that is the intent here.\n  I would ask unanimous consent that it be in order for the majority \nleader, after notification of the Democratic leader, to resume \nconsideration of the tobacco bill notwithstanding rule XXII with \nrespect to the nuclear waste bill.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I object.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the majority leader's intent \nas he has expressed it and the unanimous consent request. As he knows, \ntaking this action would actually put the tobacco bill back on the \ncalendar, and it would then subject the leadership to a request to take \nthe bill off the calendar once again and move the legislation. We would \nhave to get either unanimous consent to move the bill or we would have \nto make a motion to proceed back to the tobacco bill. So this is a \nvery, very difficult parliamentary challenge.\n  Obviously, we are in a very different set of circumstances if this \nunanimous consent request would go into effect. It would put us at the \nmercy of every single opponent of the tobacco bill. They know that. I \ngive the majority leader great credit for attempting to try to expedite \nour legislative calendar. There are a lot of things we should be doing. \nBut I will not subject this tobacco bill to the fate that would be \ndestined this legislation if we were to require that we be at the mercy \nof every opponent of the tobacco bill when we want to bring it back.\n  I would ask unanimous consent, reserving the right to object, that \nregardless of the outcome, the Senate resume consideration of the \ntobacco bill and remain on the bill until its completion.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator withhold so we can clarify this?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader has the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could just clarify, the Senator did not object; he was \nreserving his right to object to my request. Did you propound a \nmodification to that?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I did propound a modification.\n  Mr. LOTT. Then I believe the correct thing would be for me to reserve \nmy right to object to his modification of my unanimous consent request.\n  The alternative here is to have the vote on the nuclear waste cloture \nmotion on the motion to proceed, and if we get cloture, we are on the \nnuclear waste bill. If the unanimous consent that I propounded is \naccepted, we could set that aside and come on back to the tobacco bill.\n  The problem I have with the addition that the Senator has propounded \nhere that we remain on the tobacco bill until it is completed is that \nwe don't know whether that would be a day, a week, or a month. I know \nthat there is other work we will need to get done over a period of days \nand weeks and that we could, in fact, continue to work on the tobacco \nbill.\n  For instance, there is a meeting that will be occurring here in the \nnext few minutes. Senator Daschle is familiar with it. Senator McCain, \nSenator Gramm, Democrats and Republicans, are going to be involved in \nthat meeting at 4:30. You need a little time sometimes to work out an \nagreement, a compromise even.\n  Under this agreement, we wouldn't be able to set it aside and go to \nany other issue. So that is all I am saying. We have a lot of work we \nneed to get done during the month of June. It is going to take a lot of \ncooperation. The tobacco bill is on the agenda. My intent is for us to \ncontinue to make progress on it but not to the exclusion of everything \nelse. So I would object to the modification.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. LOTT. I withhold but I do object. I object to the modification.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Presiding Officer rules that since the \nmajority leader has the floor, the minority leader reserved the right \nto object and his unanimous consent will be construed to be a request \nof the majority leader to amend his unanimous consent request to \ninclude that of the Democratic leader.\n  The Chair gathers the majority leader has declined to do so.\n  Mr. LOTT. I do, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader has still reserved the \nright to object to the majority leader's unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the President for that clarification and his \ninterpretation of what has just been presented to him.\n  Mr. President, I have heard the majority leader on many occasions \ncome to this floor and make an impassioned speech to all of our \ncolleagues that we are going to stay on this bill until we get it done. \nI heard him say that eloquently and passionately on NATO. I heard him \nsay that when we talked about the budget. I heard him say that when we \ntalked about the Coverdell bill. I have heard him say that on so many \noccasions this year--we are going to stay on this piece of legislation \nuntil we get it done because we have to finish it so we can move on.\n  I do not want to misinterpret his remarks. I know he would like to \nsee some completion of the tobacco bill. I just wish he and our \ncolleagues would show the same passion and resolve to finish this bill \nso that we can move on. That is all we are asking. Let's move on to \nother pieces of legislation once we have completed our work on this. \nThis is an open invitation to go off of this legislation, move on to \nother things, and, oh, by the way, if there is time, and if my \nDemocratic colleagues play their cards right and behave, we will \nprobably have a chance to come back to tobacco.\n\n  That is the problem. I want very much to make this month as \nproductive as the last month was. But you know how it was productive? \nIt was productive when we said we were going to stay on a bill until we \nfinished it. We finished the highway bill. We finished the technical \nbills. We finished an array of pieces of legislation because we showed \nsome focus and we resolved to stay on that legislation until it was \ncompleted. That is what we are asking here. Let's stay on this bill\n\n[[Page S5554]]\n\nuntil it is done, and then let's move on to the array of other pieces \non the calendar that have to be addressed, too.\n  So because we fail to do that, unfortunately, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? Who yields time? The \nSenator from Alaska.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I just want to take 1 minute.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I defer.\n  Mr. REID. I also want to say I have the greatest respect for the \nleader, and of course the Democratic leader also. But I have to say, \nunless cloture is not invoked, the Senators from Nevada are going to \nhave a lot to say about what goes on on this floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me try to clarify where we stand. \nWhat we have pending is the nuclear waste bill, the motion to proceed. \nThe cloture vote is set at 6 p.m. That is cloture to H.R. 1270. After \ncloture, if we prevail I will introduce an amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute, which will be S. 104, and that is the bill that passed this \nbody. I propose to include in the substitute the Bingaman amendment. I \nknow this is very important to a number on the other side of the aisle.\n  Let me be clear about another matter. The idea of mixing resolution \nof the tobacco legislation with nuclear waste--that is a chemical \ncompound that simply does not mix.\n  The nuclear waste bill has been before this body previously, and I \nwould like to recount a little history of S. 104, the Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act of 1997. It passed this body 65 to 34; 53 Republicans voted \nfor it as did 12 Democrats, specifically: Senator Cleland, Senator \nGraham, Senator Harkin, Senator Hollings, Senator Johnson, Senator \nKohl, Senator Leahy, Senator Levin, Senator Moseley-Braun, Senator \nMurray, Senator Robb, Senator Wyden.\n  It is my understanding that somehow, in the minds of some, by voting \nfor cloture we are somehow setting aside our responsibility to address \nand resolve the tobacco issue. You have heard the generalization that \nby prolonging this effort to resolve the tobacco legislation, we are \nhastening the number of young people who will initiate the use of \ntobacco. Mr. President, we had a vacation. We had a week off for the \nMemorial recess. We have lost yesterday. We have lost today. The point \nis, at some point in time the nuclear waste policy matter has to be \nresolved by this body. The fact that we have voted 65 to 34 previously \non the issue, and the leadership has indicated a willingness to take it \nup today and set aside the tobacco bill--and further, make no mistake, \nit is the leader's intention to go back to the tobacco bill. As a \nmatter of fact, he proposed a unanimous consent request that was \nobjected to. So clearly the intention of the leadership on the \nRepublican side is to proceed with tobacco. But there is a lot going on \nto resolve the tobacco issue and there will be a lot more time taken in \norder to reach a conclusion that is satisfactory to this body. So let's \nbe realistic and recognize that today belongs to the issue of nuclear \nwaste. The Senate has an obligation to resolve this issue, to vote for \ncloture. After cloture, set it aside, go back to the tobacco bill, and \nthen come back on the issue of nuclear waste.\n\n  Make no mistake about it. There is a lot of politics involved in this \nbill. I know what is going on in Nevada. There is an eager House Member \nwho has issued a press release relative to the attitude of the House. I \nam not going to go down that particular avenue. But it is fair to say \nthe politics in Nevada is against a nuclear waste site in that State. \nBut to be realistic, nobody wants to have nuclear waste in their State. \nYet 65 Members of this body voted on August 15, 1997, to put the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act in order and designate Yucca Mountain to be a \nsite for an interim facility. Furthermore, as passed, S. 104 set \ndeadlines for the Department of Energy to meet its contractual \nobligations to accept and store at a single permanent repository the \nnuclear waste generated at the commercial nuclear power industry site \nthat will be used to store all Federal nuclear waste. Congress selected \nYucca Mountain, NV, as the site to be considered for the repository.\n  So there you have it. You have a situation where we have designated \nan area. We have expressed, by a vote of 65 to 34, the attitude of this \nbody. Now we are seeking cloture so we can proceed with the obligation \nto address and resolve this.\n  So what is a ``yes'' vote for? Mr. President, a ``yes'' vote is for \nstorage of nuclear waste at one, safe, Government-controlled site; \nresponsible action to meet the Government's obligation to take our \nnuclear waste after collecting $14 billion from the consumers of \nelectricity in this country. Currently, the Government is in violation \nof its contractual commitments to the nuclear waste industry. The suits \nthat are pending on this could cost the taxpayers somewhere between \n$60- and $80 billion because the Government was supposed to take the \nwaste beginning this year. What we are attempting to do with this \nlegislation is address the responsibility, with finality, for the \nGovernment to deliver on its commitments. Also, as we address global \nwarming, the Kyoto accord, and other concerns, there is definitely a \nrole for the nuclear power industry from the standpoint of its \ncontribution to air quality. Nuclear energy provides clean air.\n  What does a ``no'' vote do for us? Storing high-level waste in over \n80 sites instead of one site is what a ``no'' vote does for us. It is a \ncontinuation of a breach of contract that will cost the taxpayers, as I \nhave said, untold dollars in damages, an estimated $60- to $80 billion. \nIt will basically eliminate our largest single source of emission-free \npower, and it will result in moving over to another alternative which \nis not clean, in the sense of nuclear power.\n  Today's vote is an opportunity for triumph, if you will. It is the \nissue of safety of people over politics. A successful vote today will \nallow us to consider and adopt a bill that will lead us to a safer \nfuture for all Americans.\n  As we look at the history of this, as I have said, we passed this \nbill by large margins, bipartisan margins. The House passed the \nunderlying bill with 307 votes. There you have a pretty good idea of \nthe attitude in the House.\n  It would be the height of irresponsibility to let our process down at \nthis time, and obviously, as we look to our environmental concerns, to \nnot have an answer to our high-level waste problem is basically a cop-\nout on our responsibility.\n  We have, as the map on the right indicates, a number of sites around \nthe country. Forty States are affected, Mr. President. There are 80 \nsites in the 40 States. This is in addition to the waste stored at the \nDepartment of Energy waste disposal facility.\n  What we have is waste being stored in the backyard of constituents, \nyoung and old, across the country, near our neighborhoods, near our \nschools. Each year that goes by, our ability to continue storage of \nnuclear waste at each of these sites in a safe and responsible way is \ndiminished. Why, Mr. President? Because many of these sites are filling \nup. They are designed for a certain capacity of nuclear waste and in \nmany of those pools, at reactor sites, we are seeing storage up to its \nmaximum-designed capacity.\n  As I have indicated, the Government agreed to take that waste \nbeginning this year, in 1998, but it can't fulfill its contractual \nobligation, and that is a contractual obligation of every Member of \nthis body to address the responsibility of the ratepayers who have paid \nin $14 billion. It is irresponsible to let this situation continue. I \nfor one am not going to let that happen.\n  Again, I would like to identify in my State of Alaska I don't have a \nconstituency associated with nuclear power or nuclear waste, but it is \nan obligation that I have as committee chairman and that we have as \nMembers of this body who struggled with this issue of nuclear waste for \nmore than a decade.\n  Let me display a chart that shows the payments that have been made by \neach State. Here is what the electric consumers of the United States \nhave contributed over the years to take care of nuclear waste beginning \nthis year. There they are, Mr. President, in millions of dollars. They \ntotal $14 billion. They are asking for this Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives to mandate the removal of the waste as a consequence of \nwhat they have paid in so\n\n[[Page S5555]]\n\nthat the waste can safely be stored in Nevada. The U.S. Court of \nAppeals has ruled that the Department of Energy has an obligation to \ntake possession of this waste in 1998 whether or not a repository is \nready. Last November, the court ordered the Department of Energy to pay \ncontractual damages.\n  I told you those contractual damages are estimated to be up to $80 \nbillion of taxpayers' money, unless we address our obligation to put \nthis waste out in the desert in Nevada. Neither the consumers nor the \ntaxpayers deserve to bear the cost of the Government's failure.\n  The administration has simply ducked this issue. They don't want to \ndeal with it on their watch. They just as soon have the nuclear waste \nissue be resolved by somebody else at another time, regardless of the \nliability to the taxpayers, regardless of the fact that the ratepayers \nhave paid in the $14 billion.\n\n  Mr. President, we are here today trying again to address a \nresponsible resolve, and to adopt a responsible resolve, we are going \nto have to get on the bill. This is a motion to proceed to the bill. \nThat is all it is.\n  Again, I reflect on the opening statements of my colleagues on the \nother side relative to tying this to the tobacco issue. Tobacco is \ncomplex enough without mixing it with nuclear waste. It doesn't belong \nthere, and we have the obligation now to address it.\n  The statement of the administration bases its objections on a \nmisreading of the bill and a disregard for the reality of the Federal \nGovernment's obligation to take the waste beginning in 1998. The \nadministration claims it cares about clean air and preventing climate \nchange.\n  Currently, 22 percent of our electric power is generated by nuclear \nenergy. This is emission-free nuclear energy. The Department of \nEnergy's information administration says the Kyoto treaty would require \na 41-percent reduction of CO2 emissions from a predicted \nlevel in the year 2008 to 2012. Keep in mind, this administration isn't \ngoing to be here in the year 2008 to 2012.\n  How do you get there from here in the Kyoto accord without the \nnuclear industry? You don't. You can't. There are no new emission-free \nsources that can economically take the place of nuclear energy. For the \nmoment, we can forget about the Kyoto treaty and think about the \npresent, the present time. Between 1990 and 1995, 37 percent of the \nsulfur dioxide reductions required by the Clean Air Act came from \nincreased generation of existing nuclear power plants. That is where \nthe reduction is coming from, and this administration doesn't want to \naccept the responsibility to take care of the waste. Why? It doesn't \nwant to address it on its watch.\n  Why are my colleagues on the other side mixing tobacco in the issue \nand saying each day that we delay when the leadership has asked \nunanimous consent to go back to tobacco after we resolve this matter? \nThis is a cop-out, Mr. President.\n  That is why I urge my colleagues to reflect on how their votes are \ngoing to be recorded. Those on the other side who voted with us last \ntime are Senator Cleland, Senator Graham, Senator Harkin, Senator \nHollings, Senator Johnson, Senator Kohl, Senator Leahy, Senator Levin, \nSenator Moseley-Braun, Senator Murray, Senator Robb, Senator Wyden.\n  I encourage them to reflect, again, that this shouldn't get mixed up \nwith Nevada politics. If we look at polling in Nevada, we have to \nacknowledge Nevada does not want to be the resting place, even \ntemporarily, for our nuclear waste. But both sides are against putting \nnuclear waste in Nevada. So it isn't a matter of competition among the \nMembers who are against it. They are all against it.\n  If you ask a Nevadan whether they want nuclear waste in their State, \nthe answer is no. You can go to 49 other States and you will get the \nsame answer. But we have a responsibility to put it somewhere, and we \nare proposing to put it in the desert where we have had over 50 years \nof nuclear testing.\n  There it is. This is the location for the nuclear waste storage at \nthe Nevada site that was used previously for more than 800 tests of \nnuclear weapons. If you don't want to put it there, you tell me where \nyou want to put it. We spent over $7 billion at Yucca Mountain already \ntesting it. We are proposing that the waste be moved in accordance with \nthe Government's contract, move it out to a temporary repository until \nYucca Mountain can be licensed and certified.\n  If it isn't licensed and certified, then it is going to have to go \nsomeplace else, but until then, this is the site, and to suggest we \nshouldn't take it up simply means more storage piling up at our \nreactors. Some of those reactors are going to shut down. We are going \nto have to get that power someplace else. We will probably have to go \nto coal-fired power which, obviously, is not going to have the same \neffect that this has on our air quality.\n  EPA can pass all the regulations in the world, but if the \nadministration really does not care about clean air--well, they can do \nsomething about it, if the President would get behind this legislation. \nInstead, the administration intends to delay this issue, delay this \nissue, delay this issue, and the whole time telling the American people \nthat it really cares for its safety, the environment, and their \npocketbook.\n  Let me tell you again, if you are concerned about the safety, you are \nnot going to put this around in the number of States where we have it, \nthat is 40 States with 80 sites. If you care about the dollars, you are \nnot going to stop the realization that the taxpayers have paid $14 \nbillion; and now we are looking at claims for nonperformance of the \ncontract to the taxpayers in over $70 to $80 billion.\n  Is the President really concerned about clean air and climate change \nor is this a cynical diplomatic or, more realistically, a political \nexcuse? I think it is the latter, Mr. President. There is politics in \nthis issue. There is politics in the mix of this issue and tobacco. \nThis issue should stand on its own.\n  Finally, Mr. President, we have really reached a crossroad. The job \nof fixing this program is ours. Time for fixing this program is now. \nThe vote before the Senate is to move forward with a motion to proceed. \nThen we are going to move back to tobacco.\n  We have made progress on this issue. We have made progress at Yucca \nMountain. As I have indicated, the 5-mile tunnel is complete. We spent \n$7 billion of the consumers' money. We have to build on this progress. \nOur bill continues site characteristics, activities for permanent \nrepository. It allows each State to designate the route that the \nnuclear waste will move to the site proposed in Nevada.\n  I remind the President that we have waste moving throughout the \nUnited States, military waste across State lines. We can move it \nsafely. We know how. Europe moves it safely by rail and by ship. There \nis no magic in this. But the realization is that today we need a \ntemporary storage facility or we are going to be storing spent fuel all \nacross this Nation for decades to come. We are going to be in violation \nof our contract, which will cost the taxpayers more money to settle the \nsuit.\n  And we can choose today whether to start on this process to resolve \nthe issue of whether the Nation is going to continue to have 80 interim \nstorage sites or just one safe site--that arid, remote Nevada test site \nwhere I have indicated we have exploded scores of nuclear bombs during \nthe cold war. And it is safe and it is remote. And, unfortunately, it \nhas to be in one of our States, and it happens to be in the State of \nNevada. But it has brought a lot of jobs to Nevada, a lot of prosperity \nto Nevada over the years.\n  And there is the realization that if Yucca is licensed--and it is \nlikely to be--it is going to be a very, very easy task to move the \nspent fuel to the repository. And in the unlikely event that Yucca is \nnot licensed, or found to be unsuitable, Congress and the \nadministration are going to have to consider our options. In either \ncase, we will be ahead of the game regardless of what happens at Yucca.\n  This is a step that we should take. And remember today, yes is a vote \nfor cloture. It is a vote for the storage of nuclear waste at one safe \nGovernment-controlled site. It is a responsible action to meet \nGovernment's obligation to take the nuclear waste, after collecting $14 \nbillion from the consumers of electricity. It is for cleaner air. And a \nno vote, again, is for continuing to store high-level nuclear waste in \nover the 80 sites instead of the 1 safe site. It\n\n[[Page S5556]]\n\nis a continuation of a breach of contract that is going to cost the \ntaxpayers of this country some $70 to $80 billion as a consequence of \nour inaction.\n  A no vote is for eliminating our largest source of emission-free \npower, resulting in dirtier air. And isn't it extraordinary that this \nNation, with all of our technology, cannot address or resolve our high-\nlevel nuclear waste; but the French, the Japanese, the British, the \nSwedes have all addressed it responsibly? We cannot even get our \nGovernment to commit to its contractual commitment.\n  The time is now. I urge my colleagues--I know the politics of this \nbody. I know this is an issue in the race in Nevada, and I can \nunderstand and be sensitive of that, but each one of us has an \nobligation as statesmen to address responsibly the obligation we have \ntowards taking this waste and putting it out in a temporary repository \nin Nevada.\n  I understand the arguments from my colleagues from Nevada relative to \ntheir bottom line. They do not want it in their State. But we have an \nobligation to put it somewhere. We have voted previously to put it in \nNevada, in a temporary repository. To back down now is to shirk a duty \nand an obligation that we were elected to address, Mr. President, \naddress with a resolve; namely, the sanctity of a contractual \ncommitment that is due to take that waste this year and the recognition \nthat the Government, the administration, refuses to accept that \nresponsibility, therefore, that obligation becomes ours; furthermore, \nthe litigation and cost to the taxpayers who are going to be confronted \nwith this, and the full employment for lawyers if we do not address it \nnow.\n\n  So do not let politics enter into the vote and the resolve on this \nissue. This issue should stand on its own. This issue does not belong \nin consideration of the tobacco bill. This legislation should be \naddressed and resolved with a vote in favor today so we can move on and \nmeet our responsibility.\n  Mr. President, I ask how much time I have remaining on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-nine minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the President, and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Before yielding to my colleague from Nevada, I would like \nto ask my friend, the junior Senator from Alaska, do you disagree with \nDr. Richard Wilson, professor of physics, Harvard University, who \ntestified before the Energy and Water Subcommittee 2 weeks ago, \nrecognizing this man is one of the foremost experts on things physics \nand nuclear power in this country, when he said, ``And you can put it \n[nuclear waste] next to a power plant, as we are doing * * *, without \nappreciably increasing any risk to anybody''?\n  Do you disagree with his statement?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Relative to powerplants, let me advise the President \nthere are safety and economic advantages to having 1 central storage \nfacility rather than 80. I think my colleagues would agree on the other \nside. Throughout the debate, we keep hearing suggestions like: ``Why \ndon't we study the issue some more? Why don't we just leave it at the \nplant sites?'' which is what is suggested, and ``Why do we have to \nsolve the problem now?''\n  Well, why should we leave spent fuel at the nuclear power plants in \n34 States when there is a less costly storage method with an increased \nmargin of safety in an area that has already been proven for its \nstorage of waste?\n  Mr. REID. Let me reclaim my time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Let me try to finish.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I would say, of course, my friend from Alaska did not \nanswer the question because the answer is so obvious. We have here one \nof the most eminent scientists in America dealing with nuclear waste, \nwith things nuclear. He said, ``And you can put it next to a power \nplant [nuclear waste], as we are doing * * *, without appreciably \nincreasing any risk to anybody.''\n  I also say to those within the sound of my voice, it is cheaper to \nhave dry cast storage containment. It only costs about $5 million to \nestablish one on-site.\n  It would seem to me that this is so clear that it is easy to see \nthrough the transparency of what the nuclear utilities are trying to \ndo. They are trying to wash their hands of this terribly deadly waste \nthat they produced; namely, plutonium, wash their hands of it and give \nthe responsibility to somebody else. Otherwise we would go for the \ncheaper, safer version that has been underscored as being safe by Dr. \nRichard Wilson, professor of physics, Harvard University.\n\n  I yield to my colleague from the State of Nevada whatever time he may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada, Mr. Bryan.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair and I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, for those who are not familiar with the parliamentary \nintricacies of the Senate process, I think a reasonable question should \nbe raised, and that is why are we debating this issue; namely, the \nplacement of a temporary nuclear waste dump at the Nevada test site in \nNevada, when, No. 1, the Speaker of the House has indicated that no \nsuch legislation will be processed in the House; and, No. 2, the \nPresident of the United States has said if any such legislation should \nreach his desk, he will veto it.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. May I ask my colleague a question?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I yield briefly.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, could the Senator identify the \nstatement of the Speaker of the House of Representatives relative to \nthe statement of the Senator from Nevada that the House will not take \nit up? I have not seen that statement from the Speaker of the House.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I am happy to respond to my colleague. Let me just say \nvery briefly that statement appears in the form of a statement issued \nby the Congressman from the First Congressional District in Nevada in \nwhich he quotes the Speaker directly and explicitly, I must say, based \nupon a previous statement that the Speaker made with respect to the \nsame House Member in 1996, when he indicated at that time no action \nwould be taken on the temporary nuclear waste bill. In 1996, the \nSpeaker was good to his commitment and did not do so. I presume that he \nwould be in the same vein committed to honor the commitment he has \nmade.\n  I say to my friend from Alaska, I have no reason to challenge that. I \nhave seen nothing from the Speaker to indicate that the Congressman's \nstatement is inaccurate.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have been unable to get a copy of his \nstatement from the Speaker. I read the statement from Congressman \nEnsign on the issue relative to the attitude of the Speaker, but we \nhave not been able to get a release.\n  I suggest at this time we are perhaps misleading in the sense of \nsuggesting that is the Speaker's position.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Let me reclaim the floor and simply make the point that \nthis bill, if it ever reaches the President's desk, will be vetoed. I \nhave no question, based on the assertion not contradicted in any way, \nthis statement was released yesterday. It has not been contradicted. I \ncan understand why the Speaker may be reluctant to talk with my friend \nfrom Alaska because of the strong views. I suspect the nuclear power \nindustry has also been unable to get a response.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Is this not the statement from the Congressman that is \nrunning for the Senate seat that is vacant in Nevada?\n  Mr. REID. Vacant? Vacant?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska should address the \nquestions through the Chair.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I reclaim the floor and I simply say, because I want to \ntalk about a number of issues, I inform my friend and colleague that a \nHouse leadership aide today told one of the local publications here on \nCapitol Hill.\n\n       . . . that the nuclear industry and other bill proponents \n     should have seen this one coming. It was presumed among the \n     leadership that a vote on an issue as contentious as nuclear \n     waste storage could never take place in an election year.\n\n  That is June 2, 1998. It comes from Congress Daily, a confirmation \nfrom a House leadership aide. I have no doubt it is true.\n  Let me get to the point as our time is limited. There is a lot more \nin operation here than nuclear waste. We are\n\n[[Page S5557]]\n\ntalking, my friends, about an unholy alliance between two of the \nlargest corporate entities in America--the nuclear power industry and \nthe tobacco lobby. Here is how both of them win and the American \ntaxpayer and the kids of America lose. The Democratic leader was \nabsolutely correct when he said we should stay on the tobacco bill \nuntil we complete it, just as we have with other issues that are deemed \npriorities by the leadership in this Chamber.\n  The way to do that is to stay on it, not to get sidetracked on \nanother issue. From a procedural point of view, the majority leader, at \nany time, can file a motion to proceed to invoke cloture at any time. \nIt seems to me more is in operation here than might meet the eye. No. \n1, if we get off tobacco, and that will be the effect if cloture is \ngranted--everybody in this Chamber knows that our time limit for this \nsession is extremely limited, 13 weeks or less; there are 13 \nappropriations bills that have to be processed, and many other pieces \nof legislation--in effect, a vote to invoke cloture is a vote to kill \ntobacco. That is a vote that kills children in America. Three thousand \neach day take up smoking for the first time; 1,000 of them will die \nprematurely as a result of smoking-related complications.\n\n  A decade ago we thought we had made progress in reducing smoking of \nthe underage. However, from 1990 to 1996 the statistics have been \ntragic and disastrous. The rates of teenage smoking have soared. In \nsome categories of youngsters, African-American, they have more than \ndoubled. In my view, it is absolutely important and imperative as a \nmatter of public policy that we deal with the tobacco issue.\n  Obviously, the nuclear waste industry has its own agenda but they \nfind common ground with another industry in America, and that is the \ntobacco industry. The two of them come up with this strategy and both \nare winners and the American people are losers.\n  Let's talk a little bit about the process for a moment. We are urged \nto move to consideration of a bill that is the House bill. That bill, \nby every standard, is much worse than a bad bill processed out of this \nSenate earlier in this Congress. The chairman of the Energy Committee \nhas indicated that he has an amendment that will be offered shortly \nafter--but everybody here understands what is happening. There is a so-\ncalled substitute that most of us have never seen--that at best is a \nwork in progress--that we have no idea what it might be. There has been \nno conference, no conference. The Democratic members of the committee \nhave not been involved or consulted in any way. This has been the \nnuclear utilities working out various provisions in the back room which \nserve their best interests, and which we have not yet seen in the light \nof day.\n  My colleagues, you are asked to bring to the floor a bill that \nultimately, if the substitute is offered, we don't have any indication \nas to what its contents may be. I agree with the majority leader when \nhe said the responsible thing to do is to deal with each of these \nissues, tobacco and nuclear waste, separately and the way to do that is \nto vote no on the cloture motion and to stay on tobacco until we have \ncompleted it. Then if there is any desire to proceed, something that \nthe majority leader has every right under the rule to do, he can \nproceed along that line. But there is no reason--none--to bring this \nissue to a head now.\n  Now, let's just talk a little bit about the merits of this \nlegislation and the need. For the last 18 years, the nuclear power \nindustry in America has been crying there is an urgent need, \ncatastrophe will fall upon us, that there is a crisis.\n  Here is a statement made by our former colleague on the floor of the \nSenate, July 28, 1980--18 years ago--referring to a piece of \nlegislation which was then referred to as away-from-reactor \nlegislation, but essentially the same thing, a so-called temporary \nnuclear waste dump. Our former colleague said in discussing this:\n\n       It is an urgent problem, Mr. President, for this Nation. It \n     is urgent, first, because we are running out of reactor space \n     at reactors for the storage of the fuel, and if we do not \n     build what we call away-from-reactor storage and begin that \n     soon, we could begin shutting down civilian nuclear reactors \n     in this country as soon as 1983.\n\n  Didn't happen, didn't happen. No nuclear utility in America has ever \nbeen closed down because of inadequate space. Some have been closed \ndown because they are dangerous and they constitute a public health and \nsafety risk, and others have shut down because simply in the evolving \nelectrical markets of the day they are simply no longer economic. So \nthat is the need argument. We are hearing that it is urgent; we need to \ndeal with it.\n  Let me talk about what the scientific community has said, the Nuclear \nWaste Review Board, not comprised of Nevada citizens who have strong \nviews, as the chairman of the committee properly addresses. This is the \nscientific community. ``The board sees no compelling technical or \nsafety reasons to move spent fuel to a specialized safety facility.''\n  None. Indeed, our colleagues have specifically incorporated into the \nlaw a provision that would be changed if this piece of legislation is \nprocessed that specifically precludes the establishment of a temporary \nnuclear waste dump until such time as a permanent dump is established. \nThey knew then, as we ought to know now, that something that becomes \ntemporary is de facto permanent in America.\n  So the scientific community is not supportive. The President of the \nUnited States has indicated that he will veto this legislation. It is \nsaid the great joy of this piece of legislation is that all nuclear \nwaste will be congregated in a single site. Not true, Mr. President. \nNot true. In effect, what we do is we will add one additional site. \nThese designated sites on this chart indicate commercial reactors \naround the country.\n  Those who are familiar with nuclear power understand that a nuclear \nreactor is powered by spent-fuel rods. Those spent-fuel rods, after a \nperiod of time, lose efficiency, so that they need to be removed from \nthe reactor core and placed in storage. Those spent-fuel rods are what \nwe are talking about here. That is the commercial nuclear waste. What \nis done, because they generate enormous amounts of heat, is they are \nplaced in pools of water at the reactor site, so every commercial \nnuclear reactor in the country that has an active reactor will have \nsomeplace that by necessity they will have to store these spent nuclear \nrods for a period of 8, 9, 10 years. So this allusion that sometime we \nwill have a single site is simply not the case at all. So long as there \nare commercial reactors in America, that is the process we must go \nthrough.\n  Finally, a word about the court case and the responsibility of the \nDepartment of Energy. Mr. President, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act was \nenacted in 1982. It indicated there would be a series of contracts that \nwould be entered into by each of the reactor sites and, indeed, that is \nwhat has occurred. Those contracts defined the responsibilities of the \nparties. The responsibility of the Department of Energy is, in the \nevent that there is a delay in taking the nuclear waste from the \nreactor site--everyone must concede that is the case; there is no way \npossible that those dates can be met, and January 31, 1998, was the \ndate--it expressly indicates that the remedy that is provided is that, \nto the extent the delay is ascertained, ``the contract will be \nequitably adjusted to reflect any additional cost incurred by the party \nnot responsible for or contributing to the delay.''\n  What that means is to the extent that a nuclear utility incurs \nadditional expense for on-site storage that it would not otherwise have \nincurred had the Department of Energy been able to take the nuclear \nwaste, the nuclear utility and its ratepayers are entitled to be \ncompensated. I do not disagree with that. I have introduced legislation \nsince coming to this body that would provide for that. The simple way \nthat could be done is to reduce the amount of a contribution which the \nnuclear utility makes to the nuclear waste fund in the form of a mill \ntax levy on each kilowatt hour of nuclear power generated so that the \nratepayers may be whole. That has been offered time and time again. The \nnuclear utilities reject that because they have a different agenda. We \nwill talk more about that. Their agenda is to transfer the financial \nresponsibility from the nuclear utilities to the American taxpayer, and \nthat is one of the most outrageous features of this legislation.\n\n[[Page S5558]]\n\n  I yield the floor and reserve the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Who yields time?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to my friend from \nIdaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me join my colleague from Nevada and \nsay we are debating a motion to proceed. To proceed to what? To proceed \nto something that the House and the Senate of the U.S. Congress have \nspoken to in a substantial majority for the last 3 years, which is that \nthe Government of the United States should honor the 1982 Nuclear Waste \nAct and take possession of the waste that they promised the utilities \nthey would take in return for the ratepayers paying out billions of \ndollars to build a permanent repository.\n  The Senators from Nevada have alluded that there is no cost or \nobligation. It is the word of our Government; it is the law that \nspeaks. It is a solemn obligation under taxes that we have taken to \ntake possession and build a permanent repository. The courts have also, \njust in the last year, clearly reflected that. This administration has \nhad to quietly admit it. Now they are fighting in court saying, ``We \ndon't want our hands dirtied by our obligation.''\n  Mr. President, you are without claim, you are without program, but \nyou aren't without politics. I must say that when the Senators from \nNevada talk about the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board saying \ncertain things, let me remind the Senate the chairman of that board was \nappointed by this President. Would it be so unusual that he would \nreflect the political attitudes of this President? I suggest not.\n  Now, I find it very interesting that the Senators from Nevada are \nstanding on the floor today wringing their hands and suggesting that we \nare avoiding the debate on tobacco. Since when has the Senate been a \nsingle legislative body? Under the leadership of Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, for the purpose of moving timely policy issues, this \nSenate has dealt with a multitude of issues. That is exactly what the \nmajority leader is attempting to do today--to start a process on the \nnuclear waste bill and to move on with tobacco.\n  Who has denied the Senate the right to do two things at one time? The \nSenators from Nevada. They are the ones that say it is either/or and it \nis not both. So I find it a bit ironic that they would suggest today \nthat thousands of children may die from tobacco. Let me tell you that \nany child that starts smoking tobacco doesn't die from it immediately; \n10, 15, 20 or 30 years down the line, if they are foolish enough to \ncontinue, they might. So back off. That is an illogical argument, and \nthe reality is very clear. This Senate is capable of doing a multitude \nof things, and we must if we are going to move timely policy issues for \nthis country.\n  Oh, my goodness, Dr. Richard Wilson is suggesting that waste stored \nat generating sites is safe. What is the difference between storage at \na generating site and storage at a temporary site awaiting final \ndisposition in the Nevada desert? Well, I will tell you that there is a \ndifference. The difference is that neither is a problem. So to the \nSenators from Nevada who claim this great difficulty of human risk to \nthe State of Nevada, there is no risk, by the admission of Dr. Richard \nWilson. What there is, is the reality of the law and a timely \nresponsible disposition of this issue.\n  How can any Senator stand on the floor and say we are going to \ncollect $14 billion in taxes, which we have done, and then we are going \nto turn and run away from the issue and spend the money elsewhere? That \nis what the Senators from Nevada are suggesting. They are suggesting \nthat somehow we collect the money, but we have no obligation after the \nfact.\n  The law and the courts are clear. The reality is that we move toward \nthe development of a permanent repository. And while we are doing that, \nand while it is the Congress of the United States that, by law, \ndesignated Yucca Mountain for the purpose of the necessary scientific \nand engineering studies to determine its desirability for that, we have \nthe responsibility of the law to fulfill the obligation.\n  By the way, what Dr. Richard Wilson did not say is that every site \nthat stores waste at every generating site today, by definition, is \ntemporary--by definition, is temporary. And yet it is safe. Yes, it is \nsafe. It has been well managed. But because it is temporary, the \nCongress of the United States in 1982 said it is time this country \ndeveloped a permanent--permanent--resolution of this issue.\n  I would suggest, with a smile on my face, that the Senators from \nNevada, when using the tobacco argument, are hiding behind a bit of a \nsmokescreen today. But let's clear the smoke and face the reality that \nwe can deal with more than one issue at one time in this Chamber. The \nSenators from Nevada are denying us the ability to deal with tobacco, \nbecause if we get cloture today, we are on nuclear waste, and we will \nstay there until this issue is resolved, when we could move forth and \ndebate both tobacco and nuclear waste with a timely allocation to each \nissue for the purpose of resolving it to final disposition.\n  That is what the majority leader was talking about. That is what this \nSenate is trying to do. It is our obligation, and it is our \nresponsibility. The Senator from Alaska has talked about the waste, the \namount of storage facilities, and what we are attempting to do--81 \nsites in 41 States, commercial spent fuel. Are big utility companies \ntrying to shove off the responsibility, as has been alluded to by the \nSenators from Nevada? Quite the contrary. The big utility companies \nentered into an agreement with their Government. They signed a \ncontract, and they paid the tax. Is that shoving anything off? \nAbsolutely not. It is the reality of the law, and the Senators from \nNevada know that.\n  Can I blame them for their arguments in defense of their State? No. \nBut they are not entitled to their own truth when it does not match the \nreality of the law. Facts cannot be generated on a daily basis. The \nreality is very clear--$14 billion later and better than a decade and a \nhalf, the Congress of the United States has not forced their Government \nand has not forced this administration to own up to the law, and it is \nnow time we do so. A majority of this body agrees with that; 65 \nSenators agree with it, 307 House Members, because they understand that \nthey have an obligation to uphold the contractual relationship of this \nGovernment as was established.\n  And what did our courts say? Yes, contracts mean something. Last \nyear, the Supreme Court said: You have a contract; the Government is \nresponsible for delivering on the contract. The Senators from Nevada \nsay quite the contrary. Well, they can debate about the Supreme Court \nif they want to; I will not. What the legislation that we have before \nus proposes to do is to honor the contract and to do so in a reasonable \nand timely way, to build a temporary repository, to begin to handle \nwaste in the very way, the very safe way, by the admission of the \nSenator from Nevada, that it is being handled at temporary sites.\n  So what is the fear? I think there is none. In fact, if you study the \nissue, you know there is no fear. How many nuclear bombs were trucked \nright down through the middle of Las Vegas--hundreds of them were--as \nthey moved out to the test site in Nevada for the purpose of their \ntesting. We in this country have the phenomenal integrity of managing \nnuclear waste in a sound and safe way. And that is the record. We know \nthat is the record. But the legislation that we have before us, or at \nleast that we are attempting to get to, even tightens up on that. It \neven gets much, much tougher. It goes on to talk about the \nresponsibility of establishing the transportation sites and working \nwith the States to assure that those transportation sites' integrity is \nmaintained.\n\n  Nevada as a State, as does my State of Idaho, has had a long history \nof dealing safely and soundly with nuclear materials and doing it in a \nway that has been cost-effective, that has brought hundreds of millions \nof dollars to our State in the form of revenue, jobs, and taxation.\n  Is it a double standard we talk about today? Not this Senator. It is \na contractual obligation of our Government to find and build a \npermanent repository for the long-term safe disposition\n\n[[Page S5559]]\n\nof nuclear waste material. That is the debate today. I cannot blame the \nSenators from Nevada for the fight they put up. But it is very clear \nwhere this Congress and where this Government intends to go, and it has \nbeen very clear since 1982, because that is what the citizens of our \ncountry have wanted, and that is what we have obligated ourselves to \ndo.\n  We have a nuclear legacy that some would like to walk away from, but \nit is a nuclear legacy of which this country can well be proud.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator from Alaska yield me additional time?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. May I ask the Chair, Mr. President, how much remaining \ntime we have on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 18 minutes 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. About 8 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, this Nation has a nuclear legacy that some \nwould like to shy away from. It is, in fact, the legacy of which I am \nproud. It has brought safety and security to this country for decades. \nNow we must handle it in a responsible fashion, because from that \nlegacy there is a debt, and the debt is the safe and responsible \nmanagement of nuclear waste from the military side.\n  Some years ago, we decided that a permanent repository would also \nhouse high-level military nuclear waste. While all of that legacy is a \nresponsibility of our Government and our citizens, there is another \nlegacy that we can be even more proud of, and that is the history of \nthe commercial electrical generating industry that chose to generate \nelectricity from nuclear energy. About 20 percent of our electrical \nbase today is nuclear, and our scientists and environmental friends \ntell us that if we are to obtain the clean air standards in the \nnonattainment areas, we will probably have to have more nuclear \ngenerated electricity, or at least we will have to keep the same ratios \neven with the growth of our country.\n  All of a sudden, out of a Kyoto discussion comes a new recognition of \na phenomenally clean, safe form of electrical generation. We all \nunderstand that. We all find it terribly important. If we are going to \naddress the reality of climate change--and all of us are concerned \nabout it--one of our obligations is to provide a safe, clean source of \nenergy, and it is nuclear. And to do so, we must find a safe, clean way \nto handle the spent fuel. That is what we have understood for a long \ntime, and that is what this country will demand.\n  That is what we are putting forth today--to deal with this \nlegislation, to put it to the President, hopefully, for his signature. \nAnd I will tell you that the Senators from Nevada have said he might \nveto it. Well, the President of the United States does not run the \nlegislative branch of Government, nor should we view that threat as \nsomething that would deter or direct our policy formation. We are a \nseparate branch, and while the President might suggest he would veto \nit, we also have the power to override. And in the last vote we had on \nthis issue, we missed that by one vote. I am convinced today, based on \nthe increased importance of this issue and the reality of the court \ntests and the simple explanation of our President as he throws his \npolitical hands up and says, ``I have no solution to the problem, and I \nwill do nothing,'' even though the courts and the law say he must, that \nhe is acting in a fully irresponsible fashion. The Congress of the \nUnited States knows that, and 41 States know that. And the public is \nbeginning to say, ``Wait a moment, Mr. President. You have an \nobligation under the law. Didn't you take an oath of office? Aren't you \nresponsible for upholding the law?''\n  But so is the Congress. And the Congress and the President, in \nconcert, can resolve this issue. The resolution is in the very \nlegislation that we are attempting to debate on the floor, to build a \nsafe, temporary repository to begin to take possession of the waste \nthat we promised we would in 1982 as we began this process and as we \nbegan to tax the ratepayers of the nuclear-generating utilities of this \ncountry.\n  We can do that and we should do that, if that is what we debate \ntoday. This is not a debate about tobacco. That is a false argument. It \nwas the Senators from Nevada and the minority leader who denied the \nSenate the right to debate both issues. So let us not use that again. \nIt is a phony argument. It is a false-based argument. This Senate, \nunder Democrat or Republican leadership, has dealt with two or three \nissues at a time. When we get under time constraints, as we are in this \npolitical year when our colleagues will want to be out campaigning by \nearly October, there will be many times on the floor of the Senate when \nwe will want to deal with multiple issues.\n  This is one where some have chosen to be selective, but let the \nrecord show that is a false choice. We can do both. We should do both. \nThat is the intent. That is why we are here today, to debate a motion \nto proceed so we can handle both at the same time in a responsible way, \nso we can turn to our citizens and our electorate and say, as we close \nthe business of the 105th session of the U.S. Senate, that we dealt in \na timely fashion with our environmental responsibilities with nuclear \nwaste, high-level waste materials, and that we also dealt with the \nresponsibility to the teenagers of America, and that is to deal with \ntobacco and try to restrict it from their access and their use. We can \ndo both, and we should, and that is what we are attempting here this \nafternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I hope my friend from Idaho would review the \ncomments that he made. I, of course, recognize that a child who begins \nsmoking today doesn't die today. No, that is true. As the Senator from \nIdaho said, that person doesn't die today. That person dies later, an \nagonizing death from lung cancer, emphysema, heart disease. No, they \ndon't die today. They die later.\n  Also, I think my friend should go back and look at the statement he \nmade about those who are not teenagers who are foolish enough to \ncontinue smoking. The tobacco legislation is about addiction. The \ntobacco companies addict our children. Mr. President, 3,000 children a \nday are addicted to tobacco. It is not something they can just stop \nwhen they turn 19, something they can stop when they turn 32. They are \naddicted to a substance that causes them to want this product. They pay \nhuge amounts for it. Why? Because they are addicted to it. They are \naddicted--when? They are addicted, 90 percent of them, when they are \nteenagers.\n  So, for my friend from Idaho to say, ``if they are foolish enough to \ncontinue smoking''--I think the facts should be reassessed, as, I \nsubmit, should be a number of the other facts stated by my friend from \nIdaho. For example, he agrees with Dr. Wilson. He said that storing \nnuclear waste at a repository next to the nuclear generating facility \nis safe. The problem is with the logic that he carries forward, that it \nis also safe if you put it 3,000 miles away. We lose track of the fact \nthat this has to be hauled 3,000 miles away or 2,000 miles away or \nwhatever the distance. The logic is not there. His review of Dr. \nWilson's statement is simply without foundation.\n  Dr. Wilson said, ``And you can put it next to a power plant, as we \nare doing sometimes, without appreciably increasing any risk to \nanybody.'' Dr. Wilson does not say you can haul it 3,000 miles and it \nwill be safe.\n  Also, I am amazed that my friend from Idaho does not understand a \nbasic truth--that nuclear bombs aren't hauled through Nevada and then \nset off in the desert. There are components, separate components, like \na puzzle, none of which standing alone will cause any damage to anyone, \nthat are brought to the Nevada test site. Many of the parts are shipped \nby air to the Test Site landing strip. And these components are then \nassembled. We have an assembly facility out there that cost almost $1 \nbillion. That is where they are assembled. So, for someone to say these \nhave been hauled through the highways of Nevada or the city of Las \nVegas for years is baseless, without foundation.\n  This is a debate on tobacco. This is a subterfuge to stop us from \ngoing to tobacco. I could talk about tobacco all day, and I will talk \nabout it a little while longer. But I just want to mention a little bit \nabout where my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--\n\n[[Page S5560]]\n\nand I am sorry to say, I do say this ``on the other side of the \naisle,'' because this has become a partisan issue. There are matters \npassed out, ``Senate vote analysis,'' passed out on everyone's desk, \ncompiled and written by the staff of the Republican Policy Committee. \nThis is not a bipartisan issue. This is being pushed by the leadership \nof the House and the leadership of the Senate.\n  I also say, however, if we go to this partisan issue that wants to \nput the above-ground storage at the Nevada test site--I show you this \nchart. It has on it information, not gathered by the Senators from the \nState of Nevada, but from the Council of National Seismic System \nComposite Catalog. It shows earthquakes of magnitude 2.5 and greater in \nthe vicinity of the repository right here, the above-ground repository. \nThis area is loaded with earthquakes. Not one, not two, not three--\nthere are so many of them you cannot count, right on-site. These are \nearthquakes that have already taken place in the last 20 years. Don't \nyou think it would be nice if this issue were debated in committee, \nthat they hold some hearings on this?\n  This is stealth legislation.\n  We are proceeding on a bill that came from the House. Anyone would \nconsider this legislation an environmental abomination. I should not \nsay ``anyone.'' But the vast majority of the people of this country \nwould. The bills that have passed the House and Senate cannot be \nreconciled. With time running out, the nuclear utilities are furiously \nworking behind closed doors to come up with a final bill. No one has \nany idea what they are going to come up with. Maybe the nuclear \nindustry does. I wouldn't be surprised if they wrote it. But the final \nsurprise bill is going to be proposed and sprung upon us at a later \ntime, yet this body is voting to proceed to this measure. That should \nbe reason enough not to proceed.\n  It is important to keep in mind that the President of the United \nStates has already promised to veto this legislation, not once, not \ntwice, but numerous times. I would say scores of times. He doesn't like \nthis legislation. It is unfair. We should stick with what has been \ntalked about, and that is whether or not there should be a deep \nrepository at Yucca Mountain. Let the scientists go ahead and work on \nthat. But that is not good enough for the very powerful, greedy nuclear \nutilities. That is not good enough for them. What they want is to \nshort-circuit the system, go to the Nevada test site where we have all \nof these earthquakes, and pour a big cement pad on top of the ground \nand dump the canisters on top of the ground. It is easy. It is out of \ntheir hair. Even though my friend from Idaho agrees it is safe if they \nleave it where it is, why should we worry about transporting it all \nthose miles? Why? Because the nuclear utilities want to get rid of it. \nThey created the most poisonous substance known to man. They created \nit.\n  So, is it any wonder that this has been decried as a do-nothing \nCongress? The President said he will veto it. The Speaker of the House \nof Representatives said, ``I'm not going to touch nuclear waste.'' Yet, \nwe are marching forward on this legislation. Why? Why? Because, if the \nmotion to invoke cloture prevails, we will go to nuclear waste and \ntobacco is history.\n  There seems to be an unhealthy obsession with satisfying the \nlegislative interests of the nuclear waste industry. Are we satisfying \nthem at the expense of a bill designed to curb teenage smoking, a goal \nthat many publicly support. But secretly, do some want this \nlegislation, tobacco legislation, to go away?\n  Preventing teenage smoking is something that is important. This room \nis not big enough to put in 3,000 kids. If they did, they would be \njammed in pretty tight, on top of each other. Three thousand kids a day \nbecome addicted to tobacco smoking. And, no, they don't die today. But \nmany, many of them are going to die because of one thing, tobacco, \ninhaling tobacco.\n  In the State of Nevada, almost 20 percent of high school kids chew \ntobacco, smokeless tobacco--18 percent.\n  We may have our differences over the best way of bringing about the \ncessation of teenage smoking and other forms of tobacco abuse, but I \nhope we don't disagree on the goal.\n  The two Senators from Nevada, I want it spread across the Record of \nthis Senate, will exercise every right that we have as Senators today, \ntomorrow, next week, the week after. We will make sure this issue is \nconsidered fully and fairly; that if cloture is invoked on this very \ninopportune legislation, we are going to do everything we can to make \nsure that our message is heard.\n  This is the wrong time to bring up legislation that has been \nguaranteed a veto by the President, and the Speaker of the House has \nsaid he will not move forward on it. We are prepared to spend as much \ntime as possible debating this measure, even at the expense of other \nbusiness that is important to this Senate.\n  There is a lot to go over on this legislation. We are voting to \nproceed to either a House bill that is an unacceptable environmental \ndisaster or a substitute measure that has been written by the nuclear \nindustry and seen by very few. I haven't seen the substitute. I assume \nthe nuclear industry has. I haven't seen it. It has not been the \nsubject of any hearings. It has not been given the opportunity to be \nmarked up. It is not enjoying the benefit of public scrutiny and input \nfrom other interests.\n  Yet, the proponents of this measure are getting ready to spring this \non this body and file cloture on it. That is the way they do it, \nbecause they know the longer it is subject to the light of day, the \nmore warts will be revealed. Environmental groups will rip this \nsubstitute apart. Proponents would have you believe they are sweetening \nthe pot to broaden their support. Nuclear waste is a witches' brew that \nis unacceptable and cannot be made palatable.\n  I urge all Members--Democrats and Senators of good will--recognizing \nthe importance of tobacco, to vote against cloture. We need to get back \nto the problems of addressing teenage smoking. We don't need to be \nwasting this body's time on a measure that the President said he will \nveto and just yesterday the Speaker of the House said, ``We're not \ngoing to touch nuclear waste.''\n  I ask the Chair how much time the Senators from Nevada have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 14 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If neither side yields time, time is equally \ncharged.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wonder if the Chair will advise how \nmuch time is remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska has 12 minutes and 30 \nseconds; the Senator from Nevada has 13 minutes and 39 seconds.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, in the last few minutes we have heard \nfrom our friends from Nevada a good deal about the status of tobacco. \nHow tobacco relates to high-level nuclear waste is beyond this Senator \nfrom Alaska. I think both can kill. Certainly tobacco, as we have \nevidenced, can kill and high-level nuclear waste, if not properly \nstored and not properly transported and not properly basically put to \nrest, can kill. But when I look at the reality of where we are in this \ndebate, I refer my good friends to reflect on the action that was taken \nby the majority leader when he asked:\n\n       I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for the \n     majority leader, after notification of the Democratic leader, \n     to resume consideration of the tobacco bill, notwithstanding \n     rule XXII with respect to the nuclear waste bill.\n\n  That was objected to, Mr. President. It was objected to by the \nminority leader. Let's not make any mistake about who is whom in \nwanting to go back to the tobacco bill. This was a unanimous consent \nrequest of the majority leader, a legitimate request, to guarantee \ngoing back, and it was objected to by the other side. So who is \nobjecting to moving on tobacco? It is pretty clear. It ought to be \nclear to everybody.\n  We are all concerned about the disposition of the tobacco bill, but \nthis bill has no relation. We have an obligation on this bill to \naddress it with a resolve.\n  Do you have a few questions? Well, let's take a few, Mr. President. \nAnyone who buys the line that the tobacco industry and the nuclear \npower industry\n\n[[Page S5561]]\n\nare somehow in bed together, why that is preposterous. It is absolutely \npreposterous. There is absolutely no connection, and we all know it. \nThe Nevadans would have the alternative of doing absolutely nothing--\nabsolutely nothing--about high-level nuclear waste.\n  Mr. President, this also is about Nevada politics, not about tobacco. \nIt is Nevada politics, again, on who can generate the responsibility \nfor killing this issue in the Congress of the United States, whether it \nbe the House Member who is running for the Senate office or the Nevada \nSenator who is up for reelection. Whoever can put the best spin on it \nin Nevada is going to claim a victory. That is politics, but make sure \nwe understand it, Mr. President.\n  When my good friend on the other side says that he has no idea what \nthe substitute is about, well, somebody's memory is short because we \ndebated the issue. We had a vote on the issue. The substitute we \ndebated on April 15, 1997. The substitute was adopted 65 to 34. When he \nindicates that he has no idea relative to the amendment proposed to be \noffered, that was the Bingaman amendment. That was debated and debated \nextensively. So the record will note that the substitute was voted on \n65-34 and was adopted. The Bingaman amendment was debated on the floor; \nit was rejected. The Senator from Alaska is proposing to take the \nBingaman amendment, if we can move off the motion to proceed, and get \nthis issue behind us.\n  Mr. President, let's make sure we understand what this issue is all \nabout. It is about ducking our responsibility. It is about Nevada \npolitics, and we are now told that the House won't take it up. I \nhaven't seen a statement from the Speaker of the House of \nRepresentatives. Anyone can issue a press release, and it is important \nto recognize who is issuing the press release. It is the Congressman \nwho is seeking the Nevada Senate seat so he can get aboard and claim \nthat he is responsible for killing it.\n  As I said, anyone can issue a press release, but I can tell you what \nis true: We have a bill that received a big bipartisan vote. This is \nnot a partisan issue, as evidenced by the vote last time.\n  We had 12 Democrats that voted with 53 Republicans. All right, that \nis a fact. I have the word of Chairman Bliley in the House that he is \ncommitted to getting this bill done. I know the majority and minority \nstaff of the Commerce Committee spent all day every day in the last \nrecess negotiating a compromise. I do not think they would have done \nthat if the leadership did not intend to take up the bill.\n  I think this is a blatant attempt to influence the vote today in \neffect to perhaps become a self-fulfilling prophecy. We have to focus \non the substance of the bill and vote to do what is right, not put this \noff, not listen to political posturing from the other body or political \nposturing that affects this body.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote yes on cloture. You know, if you look \nat this picture, here is the Nevada test site, Mr. President. The last \nweapon there was exploded underground in 1991. Underground tests are \nstill performed there with nuclear materials being exploded with \nconventional explosives, all with the wholehearted support--the \nwholehearted support--of whom?\n  Well, here it is, Mr. President. Here is what the State of Nevada in \nits resolution says about the site. I would like to read relevant \nportions of the Nevada Assembly Joint Resolution No. 15 of February 26, \n1975.\n\n       Whereas, the people of Southern Nevada have confidence in \n     the safety record of the Nevada Test Site and in the ability \n     of the staff of the site to maintain safety in the handling \n     of nuclear materials * * * [and]\n       Whereas Nuclear waste disposal * * * can * * * be carried \n     out at the Nevada Test Site with minimal capital investment \n     relative to other locations; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the Assembly and the State of Nevada, jointly, \n     That the legislature of the State of Nevada strongly urges \n     the Energy Research and Development Administration to choose \n     Nevada Test Site for the disposal of nuclear wastes. . . .\n\n  That is what some people in Nevada and the Nevada legislature think \nabout this idea. It is a pretty good idea. It means jobs. They want to \nsee the ongoing development, if you will, of this area.\n  Let me tell you what the Sierra Club has to say about it. The Sierra \nClub is quite succinct. And I will read it as follows:\n\n       ``They're never going to be able to reclaim [this site, the \n     Nevada test site] for 10,000 or 15,000 years,'' says Randy \n     Harnes of the Sierra Club's Las Vegas chapter. ``They might \n     as well do [their research] there.''\n\n  He concludes:\n\n       Given the constant monitoring, the site ``is probably the \n     safest place in the whole United States.''\n\n  There you have the Sierra Club, if you put a good deal of faith in \ntheir analysis.\n  Why can't we leave the waste at the reactors? First of all, as my \nfriend from Idaho indicated, the court said the Department of Energy \nhas a contract obligation. The Government has a contract obligation to \ntake the waste in 1998. Congress cannot change that obligation. It is a \ntaxpayers' liability. And the spent fuel was never meant to be stored \nfor long-term storage. We know that.\n  It is estimated that if you are going to store it at the sites of the \nnuclear plants, it is going to cost you almost $8 billion. Who is going \nto pay for that? The ratepayers--ultimately the taxpayers.\n\n  We have heard a lot about Dr. Wilson today. Let me tell you what Ivan \nSelin, the chairman of the NRC said. Spent fuel can be managed more \neffectively and efficiently at a single site rather than at multiple \nsites. Dr. Selin, in a statement in March of 1995 to the Senate Energy \nCommittee, said the NRC--that is the law of the nuclear land--\n``believe[s] that a centralized facility will provide safety advantages \nrelative to dispersed storage at individual sites. Considering the 100-\nyear potential time frame of licensed storage, a centralized facility \nwould allow for a more focused inspection and surveillance program by \nboth DOE and NRC.''\n  So make no mistake about it, putting it in one site simply makes \nsense, and it is a logical observation that anybody would make relative \nto having temporary sites near the location of the reactors where it \nwas never intended.\n  Mr. President, I would like to save a few minutes on this side for \nconcluding remarks. So I ask how much time we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 45 seconds.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask that we may withhold that time.\n  Mr. REID. I yield to my colleague from Nevada such time as he may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank my senior colleague, and I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this debate is winding down, but I think we need to \nmake very clear that there is no misimpression created that somehow the \nSenators from Nevada have injected the nuclear waste and the tobacco \nissue together. It is my strong preference, as a member of the Commerce \nCommittee, having served on that committee, and having voted with the \ngreat majority 19-1 to report this bill out--I am referring to Senator \nMcCain's legislation--and serving on the Finance Committee where it was \nreported out by a 12-6 vote--I was with the prevailing majority--my \npriority is to consider the tobacco legislation.\n  It was not the Senators from Nevada who interjected nuclear waste in \nthe midst of our discussion on tobacco. Now we have a way in this body \nof determining what our priorities are. If our priorities are addressed \nto finishing and completing a piece of legislation, neither hell nor \nhigh water can divert our attention and focus, and as the majority \nleader has said many times, and rightly so, we are going to stay on \nthis issue until it is finished.\n  What is different here? It is a matter of priorities, I suspect, an \nagenda that may not be spoken. The best and the most effective way to \ndeal with the tobacco issue is to stay on the bill until we complete \nit, and that is the logical thing to do. To go off that bill, go on \nnuclear waste, back and forth, is not the logical way to do it.\n  Mr. President, there is absolutely no urgency in the world to move to \nnuclear waste today. There is urgency to process this tobacco \nlegislation. At the end of this day, when we return to our respective \nhomes, another 3,000 young people in this country will have taken up \nsmoking. And as we have said time\n\n[[Page S5562]]\n\nand time again, 1,000 of them--1,000 of them--one-third will die \nprematurely as a result of smoking-related complications.\n  That is the urgency. That is the priority that I attach. Let me say \nthat there are some things that have been said about this legislation \nthat I do not have time to respond to completely, but the Nevada \nlegislature has very strongly expressed its opposition. It is suggested \nby the chairman of the Senate Energy Committee that you can understand \nwhy Nevadans would be opposed to this legislation.\n\n  Let me suggest that opposition to this legislation has not come from \nNevadans alone. When the American people are asked--the country as a \nwhole--66 percent indicate they oppose temporary nuclear waste storage \nas proposed in this legislation. Only 17 percent support it; and \nanother 17 percent do not know. This is a product of research done for \nthe University of Maryland's 1997 National Omnibus Survey.\n  I have very little time, Mr. President, but I want to talk about what \nI call the ``dirty little secret'' that is involved here. What the \nnuclear utility industry wants more than anything else is for the \nAmerican public--the taxpayers in America--to lift this financial \nresponsibility.\n  Our friends in opposition who urge cloture frequently invoke the \nsanctity of this contract. This contract, as well as the legislation \nbefore us, requires those utilities to make a contribution to the \nnuclear waste trust fund of $1 million. That is a tenth of a penny for \neach kilowatt hour of nuclear power generated by these reactors. Here \nare the numbers. At no time did it contemplate, in addition to the \nexpense incurred in terms of a permanent repository, that there would \nbe an interim that would be added to this cost.\n  Here are the total costs to this program: $53.9 billion that is kind \nof broken down in terms of the Nevada transportation crosscountry, the \nso-called centralized interim storage facility that is being talked \nabout here, all of the other expenditures.\n\n  So, $53.9 billion is what nuclear waste storage is going to cost us \nin America when this program ultimately winds down.\n  Here is the agenda, here is the agenda: total program costs, $53.9 \nbillion; total revenue derived from the utilities, and that is at the \ncurrent rate of 1 mill for each kilowatt-hour, is $28.1 billion.\n  Guess who gets stuck with that number? Guess who gets stuck with that \nnumber? All of you, all of you. Every taxpayer in America, $25.8 \nbillion. That is at the current rate. If that gives you a little bit of \nelevated blood pressure, under H.R. 1270, the contribution of 1 mill \nwould be roughly reduced by a third. So it would be, like, three-tenths \nof 1 mill, which would mean this number--rather than going to $25.8 \nbillion, billions of additional dollars will have been added.\n  That is what the agenda is on the part of the utilities. Their \ncontract, the same contract that has been invoked with such sanctity, \nas well as the legislation, requires the nuclear utility industry to \ncover the costs of the high-level waste disposal program in America. \nThey would like to shift that burden to you.\n  Now, we haven't talked about one other issue, and that is, finally, \nthe transportation issue. It is absolutely crazy, and the Congress \nrecognized this, to ``site'' an interim storage, whatever merit an \ninterim storage might have. Assume for the sake of argument there was \nsome conceivable merit to it, although I must say I find none and there \nis no compelling reason and none of the scientists tells us it ought to \nbe done. Assume for the sake of argument, no one agrees we should have \na site for interim storage until the permanent site is determined.\n  This chart depicts the transportation routes. Nevada is frequently \nthe focus because we wind up at the end. But there are over 50 million \nAmericans who will be affected within 1 mile or less of the site of the \nvarious transportation routes. This chart shows rail routes and highway \nroutes. Every American is placed at risk. That makes no sense, either. \nThat is why the current law, the law that would be changed by H.R. \n1270--no temporary facility until we make a judgment with respect to \nthe permanent.\n  I conclude as I began. There is a lot more to this than meets the \neye. The President of the United States has indicated he is going to \nveto this legislation and he has indicated the reasons for that. Bad \npolicy and bad science conclude that this ought not to be passed. The \nSpeaker of the House, who wears a different political jersey than the \nSenators of Nevada, indicates that this legislation is not going to be \nenacted or acted upon by the House this year. He made a similar \nstatement in 1996 and it was not processed.\n  So, why are we doing this? Why are we going off of the tobacco bill? \nCould it be that there are some in this Chamber who really don't want \nto see tobacco legislation enacted? There is no conceivable reason that \nwe have to have the vote on nuclear waste today. The leadership has \nevery right at any time to file a motion to invoke cloture under our \nrules to proceed to the bill, and it is simply a matter of time \nelapsing for that to mature. That could be done next week, the week \nthereafter, or in anticipation of the conclusion of the tobacco debate.\n  I respectfully submit, Mr. President, that the timing of this issue \nis highly suspect. To those of us who are committed to the tobacco \nlegislation, that is a priority in America. Can there be any greater \npriority than the young people in America, at a time when the data \nreflects that the rate of increase of youngsters under the age of 18 \nhas increased dramatically? We need comprehensive tobacco legislation. \nA vote invoking cloture jeopardizes that bill, may kill the tobacco \nlegislation. Oppose the cloture vote, we stay on tobacco. We do what \nthe American people have a right to expect us to do, and that is to act \non behalf of the young people of America.\n  I reserve any remainder of time I may have.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, as we begin our second week of debate on \nthe tobacco settlement legislation introduced by Senator McCain, we are \nfaced with a cloture vote on H.R. 1270, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. \nAs we all know, the issues surrounding nuclear waste storage are \nextremely complex, often contentious, and no simple solutions exist. \nWhile I do not agree with everything in the bill, I have supported \nlegislative action on this critical issue in the past and hope to in \nthe future. This country cannot afford inaction on this issue, and it \nis my hope that we will soon move to address this vital issue.\n  That being said, I oppose the effort to invoke cloture on H.R. 1270 \ntoday. We concluded one week of debate on a national tobacco settlement \nprior to the Memorial Day recess. That legislation, which is absolutely \ncritical to public health, and especially children's health, remains \nthe pending business before the Senate, and I cannot support any effort \nto substitute other legislation before this body at this time.\n  We all know the vital statistics surrounding underage tobacco use. \nEvery day, 3,000 children will start smoking. One thousand of them will \ndie prematurely from this addiction. It is time to pass comprehensive \ntobacco legislation that addresses the critical public health issues \ncaused by tobacco use. Such an approach will reduce teen smoking, \ninvest in public health research and programs to help smokers quit, and \nprotect tobacco farmers and their communities.\n  Let us keep in mind that the tobacco industry has carefully targeted \nchildren. They have done this because children are most vulnerable to \nnicotine addiction and they are most easily affected by slick \nadvertising and promotional ploys. The evidence is overwhelming that \nsmoking is a pediatric disease. Almost ninety percent of all people who \never try a cigarette, do so by age 18, and 71 percent of people who \nhave ever smoked daily were smoking by age 18.\n  My own state of South Dakota ranks second among all states in \nunderage tobacco use. Almost 40 percent of our high school kids smoke \ncigarettes, and even more use smokeless tobacco. Almost a quarter of \nall expectant mothers in South Dakota report using tobacco during \npregnancy; an appalling statistic that results in low birth weight and \nother natal difficulties.\n  Mr. President, we face an historic opportunity to address a critical \npublic health problem. I firmly believe that this legislation will be \nremembered as a dramatic change in our government's\n\n[[Page S5563]]\n\nefforts and policies. This bill will be one of the most socially \nsignificant items this Congress tackles. Therefore, I will oppose \ncloture on H.R. 1270 at this time. The Senate should maintain focus on \ntobacco legislation that will help our children withstand the pressures \nand inducements of the tobacco industry to addict them to tobacco \nproducts.\n  I must also express my frustration over a recent statement from the \nSpeaker of the House. He has apparently determined that the nuclear \nwaste conference report will not be considered by the House of \nRepresentatives. If that is the case, any further action on the Senate \nfloor is obviously for partisan political purposes, and I will not \nsupport furthering that goal.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I will vote against cloture on the motion to \nproceed to the House version of the nuclear waste bill, but I want to \nbe very clear that my vote does not change my strong support for \nnuclear waste legislation--and for passing such legislation this year. \nThe federal government must act to fulfill its legal responsibility to \nstore used fuel from more than 100 nuclear power plants across America. \nOver a decade ago, the federal government promised the ratepayers of \nWisconsin that it would take possession of all the spent nuclear waste \nin the State by 1998 and send it to the desert of Nevada for long-term \nstorage. On the basis of that promise, the ratepayers of Wisconsin have \npaid over $250 million into a fund to help pay for the construction of \nthe storage site. But we have seen no return on that investment, only \ndelays.\n  This vote today has nothing to do with nuclear waste. The fate of \nthat legislation lies in the House. The vote today is about tobacco--\nand whether we will continue to work on the strong tobacco control \nlegislation that we started on two weeks ago.\n  Let me be clear about that because most people watching this debate \noutside of Washington D.C. may not understand how these two important \nissues are linked. Very simply, if we invoke cloture right now, the \ntobacco bill will be bumped off the Senate floor and will not come back \nuntil the majority leader, and every Member of this body, agrees to \nbring it back. Though I think there is tremendous support for tobacco \nlegislation, I do not think there is unanimous support--and that's what \nwe would need to bring the bill up again.\n  So I will oppose cloture today, but I will continue to support the \nnuclear waste bill; I will vote for it if it comes up again this year; \nand I will support cloture motions related to it--as long as they are \nnot simply legislative maneuvers to kill other important initiatives.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. How much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 41 seconds and the other side has 4 \nminutes 14 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Would the Senator from Alaska or the Senator from Idaho \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am pleased to yield, but I would like to ask on \nwhose time.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I have no time.\n  I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to ask questions for no longer \nthan 2 minutes without counting against either side.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, in light of what the Speaker announced \nwere his intentions, is it your understanding that if we made any \namendment to this legislation and therefore caused it to have to return \nto the House, that we would essentially be defeating the legislation?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, if I may respond to my friend from \nFlorida, first of all, we have not been able to obtain a copy of any \nstatement from the Speaker. The statement that has been alluded to on \nthe floor is a statement by the Congressman from Nevada who is running \nfor the Senate office. He released a statement which indicated that the \nHouse leader would not take up the bill. We have not been able to \nconfirm that with the House leader.\n  It would be my intention to offer the Senate-passed bill, Senate bill \n104, with an addition of the Bingaman amendment, which was circulated \nat the time of the Senate consideration. If informal negotiations with \nthe House bear fruit, which they certainly have been, I will probably \noffer a perfecting amendment, but there is no agreement at this time.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Would the Senator not agree, in order to deal with the \nstatement that the Speaker made as well as his actions over the past \nperiod in frustrating the adoption of a Nuclear Waste Policy Act, we \nwould be well advised before we take up this cloture vote to adopt by \nunanimous consent agreement that no amendments would be in order to \nH.R. 1270, thus to assure that the bill would, if passed, go directly \nto the President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may respond, I don't have any type of vote counts \non the House bill, and I would have to defer from any guesstimate.\n  If I may reclaim my remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, we have heard tobacco brought into this \ndiscussion. Tobacco certainly is a problem. We recognize that. So is \nnuclear waste responsibility. We have that before the Senate now. But \nwith nuclear waste, the Government has a liability already established \nand established in a court of law. There is no such obligation with \nrespect to tobacco. We are trying to address that now.\n\n  On nuclear waste, we have collected $14 billion from the taxpayers \nfor its disposal. On tobacco, we have not collected one dime.\n  I also remind my colleagues we have had a unanimous consent request \nto take up tobacco next. It has been objected to by the minority \nleader.\n  So make no mistake about it, Mr. President, we spent a lot of time \ntrying to resolve this important issue. We are in the homestretch now. \nThe House bill got 307 votes, if there is any question about the \nattitude prevailing in the House. The Senate bill we are voting on \ntoday had 65 votes the last time. That is the kind of overwhelming \nbipartisan support--and there is no reason this bill should not be \npassed now. Democrats who were with us last time included Senators \nCleland, Graham, Harkin, Hollings, Johnson, Kohl, Leahy, Levin, \nMoseley-Braun, Murray, Robb, and Wyden.\n  The whole business is there today. The obligation remains here today \nto address this and not put it off. The Senators from Nevada say not \ntoday, not today, not today. Well, when? How many dollars does the \ntaxpayer have to address as far as his responsibility, when the \nratepayers have paid $14 billion and the taxpayers are now stuck for \nliability when we go to court and we don't have a resolve of this \nproblem. There is no use putting it off today. The time to act is now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity. I strongly \nsupport the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. As the Senator from Alaska just \nstated, I was one of the 65 Senators who voted for it when we last \npassed it. I think it is very important that we pass a Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act as part of a national effort to assure that nuclear energy \nwill continue to play a significant part in America's energy future. \nThis importance is underscored by the contribution which nuclear energy \ncan make to the United States meeting its global warming commitments \nwithout incurring major economic disruption in the rest of our economy.\n  I am concerned, however, Mr. President, that I do not believe what we \nare about this afternoon is serious legislation but, rather, is a \nsubterfuge. If I felt that by invoking cloture today and then passing \nit today or tomorrow we would move toward the adoption of the National \nWaste Policy Act, I would be a strong supporter. But the Speaker of the \nHouse, through a statement of an honorable Member of the House, has \nindicated that it is not his intention to take this legislation up in \nthe House of Representatives. Therefore, unless we are willing to adopt \nprecisely what the House has submitted and send it directly to the \nPresident for signature, any amendment that we might consider would \nhave the effect of dooming this legislation.\n  I am also concerned, Mr. President, that the effect of this would not \nonly be to send the Nuclear Waste Policy\n\n[[Page S5564]]\n\nAct to sure death in the House of Representatives, but it would also \nkill the tobacco bill here in the U.S. Senate. Without a unanimous \nconsent agreement that assures that we would return immediately to the \ntobacco legislation, I am unwilling to take the risk of removing it as \nthe business before the Senate and substituting the Nuclear Waste \nPolicy Act, as much as I support that legislation.\n  So for those reasons, I will vote against invoking cloture.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). There is 1 minute 30 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. REID. I yield 1 minute to my colleague from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Florida has cut to \nthe core of this issue. From the perspective of those who want this \nlegislation to proceed, the question of adopting the House bill without \namendment obviously moves that process forward. We are now told that, \nno, that is not the strategy, that we want to offer a so-called \nBingaman amendment; and then we hear that there is a so-called \nperfecting amendment, which nobody has seen. Out our way, that is \ncalled keeping some cards up your sleeve. We don't have any idea what \nwe are going to be asked to vote on. I think our colleague makes a good \npoint. I urge rejection of the motion to invoke cloture.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the action today is a waste of time. Let's \nmove to tobacco, to the Patients' Bill of Rights, to IRS reform, or to \nthe appropriations bills--13 in number--or let's move to school \nconstruction; let's do something that is worth while. The President \nsaid he will veto this. The Speaker has said he won't consider it. This \nis a waste of time.\n  I urge everybody to vote no on cloture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/02/senate-section/article/S5551-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question is now on the McCain amendment \nNo. 2446, as modified.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, so Members will have some idea--maybe a \nlittle better than I do--as to exactly how we are going to proceed----\n  Mr. FORD. May we have order, Mr. President, to listen to the majority \nleader?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Let's have order in the body, please.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe the pending business is the McCain amendment. \nSenator McCain had hoped he could have a recorded vote on his \namendment, but I know it has unanimous support. Because a number of \nSenators are having problems with schedules, Senator McCain has agreed \nthat we will go ahead and have a voice vote on his amendment. I thank \nhim for that cooperation. I know he feels very strongly about it, and \nit is the right thing to do for the veterans of our country. So that \nwill be then the next order, the voice vote.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Can we please have order in the body? The \nmajority leader has the floor and is discussing important business. May \nwe please have order in the body?\n  Mr. LOTT. After the McCain amendment is unanimously accepted, I am \nsure there will be some further general debate or discussion about the \ntobacco bill, and we will work then on exactly the time we will come in \non Thursday and when the first votes will occur with regard to the \nDurbin amendment or the Gramm amendment, or if they agree to set them \naside so we can go to other business we will make that announcement \neither later on tonight or tomorrow during the day, even though we will \nbe out. We will put it on the recording so Senators will know.\n  There will not be, it doesn't appear at this time, an early vote on \nThursday, but we do hope to get a couple votes before noon on Thursday. \nWe will be working on that. We will do this by voice vote, and that \nwill be the last vote for the night.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I wonder, if I can ask the majority leader \na question.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, just to make clear, that will be the last \nrecorded vote for tonight. We may be able to do other business by \nunanimous consent. I didn't want to leave the wrong impression there.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, if I can ask the majority leader, it is my \nunderstanding that there will be an effort to hot line the technical \ncorrections on the transportation legislation.\n  Mr. LOTT. There certainly will be, Mr. President. It is very hot. We \nare trying to get it done before it gets worse. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the McCain \namendment No. 2446.\n  The amendment (No. 2446), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased that my colleagues have \nagreed to secure a small piece of the tobacco revenue to improve \nveterans' access to health care. The amendment offered by my colleague, \nSenator McCain, is similar to an amendment I had planned to offer which \nwould have set aside $2.7 billion for veterans health care; and I am \ndelighted that he shares my views on this matter. In my view, given the \nsignificant increased costs of providing VA health care due to smoking-\nrelated illnesses, it only seems fair to do something to fortify the \nveterans' health care system.\n  Specifically, this amendment, Amendment No. 2446 to S. 1415, would \ndedicate $600 million per year of the spending included in the tobacco \nbill to help reimburse VA for their smoking-related expenses and expand \naccess for direct smoking-related services to other veterans.\n  I want to talk about the amount of funding for the moment. I arrived \nat this formula because the VA's increased costs due to smoking are \nabout 7 percent of the estimated total federal health care costs due to \ntobacco-related illnesses.\n  This amendment is really a modest one. I ask my colleagues to look at \nthe estimates for VA's cost of providing smoking-related health care. \nIn 1997, VA spent $3.6 billion, and over the next five years, will \nspend $20 billion.\n  I believe many of my colleagues would be surprised to learn that VA \nspends so much. But it is true. Veterans have a very high prevalence of \nsmoking-related diseases and illnesses, because as young \nservicemembers, they were encouraged to smoke by the military and \nbecame addicted. Let me remind my colleagues that the military \ndistributed free cigarettes in C-rations and K-rations and sold tobacco \nproducts at vastly reduced prices to service members, a practice that \ncontinued until very recently.\n  And in the aggregate, veterans are older, and, therefore, the long-\nterm effects of smoking are likelier to have taken a toll on their \nhealth status.\n  To put it all in perspective, we are not asking our colleagues to \napprove an amendment to completely reimburse VA for their full health \ncare costs--though many believe this would be justified. No, this \namendment would be limited to just a fraction of VA's true costs--\napproximately 15% of what they are actually spending taking care of \nveterans afflicted by diseases and illnesses caused by smoking.\n  Quite obviously, providing tobacco-related health care places a \ntremendous financial burden on the VA health care system. I want to \nmake one thing perfectly clear: because of limited resources, the VA \nhealth care system is not and has never been accessible to any veteran \nwho walks in the door. There is no entitlement to health care for all \nveterans.\n  Because all of the health care provided at VA hospitals and clinics \nis subject to the availability of funding, VA enrolls veterans \naccording to certain priorities. Those veterans with service-connected \ndisabilities, or low incomes, or those who are members of certain \ngroups, like former prisoners of war, are enrolled first, and second, \nand third, and so on.\n  With an essentially frozen budget, when VA covers the health care \ncosts for smoking-related care, it means that other veterans are denied \ncare.\n  Though modest, the amendment would do wonders to VA's ability to \nprovide more health care to veterans. Some 240,000 veterans who would \nnot gain access to VA's health care system would now be able to see VA \ndoctors and nurses. Veterans dying of smoking-related illnesses could \nspend their final days in VA hospices.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I find it quite ironic that this amendment \ncomes on the heels of the elimination of a $16 billion existing \nveterans' benefits to offset funding in the highway bill. That \nparticular battle has been lost, and nothing can make amends for \ncutting an existing veterans benefit to pay for highways. Though the \ndamage is done, I am pleased that my colleagues have chosen with this \namendment to provide a measure of security for veterans and the health \ncare system dedicated to serve their needs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/02/senate-section/article/S5564-4", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5565-S5567]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TEA-21 RESTORATION ACT\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, there has been a concerted effort by the \nmajority leader and the Democrat leader, Chairman Chafee, myself, and \nthe distinguished ranking member, Mr. Baucus, to try and get a voice \nvote tonight on a technical corrections bill to the ISTEA legislation \nwhich was adopted by the Senate just before we went on recess. I regret \nthat we are not going to be able to handle that matter tonight.\n  But a part of that very important Technical Corrections Act would \naddress an error that was made in the drafting of the bill which \nrelated to veterans. Being a veteran myself, and many others in this \nbody, we were quite concerned about that mistake. And the purpose of my \ntaking the floor now is to advise the Senate this matter will be \ncorrected in the TEA-21 Restoration Act, which is a euphemism for\n\n[[Page S5566]]\n\nthe Technical Corrections Act, when we get to it. We will renew or \nefforts on Thursday.\n  I think it is important to put in tonight's Record a little of the \nbackground how this mistake was made.\n  The TEA-21 Restoration Act, which is, as I said, the Technical \nCorrections Act, corrects drafting errors to section 8201, also known \nas the Veterans Benefits Act of 1998.\n  Specifically, the corrections to this subtitle of the conference \nreport relate to using funds estimated for the veterans smoking-related \ndisability benefits as a budget offset for transportation spending.\n  The use of funds identified to finance the veterans tobacco-related \nsmoking disability benefits for other domestic discretionary programs \nwas first proposed in President Clinton's fiscal year 1999 budget \nrequest.\n  The Senate budget resolution also identified these funds as potential \noffsets for transportation spending.\n  During the conference on the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \nCentury (TEA-21), the Senate and House leadership and the Clinton \nadministration agreed to use the funds estimated for the veterans \nsmoking-related disability benefit as an offset so that transportation \nspending would equal gas tax revenues collected for the highway trust \nfund.\n  The provision included in the conference report on TEA-21 to use the \nveterans smoking-related disability benefits for transportation was \ndrafted incorrectly and had the unintended consequence of identifying \nsmoking as an act of ``willful misconduct'' by veterans.\n  That was a tragic error, drafting error, that took place in the \nlegislative counsel's office. It was unintended.\n  I have gone back and read the code, found the section from which this \nconcept was withdrawn, and it was just one of those mistakes. There was \na great deal of rushed effort toward the end of this bill and those \ntypes of mistakes happen. What is most regrettable, it has caused a \ngreat deal of emotional stress among veterans. For that, I and many \nothers apologize.\n  Today, at our midday caucus, Senator McCain raised this matter and \nspoke most passionately on it, about his concern to have it corrected. \nThat is one of the reasons I have come to the floor tonight, to assure \nSenators if and when we get to this technical correction bill it will \nbe corrected.\n  The provision in the TEA-21 Restoration Act corrects any reference to \nsmoking as an act of ``willful misconduct'' by veterans.\n  This provision also clarifies that veterans who have filed claims for \nsmoking-related benefits are grandfathered.\n  The provision also makes clear that those active-duty service \npersonnel who have a smoking-related illness will continue to qualify \nfor disability compensation.\n  Another correction in this bill relates to ensuring that survivors \nand their dependents will receive the increased benefits of the \nMontgomery G.I. Bill provided in the conference report.\n  The offsets clarified in the TEA-21 Restoration Act remain those that \nwere identified in the President's budget request and the Senate budget \nresolution.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks a letter from the Executive Office of the \nPresident dated May 29, 1998. This is a transmission from the President \nthrough the Office of Management and Budget to advise the Senate on how \nbest to make this correction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1)\n  Mr. WARNER. I also ask unanimous consent immediately following that \nto have printed in the Record a copy of the bill to be known as the \nTechnical Corrections Act, or Restoration Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2)\n  Mr. WARNER. This afternoon, Chairman Chafee and the ranking member, \nMr. Baucus, and myself had a meeting of the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works. It was well attended by Members. We explained this \nsituation and how there were three committees working on this important \npiece of legislation. Of course, the committee of original \njurisdiction, the Environment and Public Works, another committee of \noriginal jurisdiction, the Banking Committee, which dealt with the mass \ntransit part of the bill, and also throughout Chairman Domenici and the \ndistinguished ranking member, the Senator from New Jersey, Senator \nLautenberg, worked with us from the standpoint of the Budget Committee, \nwhich had an important role, of course, in the offset issue.\n  So many people were involved--three staffs, three committees. We \nregret sincerely that this error took place. We hope we have taken the \nappropriate corrective measures.\n  This language has been submitted to the veterans committee for \nreview. I understand the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Rockefeller, \nwill have some views to express on this matter, and also the Budget \nCommittee. There is a report to the Senate and to those who are \nfollowing this issue in hopes that we can put to rest a very serious \nproblem which was accidental, I am convinced of it. We regret most \nsincerely, speaking to myself and I think many other veterans, that \nthis caused such consternation among the veterans of the United States.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                              Office of Management and Budget,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 29, 1998.\n\n                         Note for Bill Hoagland\n\n     From: Jack Lew\n     Subject: Technical Corrections to the TEA Bill\n       Attached per our conversation is the Administration's \n     original legislative proposal for the Veterans tobacco \n     offset, which would correct all of the problems created by \n     the language included in the enrolled TEA bill. We have \n     drafted this as an amendment to TEA that would delete the \n     incorrect language and insert the original Administration \n     proposal.\n       We are continuing to discuss administrative remedies with \n     the Department of Veterans Affairs, but those discussions \n     have not yet reached a final conclusion.\n       Please call me if you have any questions.

POOLER TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE \n                         FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I congratulate Judge Rosemary Pooler on her \nconfirmation as a member of the Second Circuit. She has been providing \na great service as a United States District Court Judge in the Northern \nDistrict of New York. President Clinton nominated her last November to \nfill a vacancy on the Second Circuit. I worked very hard to have her \nincluded in a prompt confirmation hearing, was finally able to get her \nincluded in a hearing on May 14 and, with the cooperation of Chairman \nHatch, have her reported by the Judiciary Committee on May 21. With her \nconfirmation, Judge Pooler becomes the second woman to serve as a \nmember of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\n  Ironically, her confirmation also brings into sharp relief the harm \nthat is being perpetuated in the Northern District of New York by the \nSenate's refusal to consider Clarence Sundrum, another nominee for a \nlongstanding vacancy on an overburdened court. Mr. Sundrum was first \nnominated in September 1995, over two and one-half years ago. The \nvacancy has long been considered a judicial emergency. This judicial \nnomination is the oldest pending judicial nomination before the Senate. \nAfter two hearings and almost three years, Mr. Sundrum has still not \nbeen considered by the Judiciary Committee or the Senate.\n  I was very disappointed that Judge Pooler was not confirmed before \nthe Senate left for its Memorial Day recess. Along with the \nconfirmations of Judge Sonia Sotomayor, Robert Sack and Chester Straub, \nher confirmation will help end the continuing emergency caused by the \nvacancy crisis on the Second Circuit. I want to thank the Majority \nLeader for calling up the nomination of Judge Rosemary Pooler today and \nChester Straub yesterday.\n  As I noted most recently on May 21 and May 22, the Second Circuit is \nsuffering from an unprecedented emergency caused by the vacancies \ncrisis on that court. We have had four nominees before the Senate for \nmany months who together could help end this crisis.\n  On March 25, the five continuing vacancies on the 13-member court \ncaused Chief Judge Ralph Winter to certify a circuit emergency, to \nbegin canceling hearings and to take the unprecedented step of having \n3-judge panels convened that include only one Second Circuit judge. On \nApril 23, Chief Judge Winter was forced to issue additional emergency \norders.\n  The people of the Second Circuit need additional federal judges \nconfirmed by the Senate. Indeed, the Judicial Conference of the United \nStates recommends that in addition to the current vacancies, the Second \nCircuit be allocated an additional two judgeships to handle its \nworkload. The Second Circuit is suffering harm from the vacancy crisis \nand Senate inaction.\n  This past weekend the Second Circuit held its annual circuit \nconference. I was pleased that this year's meetings could be held in \nManchester, Vermont, and congratulate Chief Judge Murtha of the \nDistrict Court of Vermont on the success of those meetings.\n  In connection with the annual conference, the Chief Judge of the \nSecond Circuit issued his annual report. Chief Judge Winter \nconcentrates on ``the problem, now chronic as well as aggravated, of \nobtaining resources equal to the jurisdictional responsibilities \nentrusted to the Court.'' In particular, he notes that the filings with \nthe Court of Appeals rose 20 percent over the last two years while its \nactive judges went down by 33 percent, from 12 to eight.\n  After thanking the senior judges, district judges and visiting judges \nfrom other circuits, without whom the Second Circuit ``would have been \nengulfed by a backlog that would not be amenable to future reduction,'' \nhe went on to note:\n\n       The semblance of normalcy, however, is still just a \n     semblance. Ten panel days in April and June had to be \n     canceled outright. Seven panels were able to hear cases only \n     after I certified that a judicial emergency existed so that \n     the panel could proceed with only one member of the court and \n     two visiting judges. The number of pending cases is \n     increasing at an alarming rate, and the Court has the largest \n     backlog in its history.\n  The Chief Judge had some blunt talk for congressional critics.\n  He concludes:\n\n       The political branches have steadily increased our federal \n     question jurisdiction, have maintained an unnecessarily broad \n     definition of diversity jurisdiction, and then have denied us \n     resources minimally proportionate to that jurisdiction. That \n     is the problem. The result is that a court with proud \n     traditions of craft in decision-making and currency in its \n     docket is now in danger of losing both.\n\n  I conclude by noting my regret that the Senate is not proceeding to \nconsider the longstanding nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor. I will \ncontinue to press for her confirmation and that of Robert Sack to the \nSecond Circuit. I have been urging favorable Senate action on the \nnomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit for many \nmonths.\n  Judge Sonia Sotomayor is a qualified nominee who was confirmed to the \nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of New York in \n1992 after being nominated by President Bush. She attended Princeton \nUniversity and Yale Law School. She worked for over four years in the \nNew York District Attorney's Office as an Assistant District Attorney \nand was in private practice with Pavia & Harcourt in New York. She is \nstrongly support by Senator Moynihan and Senator D'Amato. She is a \nsource of pride to Puerto Rican and other Hispanic supporters and to \nwomen. When confirmed she will be only the second judge of Puerto Rican \ndescent to serve on the Second Circuit.\n  By a vote of 16 to 2, the Judiciary Committee reported the nomination \nof Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Senate. That was on March 5, 1998, \nalmost three months ago. No action has been taken or scheduled on that \nnomination and no explanation for the delay has been forthcoming. This \nis the oldest judicial nomination pending on the Senate Executive \nCalendar. In spite of a bipartisan April 9 letter to the Senate \nRepublican Leader signed by all six Senators from the three States \nforming the Second Circuit urging prompt action, this nomination \ncontinues to be stalled by anonymous objections. Our bipartisan letter \nto the Majority Leader asked that he call up for prompt consideration \nby the Senate the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor. That was almost \nthree months ago.\n  I do not know why this distinguished jurist, who was nominated by \nPresident Bush to the District Court and by President Clinton to the \nCourt of Appeals, is being denied consideration by\n\n[[Page S5568]]\n\nthe Senate. I have heard from the Hispanic Caucus and a number of bar \nassociations in support of her confirmation and have to tell them that \nI cannot dispel the impression that they have that she is being delayed \nbecause she is Hispanic.\n  Last Friday, Paul Gigot speculated in a column in the May 29 Wall \nStreet Journal that Judge Sotomayor might be a top candidate for the \nUnited States Supreme Court should a vacancy arise there. Although his \ncolumn mischaracterizes her and her judicial record, it confirms the \nimpression of so many that she is being penalized for being an \naccomplished Hispanic woman.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the April 9, 1998 letter to \nthe Majority Leader from Senators Moynihan, D'Amato, Dodd, Lieberman, \nJeffords and myself be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 9, 1998.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: On March 23, faced with five vacancies \n     on a 13-member Court, Chief Judge Winter of the United States \n     Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit certified the \n     judicial emergency caused by these vacancies, began canceling \n     hearings and took the unprecedented step in the Second \n     Circuit of authorizing 3-judge panels to be composed of two \n     visiting judges and only one Second Circuit Judge. The \n     Judiciary Committee has reported to the Senate the nomination \n     of Judge Sotomayor by a vote of 16 to 2. Three additional \n     outstanding Second Circuit nominees are pending before the \n     Judiciary Committee and await their confirmation hearings: \n     Judge Rosemary Pooler; Robert Sack, a partner in the law firm \n     of Gibson Dunn & Crutcher; and Chester J. Straub, a partner \n     in the law firm of Wilkie Farr & Gallagher.\n       We urge prompt and favorable action on the nomination of \n     Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Second Circuit when the Senate \n     returns on April 20 and thank you for your consideration of \n     this important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Patrick Leahy,\n     Alphonse D'Amato,\n     James Jeffords,\n     Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Joseph Lieberman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/02/senate-section/article/S5567-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NATIONAL CENTER FOR MISSING AND EXPLOITED CHILDREN\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today as an original cosponsor of \nthe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children Authorization \nAct of 1998. I applaud the Senator from Utah's fine efforts in support \nof this important legislation.\n  The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) has an \nextraordinary record of success. The Center boasts a recovery rate that \nhas grown from 62% to 91% over the past 14 years. This particular \nlegislation directs the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \nPrevention (OJDDP) at the Department of Justice to issue annual grants \nto the NCMEC in the amount of $10 million for fiscal years 1999-2003. \nThe $10 million is an authorization and is subject to appropriations \nprocedures.\n  The bill will allow the Center to bypass the competitive selection \nprocess it must go through to obtain grant money from the OJDDP on an \nannual basis. Moreover, by providing an authorization, the bill will \nalso allow for increased Committee oversight of the Center's \nactivities.\n  This bill will better enable the Center to pursue national efforts to \nlocate and recover missing children. It will also aid the NCMEC, in \nconjunction with the U.S. Department of Justice, in raising public \nawareness about ways to prevent child abduction, molestation, and \nsexual exploitation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me, Senator Hatch, Senator DeWine, and a \nnumber of our colleagues in supporting this worthwhile bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/02/senate-section/article/S5568-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are now in what should be one of our \nmost productive and thoughtful legislative periods this year. Many \nimportant items are pending before the Senate, and there is no reason \nto believe that we cannot successfully address each of them. We must \nact to protect the nation's children from tobacco, and we must move \nforward on appropriations and authorization bills. But, there are many \nother important measures waiting to be brought to the floor. Patients \nacross the country are urging Congress to enact the ``Patients' Bill of \nRights.'' I would like to take this opportunity to share with members \nof the Senate another tragic story that demonstrates the need for \naction.\n  This is a story about Mrs. Peggy Earhart of Sun Valley, California. \nAt the age of 63, she was being treated by her HMO for arthritis. Her \ntreatment required her to visit her doctor every six to eight weeks for \ncortisone injections. During a period of treatment, she noticed a mole \non her ankle. She brought this mole to her doctors' attention, but her \ndoctor reassured her that it looked fine and she need not worry about \nit.\n  Initially, she trusted her doctor's judgment. As the mole changed \nshape and color, she brought these changes to the attention of her \ndoctor, who looked at the mole again and assured Mrs. Earhart that it \nwas fine. On the next visit, Mrs. Earhart once again pointed out \nchanges in size and color, and again, the doctor did nothing.\n  Worried and exasperated, Mrs. Earhart requested a change of doctor. \nShe filled out the necessary paperwork and waited--and waited, and \nwaited. Six months later, the HMO finally responded, permitting her to \nsee another physician. The first time she saw the new doctor, he \nexamined the mole and immediately referred her to a dermatologist. The \ndermatologist took a biopsy and found that the ``mole'' was in fact a \nmalignant melanoma.\n  Further tests were ordered, which showed that the cancer had \nmetastasized. It was then too late to treat Mrs. Earhart, and she died \na year later.\n  As this tragic story shows, the heart of the issue is providing \npatients with access to needed health care--a guarantee that patients \nshall receive the care they paid for with their hard-earned premiums.\n  In talking about the rights of patients, it is no answer to simply \nsay ``Let the Patient Beware.'' Purchasing health insurance is not like \nbuying a car, and it never will be.\n  Patients deserve to know that, if they notice something wrong and \nreport it to their doctor, their health needs will be met. Mrs. Earhart \nshould have been treated by the appropriate specialist, without the \nlong delay that ultimately cost her life.\n  Mrs. Earhart should have had access to an appropriate review \nprocedure that would have allowed her to seek outside help in time. Her \nfamily should have been able to hold the health plan accountable for \nits actions, and for the inexcusable delay that took her life.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights provides these protections and more. The \nSenate should act on this bill as soon as possible. It has the strong \nsupport of more than 100 organizations, representing millions of \npatients, doctors, nurses, working families and consumers. Every day we \ndelay, more tragedies like this take place. They shouldn't have to \nhappen to any family, and they won't happen when this needed \nlegislation is enacted into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/02/senate-section/article/S5568-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5568-S5569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:32 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution, without amendment:\n\n       S.

A bill to forgive certain debt owed by the city of \nDickinson, North Dakota; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n                       private relief legislation\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill to permit \nthe Secretary of the Interior to accept a one-\n\n[[Page S5570]]\n\ntime, lump-sum payment from the city of Dickinson, North Dakota, in \nlieu of the annual payments required under the city's existing \nrepayment contract for construction of the ``bascule gates'' on the \nDickinson Dam on the Heart River. In exchange for reducing the debt the \nCity would pay, this legislation calls on the City to work to improve \nthe water quality on Patterson Lake. This bill would resolve a long-\nstanding issue for the City of Dickinson and the Bureau of Reclamation.\n  Mr. President, the history of the Bascule Gates is long and complex. \nThe Bureau of Reclamation constructed the Dickinson Dam on the Heart \nRiver in 1949 and 1950 to supply water to the city of Dickinson, and \nfor flood control, recreation, and other purposes. The reservoir \ncreated by this dam was named Patterson Lake in about 1960.\n  The need for additional water supply for the city was identified in \nthe early 1970s, and the bascule gates were constructed in the early \n1980s, to provide additional water storage capacity in Lake Patterson. \nAt the time, the City expressed reservations over the cost of the \nbascule gates and the viability of the gates, since the City was not \naware of any other location in a northern climate in which the gates \nhad been tested or proven. In 1982, shortly after the gates were \noperational, a large ice block caused excessive pressure on the \nhydraulic system, causing it to fail. Construction modifications were \nmade to the gate hydraulic system and a de-icing system was added in \n1982, adding further costs to the project.\n  In 1991, the city began to receive its municipal water supply from \nthe Southwest Pipeline Project, a project constructed in part with \nfunds provided for North Dakota's statewide water project, the Garrison \nDiversion project, which is another Bureau of Reclamation project. The \nSouthwest Pipeline brings high-quality water from Lake Sakakawea on the \nMissouri River to the City of Dickinson and other communities in \nsouthwest North Dakota. The water is of much higher quality that the \nwater from the city's previous supply from Lake Patterson, and has \nhelped spur economic development in the region. While the citizens of \nthe area now benefit from a higher quality water supply, the City no \nlonger benefits from the additional water supply provided by the \nbascule gates. The result is the City is paying for two Bureau of \nReclamation projects, while it is using water from only one of those \nprojects for its municipal water supply. The City has repaid more than \n$1 million to the United States for the bascule gates, despite the fact \nthat the gates now provide almost no direct benefit to the City.\n  The City has previously investigated alternatives to the current \nsituation. The City has discussed the option of assuming title to the \ndam and bascule gates, as well as attempting to negotiate a new \nagreement with the Bureau of Reclamation administratively. However, \nbecause the terms of the existing contract are outlined statutorily, \nnew legislation is required to make any changes to the current \nrepayment contract.\n\n  The legislation I am introducing today would do four primary things. \nFirst, it would permit the Interior Secretary to accept a lump-sum \npayment of $150,000 from the City and terminate the remaining annual \npayments required under the existing repayment contract. This would end \nthe issue of paying for the construction of these gates for both the \nCity and the Federal government.\n  Second, my bill would require the Secretary to reallocate the costs \nof operation and maintenance for the bascule gates and the Dickinson \nDam. The bill does not prescribe any particular reallocation formula, \nbut does require the Secretary to consider the fact that the current \nbenefits of the dam and bascule gates are primarily for flood control, \nrecreation, and fish and wildlife purposes. In my view, operation and \nmaintenance costs should be borne by those who benefit from a \nparticular project.\n  Third, this legislation would permit the Secretary to enter an \nagreement with the City to give the city responsibility for improving \nthe water quality and recreation value of the lake. The City has \nexpressed its interest in developing the area to promote and enhance \nrecreation and the environment in the area. In recent years, the City \nhas been working with the U.S. Geological Survey and the North Dakota \nDepartment of Health and Department of Game and Fish to improve the \nlake's water quality.\n  Finally, my bill would permit the Secretary to enter any appropriate \nwater service contracts in the future if the city uses water from \nPatterson Lake for its municipal water supply or for other purposes. It \nis only fair that if the City benefits in the future from the water \nstored behind the bascule gates that we preserve an option for \nrecovering additional costs from those beneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, this legislation represents a win-win situation for \nthe residents of the Dickinson area and for the Federal government. I \nhope this Congress will carefully study this issue and quickly pass \nthis important legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the bill and a \nletter from the City Administrator of Dickinson be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2127\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Bureau of Reclamation constructed structures known \n     as the bascule gates on top of the Dickinson Dam on the Heart \n     River, North Dakota, to provide additional water supply in \n     the reservoir known as Patterson Lake for the city of \n     Dickinson, North Dakota, and for additional flood control and \n     other benefits;\n       (2) the gates had to be significantly modified in 1982 \n     because of damage resulting from a large ice block causing \n     excessive pressure on the hydraulic system, causing the \n     system to fail;\n       (3) since 1991, the City has received its water supply from \n     the Southwest Water Authority, which provides much higher \n     quality water from the Southwest Pipeline Project;\n       (4) the City now receives almost no benefit from the \n     bascule gates because the City does not require the \n     additional water provided by the bascule gates for its \n     municipal water supply;\n       (5) the City has repaid more than $1.1 million to the \n     United States for the construction of the bascule gates, and \n     has been working for several years to reach an agreement with \n     the Bureau of Reclamation to alter its repayment contract;\n       (6) the City has a longstanding commitment to improving the \n     water quality and recreation value of the reservoir and has \n     been working with the United States Geological Survey, the \n     North Dakota Department of Game and Fish, and the North \n     Dakota Department of Health to improve water quality; and\n       (7) it is in the public interest to relieve the United \n     States from further risk or obligation in connection with the \n     collection of construction costs for the bascule gates by \n     providing for a single payment to the United States in lieu \n     of the scheduled annual payments and for the termination of \n     any further repayment obligation.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITION.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Bascule gates.--The term ``bascule gates'' means the \n     structure constructed on the Dam to provide additional water \n     storage capacity in the Lake.\n       (2) City.--The term ``City'' means the city of Dickinson, \n     North Dakota.\n       (3) Dam.--The term ``Dam'' means Dickinson Dam on the Heart \n     River, North Dakota.\n       (4) Lake.--The term ``Lake'' means the reservoir known as \n     ``Patterson Lake'' in the State of North Dakota.\n       (5) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior, acting through the Commissioner of the \n     Bureau of Reclamation.\n\n     SEC. 3. FORGIVENESS OF DEBT.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary shall accept a 1-time \n     payment of $150,000 in lieu of the existing repayment \n     obligations of the City under the Bureau of Reclamation \n     Contract No. 9-07-60W0384, dated December 19, 1988.\n       (b) Ownership.--Title to the Dam and bascule gates shall \n     remain with the United States.\n       (c) Costs.--\n       (1) In general.--In consultation with the City and the \n     State of North Dakota, the Secretary shall reallocate \n     responsibility for the operation and maintenance costs of the \n     Dam and bascule gates.\n       (2) Consideration of benefits.--The reallocation of costs \n     shall reflect the fact that the benefits of the Dam and \n     bascule gates are mainly for flood control, recreation, and \n     fish and wildlife purposes.\n       (d) Water Quality.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary shall enter into an \n     agreement with the City to make activities to improve water \n     quality of the Lake and to enhance the recreational value of \n     the Lake the responsibility of the City .\n       (2) Assistance.--The City may seek the assistance of \n     Federal agencies to assist in improving the water quality of \n     the Lake.\n\n[[Page S5571]]\n\n       (e) Water Service Contracts.--The Secretary may enter into \n     appropriate water service contracts if the City seeks to use \n     water from the Lake for municipal water supply or other \n     purposes.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                            City of Dickinson,\n\n                                     Dickinson, SD, March 3, 1998.\n     Senator Kent Conrad,\n     c/o Kirk Johnson,\n     Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Kirk: Thanks for your call this morning. As I said on \n     the phone, the city of Dickinson is grateful for the \n     assistance Senator Conrad is providing to the City as a means \n     of resolving the Bascule Gate issue. Following our \n     conversation, I spoke to our City Attorney, Tim Priebe and \n     asked him to consider any points that he feels might add to \n     our argument necessitating legislation on this matter. I have \n     included his input in developing the points to consider in \n     developing the legislation.\n       Here are a few ideas we came up with:\n       The city of Dickinson has never agreed with the placement \n     of the Bascule Gate device on Dickinson Dam.\n       The Bureau of Reclamation has been unable at this point to \n     provide us with information showing other locations in \n     northern climates, affecting by severe winter conditions, in \n     which Bascule Gates have been used.\n       We feel the Bascule Gates have more of a flood control \n     benefit than the water impoundment benefit that the City \n     sought in the 1970's prior to the installation of the gates.\n       Since 1991, the city of Dickinson has benefited greatly \n     from a new source of water, the Missouri River, which was \n     made possible through the construction of the Southwest \n     pipeline. For this reason, the City no longer uses Patterson \n     Lake as a water source.\n       The Southwest Water Authority has informed the City that it \n     has no desire to ever use Patterson Lake as a backup source \n     of water.\n       The city of Dickinson has a long standing commitment to the \n     maintenance Patterson Lake as a recreational resource, the \n     improvement of water quality and the extension of the \n     possible life of Patterson Lake. In recent years, the City \n     has actively participated in a study headed by the US \n     Geological Survey and the North Dakota Department of Health \n     to study the Patterson Lake watershed as a means of \n     identifying potential threats to Patterson Lake and water \n     quality due to both sediment and nutrient loading. The final \n     document for this study was produced in December, 1997.\n       In accordance with Bureau of Reclamation recommendations, \n     the City recently worked on the transfer of Patterson Lake, \n     Dickinson Dam and related properties from the US Government \n     to the city of Dickinson as a means of resolving the Bascule \n     Gate issue. This effort was abandoned over local concerns \n     regarding the potential liability the City might be taking on \n     if the effort were successful. Prior to abandonment of the \n     transfer issue, the City paid for studies, the outcome of \n     which was a direct benefit to the public. These included a \n     cultural resources study and beginning work on a NEPA study. \n     We understand that the Bureau of Reclamation used the \n     information gathered and completed the studies, which will \n     have a long lasting benefit by having cultural resources and \n     potential cultural resources identified.\n       In recent years the City has been working with the North \n     Dakota Department of Game and Fish to improve water quality \n     in the lake and thereby increase its usefulness as a fishery.\n       Also while discussing this matter with Tim Priebe, he \n     suggesting referring to a document prepared a few years ago \n     in conjunction with Senator Dorgan's office and the North \n     Dakota State Water Commission. It points more toward the \n     recreation and environmental aspects of this effort, rather \n     than simply an asset buydown. I am enclosing a copy of that \n     study.\n       If I can be of further assistance, please let me know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Greg Sund,\n\n                                       City Administrator.\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. STEVENS:\n  S. 2128. A bill to clarify the authority of the Director of the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation regarding the collection of fees to \nprocess certain identification records and name checks, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                           no gun tax of 1998\n\n Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I introduce for proper referral \nthe No Gun Tax Act of 1998 to address the implementation of the \nNational Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) which takes \neffect November 30, 1998.\n  As you know, the Brady Act had two provisions: an interim provision, \nwhich will expire on November 29, 1998, and permanent provision which \nwill take effect on December 1, 1998. The permanent provision mandates \nthe establishment of a National Instant Criminal Background Checks \nSystem (NICS). The operation of the NICS will be the responsibility of \nthe Justice Department.\n  The Department of Justice now proposes to charge fees for the NICS \nusing the authority of a provision in the 1991 Commerce, Justice, State \nAppropriations Act (Public Law 101-515)--an Act that was passed two \nyears before the NICS program and which was never intended to allow \nfees under the NICS program. This limited 1991 authority allowed fees \nonly ``to process fingerprint identification records and name checks \nfor non-criminal justice * * * and licensing purposes.'' It was not \nintended to apply to programs like the NICS program, which checks the \ncriminal background of purchasers and has nothing to do with licensing.\n  For years I and others pushed for the instant check system as the \nmost thorough and efficient way to ensure that criminals cannot buy \nfirearms. The imposition of a fee would encourage some to try to obtain \nfirearms on the black market. No matter how you feel about gun control, \nwe should all do what we can to make sure the new background check \nsystem works.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord. I urge all of my colleagues to support this very important \nbill.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2128\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This act may be cited as the ``No Gun Tax Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. IDENTIFICATION RECORDS AND NAME CHECKS FEES.\n\n       The first paragraph under the subheading ``Salaries and \n     Expenses'' under the heading ``Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation'' in title II of Public Law 105-515 (28 U.S.C. \n     534 note) is amended by adding at the end thereof the \n     following new sentence: ``Notwithstanding the foregoing or \n     any other provision of law, the Director may not collect any \n     fee, assessment, third party collection, or other charge from \n     any person or agency in connection with any background check \n     required under subsections (s) or (t) of section 922 of title \n     18, United States Code.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 2129. A bill to eliminate restrictions on the acquisition of \ncertain land contiguous to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n         hawaii volcanoes national Park adjustment act of 1998\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, in behalf of myself and Senator Dan \nInouye, I am introducing legislation today that would enable the \nNational Park Service to acquire a valuable parcel of land at the \nsouthern tip of the Island of Hawaii for inclusion in Hawaii Volcanoes \nNational Park (HVNP).\n  My bill, which is supported by the Administration, would revise \nHVNP's enabling act to allow the Secretary of the Interior to use \nappropriated funds to acquire a certain 1,951-acre tract of privately \nheld land on the southern boundaries of the park. HVNP's existing \nstatutory authority precludes the acquisition of additional contiguous \nproperties except by donation.\n  Mr. President, the small parcel of land that the Park Service wishes \nto acquire is clearly defined by the ``Great Crack,'' a landform which \nextends to the summit of the Kilauea Caldera and is characterized by \nextensive pili grasslands. The area contains historic and prehistoric \nlava flows with related geological features, major lava tube systems of \nsignificant biological and cultural value, and over two miles of \ncoastal environment with associated cultural sites and marine \nresources.\n  Located adjacent to HVNP's designated Wilderness Area, one of the \nmost remote areas of the wilderness in Hawaii, the proposed acquisition \nwould be managed as undeveloped land sharing the same wilderness \nqualities of natural quiet, grand vistas, and solitude.\n  Mr. President, the acquisition of this parcel will significantly \nenhance the environmental and cultural values of Hawaii Volcanoes \nNational Park. I hope that my colleagues will support this measure.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the full text \nof my bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5572]]\n\n                                S. 2129\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Hawaii Volcanoes National \n     Park Adjustment Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Res. 100\n\n       Whereas the traditional policy of the United States, \n     reiterated by this Administration, has been to vigorously \n     pursue and apprehend terrorists who have killed American \n     citizens in other countries;\n       Whereas numerous American citizens have been killed by \n     Palestinian terrorists, most of them in Israel or the Israeli \n     administered territories, including 9 since the signing of \n     the Oslo Accords in 1993, namely Nachshon Wachsman (New York, \n     Alisa Flatow (New Jersey), Sara Duker (New Jersey), Matthew \n     Eisenfeld (Connecticut), Joan Davenny (Connecticut), David \n     Boim (New York), Yaron Ungar (New York), Leah Stern (New \n     Jersey), and Yael Botwin (California);\n       Whereas at least 20 of the terrorists suspected in the \n     killings of American citizens in Israel or the Israeli \n     administered territories during 1993-1997 have been \n     identified by Israel as Mohammed Dief, Nabil Sharihi, Nafez \n     Sabih, Imjad Hinawi, Abd al-Maid Dudin, Adel Awadallah, \n     Ibrahim Ghneimat, and Mahmoud Abu Hanudeh, Abd al-Rahman \n     Ghanelmat, Jamal al-Hur, Raid Abu Hamadayah, Mohammad Abu \n     Wardah, Hassan Salamah, Abd Rabu Shaykh'Id, Hamdallah \n     Tzramah, Abd Al-Nasser Atallah Issa, Hataham Ibrahim Ismail, \n     Jihad Mahammad Shaker Yamur, and Mohammad Abbasm;\n       Whereas, according to the Israeli Government, 10 of those \n     20 terrorist suspects are currently believed to be free men;\n       Whereas the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1986 permits the \n     prosecution, in the United States, of individuals who murder \n     American citizens abroad; and\n       Whereas the United States has previously acted to bring to \n     justice those responsible for the deaths of American citizens \n     and has established a precedent of United States intervention \n     by demanding that Libyan leader Moammar Qadaffi transfer to \n     the United States the Libyan terrorists suspected of bombing \n     Pan Am flight 103: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) the United States should demand the prosecution of all \n     suspected perpetrators of these attacks against the United \n     States citizens;\n       (2) the United States should seek the cooperation of the \n     Palestinian Authority and all other appropriate authorities \n     in the prosecution of these cases; and\n       (3) the suspects should be tried in the United States \n     unless it is determined that such action is contrary to \n     effective prosecution.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this measure expresses the sense \nof the Congress regarding the murder of U.S. citizens by Palestinian \nterrorists. This resolution addresses specific concerns that I have \nregarding the failure of the Palestinian Authority to apprehend and \nbring to justice perpetrators of terrorist acts involving American \ncitizens who have been killed in recent months and years in terrorist \nattacks in Israel. A companion resolution, introduced by Congressman \nJon Fox, passed the House by a vote of 406-0 on May 5, 1998.\n  Since the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993, at least nine American \ncitizens in Israel have been killed by Palestinian terrorists. They are \nour parents, our children, and our citizens. The traditional policy of \nour nation has been to pursue and apprehend any terrorists who have \nkilled American citizens abroad. This in no way contravenes or \nconflicts with either international or constitutional law. While \ncriminal jurisdiction is customarily limited to the place where the \ncrime occurred, it is well established constitutional doctrine that \nCongress has the power to apply U.S. law extra territorially if it so \nchooses. United States versus Bowman, 260 U.S. 94, 98 (1922). It was on \nthe basis of this doctrine that I spearheaded efforts to enact the \nAnti-Terrorism Act of 1986, which extended the reach of U.S. criminal \njurisdiction to acts of violence perpetrated against Americans anywhere \nin the world. But, making murder committed by terrorists a U.S. crime \nwill not, on its own, protect Americans abroad. We must also \ndemonstrate our seriousness by applying the law regularly and \nconsistently.\n  At the heart of the Anti-Terrorism Act was the fundamental notion \nthat international terrorists are criminals and ought to be treated as \nsuch--they should be promptly located, apprehended, and brought to \ntrial for their heinous crimes. The United States government in \nconjunction with the government of Israel knows the location of 10 of \nthe 20 terrorists suspected in the murders of these United States \ncitizens. I am aware that from March 6-10, an interagency task force \ncomprised of individuals from the Department of State, Justice \nDepartment, FBI and National Security Commission was in Israel in the \nPalestinian controlled areas to investigate the deaths of these \nAmericans. Cooperation from the Palestinian Authority is critical as \ninvestigative authorities attempt to discover and develop evidence for \nprosecution. However, the Palestinian Authority has failed to cooperate \nand has not honored requests for the transfer of many of these \nsuspects.\n  The Anti-Terrorism Act of 1986 provides the necessary subject matter \njurisdiction to prosecute those who attack U.S. citizens abroad. But, \nto obtain personal jurisdiction over the culprits themselves, the \nsuspect must first be seized or arrested and brought to the United \nStates to stand trial. Under current constitutional doctrine, both U.S. \ncitizens and foreign nationals can be seized and brought to stand trial \nin the United States without violating due process of law. Frisbie \nversus Collins, 342 U.S. 519, 522 (1952).\n  My resolution calls for the United States to demand the prosecution \nof all suspected perpetrators of these attacks against United States \ncitizens by seeking the cooperation of the Palestinian Authority and \nall other appropriate authorities in the prosecution of these cases. In \naddition, my resolution calls for these suspects to be tried in the \nUnited States unless it is determined that such action is contrary to \neffective prosecution.\n  We must utilize all our laws properly and remain persistent in \nseeking justice for these American families. We must remain vigilant in \nour search for all suspected perpetrators of these atrocious attacks \nagainst U.S. citizens. I urge my colleagues to support this measure and \nto help push for justice in this important matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/02/senate-section/article/S5573-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5573-S5575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 240--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE WITH RESPECT \n TO DEMOCRACY AND HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE LAO PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC\n\n  Mr. THOMAS (for himself, Mr. Grams, and Mr. Smith of Oregon) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations.\n\n                              S. Res. 240\n\n       Whereas in 1975, the Pathet Lao party supplanted the \n     existing Lao government and the Lao Royal Family, and \n     established a ``people's democratic republic,'' in violation \n     of the 1962 Declaration on the Neutrality of Laos and it's \n     Protocol, as well as the 1973 Vientiane Agreement on Laos;\n       Whereas since the 1975 overthrow of the existing Lao \n     government, Laos has been under the sole control of the Lao \n     People's Democratic Party;\n       Whereas the present Lao Constitution provides for human \n     rights protection for the Lao people, the Laos is a signatory \n     to international agreements on civil and political rights; \n     and\n       Whereas Laos has become a member of the Association of \n     Southeast Asian Nations, which calls for the creation of open \n     societies in each of its member states by the year 2020;\n       Whereas despite that, the State Department's ``Country \n     Reports on Human Rights Practices for 1997'' notes that the \n     government has only slowly eased restrictions on basic \n     freedoms and begun codification of implementing legislation \n     for rights stipulated in the Lao Constitution, and continues \n     to significantly restrict the freedoms of speech, assembly \n     and religion; and\n       Whereas on January 30, 1998, the Lao government arrested \n     and detained forty-four individuals at a Bible study meeting \n     in Vientiane and on March 25 sentenced thirteen Christians \n     from the group to prison terms of three to five years for \n     ``creating division among the people, undermining the \n     government, and accepting foreign funds to promote \n     religion;'' Now therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That it is the sense of the Senate \n     that the present government of Laos should--\n       (1) respect international norms of human rights and \n     democratic freedoms for the Lao people, and fully honor its \n     commitments to those norms and freedoms as embodied in its \n     constitution and international agreements, and in the 1962 \n     Declaration on the Neutrality of Laos and it's Protocol and \n     the 1973 Vientiane Agreement on Laos;\n       (2) issue a public statement specifically reaffirming its \n     commitment to protecting religious freedom;\n       (3) fully institute a process of democracy, human rights \n     and openly-contested free and fair elections in Laos, and \n     ensure specifically the National Assembly elections--\n     currently scheduled for 2002--are openly contested.\n\n\n[[Page S5574]]\n\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, today as the Chairman of the Subcommittee \non East Asian and Pacific Affairs I submit S. Res. 240, a resolution \nexpressing the sense of the Senate with respect to democracy and human \nrights in Laos.\n  In 1975, the Pathet Lao party supplanted the legitimate Lao \ngovernment and the Lao Royal Family, and established a ``people's \ndemocratic republic,'' in violation of the 1962 Declaration on the \nNeutrality of Laos and its Protocol, as well as the 1973 Vientiane \nAgreement on Laos. Since that time, Laos has been under the sole \ncontrol of the communist Lao People's Democratic Party.\n  Although the present Lao Constitution provides for human rights \nprotection for the Lao people, is a signatory to international \nagreements on civil and political rights, and has become a member of \nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations--which calls for the \ncreation of open societies in each of its member states by the year \n2020--the State Department's ``Country Reports on Human Rights \nPractices for 1997'' notes that the government has only slowly eased \nrestrictions on basic freedoms and begun codification of implementing \nlegislation for rights stipulated in the Lao Constitution, and \ncontinues to significantly restrict the freedoms of the press, speech, \nand assembly.\n  Mr. President, would-be opposition political leaders in Laos continue \nto be jailed in horrible conditions solely because they espouse \ndemocratic ideals. While Laos recently conducted the country's most \nopen elections since 1975, that is not to say that the elections came \nclose to meeting even the minimal norms for what we would consider free \nand fair; Laos is still a one-party state and all of the candidates for \nelection were vetted by the party. And the Hmong and Yao ethnic \nminorities continue to face discrimination and, in some cases, \npersecution.\n  In addition, on January 30 of this year, a group of 44 people, \nincluding five foreigners, were arrested at a Bible study meeting in \nVientiane. Charged with creating divisions among the people, \nundermining the government and accepting foreign funds to promote \nreligion, a Laotian court sentenced 13 Christians from the group to \nprison on March 25. Eight were sentenced to three-year prison terms, \nincluding five Lao affiliated with Partners in Progress (PIP), a U.S.-\nbased evangelical humanitarian aid organization. Lao authorities had \nprevented the prisoners from meeting with their families until the \nsentencing.\n  Last month the Lao Foreign Ministry accused the group of making \nnegative comments about the government and interfering in the internal \naffairs of the country by insulting the reputation of Lao leaders. A \nforeign ministry spokesman added that the three Americans, all PIP \nworkers, had taken advantage of their non-governmental organization \nstatus to ``promote the worship of Christ'' to Lao nationals.\n  Mr. President, Laos doesn't receive a lot of attention from the \noutside. It is a land-locked, impoverished country of just slightly \nover five million people, where only three percent of the land is \narable. Subsistence farming accounts for more than half of the GDP, and \nprovides more than eighty percent of total employment. It has few \nroads, no railroads, and electricity in only a few scattered urban \nareas. Needless to say, it is of little strategic or economic interest \nto the rest of the world.\n  But Mr. President, that does not mean that we can or should turn a \nblind eye to the human rights situation in that country. We need to \nurge Laos to respect international norms of human rights and democratic \nfreedoms for the Lao people, and fully honor its commitments to those \nnorms and freedoms as embodied in its constitution and international \nagreements. The resolution calls on the Lao government to issue a \npublic statement specifically reaffirming its commitment to protecting \nreligious freedom, and to fully institute a process of democracy, human \nrights and openly-contested free and fair elections in Laos, and ensure \nspecifically that the National Assembly elections--currently scheduled \nfor 2002--are openly contested. I hope they get the message.\n  Mr. President, before I close I would like to thank my good friend \nfrom Minnesota, Mr. Grams, for cosponsoring--indeed, for inspiring--\nthis resolution. Senator Grams has significant Lao and Hmong \npopulations in his state, and has been active in getting their message \nheard in Congress; I've attended several meetings, including one with \nmembers of the Lao royal family, which he sponsored. I would also like \nto thank my friend the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Smith, for his \ncosponsorship; there is a large Hmong population in Portland, and I \nknow Senator Smith has followed events in Laos closely.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Thomas as co-\nsponsor of S. Res. 240, a resolution which hopefully will focus more \nCongressional attention on the situation in Laos. With 50,000 Hmong and \n7,000 other ethnic Lao living in Minnesota, I am well aware that the \natrocities being committed in that country and the lack of progress \ntoward a democratic government are far more serious than press reports \nwould lead us to believe. It is rare indeed that any of us, even those \nof us who serve on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, ever hear \nanything about Laos. Yet many Lao and Hmong fought with us in the \nVietnam War. In fact, they are still being ``punished'' for their \nloyalty to the United States through continued violence against them by \nthe Lao government. But, the State Department recently responded to an \ninquiry I made by saying they do not see evidence of abuses.\n  We owe the Hmong and other Lao a great debt of gratitude for their \nservice during the Vietnam War. We owe them our renewed efforts to end \nthe violence in Laos and to enforce the agreements signed by Communists \nin Laos in 1962 and 1973 which committed them to a coalition government \nincluding the Lao Royal Family. As you may know, this government was \noverthrown in 1975, and now the country is under sole control of the \nLao People's Democratic Party.\n  Since there has been so little focus on Laos, Mr. President, there \nhas been little progress there. While the Lao government approved a \nConstitution in 1990 claiming human rights protection, and while Laos \nhas signed international agreements on civil and political rights and \nis a member of ASEAN, the record shows these promises are being \nignored.\n  Several months ago, the United Lao Movement for Democracy of \nMinnesota hosted a staff briefing. The briefing included a videotape \nwhich showed death, violence, and evidence that ``yellow rain'' has \nbeen used against Lao citizens recently--despite comments by the State \nDepartment these atrocities do not exist. We were told during the \nbriefing that the ``killing fields'' are still going on in the \ncountryside, mostly against the Hmong. The leaders of the Minnesota \ngroup, Shoua Cha, Xiong Pao Moua, and Cha Vang have been instrumental \nin calling these atrocities to our attention and maintaining valuable \ncontact with the people of Laos. There were many cries on the tape that \nwar hero General Vang Pao should return to Laos to help stop the \nviolence.\n  Mr. President, the Thomas-Grams resolution expresses Senate \nopposition to human rights abuses in Laos, including religious \npersecution. It calls for free and fair elections and a process toward \ndemocracy.\n  I would like to call attention to one American, Steve Young, an \nexpert and activist in Indochinese matters for over 30 years. Steve has \nhelped us focus on problems in Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam, and I have \nalways valued his counsel. If Steve, and my many Hmong and Lao \nconstituents, say there is a serious problem here, I believe them. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that an article by Steve Young \nprinted in the May 14, 1998 edition of the Minneapolis Star Tribune be \nprinted in the Record.\n  Mr. President, to those seeking changes in Laos, this resolution \nprovides hope. I ask that my colleagues give it their support, as an \nexpression by the Senate of our renewed interest in improving the \nsituation in Laos. Please join me in co-sponsoring this resolution and \nfacilitating its passage in the near future.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     In Putting Laos Out of Sight, America Has Abandoned Its Honor\n\n                            (By Steve Young)\n\n       Laos: on the losing side of history, one of only four \n     remaining Communist states, a\n\n[[Page S5575]]\n\n     genuine backwater in international affairs, a little country \n     with no geopolitical importance, no raw materials, no \n     seaport, no beautiful beaches, no ski resorts.\n       Why should I, or anyone else, care a whit about Laos?\n       The Lao people have no Dalai Lama to win friends and \n     influence Hollywood; their ancient royal family is also in \n     exile but commands no attention. Their holy relic, the \n     Prabang Buddha statue, is rumored to be in Moscow, hidden \n     away as a now-forgotten and irrelevant trophy of the Cold \n     War.\n       Fifty thousand Hmong people from Laos now live in \n     Minnesota, along with some 7,000 ethnic Lao. But is that any \n     reason to care about the tiny, faraway homeland of a people \n     who don't speak English?\n       Life in Laos is hard, especially for the Hmong, for the \n     ethnic Khamu people and for the poor. The country's Communist \n     leadership is awful. There are arbitrary arrests, no economic \n     development, lousy schools, no free speech. Corruption is \n     rampant.\n       The self-centered whims of Communist Party cadres are the \n     law.\n       Opium is still a cash crop in Laos, feeding the world's \n     supply of heroin. Communist officials, it is said, protect \n     and profit from the vile traffic.\n       With help from the United States, many Lao and Hmong fought \n     the Communists until 1973. Then, the United States walked \n     away to ``give peace a chance,'' as John Lennon demanded.\n       Today, years later, fighting still goes on. The Hmong in \n     the hills are still loyal to the cause of the United States \n     in the Cold War. They don't understand why the Americans went \n     into a sulk and gave up fighting an evil political movement.\n       In December and January, and again in March, Communist Lao \n     forces numbering several battalions attacked Hmong hamlets on \n     the slopes of the Phu Bia mountain massif. Communist forces \n     were repulsed. Their wounded filled the military hospital in \n     the capital city of Vientiane.\n       In the far south of Laos, the Khamu people have turned \n     against their former patrons--Lao and Vietnamese Communists. \n     Young Khamu men have taken to the jungles to fight and put on \n     their left arms the white elephant patch of the Lao royal \n     family.\n       American officials in Vientiane make the best of a tour of \n     duty in a place that counts for nothing except oppression. \n     They argue for a form of appeasement, calling it \n     ``constructive engagement.''\n       Poor little Laos: Back then, its needs were hidden behind \n     the secrecy of an unpublicized war. The grim fighting, the \n     terror for innocent villagers, the heroism of the Hmong, the \n     illegalities of the Vietnamese Communists in invading a \n     neutral country were out of sight and out of mind for the \n     experts and gurus whose duty it is to tell our collective \n     national psyche when, and how, and for whom to emote \n     compassion.\n       Today, Laos is equally forgotten and still the victim of \n     that past war. The bad guys won.\n       In putting Laos out of sight, America has abandoned its \n     honor.\n       Promises were made to the peoples of Laos by the American \n     government, among others. International agreements were \n     signed in 1962 by all the great powers, pledging peace, \n     neutrality, multiparty government. In 1973 the promises were \n     renewed; yet again treaties were signed. International law \n     protected the peoples of Laos, so it was said. Henry \n     Kissinger got a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts.\n       In 1975 the Communists broke their agreements, killed the \n     king, queen, crown prince and many others--all to impose the \n     justice of a really stupid ideology and, let us not forget, \n     to gain a little joie de vivre for themselves.\n       A solution to the continuing troubles in Laos is at hand. \n     The Communists need only return to the agreements they signed \n     in 1962 and 1973, restoring coalition government, the \n     monarchy and human freedoms. Such a Laos would be a buffer \n     between Thailand and Vietnam, adding to the peaceful \n     stability of Southeast Asia. Such a Laos would also protect \n     Vietnam from penetration by China through the mountains \n     around Dien Bien Phu.\n       To forget the promises made is willfully to choose \n     dishonor.\n       We can mediate successfully in Northern Ireland, we send \n     troops to watch over ethnic brutality in Bosnia, we mobilize \n     to crack down on Saddam Hussein's inhumanities. Why can't we \n     care as well about Laos?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/02/senate-section/article/S5573-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 241--RELATIVE TO THE DEATH OF THE HONORABLE BARRY \n        GOLDWATER, FORMERLY A SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF ARIZONA\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Sessions) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n  Resolved, That the Senate has heard with profound sorrow and deep \nregret the announcement of the death of the Honorable Barry Goldwater, \nformerly a Senator from the State of Arizona.\n  Resolved, That the Secretary of the Senate communicate these \nresolutions to the House of Representatives and transmit an enrolled \ncopy thereof to the family of the deceased.\n  Resolved, That when the Senate recesses today, it stand recessed as a \nfurther mark of respect to the memory of the deceased Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/02/senate-section/article/S5575-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        NATIONAL TOBACCO POLICY AND YOUTH SMOKING REDUCTION ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 McCAIN (AND OTHERS) AMENDMENT NO. 2446\n\n  Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Bond, Mr. Campbell, Mr. \nRockefeller, Mr. Specter, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. \nLeahy, Mr. Coverdell, Ms. Collins, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Biden, Ms. \nMikulski, Mr. Hutchinson, and Mr. Sessions) proposed an amendment to \nthe bill (S. 1415) to reform and restructure the processes by which \ntobacco products are manufactured, marketed, and distributed, to \nprevent the use of tobacco products by minors, to redress the adverse \nhealth effects of tobacco use, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 403, beginning with line 3, strike through line 19 \n     on page 407, and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1301.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nvery special South Dakotan--Mary Mooney-Keith.\n  On July 1, 1998, Mary Mooney-Keith, of Rapid City, South Dakota will \nretire after many years of diligent service for the school children of \nSouth Dakota. Mary is retiring to a lifestyle where hopefully someone \ncan serve her just like all the years she served children through her \nwonderful food service career.\n  Mary's outstanding food service career allowed her to demonstrate her \nknowledge, leadership, and passion for nutrition at all levels. From \nher work at the small school district of Faith, South Dakota to her \nservice at Meade, South Dakota (one of the largest geographical \ndistricts in the nation), to her role at the South Dakota Child and \nAdult Nutrition Services, Mary always strived to make it her goal to \nmake the school nutrition program the best possible.\n  Mary's nutrition expertise did not stop in the classroom. She also \nwas very active in the School Food Service Association at the local, \nstate, and national levels. She held elected offices at all levels \nwithin the Association--including Midwest Regional Director.\n  Mary's passion for child nutrition came through in her teaching \nstyle. She wasn't the teacher who went in and just talked to her \nstudents. Instead, she went to a clown school in Wisconsin during the \nsummers and developed Mario the Clown'' to assist with her instruction.\n  Mary is the type of person whose career may not have made her famous \nor wealthy. But, for 32 years, Mary Mooney-Keith taught our most \nprecious citizens, our school children, one of the most important \nlessons in life--good nutrition. And, the greatest thing about it all, \nshe lived her life with one basic principle that sometimes we all \nforget, to simply be yourself.''\n  I am proud of Mary Mooney-Keith and offer her my best wishes in her \nupcoming retirement. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/02/senate-section/article/S5576-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5576]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TOM WHITTAKER REACHES EVEREST SUMMIT\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \ncongratulate a former Idahoan on his successful climb of the world's \ntallest peak.\n  Mr. President, last month I reported to the Senate a story of my \nconstituents who were climbing Mount Everest. While the climb is not a \nnew adventure to the world, the climbers are. A group of disabled \nIdahoans, led by former Idahoan Tom Whittaker, successfully reached the \nbase camp of the Everest peak on May 19. On May 27 Tom continued on to \nthe summit with another group, becoming the world's first amputee to \nreach the top.\n  Tom had fallen ill the week prior to his final ascent; however, he \nwould not be deprived of his ultimate goal. He had tried unsuccessfully \nto make the climb twice in the past, but was forced back by bad \nweather. This time, at the Everest website, climbers from around the \nworld are congratulating Tom on his achievement, writing, ``May his \nsuccess inspire you to follow your dreams and know that your abilities \nare far more important than your disabilities, whatever they may be.''\n  I would like to share that sentiment with America today. Tom did not \nget to his goal without hard work and sacrifice. He did not succeed on \nthe first try. But he would not be denied his dream, and in my mind, \nTom Whittaker has set an example to be emulated by all.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/02/senate-section/article/S5576-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S5577]]\n             OHIOAN NAMED SMALL BUSINESS PERSON OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \noutstanding entrepreneurial achievement of a resident from my home \nstate of Ohio, Mr. Ross O. Youngs. The President of Univenture \nIncorporated, Ross was recently named as Small Business Person of the \nYear. The decision was made by Vice President Al Gore and Aida Alvarez, \nAdministrator of the Small Business Administration. Mr. Youngs was \nselected from a highly competitive field of 53 small businesses \nrepresenting all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and \nGuam.\n  Ross Youngs began Univenture 10 years ago with an idea, hard work, \nperseverance and a limited budget. In the long standing tradition of \nthe American Entrepreneur, Ross took a $20,000 personal bank loan and \nstarted a company in his basement. Over the following nine years, two \nSmall Business Administration guaranteed loans helped Mr. Youngs expand \nproduction. Sales have risen in 10 years from $111,000 to $15 million. \nRoss Youngs' company Univenture has proven itself to be an outstanding \nexample of American small business.\n  Univenture is not only a successful company but also a contributor to \nthe community in a number of ways. The firm works with a local \norganization to employ people with disabilities, Univenture supports \nthe Columbus Police Department's Shop-With-A-Cop Program to provide \ngifts for needy children during the holiday season and contributes to \nthe Wexner Center for the Arts.\n  Mr. Youngs continues to be an example of outstanding achievement in \nbusiness and his community. It is with great pride that I recognize Mr. \nRoss Youngs as the National Small Business Person of the Year during \nNational Small Business Week. I extend my congratulations and wish him \ncontinued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/02/senate-section/article/S5577-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CRIME IDENTIFICATION TECHNOLOGY ACT\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today as an \noriginal cosponsor of the ``Crime Identification Technology Act'' \nrecently introduced by my colleague from Ohio, Senator DeWine. I \napplaud the Senator from Ohio's fine efforts in getting this important \nbill introduced and shepherding it through the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee so quickly.\n  In my view S. 2022 will provide significant assistance to federal, \nstate, and local law enforcement groups as they work to integrate their \nidentification, information, communications, and forensic systems. \nCurrently, federal, state, and local crime databases are not \nuniversally maintained in a format that makes them compatible with one \nanother. Right now law enforcement officials often have trouble \naccessing information and transferring it among themselves.\n  Important technologies such as the Integrated Automated Fingerprint \nIdentification System (IAFIS) which is operated by the Federal Bureau \nof Investigation (FBI), the National Integrated Ballistics Network, and \nthe National Incident-Based Reporting System all would be much more \neffective if all states and localities had compatible systems. The \nfederal government has provided agencies with the funds necessary to \ncreate this technology. Unfortunately, a number of states, and local \ncommunities in particular, often have not had sufficient funds to \nimplement them. Moreover, particular states and localities often lack \nsufficient incentive to standardize because standardization's benefits \nbecome clear only if all states and localities participate. Thus it is \nimportant that the federal government provide assistance in order to \nmaintain a uniform national system.\n  The ``Crime Identification Technology Act'' will better enable \nfederal, state, and local governments to work in tandem in the fight \nagainst crime. In a nutshell, this bill authorizes $250 million in \ngrant money over five years to states in conjunction with local \ngovernments and Indian tribes, to establish or improve information and \nidentification technologies and make them more compatible with one \nanother and with federal systems. Grants will be distributed by the \nBureau of Justice Statistics, which will consult with the Governor of \neach state to determine how much money is needed and for which \nprograms. For example, some states may feel they need better \nfingerprint-scanned devices while others may want to integrate their \nballistics programs into the National Integrated Ballistics Network.\n  Federal and state governments share an interest in the interstate \ncompatibility of these technology systems and in quickly identifying \nwhether an individual has a federal, state, or local record. Ensuring \nthe accuracy and accessibility of criminal history records must be a \njoint endeavor among law enforcement agencies at all levels. This \nlegislation will be of critical assistance in bringing this about.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me, my colleague from Ohio, the Chairman \nand Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, and a number of other \ncolleagues in supporting this important piece of legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/02/senate-section/article/S5577-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRIBUTE TO ADMIRAL CHARLES R. LARSON, UNITED STATE NAVY\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to honor a \nremarkable naval officer and good friend, Admiral Charles R. Larson. \nHaving served a distinguished career in the United States Navy, Admiral \nLarson will enjoy a well deserved retirement after forty years of \nservice. Over his forty years of service, Admiral Larson has served in \n11 positions, spanning more than nineteen years as a flag officer. \nAdmiral Larson is a man of honor, integrity, and patriotism.\n  For the past four years, Admiral Larson has served as the 55th \nSuperintendent of the United States Naval Academy. It was in this \nposition that I got to know and admire him. Under Admiral Larson's \nleadership, honor and discipline were restored following the most \nscandal-ridden period of the Academy's history. As a member of the \nNaval Academy Board of Visitors, I worked closely with Admiral Larson \nas he developed and implemented his successful reform agenda. I was \nhighly impressed with the tough choices he had to make to change the \nAcademy. Under his leadership, he led the full integration of women \ninto the academy. He also initiated many new programs and improved the \ncurriculum. Always he led the midshipmen by example.\n  We in Maryland are very proud of the United States Naval Academy. It \nis important to our state and our nation. The Board of Visitors \nrecently conducted a comprehensive investigation of the Naval Academy. \nWe concluded that while we must continue to improve the Naval Academy, \nthis vital national resource is on the right track and will produce \ntop-notch cadets for the twenty-first Century. Admiral Larson's \nleadership is what made this possible.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to commend Admiral \nLarson's wife, Sally, and his family, who have greatly contributed to \nthe success of his naval career. I ask my colleagues to join me in \nthanking Admiral Larson for his service to our nation. I wish Admiral \nLarson the very best for the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/02/senate-section/article/S5577-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5577-S5579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HARBOR MAINTENANCE TAX\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, since colonial times, waterborne \ncommerce has been key to the economic growth and vitality of our \nNation. It has been especially important for my home state of \nLouisiana. The entire U.S. economy, and that of Louisiana, depends on \nan efficient and reliable transportation system to remain competitive \nin domestic and international markets. Navigable channels, railways, \nhighways, and ports are links in the transportation chain that allow \nmanufacturers, buyers, and sellers to send and receive goods quickly, \nsafely, and efficiently. Congress has recognized the importance and \nneed for promoting a system of seamless intermodal connections, from \nship to shore, and then to rail or truck, and ultimately to the \nconsumer's local retail store. The original ISTEA legislation, was \nnamed for intermodalism, in recognition of the importance of fostering \nand promoting intermodalism, and I am confident that ISTEA II will \ncontinue our efforts to expand and modernize the infrastructure needed \nto facilitate intermodalism.\n\n[[Page S5578]]\n\n  Continued adequate investment in our Nation's transportation \ninfrastructure, including federal navigation channels, is critical. In \nfact, in Louisiana we have literally hundreds of miles of navigable \nwaterways crisscrossing our state. The resulting benefits of this \nwaterway system are efficient access to a wide variety of products and \nservices, internationally competitive exports, and lower costs for \nconsumers. Maintaining deep draft navigation channels is one of the \nmost important, and least understood, factors in maintaining an \nefficient national transportation system. The need for both maintenance \nand deepening of navigational channels will drastically increase as \nvessel operators continue to switch to newer and larger vessels.\n  The most modern and largest container ships available today are \ncapable of carrying over 6,000 TEUs. By way of comparison, this cargo \nload would translate into a train length of over 27 miles. However, \nthese vessels require navigable channels in excess of 45 feet of depth \nin order to get into port in a fully laden mode. We can have the \ngreatest system of intermodal infrastructure available, but if the \ngigantic vessels that will be plying the seven seas cannot enter our \nports, our importers and exporters will not benefit, and we will lose \nthe competitive advantages of having cheap and safe transportation.\n  U.S. port development and maintenance is currently a shared \nresponsibility of federal, state, and local governments, with extensive \nprivate sector participation. Under this relationship, rooted in the \nU.S. Constitution, the Federal government has maintained harbor access \nchannels and contributed a share towards channel improvements, while \nindividual ports construct and maintain the land-side terminal \nfacilities, including developing rail and highway access, dredging \ntheir own shipping berths, and contributing to channel improvement \ncost-sharing programs.\n  Since 1789, the Federal Government has authorized navigation channel \nimprovement projects, and the General Survey Act of 1824 established \nthe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as the agency responsible for the \nNation's navigation system. Relying in good faith on this long-standing \npartnership, local port authorities spend approximately $1.3 billion \nannually to construct and maintain the land-side facilities. These \nlocal investments have been paid for through state taxes and bonds and \nhave resulted in a port system that can be relied on to meet our \ncountry's national defense needs and accommodate our ever growing \ninternational trade.\n  Traditionally, the Federal Government funded maintenance dredging of \nfederal navigation channels from General Treasury revenues. However in \n1986, Congress enacted the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund to pay for a \nportion of channel maintenance dredging. Revenue for this trust fund is \ngenerated by assessing a fee, the ``Harbor Maintenance Tax'' or HMT, on \nthe value of export, import, and domestic cargo moving through the \nnation's deep draft ports. At the same time, local cost-sharing was \ninstituted for funding new construction projects. These projects allow \na Port to either widen or deepen navigable channels. By way of \ncontrast, on the inland waterways, operations and maintenance costs are \npaid out of the General Treasury, and new construction costs are \nfunded, in part, by an inland waterways fuel tax.\n\n\n          The Funding for Maintenance Dredging is in Jeopardy\n\n  Recently, the Supreme Court has ruled that the Ad Valorem nature of \nthe HMT and the surplus of revenues in the HMT makes it a tax rather \nthan a user fee, and that the collection of the HMT violates Article I, \nsection 9, clause 5 of the U.S. Constitution which restricts Congress \nfrom enacting taxes or duties on U.S. exports. As a result of this \ndetermination, the U.S. Customs Service has been forced to cease \ncollection of the HMT on exports. In addition, previous to the \ndetermination of the Supreme Court, the European Union challenged the \nHMT as a tariff barrier and an unfair trade practice under GATT. It \nwill be unlikely that we will now be able to prevail in a GATT panel in \na challenge to the HMT given that we only would collect the HMT for \nimported items.\n\n\n     The Federal Government Must Resume Responsibility for Channel \n                              Maintenance\n\n  The debate over the creation of a user fee in 1986 to fund \nmaintenance dredging was a long and acrimonious one and one that \ndivided the port, shipper, and carrier communities. Congress recognized \nand considered that the assessment of a tonnage fee on cargo or vessels \nwould have severely affected bulk commodities, such as grain or coal, \nwhich compete in international markets where even the slightest price \nfluctuation can make or break a sale. The final product, assessing an \nAd Valorem fee on cargo, ending up adding hundreds of dollars to the \ncost of shipping a single container of high value cargo, such as \nelectronic equipment or computers, has caused traffic to be diverted to \nnon-U.S. ports to avoid payment. For instance, the imposition of the \nHMT caused a railcar-carrier service on the Great Lakes to go out of \nbusiness.\n  When the HMT was enacted in 1986, Congress tried to be sensitive to \nthe impact of a user fee on trade, and set the HMT at a level to \ncollect 40 percent of the costs thought to be required to cover \nmaintenance dredging. However, in 1990 in the budget agreement, \nCongress tripled the fee with very little debate, and since then the \ntrust fund has accumulated a $1.2 billion surplus and that surplus has \nbeen projected to grow to $1.9 billion by the end of fiscal year 1999.\n  The cost of maintenance dredging is expensive, and many U.S. ports \ncould not perform routine maintenance dredging programs given the scope \nof the need of certain ports and the hydrographical particulars of \ncertain channel waterways. Without routine maintenance dredging, many \nof these channels would be rendered unnavigable. It should be \nremembered that the prime beneficiaries of adequately maintained \nnavigation channels are not the ports themselves, although local port \ncommunities do benefit from the economic activity generated through the \nport, but U.S. producers and consumers. In fact, the beneficiaries \ninclude the entire national economy, as well as the Federal Government, \nas well as the vessels of the U.S. Navy, Coast Guard, and other public \nagencies which travel our navigable channel waterways--all benefit from \nthe public sector payments into the HMT to defray maintenance dredging \ncosts.\n  Without today's access to ports, there would be fewer and more \nexpensive transportation options. U.S. exports would suffer as \nproducers' transportation costs increased, thus decreasing our \ninternational competitiveness and the availability or accessibility of \ncertain imports. Since 95% of U.S. international trade moves through \nour ports, the channels and harbors must be kept safe and navigable \nthrough essential routine maintenance by removing sediment that can \nclog shipping lanes.\n\n\n  User Fees for Dredging Hurt Our International Trade Competitiveness\n\n  Imposing new taxes on trade to fund maintenance dredging would run \ncounter to our government's trade promotion efforts. Our nation cannot \nhope to reap the economic benefits of the global marketplace without \nproviding the infrastructure necessary to transport those goods as \ncheaply and efficiently as possible. A 1993 General Accounting Office \nstudy found that 12 Federal agencies already levy 117 assessments on \nwaterborne trade. Making our exports more expensive through additional \nfees makes the U.S. less competitive in international markets.\n  U.S. ports annually handle more than one billion metric tons of \ninternational trade cargo valued in excess of $600 billion. Customs \nrevenues in FY 1996 totaled $22.3 billion, of which roughly 70 percent \n(or $15.6 billion) is attributable to seaport activity. International \ntrade's impact on the U.S. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is growing by \nastronomical bounds. In 1970, trade represented only 13 percent of U.S. \nGDP. By 1996, trade had grown to account for 30 percent of GDP, or \nabout $2.3 trillion. More than 11 million U.S. jobs now depend on \nexports, and this figure represents an increase of 1.5 million jobs in \njust four years. Significantly, the wages earned by workers \nmanufacturing goods for export are, on average, 13-17 percent higher \nthan non trade-related jobs.\n\n[[Page S5579]]\n\n                              Why Dredge?\n\n  Over 90 percent of the nation's top 50 ports in foreign waterborne \ncommerce, including ports in Louisiana, require regular maintenance \ndredging. Together these ports move nearly 93 percent of the volume of \nall U.S. waterborne commerce. Routine maintenance dredging is necessary \nin many parts of the country to remove sediment from rivers and harbors \nthat builds up due to tidal and other hydrographical forces. Without \ndredging, many port facilities and navigation channels would be \nrendered unsafe and non-navigable to users in less than a year. For \nexample, the Columbia River accumulates sediment at a rate of five to \nsix feet a year in some areas. Without routine dredging, areas of the \nnavigation channel that serves the water highway for many ports in \nOregon and Washington State could change from a 40-foot to a 35-foot \ndeep channel in one year. Since 90% of the ship traffic use the maximum \ndepth of the channel, such a dramatic change would prohibit many ships \nfrom entering the channel or force ships to carry only a fraction of \ntheir intended load, making their voyages expensive and inefficient.\n  Failure to adequately maintain navigation channels affects not only \nthe local economy around the port, but has far-reaching impacts \nthroughout the country. For example, agricultural and natural resource \nproducts such as grain or timber will be unable to reach export \nmarkets. In addition, imports such as clothing, consumer electronics, \nand automobiles will become more scarce and expensive. Since ships and \nports provide the means to facilitate the flow of interstate and \ninternational commerce, the Federal Government should bear a large \nportion of the responsibility to ensure that these trade conduits \nremain viable.\n\n\n       The Economic Benefits of Waterborne Shipping are Plentiful\n\n  The economic benefit of our waterborne system is nationwide: goods \nfrom 27 states leave the country through the ports in Louisiana alone. \nMidwestern grain supplies the Pacific rim market through ports in the \nPacific Northwest. Crude oil that is brought to and refined in New \nJersey and Pennsylvania reaches consumers on the entire East Coast--\nfrom Maine to Florida. Steel that travels to major Midwestern \nindustrial centers is delivered cheaply and efficiently through ports \non the Great Lakes. Ports on the West Coast handle high value goods \ndestined for consumers throughout the country.\n  Costs associated with waterborne shipping are three to four times \nless per ton-mile than any other freight transportation, and waterborne \nshipping is the most cost effective method of freight movement. Our \nwaterborne transportation efficiency contributes mightily to our \nability to compete in the price sensitive bulk commodity markets. Grain \nand coal are just two examples of price-sensitive bulk commodities. \nBecause shipping contracts can hinge on a few tenths of a cent per \nbushel of grain or ton of coal, transportation costs can be the \ndeciding factor for foreign buyers choosing between American or foreign \nbulk products.\n  Maintaining the right channel depth allows U.S. commodities to stay \ncompetitive. For each foot of draft vessel depth not dredged, vessels \ncarry less product--making each voyage less efficient and more costly. \nFor instance, maintaining a channel at 43 feet instead of 44 feet may \nmean the difference of 750 tons of additional coal capable of being \nloaded on a ship. Properly maintained channels can make or break a \ncontract in the international marketplace.\n\n\n             Safety and Environmental Benefits of Dredging\n\n  Making waterways safe for navigation is one of the most important \nbenefits of routine maintenance dredging. Deepened channels that \naccumulate sediment become dangerous because they increase the chance \nof ships running aground. Groundings are expensive not only in cargo \nand time lost, but groundings may also pollute the environment if \nships' hulls are breached and cargo is spilled. The cost of responding \nto and cleaning up oil pollution impacts everyone. Well-maintained \nchannels eliminate any surprise shoalings or buildups that may cause \nmishaps harmful to the environment.\n  When waterways are not regularly dredged, ships have to be lightered; \nthat is, they have enough cargo removed to smaller, shallower vessels \nso that the primary ship is light enough to enter the harbor safely. \nAside from the additional handling costs associated with the practice \nand the loss of time and potential productivity, lightering of bulk \nliquids increases the chance of spillage and pollution.\n  Waterborne freight transportation is also the most efficient mode of \nsurface transportation in terms of fuel use per ton-mile. Waterborne \ncommerce contributes the least amount of pollution in terms of \nhydrocarbons, carbon monoxide, and nitrous oxide emitted per ton-mile, \nand is also the safest in terms of death or injury per ton-mile. \nWaterborne shipping emits five times fewer hydrocarbons than trains and \nseven times fewer than trucks. A shift of less than 1 million tons of \ncargo from ship to truck would increase fuel use by a factor of ten, \nand probable accidents by a factor of six annually.\n\n\n                      Future Role of U.S. at Stake\n\n  Since the first wooden vessels arrived on our shores, this nation has \nrelied on and prospered due to its access to water and thereon to the \nrest of the world. Both economically and strategically, thereby are no \ngreater national assets than our ports and federal navigation \nchannels--our water connections to the global marketplace and our means \nof projecting our national defense.\n  Until 1986, the Federal Government fully funded the maintenance of \nour Nation's navigation channels, maintaining a partnership with state \nand local port authorities. Contributing to, and relying on this \npartnership, these local port agencies have invested billions of \ndollars in land-side terminals to develop the array of ports along our \nthree sea coasts, Great Lakes, and inland waterways. The HMT, \ninstituted in 1986 to recover first 40%, then 100%, and more, of \ndredging maintenance costs, has been ruled unconstitutional as applied \nto exports by the U.S. Supreme Court. Based both on this decision and \nthe rancorous debate during the 1980s, any alternative trade tax/user \nfee funding mechanism will have significant legal and political \nchallenges to overcome.\n  With the United States' future role in the global economy at stake, \nit is critical that we approach this issue delicately, and I would urge \nthe Administration to carefully review this issue and not rush to any \njudgment. This issue has too many different constituencies with an \nimportant stakeholder interest.\n  Accordingly, I have written to Secretary Slater to request his \nassistance in establishing a private sector task force to review the \nissues confronting any reformulated approach to maintenance dredging. \nAt a minimum, this task force should include various carrier and \nshipper interests and port and port-related labor interests and should \nallow the affected interests to air their concerns and make \nrecommendations. The problem that we face with the potential \nelimination of the HMT is severe, and any action to replace it, or \nreformulate it, should be done only after an informed airing of the \nissues from affected parties. Mr. President, this issue is critical not \nonly to Louisiana but to the entire country. I look forward to working \nwith all interested parties to develop a workable solution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/02/senate-section/article/S5577-4", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5579-S5580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nPRESIDENT CLINTON NAMES CLYDE J.

As always, other \nexecutive or legislative matters may be considered as they are cleared.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/02/senate-section/article/S5581-4", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "02", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5581]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECESS UNTIL 9:30 A.M., THURSDAY, JUNE 4, 1998\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.
