In this time of dropout dads \nand absentee fathers, when 21 million children in America live without \na father in their homes, we ask You to instigate a father movement.\n  Bless the families of our land. Stir fathers who have abdicated their \nleadership. When fathers are silent about their faith, children miss \nthe strength and courage of learning how to trust You with the ups and \ndowns of life. We need a great spiritual awakening.

O'Neill,\n                                                         Director.\n       Enclosure.\n\n        CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE, JUNE 9, 1998\n\n S. 2057: National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999, As \n   Reported by the Senate Committee on Armed Services on May 11, 1998\n\n\n                                SUMMARY\n\n       S. 2057 would authorize appropriations for 1999 for the \n     military functions of the Department of Defense (DoD) and the \n     Department of Energy (DOE). It also would prescribe personnel \n     strengths for each active duty and selected reserve component \n     of the U.S. armed forces. Assuming appropriation of the\n\n[[Page S6642]]\n\n     amounts authorized for 1999, CBO estimates that enacting S. \n     2057 would result in additional discretionary spending from \n     1999 appropriations of $269 billion over the 1999-2003 \n     period, including $1.9 billion that would be designated as \n     emergency funding. In addition, the bill contains provisions \n     that would lower the cost of discretionary defense programs \n     over the 2000-2003 period by about $4.8 billion.\n       The bill would affect direct spending through land \n     conveyances, the sale of naval vessels, loss of receipts from \n     the auction of the electromagnetic spectrum, changes to \n     military retirement and survivor benefit programs, and other \n     provisions. CBO estimates that the bill would raise direct \n     spending by $71 million in 1999 and by $1.1 billion over the \n     1999-2003 period. It also would generate receipts from assets \n     sales totaling $251 million in 1999. The combined effect \n     would be to lower spending by $180 million in 1999 but raise \n     it by $826 million over the 1999-2003 period. Because the \n     bill would affect direct spending, pay-as-you-go procedures \n     would apply.\n       S. 2057 would require some airlines to extend federal \n     government rates to reservists traveling to and from their \n     inactive duty stations. This requirement may be a private-\n     sector mandate as defined by the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act \n     (UMRA). However, the cost of this provision would be small, \n     and well below the threshold established by UMRA. UMRA \n     excludes from application of that act legislative provisions \n     that are necessary for the national security. CBO has \n     determined that all other provisions in S. 2057 either fit \n     within this exclusion or do not contain intergovernmental \n     mandates as defined by UMRA.\n\n\n                ESTIMATED COST TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT\n\n       The estimated budgetary impact of S. 2057 is shown in Table \n     1, assuming that the bill will be enacted by October 1, 1998.\n\n                    Authorizations of Appropriations\n\n       The bill would authorize specific appropriations totaling \n     $273.5 billion in 1999 for military programs in DoD and DOE. \n     The bill would authorize $271.6 billion for ongoing programs \n     and $1.9 billion on an emergency basis to cover the \n     incremental costs of operations in and around Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina (see Table 2). These costs would fall within \n     budget function 050 (national defense). The estimate assumes \n     that the amounts authorized will be appropriated for 1999. \n     Outlays are estimated based on historical spending patterns. \n     In addition, S. 2057 would authorize specific appropriations \n     for other budget functions: $117 million for the Naval \n     Petroleum Reserve (function 270); $71 million for the Armed \n     Forces Retirement Home (function 700).\n       The bill also contains provisions that would affect various \n     costs, mostly for personnel, that would be covered by the \n     fiscal year 1999 authorization and by authorizations in \n     future years. Table 3 contains estimates of these amounts. In \n     addition to the costs covered by the 1999 authorizations in \n     the bill, these provisions would lower estimated costs by \n     $4.8 billion over the 2000-2003 period. The following \n     sections describe the estimated authorizations shown in Table \n     3 and provide information about CBO's cost estimates.\n     Endstrength\n       The bill would specifically authorize appropriations of \n     $70.4 billion for military pay and allowances in 1999. Under \n     the bill, the authorized endstrengths in 1999 for active-duty \n     personnel and personnel in the Selected Reserve would total \n     1,395,780 and 877,094, respectively. Compared to the minimum \n     endstrength level set in current law--1,431,379 active-duty \n     personnel--the endstrength specified in S. 2057 would lower \n     personnel costs by $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion annually.\n       Also the bill would authorize an endstrength of 8,000 in \n     1999 for the Coast Guard Reserve. This authorization would \n     cost about $69 million and would fall under budget function \n     400, transportation.\n       Grade Structure. Section 415 would change the grade \n     structure of active-duty personnel in support of the \n     reserves. This change would not increase the overall \n     endstrength, but would result in more promotions. The \n     provision would cost about $3 million a year.\n\n           TABLE 1.--BUDGETARY IMPACT OF S. 2057 AS REPORTED BY THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON ARMED SERVICES\n                                    [By fiscal year, in millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        1998         1999         2000         2001         2002         2003\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                    SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION ACTION\n \nSpending Under Current Law for\n Defense Programs:\n    Budget Authority \\1\\..........      270,786            0            0            0            0            0\n    Estimated Outlays.............      269,058       91,071       33,952       15,117        6,586        3,047\nProposed Changes:\n    Regular Authorizations:\n        Authorization Level.......            0      271,867            0            0            0            0\n        Estimated Outlays.........            0      179,519       54,255       20,578        9,103        3,590\n    Emergency Authorizations:\n        Authorization Level.......            0        1,859            0            0            0            0\n        Estimated Outlays.........            0        1,533          283           32            8            0\nSpending Under S. 2057 for Defense\n Programs:\n    Authorization Level \\1\\.......      270,786      273,726            0            0            0            0\n    Estimated Outlays.............      269,058      272,123       88,490       35,727       15,697        6,637\n \n                                                 DIRECT SPENDING\n \nEstimated Budget Authority........            0           71           74          264          508          160\nEstimated Outlays.................            0           71           74          264          508          160\n \n                                                 ASSET SALES \\2\\\n \nEstimated Budget Authority........            0         -251        (\\3\\)        (\\3\\)        (\\3\\)        (\\3\\)\nEstimated Outlays.................            0         -251        (\\3\\)        (\\3\\)        (\\3\\)        (\\3\\)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The 1998 level is the amount appropriated for programs authorized by the bill.\n\\2\\ Under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, proceeds from a nonroutine asset sale may be counted for purposes of\n  pay-as-you-go scoring only if the sale would entail no net financial cost to the government.

     -1,279\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: For every item in this table except one, the 1999 impacts are included in the amounts specifically\n  authorized to be appropriated in the bill. Those amounts are shown in Table 2. Only the authorization of\n  endstrength for the Coast Guard Reserve is additive to the amounts in Table 2.\n\n     Compensation and Benefits\n       S. 2057 contains several provisions that would affect \n     military compensation and benefits.\n       Pay Raises. Section 601 would raise basic pay by 3.1 \n     percent or $1.2 billion in 1999. Because the pay raise would \n     be the same as under current law, section 601 would have no \n     incremental costs. Section 602 would increase the pay rates \n     for cadets and midshipmen at the service academies. The \n     incremental cost of this provision would be $6 million \n     annually.\n       Expiring Bonuses and Allowances. Several sections would \n     extend for three months DoD's authority to pay certain \n     bonuses and allowances to current personnel. The authority is \n     scheduled to expire at the end of fiscal year 1999, but in \n     some cases renewing authorities for even brief periods \n     results in costs over several years because payments are made \n     in installments. CBO estimates that payment of enlistment and \n     reenlistment bonuses for active duty personnel would cost $43 \n     million in fiscal year 2000. The cost of extending special \n     payments for aviators and nuclear-qualified personnel would \n     be $23 million in 2000. Payment authorities for various \n     bonuses for the Selected and Ready Reserve would total $14 \n     million in 2000. We estimate that authorities to make special \n     payments to nurse officer candidates, registered nurses, and \n     nurse anesthetists would cost $3 million in 2000. The \n     estimated cost of all these bonuses and allowances is $163 \n     million over the 2000-2003 period.\n       Voluntary Separation Benefits and Early Retirement. Section \n     522 would extend for four years DoD's authority to separate \n     personnel by paying voluntary separation benefits and \n     offering early retirement. Because DoD has made relatively \n     little use of the voluntary separation benefit in recent \n     years, CBO estimates the cost of extending that authority \n     would be less than $10 million a year. However, recent \n     experience indicates that early retirement incentives may be \n     used more often. CBO estimates that DoD would spend about \n     $150 million annually to cover the costs of extending an \n     option to retire early.\n       Benefits for Involuntary Separations. Section 522 would \n     also extend for four years transitional benefits for former \n     military personnel who have left service involuntarily. These \n     benefits include travel and transportation allowances, \n     payments for storing household goods, and access to health \n     care, commissaries, and family housing. CBO estimates that \n     costs for extending these benefits would total $40 million a \n     year starting in 2000.\n\n[[Page S6644]]\n\n       Recruiting Incentives. The bill would change restrictions \n     governing two recruiting incentives that would be extended \n     through January 1, 2000. Section 616 would increase the \n     maximum enlistment bonus in the Army from $4,000 to $6,000 \n     for individuals who enlist for three years and score 50 or \n     above on the Armed Forces Qualification Test. Based on \n     current recruitment goals, CBO estimates that costs for \n     enlistment bonuses would increase by $4 million in 1999 and \n     about $2 million in 2000. Under current law, enlistees cannot \n     receive both the college fund benefits and an enlistment \n     bonus. Section 619 would also allow certain enlistees to \n     receive both recruitment incentives, which CBO estimates \n     would cost $8 million in 1999, $6 million in 2000, and $2 \n     million in 2001.\n       In addition, the maximum benefit from the military college \n     funds under section 618 would increase in 1999 from $40,000 \n     to $50,000, at an estimated cost to the military pay accounts \n     of $20 million a year.\n       Termination of Premiums for Survivor Benefits. Under \n     section 631 a military retiree participating in the Survivor \n     Benefit Plan (SBP) would stop paying premiums after paying \n     them for 30 years and reaching 70 years of age. This \n     provision would increase the payment that DoD makes to the \n     Military Retirement Trust Fund for accruing retirement \n     benefits. CBO estimates that those costs would average about \n     $22 million a year over the first several years. The \n     provision would also lead to increases in direct spending as \n     discussed below.\n       Changes in Reenlistment Bonus Eligibility. The services \n     extend reenlistment bonuses to personnel in specialities \n     characterized by inadequate manning, low retention, and high \n     replacement costs. The maximum bonus payment under current \n     law is $45,000, but no more than ten percent of the bonuses \n     can exceed $20,000. Section 615 would remove the ten percent \n     restriction and allow the services to extend reenlistment \n     bonuses to reserve members performing active guard and \n     reserve duty. CBO estimates that these changes would cost \n     about $10 million in 1999 and $26 million over the 1999-2003 \n     period.\n       Caps on Education Loan Repayment. The bill would increase \n     the authorized caps on loans that DoD may repay for health \n     professionals serving in the Selected Reserve and who have \n     critical skills. The repayment caps would increase from \n     $3,000 per year and $20,000 in total to $20,000 and $50,000, \n     respectively. The provision would cost an estimated $10 \n     million in 1999 and $25 million over the 1999-2003 period.\n     Incentive Payments to Civilian Employees\n       CBO estimates that together sections 1103 and 1104 would \n     raise discretionary costs by $362 million and direct spending \n     by $343 million over the 1999-2003 period. Section 1103 would \n     extend DoD's authority to offer incentive payments to \n     civilian employees who voluntarily retire or resign. This \n     authority, currently scheduled to expire at the end of fiscal \n     year 2001, would be extended through fiscal year 2003. \n     Section 1104 would authorize DoD to target offers of early \n     retirement to specific groups of employees. DoD frequently \n     offers incentive payments and early retirement to the same \n     employees, and has found that the two methods are more \n     effective when used together.\n       As a result, the net impact of enacting both sections 1103 \n     and 1104, on both DoD workforce reductions and the budget, is \n     greater than the individual impact of each provision.\n       Based on information provided by DoD and the Office of \n     Personnel Management (OPM), CBO estimates that section 1103 \n     would increase discretionary spending by $244 million in 2002 \n     and 2003. Section 1104 would increase discretionary costs by \n     $76 million between 2000 and 2003. If both provisions were \n     enacted, discretionary spending would increase by an \n     additional $42 million in 2002 and 2003. These costs reflect \n     additional incentive payments and deposits to the Civil \n     Service Trust Fund that DoD would be required to make for \n     each employee who accepts an incentive payment. These figures \n     also incorporate savings that DoD would realize due to lower \n     spending on severance payments associated with involuntary \n     separations. Additional information about the budgetary \n     impact of these provisions is provided below in the \n     discussion of impacts on direct spending.\n     Military Health Care Programs and Benefits\n       Title VII contains several provisions that would affect \n     health care programs and benefits although only a few would \n     have a budgetary impact.\n       Demonstration Projects. Section 707 would require DoD to \n     establish three demonstration projects involving health \n     benefits for certain beneficiaries who are eligible for \n     Medicare and who live 40 miles or more from a military \n     treatment facility (MTF), a so-called catchment area. \n     Specifically, one project would offer mail-order pharmacy \n     benefits; another would offer Tricare as supplemental \n     coverage to Medicare; and a third would offer supplemental \n     coverage under the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program \n     (FEHBP). The bill would cap DoD's costs at $60 million a year \n     for the term of the demonstrations. The budgetary impact of \n     section 707 would include both an increase in spending \n     subject to appropriation and direct spending.\n       CBO estimates that DoD would spend $14 million in 1999 and \n     $104 million over the 1999-2003 period for the demonstrations \n     of providing mail-order pharmacy benefits and Tricare \n     coverage as a supplement to Medicare. Those costs would be \n     subject to appropriation. (The direct spending costs of the \n     third demonstration are discussed below with other provisions \n     affecting direct spending.) The estimate assumes that 11,000 \n     beneficiaries eligible for Medicare reside in each of six \n     demonstration sites, based on the average number of such \n     individuals living outside catchment areas. This estimate \n     assumes DoD would offer benefits under each project to \n     roughly the same number of beneficiaries. (Thus, DoD's \n     spending on each project would depend on the per capita cost \n     of the benefits offered.) Alternatively, DoD could design the \n     demonstration to spend roughly the same amount on each \n     project. If this were the case, DoD would spend roughly $40 \n     million annually on these two projects.\n       Dependents' Dental Premiums. Under current law, \n     participating dependents of active-duty personnel must pay \n     part of the premium for dental care coverage, but the amount \n     is capped at $20 per month per family. Section 701 would \n     allow DoD to adjust the participants' premiums by the \n     military pay raise. CBO estimates that this provision would \n     reduce DoD's costs by a negligible amount in 1999 but that \n     savings would increase by about $500,000 annually thereafter, \n     totaling $6 million over the 1999-2002 period.\n       Automatic Enrollment and Reenrollment in Tricare Prime. \n     Under current law, if dependents of active-duty personnel \n     want to join Tricare Prime, they must enroll each year. \n     Enrollees can choose either military or civilian primary care \n     providers or they may be assigned to civilian providers if an \n     MTF reaches its enrollment capacity. Section 703 would \n     provide that dependents of members in grades E-4 or below who \n     live outside a catchment area be automatically enrolled in \n     Tricare Prime at the MTF. They would remain enrolled at the \n     MTF until they elect to disenroll or become ineligible for \n     coverage.\n       Although automatic enrollment could encourage some \n     dependents who do not currently rely on military health care \n     to join Tricare, CBO believes that the costs to DoD would be \n     negligible because nearly all dependents of members in grades \n     E-4 and below already use the military health system. But, if \n     automatic enrollment encourages current participants in \n     Tricare Extra and Tricare Standard to get care from the MTFs \n     instead, then DoD would incur more costs in its direct care \n     system. However, only a small part of this population would \n     be likely to change providers based solely on automatic \n     enrollment, and because Tricare contractors would experience \n     lower health care costs from shifts to the MTFs, at least \n     some of DoD's extra costs would be offset by adjustments to \n     the price of the managed care contracts.\n       Authority to Provide Tricare Coverage. Under current law \n     beneficiaries lose eligibility for Tircare once they are \n     eligible for Medicare. Section 704 would allow DoD to extend \n     Tricare eligibility through June 30, 1999, for certain \n     beneficiaries who have become eligible for Medicare because \n     of a disability but who have not enrolled in Medicare Part B. \n     CBO estimates that DoD would spend about $3 million in health \n     care costs for these individuals, based on information from \n     DoD on the number of affected beneficiaries. Information from \n     DoD suggests that its has been willing to pay these expenses \n     even though current law does not require it. Thus, assuming \n     that DoD would continue to pay these costs under current law, \n     this provision would have no net budgetary impact.\n     Long-Term Charter of Naval Vessels\n       Section 1012 would authorize the Secretary of the Navy to \n     charter three vessels in support of submarine rescue, escort, \n     and towing. Two of the vessels would be leased through 2005 \n     and a third vessel would be leased through 2012. The charter \n     would be a capital lease that would cost about $101 million \n     through 2003. Because two charters would begin in 1999 and \n     the third would begin in 2000, the estimated \n     authorizations is counted in those two years. The estimate \n     is based on information provided by the Navy and the owner \n     of the vessels.\n     Limitation of the Price Preference for SDBs\n       Under current law, DoD may enter into contracts with small \n     disadvantaged businesses (SDBs) to pay prices that exceed the \n     fair market price in order to facilitate awarding at least \n     five percent of its contracts to SDBs. Section 803 would deny \n     that authority except when DoD failed to reach that goal in \n     the preceding fiscal year. Information from DoD suggests that \n     contracts awarded to SDBs in recent years have exceeded the \n     goal and have resulted in annual price premiums totaling \n     between $7.5 million and $10 million. On this basis, CBO \n     estimates that section 803 would save $8 million a year.\n     Other Provisions.\n       The bill contains several other provisions that would have \n     a budgetary impact totaling about $5 million annually.\n       DARPA Personnel Management. Section 1105 would authorize \n     the Secretary of defense to appoint not more than 20 eminent \n     experts in science and engineering to work in research and \n     development projects administered by the Defense Advanced \n     Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The authorization would \n     extend over the five-year period beginning on the date of the \n     enactment S. 2057. CBO estimates that implementing section \n     1105 would cost $3 million a year over the 1999-2003 period.\n       Pay Increase for Safety Personnel at Defense Nuclear \n     Facilities. Under current law, the salary of safety personnel \n     at defense nuclear facilities may not exceed the rate of pay \n     or Level IV of the Executive Schedule. Section 3142 would \n     change that limit to Level III, an\n\n[[Page S6645]]\n\n     increase of about $7,500 per person per year. CBO estimates \n     that this provision would raise DOE's personnel costs by less \n     than $2 million a year for about 200 individuals.\n       National Defense Panel. Section 905 would authorize the \n     Secretary of Defense to establish a National Defense Panel in \n     2001 and every four years there after to recommend a 10- and \n     20-year defense plan. The panel would consist of a chairman \n     and eight other individuals from the private sector who are \n     recognized experts in national security matters. The chairman \n     would have the authority to hire an executive director and \n     staff. CBO estimates that implementing section 905 would cost \n     $4 million in 2001 and $1 million in 2002.\n       Reductions in Headquarters Staff. Section 904 would require \n     the Secretary of Defense to reduce staffing in headquarters \n     and various DoD agencies by the end of fiscal year 2003. \n     Because total military personnel are determined by end \n     strength requirements, CBO assumes that the provision would \n     mainly affect civilian employees. Starting from the \n     employment level of October 1, 1996, section 904 would \n     require the elimination of approximately 33,000 civilian \n     positions at estimated annual savings of about $2.1 billion \n     once the reduction is fully accomplished. Because such \n     reductions are occurring under current law, CBO does not \n     estimate additional savings under section 904.\n\n                   Director Spending and Asset Sales\n\n       S. 2057 contains several provisions that would affect \n     direct spending and asset sales. As shown in Table 4, the \n     bill would raise direct spending by $71 million in 1999 and \n     $1,077 million over the 1999-2003 period. CBO estimates that \n     it would raise receipts from asset sales by about $251 \n     million in 1999.\n     Forgone Spectrum Receipts.\n       CBO estimates that the provisions in section 1062 regarding \n     licenses for the use of the electromagnetic spectrum would \n     result in a loss of offsetting receipts that could range from \n     a few hundred million to several billion dollars over the \n     1999-2003 period. Existing law requires the transfer of \n     certain frequencies from federal to nonfederal jurisdiction, \n     and the subsequent assignment of licenses to use those \n     frequencies to private entities through auctions conducted by \n     the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Under current \n     law, the costs of relocating federal users are a federal \n     responsibility and would be financed during appropriated \n     funds. Under this bill, nonfederal entities would be \n     obligated to compensate federal agencies in advance for costs \n     incurred to relocate out of the portion of the spectrum being \n     licensed for commercial use. Agency spending of the receipts \n     collected from the licensees would be subject to \n     appropriation.\n       The provisions in section 1062 could apply to spectrum \n     auctions that are projected to generate about $9 billion in \n     receipts over the 1999-2003 period under current law. \n     Obligating prospective bidders to pay the relocation costs \n     associated with specific licenses would significantly depress \n     interest in many, if not most, of those auctions. For \n     example, recent reports have suggested that relocating \n     certain DoD functions could cost an average of about 20 cents \n     per megahertz per person, which is more than half the average \n     price received in 1997 for wireless telecommunications \n     licenses ( the D, E, and F block auctions). Consequently, CBO \n     estimates that offsetting receipts from spectrum licenses \n     would be 5 percent to 10 percent lower than under current law \n     because of the uncertainty associated with the added \n     liability to the prospective licenses. In addition, CBO \n     expects that the FCC would not receive bids for some portions \n     of the spectrum because the projected cost of relocating \n     federal users out of certain spectrum would likely exceed the \n     market value of some licenses. As a result, we estimate that \n     enacting section 1062 would reduce offsetting receipts by a \n     total of $800 million over the next five years. The loss of \n     receipts could be significantly higher, depending on the \n     extent to which bidders lack confidence in the estimates of \n     their liability for relocation costs. Finally, CBO \n     anticipates that some auctions would be postponed to allow \n     time for federal agencies to finalize cost estimates and \n     develop procedures for releasing information to bidders. Such \n     delays would reduce auction receipts in 1999 but would have \n     no significant net effect over time.\n\n                              TABLE 4.--DIRECT SPENDING AND ASSET SALES IN S. 2057\n                      [By fiscal year, budget authority and outlays in millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                    Category                         1999         2000         2001         2002         2003\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                 DIRECT SPENDING\nForgone Spectrum Receipts......................          100           75          200          400           25\nIncentive Payments to Civilian Employees:\n    Section 1103 incentives....................            0            0            0           -9           24\n    Section 1104 incentives....................            0           10           64           99           75\n    Interactive effects........................            0            0            0           15           65\n                                                ----------------------------------------------------------------\n        Subtotal...............................            0           10           64          105          164\nPremiums for Survivor Benefits.................           -5           -5           -5           -5           -5\nFEHB Demonstration Project.....................            3           30           41           44           12\nSpending of Travel Rebates.....................            2            2            2            2            2\nLeases of Naval Vessels........................          -29          -38          -38          -38          -38\nLand Conveyance Spending.......................

Some\n  provisions would authorize spending from the proceeds of certain asset sales, and although proceeds and\n  spending would cancel each other over time they would not do so on a yearly basis. Another provision would\n  authorize a sale with payment delayed for 10 years; that provision would have a subsidy cost under credit\n  reform.\n\\2\\ Under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, proceeds from a nonroutine asset sale may be counted for purposes of\n  pay-as-you-go scoring only if the sale would entail no net financial cost to the government. CBO estimates\n  that the nonroutine asset sales that would result from enacting S. 2057 would generate a net savings to the\n  government, and therefore that the proceeds would be counted for pay-as-you-go purposes.\n\\3\\ CBO does not have enough information to estimate the budgetary impact of land conveyances that would be\n  authorized under S. 2057.\n\n     Incentive Payments to Civilian Employees\n       In addition to their impact on discretionary spending \n     (discussed above), sections 1103 and 1104 of the bill would \n     affect direct spending. Enacting both sections 1103 and 1104 \n     would increase the number of employees taking incentive \n     payments and retiring early in 2002 and 2003, and the \n     budgetary impact of the two provisions taken together is \n     greater than their separate impacts. CBO estimates that \n     sections 1103 and 1104 would raise direct spending by about \n     $343 million (in budget functions 600 and 950) over the 1999-\n     2003 period.\n       Section 1103. This provision would allow DoD to offer \n     incentive payments to employees who voluntarily retire or \n     resign in fiscal years 2002 and 2003. These payments would \n     induce some employees to retire--and begin receiving federal \n     retirement benefits--earlier than they would otherwise. These \n     additional benefit payments represent direct spending. In \n     later years, annual federal retirement outlays would be lower \n     than under current law because employees who retire earlier \n     would receive a smaller annuity. By itself, section 1103 \n     would increase net direct spending by a total of $15 million \n     in 2002 and 2003.\n       Based on information from DoD, CBO estimates that about \n     7,900 employees would accept incentive payments in 2002 and \n     2003 (see Table 5). CBO assumes that about 60 percent of \n     these employees would retire at the same time under current \n     law; the rest would be induced to retire one to two years \n     early. As a result, CBO estimates that spending on federal \n     retirement benefits would increase by $76 million during the \n     2002-2003 period. In later years, annual spending on \n     retirement benefits would decrease by about $15 million \n     relative to current law.\n       DoD would be required to make a deposit to the Civil \n     Service Trust Fund equal to 15 percent of final pay for each \n     employee who accepts an incentive payment. CBO estimates that \n     these deposits would be about $7,700 per employee and would \n     increase deposits received by the trust fund by $61 million \n     in 2002-2003.\n       Section 1104. Federal agencies that are undergoing a major \n     reorganization or reduction in force may, with the approval \n     of the OPM, offer their employees retirement benefits earlier \n     than would normally be allowed. OPM and agencies have \n     traditionally used a number of criteria to target offers of \n     early retirement to particular groups of employees and thus \n     address agencies' specific personnel needs. In September \n     1997, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in \n     Torres v. OPM struck down many of these criteria, ruling that \n     OPM lacked the necessary statutory authority. The recent \n     supplemental appropriations bill (Public Law 105-174) \n     granted OPM the necessary authority, but only through \n     fiscal year 1999. Section 1104 would permanently codify \n     the previous practice for\n\n[[Page S6646]]\n\n     DoD and, in the absence of section 1103, would increase \n     direct spending by $248 million over the 2000-2003 period.\n\n   TABLE 5.--ESTIMATED NUMBER OF CIVILIAN EMPLOYEES OF DOD WHO WOULD RECEIVE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS AND TAKE EARLY\n                                     RETIREMENT UNDER SECTIONS 1103 AND 1104\n                                  [Number of employees receiving each benefit]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     1999         2000         2001         2002         2003\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                           CHANGES UNDER SECTION 1103\n \nIncentive Payments.............................            0            0            0        4,300        3,600\nEarly Retirement...............................            0            0            0          200          200\n \n                                           CHANGES UNDER SECTION 1104\n \nIncentive Payments.............................            0        2,300        2,300            0            0\nEarly Retirement...............................            0        2,500        2,500          200          200\n \n                                          CHANGES BASED ON INTERACTIONS\n \nIncentive Payments.............................            0            0            0        1,700        1,400\nEarly Retirement...............................            0            0            0        1,300        1,200\n \n                                               TOTAL UNDER S. 2057\n \nIncentive Payments.............................            0        2,300        2,300        6,000        5,000\nEarly Retirement...............................            0        2,500        2,500        1,700        1,600\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: According to information from DoD, it plans to reduce its civilian workforce by 23,000 in 1999; 28,000 in\n  2000; 32,000 in 2001; 13,000 in 2002; and 12,000 in 2003. The CBO estimate of the number of employees\n  receiving incentive payments and early retirements is also based on information from DoD. Because some\n  individuals would receive both benefits, the figures are not additive.\n\n       Based on information from DoD and OPM, CBO believes that \n     the Torres decision will lead agencies to sharply curtail \n     their use of early retirement. Applications since the Torres \n     decision indicate that the number of DoD employees projected \n     to take early retirement are about 30 percent of pre-Torres \n     levels. Without a change in law, DoD will have to rely more \n     heavily on involuntary separations in order to reach its \n     workforce reduction goals from 2000 to 2003. However, some \n     employees who would have taken early retirement before the \n     Torres decision will avoid the involuntary separations and \n     continue working until taking regular retirement in later \n     years. Because these employees will receive a higher annuity \n     than they would have by retiring early, long-term spending on \n     federal retirement benefits should increase in the wake of \n     the Torres decision.\n       CBO estimates that section 1104 would increase the number \n     of DoD employees taking early retirement in 2000 and 2001 by \n     5,000, and in 2002 and 2003 by about 400. The increase \n     projected for 2002 and 2003 is much smaller because DoD does \n     not currently have authority to offer incentive payments in \n     those years. Moreover, DoD's workforce reduction targets for \n     2002 and 2003 are smaller than those for 2000 and 2001. The \n     increase in early retirements would raise spending on federal \n     retirement benefits by $289 million between 2000 and 2003. \n     But by 2008, spending on benefits would be $40 million lower \n     than under current law.\n       CBO also estimates that many of the 5,000 additional early \n     retirees in 2000 and 2001 would accept incentive payments. \n     For these employees, DoD would make $41 million in additional \n     deposits to the Civil Service Trust Fund.\n       Interaction Between Sections. DoD frequently offers \n     incentive payments and early retirement to the same \n     employees, and has found that the two methods are more \n     effective when used together. As a result, the net impact of \n     enacting both sections 1103 and 1104, on DoD workforce \n     reductions and the budget, is greater than the individual \n     impact of each provision. CBO estimates that enactment of \n     both sections would result in an additional 3,100 employees \n     taking incentive payments and an extra 2,500 employees taking \n     early retirement in 2002 and 2003. CBO estimates that taken \n     together the provisions would raise direct spending by about \n     $343 million over the 2000-2003 period or about $80 million \n     more than if they had no interaction.\n     Termination of Premiums for Survivor Benefits\n       Under section 631, a military retiree participating in the \n     Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP) would stop paying premiums after \n     paying them for 30 years and reaching 70 years of age. \n     Because the bill would specify October 1, 2003, as the \n     effective date, no costs would be incurred until that time. \n     However, CBO estimates that some individuals who would stop \n     participating in SBP under current law would continue to pay \n     premiums under section 631. Thus, CBO estimates that the \n     government would collect additional premiums of about $5 \n     million a year until 2004 when costs would more than offset \n     the additional receipts. Direct spending costs (in budget \n     function 600) would be about $59 million in 2004 and would \n     reach about $120 million in 2008. Net costs would continue to \n     increase after 2008 before leveling off.\n     Demonstration Projects for Medicare-Eligible Military \n         Retirees\n       Section 707 would require DoD to establish three \n     demonstration projects to offer certain health benefits to \n     military beneficiaries who are also eligible for Medicare. \n     Two of the projects would raise direct spending by a total of \n     $3 million in 1999 and $130 million over the 1999-2003 \n     period.\n       CBO estimates that the project that would allow coverage \n     under the FEHB program would raise direct spending by $103 \n     million from 2000 through 2003. This estimate assumes that \n     DoD offers enrollment to 22,000 individuals residing in two \n     catchment areas and that 70 percent of them would join the \n     program. Most of the increase in direct spending would be \n     DoD's payment of the government contribution toward the FEHB \n     premium. A small portion of the direct spending increase \n     would be higher expenditures in the Medicare program because \n     beneficiaries who acquire supplemental health coverage tend \n     to use more Medicare services overall. CBO estimates that \n     Medicare expenditures (in budget function 570) would rise by \n     $22 million over the 1999-2003 period. There would be no \n     budgetary impact in 1999 from this project because the FEHB \n     project would begin on January 1, 2000, and end on December \n     31, 2003.\n       CBO believes that the demonstration project offering \n     Tricare supplemental coverage would also increase Medicare \n     spending. To the extent that this benefit covers most or all \n     of the Medicare deductibles and copayments, spending in the \n     Medicare program would rise for the participants who acquire \n     supplemental coverage through this project. Assuming that if \n     the Tricare supplemental is like the most commonly purchased \n     commercial Medigap plan, which covers the Medicare inpatient \n     deductible and outpatient copayments, then Medicare spending \n     would rise by about $3 million in 1999 and $26 million over \n     the 1999-2003 period.\n     Spending From Rebates\n       Section 802 would give DoD the authority to spend rebates \n     it receives from travel agencies under contracts with the \n     department. Under current law, DoD is prevented from spending \n     receipts that stem from certain contracts or that are \n     credited to an appropriation that has lapsed. By allowing \n     such funds to be spent, CBO estimates that section 802 would \n     increase outlays by about $2 million a year.\n     Leases and Sales of Naval Vessels\n       Section 1013 would authorize the transfer of 22 naval \n     vessels to foreign countries: six by grant, eleven by sale, \n     and five by lease or sale. CBO estimates the transfer would \n     increase offsetting receipts by $332 million over the 1999-\n     2003 period--$151 million from the sale of ships and $181 \n     million in lease payments. The estimate assumes the five \n     ships authorized for transfer by sale or lease will be leased \n     for five years, with quarterly payments beginning in the \n     second quarter of fiscal year 1999.\n     Stockpile Sales\n       The bill would authorize DoD to sell several materials \n     contained in the National Defense Stockpile to achieve \n     receipts totaling $100 million in 1999. CBO estimates that \n     DoD would be able to sell the materials authorized for \n     disposal and raise the receipts required by the bill.\n     Land Conveyances\n       The bill contains several provisions that would convey land \n     to nonfederal entities. CBO cannot estimate the aggregate \n     budgetary impact because DoD has not assessed the market \n     value of all the affected properties.\n       Section 2821 would authorize the sale of about 5,000 acres \n     to the Indiana Reuse Authority and section 2823 would convey \n     about 1,000 acres to Hamilton County, Tennessee. In each \n     case, payment would occur 10 years after the land was \n     transferred. The delayed payment would represent loans by the \n     United States under procedures established by the Federal \n     Credit Reform Act of 1990. The budgetary impact would be the \n     difference between the sale price and the subsidy cost. \n     However, because DoD does not know the market value of the \n     land, CBO cannot estimate the budgetary effects.\n       Sections 2821 and 2823 also would grant the Secretary of \n     the Army authority to accept and spend reimbursements from \n     local authorities for administrative expenses incurred during \n     the conveyances. Because receipts and spending would offset \n     each other, this authority would have no net budgetary \n     impact.\n       Other sections would either authorize DoD to give or sell \n     parcels of property that GSA might sell under this disposal \n     procedures. CBO estimates that these sections would not have \n     a significant budgetary impact.\n\n[[Page S6647]]\n\n     Other Provisions\n       The following provisions would have an insignificant \n     budgetary impact:\n       Section 313 would allow DoD to collect landing fees for the \n     use of military airfields by civil aircraft and to use the \n     fees to fund the operation and maintenance of the airfields \n     during fiscal years 1999 and 2000.\n       Section 511 would allow National Guard officers to compute \n     their time-in-grade for retirement purposes from the date \n     they are confirmed by the Senate.\n       Section 512 would allow reserve generals and flag officers \n     who are involuntarily transferred from active status to \n     retire at a higher grade if they have served two years, \n     instead of three years, at that grade.\n       Section 522 would allow a limited number of reserve \n     commissioned officers who retire voluntarily to retire at a \n     higher grade if they have served two years, instead of three \n     years, at that grade.\n       Section 632 would require certain retirees to begin paying \n     premiums under the Survivor Benefit Plan the month following \n     a court order.\n       Title XXXV would authorize the Panama Canal Commission \n     (PCC) to solicit and accept donations of funds, property, and \n     services from nonfederal sources for the purpose of carrying \n     out promotion activities. This provision would have no net \n     effect on direct spending because any new offsetting \n     collections would be deposited into the FCC's revolving fund, \n     from which they would be spent without further appropriation.\n       Section 1052 would allow the superintendents of the \n     military academies to receive and spend funds awarded from \n     research grants.\n       Section 1054 would allow DoD to spend reimbursements from \n     companies that damage personal property during shipping if \n     DoD has reimbursed the owners of the property.\n       Section 1056 would allow military historical centers to \n     spend the amounts they collect as fees for providing \n     information to the public.\n       Section 1061 would increase the amount of funding that \n     would be derived from fees and spent for a program to \n     commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Korean War.\n       Title XXIX, the Juniper Butte Range Land Withdrawal Act, \n     would reserve approximately 12,000 acres of public land in \n     Owyhee County, Idaho, for use by the Secretary of the Air \n     Force for training and other defense-related purposes. \n     Implementing title XXIX could lead to a decreased in \n     offsetting receipts from grazing on federal lands, but \n     because implementation would depend on appropriation action, \n     CBO estimates that enactment of title XXIX would not, by \n     itself, affect direct spending or receipts.\n\n\n                      pay-as-you-go considerations\n\n       Section 252 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985 sets up pay-as-you-go procedures for \n     legislation affecting direct spending on receipts.

CBO has determined that \n     the provisions in S. 2057 either fit within this exclusion or \n     do not contain intergovernmental mandates as defined by UMRA.\n\n\n                 estimated impact on the private sector\n\n       One provision of S. 2057 could impose a new private-sector \n     mandate. Section 623 of title VI would require airlines and \n     other common carriers under contract with the General \n     Services Administration to provide transportation at the \n     contracted federal government rate to reservists traveling to \n     and from their inactive duty training station. To the extent \n     that the contracted government rate is lower than available \n     commercial rates, this provision would reduce carriers' \n     revenues and income. About 700,000 reservists are required to \n     participate in monthly drills and annual training. The annual \n     cost of this provision would be well below the $100 million \n     threshold set by UMRA, since most reservists travel to their \n     training bases by private automobile rather than by common \n     carrier. Furthermore, once the General Services \n     Administration renegotiates its service agreements with the \n     carriers, this provision would become a standard condition of \n     the contract that the carriers accept, and would therefore no \n     longer constitute a private-sector mandate.\n\n\n                         previous cbo estimate\n\n       On May 12, 1998, CBO prepared a cost estimate for H.R. \n     3616, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal year \n     1999, as ordered reported by the House Committee on National \n     Security.\n       Estimate prepared by:\n       Federal Cost: The estimates for defense programs were \n     prepared by Valerie Barton (military retirement), Shawn \n     Bishop (health programs), Kent Christensen (military \n     construction and other defense), Jeannette Deshong (military \n     and civilian personnel), Raymond Hall (procurement, RDT, \n     stockpile sales, and atomic energy defense activities), Dawn \n     Sauter (operation and maintenance), and Joseph C.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, today the Senate is back to consider S. \n2057, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999. I am \nhopeful that we will be able to finish the floor action on this bill \nquickly, and I am looking forward to the floor debate.\n  Mr. President, this bill is an important piece of legislation that \nenhances our national security. The Armed Services Committee has \nreported a sound bill which provides a 3.1 percent pay raise for the \nuniformed services, restores appropriate funding levels for the \nconstruction and maintenance of both bachelor and family housing, and \nincreases investment in future modernization to ensure that the \nDepartment of Defense can leverage advances in technology and maintain \nour future force readiness.\n  This bill recommends a number of policy initiatives and spending \nincreases which improve the readiness of the reserve forces and permit \ngreater use of the expertise and capabilities of the reserve \ncomponents.\n  Under the budget agreement, we have not added funds to the defense \nbudget this year. However, as I stated when the Budget Resolution was \non the floor, I believe that we are not providing adequate funds for \ndefense and that we must reverse this negative spending trend.\n  Mr. President, as a result of the budget agreement reached last year, \nnon defense discretionary spending received significant increases while \ndefense continued its downward spending\n\n[[Page S6648]]\n\ntrends--not even keeping pace with inflation. During the fiscal year \n1998 appropriations process, the national security appropriations bill \nhad the lowest percentage increase from fiscal year 1997 funding level \nthan any of the other appropriations bills. In fact, military \nconstruction appropriations had a negative 6.2 percent change over the \nfiscal year 1997 funding levels, making funding for national defense \ngrow at one-fifth the rate of domestic spending increases.\n  Since the end of the Cold War, the active military end strength has \nbeen reduced from 2.2 million men and women to a little over 1.4 \nmillion. Annual defense spending continues to decline from a level of \n$400 billion in fiscal year 1986 to about $260 billion, in equivalent, \ninflation-adjusted dollars.\n  Mr. President, I have been pleased to hear that many of my colleagues \nincluding, the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the \nChairman of the Budget Committee believe, as I do, and have been \nrecently quoted in the press that defense spending must be increased, \nand the negative spending trend for defense must be reversed. The gap \nbetween our military capability and our commitments around the world \ncontinues to widen. We can no longer carry out the ambitious foreign \npolicy of this Administration with the level of resources allocated for \ndefense and still maintain our current readiness posture. We will not \nrequire less of our servicemen and women in the future. We must meet \nour obligation to provide adequate resources for our national security.\n\n  In this bill, the Committee has achieved a better balance among near-\nterm readiness, long-term readiness, quality of life and adequate, safe \nand reliable nuclear weapons capabilities.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to thank the Chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee and his staff for their close cooperation \nwith our Committee this year. I cannot recall a time when we have \nworked together as closely as we have this year. I believe that \ncooperation is reflected in both of our bills, and I commend the \nChairman and the Members of the Appropriations Committee and their fine \nstaff for their work this year.\n  I urge my colleagues to come to the floor and offer their amendments, \nbut I would also like to remind my colleagues that any amendments to \nthe defense authorization bill that would increase spending should be \naccompanied by offsetting reductions.\n  My hope is that colleagues will support this bill and join the \nMembers of the Armed Services Committee in passing this bill with a \nstrong bipartisan vote.\n  I wish to thank the Chair, and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first let me again commend Senator Thurmond \nfor his leadership on the committee. His chairmanship has been a \ndistinguished one. He has worked hard to keep us together as a \nbipartisan committee. We have adopted this bill on a bipartisan basis. \nHe and his staff have worked with me and our staff to work out the \nproblems that we have had, and where there have been disagreements we \nhave resolved them and moved on to other areas of importance. We are \nready to get back to work on our bill. As the chairman mentioned, the \nAppropriations Committee has already reported the DOD appropriations \nbill, and we worked cooperatively with them, so it is important that we \ncomplete action on this authorization bill so we can get to conference.\n  We have been working with Senators for the past several weeks on a \nnumber of amendments which we have been able to clear, and I hope that \nwe can act on those cleared amendments here this morning.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I just take this opportunity to thank Senator Levin and \nthe Members of the minority for their fine cooperation and working with \nus on this defense bill. Senator Levin is always ready to cooperate, \nand he renders this country a great service.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I offer an amendment to the underlying \nNational Defense Authorization Act, amendment 2387, which I filed on \nMay 20.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It would take unanimous consent at this point \nto call up an amendment.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is an amendment by \nSenator Brownback, a second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we lay \naside the pending business for the purpose of offering amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I would like to speak on several \namendments which I would have offered today had objection not been \nraised. These amendments, to which objection has been raised on the \nbasis that they are controversial, are, word for word, provisions that \npassed the U.S. House of Representatives many months ago by \noverwhelming margins.\n  The first amendment I will be speaking on passed the House of \nRepresentatives by a margin of 415 to 1. It is that amendment dealing \nwith coerced and forced abortions in the Nation of China to which \nobjection has been raised and to which I will speak this morning.\n  I further point out, these amendments were filed May 20, a month ago, \nto the defense authorization bill, and I announced my intent, even \nprior to that, to offer these amendments and to ensure that those \nprovisions which passed the House with such overwhelming support, \nreflecting overwhelming public support for these provisions, would have \nan opportunity to be voted on in the U.S. Senate.\n  I think those votes would have occurred much sooner had they not been \ntied up in committee. I think that they have overwhelming support, not \nonly by the country, not only by the U.S. House of Representatives, but \nby the U.S. Senate, and when we have a chance to vote on them--and we \nwill--that we will see them pass this body just as assuredly, and by \nthe same kind of margin, as they passed the House.\n  So, while there may be objection raised on the basis that they are \ncontroversial amendments, I think when the vote happens we will find \nthey are really not controversial at all. I think we are going to find \nvery few Senators willing to cast nay votes on amendments which are so \ncommonsensical and so reflect the moral values of the American people. \nWe will have an opportunity to find out later, but objection has been \nraised.\n  The intent in offering these amendments somehow has been construed as \nbeing an effort to embarrass the President. I have no desire to \nembarrass the President on the eve of his trip. I do think it is \nimportant we send a certain message, and a clear, resounding message, \nto the Chinese Communist Government as to how important human rights \nabuses in that Nation--how important they are to our country, to our \npeople, and to our Government.\n  I would have been delighted to have had this debate and this vote a \nmonth ago. Had it not been for prolonged, extended debate on the \ntobacco bill, that would have happened. So the timing for the offering \nof these amendments is not such to have some design to embarrass the \nPresident on the eve of his trip to Beijing. The timing was unavoidable \nbecause of the prolonged, extended debate on the tobacco bill that I \nthink ran into 4 weeks. But I remind my colleagues on the floor this \nmorning, these amendments were offered a month ago, there was public \nattention paid to these amendments a month ago, and it was clearly \nannounced that I intended to offer them a month ago. I think it is \nunfortunate we cannot go ahead and offer those amendments to the \ndefense authorization bill today.\n\n[[Page S6649]]\n\n  The amendment, as I say, mirrors the language that passed \noverwhelmingly on the floor of the House. It would do two things. \nFirst, it condemns those officials of the Chinese Communist Party, the \nGovernment of the People's Republic of China, and other Chinese \nnationals involved in forced abortions and sterilization. I hardly \nthink that is controversial. I do not think there are many people in \nthis country who would say we should not condemn the practice of forced \nabortions and forced sterilizations. So the amendment does that.\n\n  Second, the amendment would prevent such persons from entering or \nremaining in the United States. That is, it would deny visas to those \nCommunist Government officials who are involved in the practice of \nforced sterilizations and forced abortions in the Nation of China. It \nwould be based upon credible evidence, and that credible evidence would \nbe ascertained by the Secretary of State. So, to the extent that that \ninformation is available, to the extent that we have factual evidence \nthat a person is involved in this horrendous practice, as determined by \nour Secretary of State, then visas would be denied to those \nindividuals.\n  I just find it very difficult to see anything controversial about \nthose two provisions in this amendment, but objection has been raised, \nalthough it passed by 415 to 1 in the House of Representatives. The \nobjection has been raised on the basis of it being controversial \nbecause it condemns those Chinese Communist Party officials involved in \nabortions and sterilizations and would prevent them from receiving \nvisas to travel to this country if the Secretary of State so determined \nthat credible evidence indicated they were involved in that. That is \nthe controversial amendment we are not allowed to offer today to the \ndefense authorization bill.\n  In an attempt to reach a 1 percent annual population growth rate, \nChinese authorities, in 1979, instituted a policy of allowing one child \nper couple, providing monetary bonuses and other benefits as \nincentives. In subsequent years, it has been widely reported that women \nwith one living child, who become pregnant a second time, are often \nsubjected to rigorous pressure to end the pregnancy and undergo \nsterilization.\n  Forced abortion and sterilization have not only been used in \nCommunist China to regulate the number of children but to eliminate \nthose regarded as defective under China's eugenics policy, the so-\ncalled natal and health care law. This law requires couples at risk of \ntransmitting disabling congenital defects to their children to use \nbirth control or undergo sterilization.\n  China's leadership has admitted that coerced abortions and \ninvoluntary sterilizations occur but insists that officials involved in \nsuch incidents are acting outside the law and are punished. The extent \nto which this policy is carried out is not known, and while its \nenforcement is not uniform throughout China, the very fact that such a \npolicy exists is abhorrent to people around the world who believe in \nbasic human rights.\n  China's population control officials, working with employers and work \nunit officials, routinely monitor women's menstrual cycles. They \nsubject women who conceive without government authorization to extreme \npsychological pressure, to harsh economic sanctions, including \nunpayable fines and loss of employment and, in some instances, physical \nforce.\n  The aborting of unauthorized pregnancies, regardless of the stage of \npregnancy--first trimester, second trimester, or even third trimester--\nis apparently, in China, a routine occurrence. Some have argued that \nChina commits about half a million third-trimester abortions annually. \nMost of these babies are fully viable when they are killed, and \nvirtually all of these abortions are performed against the mother's \nwill.\n  I have also been told by those who have studied this issue that women \nare often imprisoned, brainwashed, and refused food until they finally \nbreak down and agree to the performing of an abortion. The actual \nmethods by which doctors carry out these procedures are often unnerving \nand horrific. It has been reported that doctors commonly inject women \nwith a shot of Rivalor, commonly known as ``the poison shot,'' which \ndirectly causes congestive heart failure in the baby. The baby slowly \ndies over the course of 2 or 3 days, at which time the baby will be \ndelivered dead.\n\n  I have also been made aware of reports that Chinese doctors also \ninject pure formaldehyde into the baby's soft spot of their head or the \nskull is crushed by the doctor's forceps.\n  Steven Mosher, the Director of Asian Studies at California's \nClaremont Institute, can personally account for seeing doctors carrying \n``chokers.'' These chokers are similar to our white twisty garbage \nties. They are placed around the baby's neck during delivery. The baby \nthen dies of painful strangulation over a period of about 5 minutes.\n  A government that would force women to undergo these kinds of grisly \nprocedures obviously has no respect for basic human rights.\n  China currently has legislation that requires women to be sterilized \nafter conceiving two children, and they even go so far as to demand \nsterilization of either the man or the woman if traces of a ``serious \nhereditary disease'' are found in an effort to eliminate the presence \nof children with handicaps, illnesses or other characteristics they \nmight consider to be ``abnormal.''\n  Numerous international organizations have found that the Chinese \nGovernment utilizes in the sterilization method to control population \nhorrendous practices. Mr. President, the practice of forced abortions \nby the Communist Chinese Government was truly exposed to America when \nmy good friend and my former colleague in the House, Congressman Chris \nSmith, chairman of the International Operations and Human Rights \nSubcommittee of the House International Relations Committee held a \nhearing just less than 2 weeks ago, June 10. This hearing featured \ncompelling testimony from a former administrator of China's Planned \nBirth Control Office on the use of coercive population control in order \nto achieve the Communist Government's one-child-per-couple limit.\n  Ms. Gao Xiao Dunn, the former head of China's Planned Birth Control \nOffice from 1984 to 1988, admitted--and we have heard testimony of what \nshe said before the House subcommittee less than 2 weeks ago, the \nformer head of the birth control office of Communist China, this is \nwhat she testified. She said:\n\n       Once I found a woman who was 9 months pregnant, but did not \n     have a birth-allowed certificate. According to the policy, \n     she was forced to undergo an abortion surgery. In the \n     operation room, I saw how the aborted child's lips were \n     sucking, how its limbs were stretching. A physician injected \n     poison into its skull and the child died, and it was thrown \n     into the trash can. To help a tyrant do evils was not what I \n     wanted. I could not bear seeing all those mothers grief-\n     stricken by induced delivery and sterilization. I could not \n     live with this on my conscience. I, too, after all, am a \n     mother.\n\n  That was her very vivid, very powerful testimony before the House \nsubcommittee, this former head of China's Planned Birth Control Office \nfrom 1984 to 1988. I think that her testimony, so very compelling, \ndemands this body and this Government and this administration to take a \nstand in every way possible against these kinds of practices.\n  In addition, Mrs. Gao Xiao Dunn admitted:\n\n       When I was in my hometown in China, I saw how a large \n     number of pregnant women were hiding anywhere they could. \n     Some of them were 9 months pregnant, but were forced to \n     undergo abortion procedures just the same--simply because \n     they had no ``birth-allowed certificates.'' The government \n     dismantled the houses of some of them and made them homeless. \n     The government's planned birth policy is extremely stern. \n     In my native village, I saw how many women were looking \n     for places to hide at night, because the government \n     usually catches people at night. All this made me \n     terrified.\n\n  There are those who apologize for the Chinese Government. They say, \n``Oh, things are better, but these are not things going on today.'' \nHere is someone who knows. Here is someone who was involved in it. Here \nis someone who became so guilt-stricken by her own involvement in this \npractice that she couldn't stand it any longer and has come forward to \ntell that story.\n  In her testimony, she discussed the abortions that occurred in jails \nwhere women were placed in jail who were fighting the physician's \nattempts to abort her child. She spoke of not only the jails where they \nwere incarcerated,\n\n[[Page S6650]]\n\nbut she spoke of the abortion bed where women were tied in by leather \nstraps and where those terrible procedures were performed. Their homes \nwere destroyed if they fought the Government strictures on the one-\nchild policy.\n  What does our own State Department say? If we are not willing to \naccept the testimony of someone who put their own future in jeopardy by \ncoming forward before a House subcommittee and telling their very \nvivid, compelling story, perhaps we will listen to our own State \nDepartment, because in the most recent human rights report on China \nissued only a few months ago, our own State Department said:\n\n       The Government does not authorize the use of force to \n     compel persons to submit to abortion or sterilization, but \n     officials acknowledge that there are instances of forced \n     abortions and sterilizations. . . . Poor supervision of local \n     officials under intense pressure to meet family planning \n     targets results in instances of abuse, including forced \n     abortion and sterilization. . . . There are credible reports \n     that several women were forced to undergo abortions of \n     unauthorized pregnancies in Fujian. . . . Newspapers in \n     Shenyang reported that family planning agents convinced a \n     woman 7 months pregnant to take ``appropriate measures.''\n\n  That is an abortion, although she was in the seventh month.\n\n       A well-documented incident of a 1994 forced 8-month \n     abortion has been reported in the coastal province of \n     Guangdong. A 1995 incident involving a forced sterilization \n     was also reported in Guangdong.\n\n  That is from the State Department. That is the end of the quote from \nour own State Department report.\n  The Chinese Communist Government will deny that it is the official \npolicy to encourage coerced abortions. They acknowledge that. Even the \nChinese Communist Government acknowledges that these terrible practices \noccur.\n  What do other human rights organizations say? We have heard from a \nformer director of the birth control agency in China. We have heard \nfrom our own State Department, but independent groups that monitor \nhuman rights abuses in China have weighed in as well.\n  Amnesty International has expressed its strong opposition to these \ncoerced abortions, forced sterilization practices. In a 1996 report, \n``Women in China: Detained, Victimized, but Mobilized,'' it iterated \nits profound concerns about these practices:\n\n       Testimonies have indicated that officials have resorted to \n     physical coercion resulting in torture or cruel, inhuman and \n     degrading treatment when faced with this pressure. Family \n     planning cadres continue to be disciplined and fired for \n     failing to keep birth quotas.\n\n  This is from Amnesty International. While Amnesty International takes \nno position on the official birth control policy in China, they are \nconcerned about the human rights violations which result from its \ncoercive application. Like many of the human rights organizations that \nmonitor China, I am concerned by reports that forced abortion and \nsterilization have been carried out by or at the instigation of people \nacting in an official capacity--such as family planning officials--\nagainst women who are detained, restricted or forcibly taken from their \nhomes to have the operation.\n  Previous reports by Amnesty International and other organizations \nhave cited a wide range of evidence regarding the use of forcible \nmeasures taken from official family planning reports and regulations. \nArticles in the official Chinese press, testimonies from former family-\nplanning officials, and testimonies from victims of forced abortion all \nattest that this is all too common still in 1997 in China.\n  Reports have also detailed cases of hostages being taken and ill-\ntreatment by officials of the relatives of couples who failed to pay \nbirth control fines or who had fled their villages attempting to avoid \nabortion or sterilization.\n  The Chinese authorities have never responded to such reports in \ndetail. In recent years, they have simply asserted that ``coercion is \nnot permitted,'' but they admit that it is going on. Mr. President, I \nam concerned that there is no evidence the Chinese authorities have yet \nset in place effective measures to ensure that such coercion is not \nonly forbidden on paper, but punished and prevented in practice.\n  I have been unable to find any instance of sanctions taken against \nofficials who perpetuate such violations. In other words, the Chinese \nCommunist Government today in the enforcement of their one-child policy \nturns a blind eye to local officials who use coercion, who use force, \nto compel women to have abortions against their will.\n  Mr. President, the absence of laws and regulations in China \nconcerning coercive family planning has become even more cause for \nconcern since 1995. Since that time, China has made numerous \ncommitments at the international level to combating violence against \nwomen. However, the absence of any substantive laws regulating forced \nabortions and sterilization appear to widen the potential for coercion.\n  Mr. President, I am aware that some have concerns about how we can \nassure compliance with this amendment's requirement that visas be \ndenied to individuals involved with these nefarious practices of forced \nabortions, of forced abortions and sterilizations. While I would expect \na determined effort would be made to identify persons involved in such \nactions prior to the issuance of such visas, I recognize that \nenforcement will not be easy in every instance. And I would state that \nwhat is most important is that we provide both a strong condemnation of \nthese practices, which the amendment does, and that we provide a \nmechanism for taking action against those responsible for them when \ncredible information about their activities comes to light.\n  Let me reiterate, there is absolutely nothing controversial about \nthis amendment. We are talking about the kinds of family planning \npractices condemned across the political spectrum, by all who are \nconcerned about moral values and basic human rights, that we take the \nmodest action of saying we ought to condemn it as a government and we \nought to deny visas to those who are perpetuating the practice in \nChina, that to the extent we can identify them, to the extent that \ncredible information comes forward, they should not be given visas to \ntravel to this country. I do not believe--I really in my heart--do not \nbelieve there is anybody on the other side of the aisle who thinks this \nis a bad thing to do. So I am perplexed and I am befuddled that anybody \nwould object to this amendment as being controversial.\n  Not only is China an increasing threat internationally, but within \ntheir own borders they continue to oppress their own people. And we \nshould not simply turn a blind eye and say we do not want to talk about \nit or that it might cause embarrassment to either our President or to \nthe Chinese Government. What a pitiful excuse for not addressing the \nissue.\n  Involuntary abortion or sterilization should be condemned, and it \nshould be condemned in the strongest terms as a violation of human \nrights, a violation of the first order.\n  I want to read a brief excerpt from Nicholas Kristof and his wife \nSheryl Wudunn from their book, the 1994 book, ``China Wakes, The \nStruggle for the Soul of a Rising Power.'' Mr. Kristof was the New York \nTimes' Beijing bureau chief, and his wife Ms. Wudunn was a New York \nTimes Beijing correspondent in the late 1980s. They are the only \nmarried couple to have ever won the Pulitzer Prize award.\n  In 1989, Mr. Kristof and Ms. Wudunn were awarded with the Pulitzer \nPrize for their reporting during the Tiananmen Square massacre. They \nsaw firsthand the Chinese Government's reprehensible practices. In \nparticular, apart from the Tiananmen Square massacre, they saw \nfirsthand the practices of forced abortions and sterilizations.\n\n  This is what they wrote, these two prize-winning authors. They wrote:\n\n       The family planning authorities routinely forced young \n     women to undergo abortions and sterilization. The township \n     authorities send teams into the villages once or twice a year \n     to collect all the women who are due to be fitted with an IUD \n     or to be sterilized. Some run away, in hopes they can remain \n     fertile and have another baby, and the authorities then send \n     goons to the women's relatives in other villages, even in \n     other provinces, to find and sterilize them. Usually, they do \n     not have to drag a woman to the operating table; when half a \n     dozen men surround her home and order her to come out, she \n     may not see much sense in fighting back.\n\n  Mr. President, the bottom line is that the practice of forced \nabortion and sterilization is inhumane. The practice is repugnant, and \nit is morally reprehensible.\n  This amendment, which I hope to be able to offer in the near future--\nthis\n\n[[Page S6651]]\n\namendment is not about a peculiarly American view of rights. It is not \neven about whether you are pro-life or pro-choice. It does not have a \nthing to do with this amendment. The use of force coercion, \nintimidation to commit such crimes against humanity is something that \nwe all as a freedom-loving people--Democrat, Republican, pro-life, pro-\nchoice--that all of us can join together in vigorously denouncing.\n  I remind you again, what this amendment does is to condemn the \npractice and say, to the extent that we can identify these individuals, \nwith credible information--the Secretary of State can do that--we will \ndeny them visas. This amendment, this ``very controversial'' amendment, \npassed by a vote of 415-1 in the House of Representatives, this \namendment to which objection has been made today on the basis of it \nbeing controversial.\n  Mr. President, were I able to offer additional amendments today--and \nI had four prepared to be offered--I would move to amendment No. 2423, \nwhich I will not offer, but I intend to debate and make a statement on.\n  This is another ``controversial'' amendment. It passed the House of \nRepresentatives by a vote of 366-54. I filed this amendment back on May \n20, almost a month ago. I announced my intent at that time that I would \noffer this amendment to the defense authorization bill. It mirrors the \nlanguage that passed the House of Representatives. It would do three \nthings.\n  It states, as congressional policy, that religious freedom should be \na major facet of the President's policy towards China. Secondly, the \namendment would prohibit the use of American funds appropriated for the \nDepartment of State, USIA or AID to pay for the travel of Communist \nChinese officials involved in the monitoring of government-approved \nchurches in China, or the formulation of implementation of policies to \nrepress worship.\n  So it would deny our Government paying the travel expenses for those \nwho are involved in the Chinese Communist Government in monitoring and \nsupervising churches, places of worship, and those who were involved in \nthe repression and the persecution of religious minorities.\n  Thirdly, it would deny visas to officials engaged in religious \npersecution--not the head of Government, not Cabinet members; we would \nexempt them; and not those who are the official heads of the Patriotic \nchurches, but to Government officials involved in the persecution and \nrepression of religious minorities--they would be denied visas. The \nconditions and the criteria would be the same--credible information, \ncredible evidence as determined by the Secretary of State.\n\n  Mr. President, since the founding of the People's Republic of China \nalmost 50 years ago, the Chinese Government has too often been involved \nin the persecution of religious believers. And they have subjected all \nreligious groups in China to comprehensive control by the state and the \nChinese Communist Party.\n  The five officially recognized religious denominations have been \nreorganized into state-controlled associations, as the Chinese \nBuddhist, the Daoist, the Islamic, the Patriotic Catholic associations, \nand the Protestant Three-Self Patriotic Movement. Even within the pale \nof these authorized religions, Tibetan Buddhists and Uigher Moslems in \nXinjiang have been subjected to wholesale persecution because of the \nenduring links between their religion and their national aspirations. \nFor similar reasons, the Chinese Government has forcibly severed all \nlinks between Chinese Catholics and Protestants and their foreign \ncoreligionists.\n  In fact, while I was in China in January, I met with a group of \nAmerican nationalists, American expatriates, who are doing business in \nChina. They attend church in China and have an American church. It has \nto be an American church by law. They cannot allow Chinese people to \nattend. They have almost 1,000 Americans who attend this church. But in \nmeeting with them, they said, were they to allow any of the Chinese \nnationals to attend and to worship with them, they would be shut down \nbecause of the Chinese Government's fear of any influence from outside \nits own borders.\n  Millions of other religious believers, according to some estimates, \nthe large majority of Chinese, have been deemed to fall outside these \nfive recognized faiths and are simply denied any status as believers \nand are subjected to criminal penalties for practicing what the \nGovernment calls ``superstition'' or ``folk beliefs.''\n  Even congregations of authorized denominations are kept under rigid \nstate control through mandatory registration, a requirement enforced \nwith unprecedented severity through the last several years, what they \ncalled an anticrime crackdown. The anticrime crackdown became the \nrationale for cracking down on religious minorities in China. It has \nbeen very severe in recent years. Registration entails full state \ncontrol over religious doctrines.\n  I met with seminary officials while I was in China in Shanghai. We \nhad a very interesting discussion. They are recognized, authorized, \nregistered with the Government. But they made it very clear, as well, \nthat there are certain things they are not allowed to do. I asked, \ncould you go down the street, rent a building, and open that building \nfor church services? There was a Government official sitting in the \nroom, and they cast a weary glance at the Government officials, and \nthey said no, that would not be tolerated; worship has to be done in \napproved places. I said, could you go out on the street, upstairs--we \nwere meeting in a basement--could you go upstairs and pass out \nreligious literature? Once again, a kind of weary glance at the \nGovernment officials in the room and they said no, that would not be \npermitted; religion must be constrained to certain geographical \nlocations--a far different idea of what religious freedom is--in China \ntoday.\n  The content of preaching in sermons is controlled by the Government. \nIt is not permitted to preach on the ``second coming of Christ.'' That \nwould be a taboo subject. They would not allow that to be taught or \nproclaimed in a Protestant or Catholic church in China.\n  The selection of clergy--controlled by the Government. Financial \naffairs, religious materials, building programs--you can't go build a \nchurch without getting a zoning requirement. It is a means of \ncontrolling the growth, as well as restriction on educational and \nsocial welfare projects. There is a complete bar on proselytizing \npersons under 18 and an official veto over baptism at any age. \nRegistered congregations must reveal the names and addresses of all \ncongregants.\n  The head of the state's Religious Affairs Bureau said in 1996, ``Our \naim is not registration for its own sake but control over places for \nreligious activities, as well as over all religious activities \nthemselves.'' I don't know how you could be much more upfront, much \nmore candid, than this official was, an individual who is the head of \nthe entire China state Religious Affairs Bureau and very recently, in \n1996, said, ``Our aim is not registration . . .'' just to register, our \ngoal is ``control over places for religious activities, as well as over \nall religious activities themselves.'' The key word is the word \n``control.'' That is the reason they require churches, synagogues, \nBuddhist temples, that is why they require all religious activities to \nbe approved and sanctioned by the Government. Religious organizations \nare required to promote socialism and patriotism, while the massive \nstate and party propaganda apparatus vigorously promotes atheism and \ncombat superstition. While the Government officially promotes atheism, \nthey demand that the churches support and promote patriotism.\n  Why is there this intense effort to control religion in China? I \nsuggest if you look back to the ancient Roman empire, you can find an \nexample of why that is so important to the Communist Chinese \nGovernment. It was the policy of the Roman empire that they practice \nwhat they called ``religious tolerance.'' You could have any religion \nyou wanted, so long as whatever religious faith you were, you were \nwilling to acknowledge Caesar as the ultimate sovereign. It would \ndemand that, regardless of your faith, you say Caesar is Lord. That is \nwhere Christianity ran into problems in the Roman empire--it was the \npersecuted religion--because Christians wouldn't say Caesar is Lord, \nthe ultimate sovereign. They saw there was a sovereign, a control \nbeyond the Government, beyond Caesar.\n\n[[Page S6652]]\n\n  May I suggest that is exactly the fear of the Chinese Communist \nGovernment. While they repressed all political dissent, our own State \nDepartment says that all of the political dissidents, all in the \ndemocracy movement have been incarcerated, exiled, or executed. So they \nhave eliminated that threat. They see now that which is beyond their \ncontrol as being the rapid growth of religion. And religion is growing. \nIt is in a tremendous revival. People of faith are multiplying in \nChina. Thus, we find the Chinese Government cracking down on religion \nbecause they see that as, in the long term, a threat to their power and \ntheir control because here is a body of people who see a loyalty beyond \nthe Government in Beijing. So they crack down.\n  The Chinese Government and the Communist Party have in recent years \nintensified these efforts to expel religious believers from the \nGovernment, the military, and the party, ordering a nationwide purging \nof believers in January 1995. In spite of this, there is a phenomenal \ngrowth occurring among people of faith in China.\n  But I am deeply concerned about the mounting campaign against people \nof faith in China. The Roman Catholic Church has been made--at least \nthe part of the Roman Catholic Church that recognizes the Vatican and \nthe papal authority in Rome--has been made effectively illegal in China \ntoday. Priests, bishops, people of faith have been imprisoned and \nharassed. Zheng Yunsu, the leader of a Jesus family, a Protestant \ncommunity in Shandong Province, is one of many behind bars today simply \nfor practicing their faith. He was arrested during a police raid in the \ncommunity in 1992. Then he was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment for \ndisrupting--listen to this--for ``disrupting public order and \nswindling.'' His four sons and other members of the group were also \nimprisoned. I believe those individuals are prisoners of conscience and \nprisoners of faith.\n  Such persecution of religious groups has followed a substantial \nreligious revival of China in the past 15 years. The Christian \ncommunity--much of the expansion has been in religious groups that \nconduct their activities outside the Protestant and Catholic churches \nrecognized by the Government.\n  When I visited China in January, I attended a church that worshipped \nopenly, but in order to worship openly, they had to be approved, they \nhad to be sanctioned, they had to be registered by the Government. But \nthe explosive growth among believers in China today of all faiths is \noccurring primarily among the unregistered, the underground church, the \nhouse church movement.\n  Here we have a picture that was smuggled out of one of those house \nchurches. You can see, I think, not only the enthusiasm and the faith \nand the devotion. The picture is worth a thousand words. There are more \nthan a thousand words articulated by that picture. The response of the \nChinese Government to this growth of faith has been to crack down, to \nincarcerate, to persecute, to economically penalize those who would \ndare to worship according to the dictates of their conscience. That is \nwhy we believe we should take a stand. That is what this amendment is \nall about--condemn the practice, deny visas to those involved in it. I \nam sorry, but I have a hard time discerning how that could be \ncontroversial.\n  Mr. President, these peaceful but unregistered religious gatherings \nhave been raided by police. Gatherings like this have been raided by \npolice. Those attending have been beaten, threatened, and detained. \nMany of those detained are required to pay heavy fines as a condition \nfor release. Those regarded as ``leaders'' are usually kept in custody \nand either sentenced to prison terms or administratively detained \nwithout charge or trial.\n  I was talking just last night with a lobbyist, a lobbyist for a very \nmajor American corporation. If I could mention the name of the \ncorporation, everyone would immediately recognize it as being one of \nthe leading companies in this country. This lobbyist engaged me in a \ndiscussion on China. I didn't bring it up, he did. He said, ``I want to \ntalk to you about your convictions on China.'' Then he said, ``Senator, \nour people in Beijing say that there is religious freedom in China \ntoday.'' Then I began to tell about some of the things that are \nactually going on, some of what I learned even while I was there. I \nthink that there is a tremendous disinformation to say that things are \nOK.\n  These aren't American views of freedom, these are basic human values. \nPeople of faith ought to be able to worship according to the dictates \nof their conscience and their own hearts, without fear of intimidation, \nwithout fear of incarceration, without fear of economic penalty.\n  In January 1994, two national regulations on religious activities \ncame into force. Notably, Mr. President, they banned religious \nactivities which ``undermine national unity and social stability.'' Let \nme say that again. They banned religious activities which ``undermine \nnational unity and social stability.'' Whatever in the world does that \nmean?\n  That it the whole point. It is subject to the whims of any local \nofficial who wants to interpret it. Under the broad rubric of these two \nregulations, any activity could be construed as undermining the Chinese \nGovernment and, therefore, constitute a threat punishable by \nprosecution, imprisonment, arrest, and bodily harm.\n  These regulations also require that all ``places of religious \nactivities'' be registered with the authorities, according to the rules \nformulated by China's Religious Affairs Bureau.\n  This means, in effect, Mr. President, that religious groups that do \nnot have official approval may not obtain registration, and that those \ninvolved in religious activities in unregistered places may be detained \nand punished. In other words, if you started a worship service in your \nhome, you could not get official sanction, be registered, and you would \nbe subject to detainment or punishment. Provided in these new \nregulations are detention and criminal penalties for any violation.\n  During this past year, police raids on religious gatherings organized \nby independent groups have continued, with hundreds of Protestants and \nCatholics reportedly detained as a result. More than 300 Christians \nwere reported to have been detained in what appears to have been a \ncrackdown by local police on unregistered Protestant houses and \nchurches.\n  The evidence is clear that there is an intensified Chinese effort to \nrepress religious liberty. This repression ranges from ransacking homes \nin Tibet in search of banned pictures of the Dalai Lama to destroying \nor closing 18,000 Buddhist shrines last spring alone. Ministers, \npriests, and monks are routinely arrested and imprisoned, tortured, and \nsometimes killed for the mere expression of their faith.\n  Mr. President, I believe not only should we adopt this amendment, \nwhich passed with over 350 votes in the House of Representatives, I \nbelieve that the President, on his trip to China, should raise this \nissue to the highest level. I hope he will do that. He said he is not \nintending to meet with dissidents. I hope he will change his mind. I \nhope that he will say what the Chinese people can't say, and that while \nthe Chinese people are gagged, our President won't be gagged. He will \nhave the opportunity and I hope he will talk about these issues.\n  Mr. President, in Paul Marshall's critically acclaimed book ``Their \nBlood Cries Out,'' an authoritative book on religious persecution \naround the globe, the case of Bishop Su is documented. During Bishop \nSu's 15 years in China's prison system, he was subjected to various \nforms of torture. They go through very graphic detail in recounting the \nkinds of suffering that this bishop endured. Unfortunately, that is not \nthe exception.\n  The State Department's most recent report on religious freedom \nstates:\n\n       . . . the government of China has sought to restrict all \n     actual religious practice to government-authorized religious \n     organizations and registered places of worship.\n\n  That is what they have sought to do. Then our State Department goes \ninto a great deal of detail, enunciating exactly the kinds of abuses \nthat are too common in China today.\n  There are only a handful of churches that are open in all of Beijing, \nnot because there are not worshipers or believers, but because of the \npractice of the Government. The legal provisions requiring registration \nof all religious groups have been used against various\n\n[[Page S6653]]\n\ngroups, including members of Protestant house churches who organize \nreligious meetings in their private homes without having registered \nwith the authorities. Many of these groups and the members of these \ngroups don't register out of a personal conviction. They don't believe \nit would be proper. They feel they would be restricting their own faith \nand what they could say and do; so they don't register. Then they face \ndetainment and fines and harassment by the police. Some house churches \nhave voluntarily suspended their meetings because many members were \nbeing harassed, and others have regularly changed premises and meeting \ntimes for worship, moving from place to place to avoid detection by the \nauthorities. Some congregations have even stopped singing during the \nworship time in order to avoid detection.\n  Pressure to register is reported to have increased in the past year. \nReports from various areas show that official control over religious \nactivities has been stepped up. Unregistered Protestant churches in \nShanghai have been under increased Government pressure since December \nof 1994 when authorities announced that ``it was illegal to hold \nreligious activities in unregistered places of worship.'' The \nauthorities reportedly threatened to fine any person found attending or \nleading an unregistered house church meeting. Religious books, \nreligious tapes, and even collection boxes and offering plates have \nbeen confiscated by Government officials.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues that the human costs are higher \nfor unregistered or unauthorized clergy and believers. It is too high. \nWe should and we must denounce it, condemn it, and speak out against \nit. Today, hundreds of people are serving long prison sentences in \nChina--Buddhists, Taoists, Moslems, Catholics, and Protestants--for \nsimply practicing their religious faith.\n  The Beijing government sentenced a 76-year-old Protestant leader to \n15 years in prison for the ``high crime'' of distributing Bibles. Where \ndo you get a Bible in China? There is a lot of talk about how, today, \nthe Chinese Government permits the printing of Bibles. That is true. \nThey set a quota every year. They allow a certain number to be printed, \nbut they can only be distributed in churches, in places of worship \nwhich are officially recognized, sanctioned and registered by the \nCommunist government. That is how you get a Bible in China. So this \nman, 76 years old, was arrested for distributing Bibles illegally. He \nwas sentenced to 15 years.\n  But it is controversial for us to condemn that with an amendment to \nthe Department of Defense authorization. Somehow, it is controversial \nto deny visas to those who are perpetrating these kinds of atrocities \nagainst religious believers. I am sorry.\n  The Government then sentenced a 65-year-old evangelical elder to an \n11-year prison term for belonging to an unauthorized evangelical group. \nThey sentenced a 60-year-old Roman Catholic priest to 2 years of \n``reeducation through labor'' for unknown charges. He had previously \nspent 13 years in prison because of his refusal to renounce the \nVatican. The 6-year-old Panchen Lama--the second highest dignitary in \nTibetan Buddhism--has been detained for a year and a half, and his \nwhereabouts are unknown. Scores of Tibetan Buddhists who refused to \nparticipate in the Communist Chinese sham enthronement of Beijing's \n``Panchen Lama'' have been sent to prison. One leading Buddhist \nspiritual teacher committed suicide rather than to take part in the \ncharade.\n  I have another chart I want to show you. These are simple news \naccounts that have occurred--all of them within the last 2 weeks. They \nare reports in the mainstream media during the last 2 weeks.\n  June 14, The Portland Oregonian reported that:\n\n       Chinese police interrogated and threatened three dissidents \n     who urged President Clinton to press Chinese leaders on human \n     rights during the summit. . . . Police ransacked the homes of \n     Leng and Tang, confiscated the computers, and took the two to \n     a local precinct.\n\n  This is occurring within weeks of the President's visit. Instead of \nthings getting better, they are rounding up dissidents in preparation \nfor the President's visit. That is how little they comprehend the value \nof human rights. That is how little they understand what our concerns \nare in this country. Instead of releasing dissidents, instead of \nencouraging free expression, they round them up.\n  I think we have all read about the unflattering book published in \nChina about our President. What do they do? They round up the books and \ndon't let the books be in the bookstores when our President visits. \nThat is China today.\n  On June 18, the Far Eastern Economic Review reported that, ``Beijing \nwarned the Vatican not to use the Internet or other media channels to \ninterfere with China's religious affairs policies.'' This is June 18. \nSo it is very current in what the Chinese Government is saying, warning \nthe Vatican not to use the Internet to interfere with their internal, \ndomestic, religious affairs policies.\n  On June 16, the New York Times reported on ``an hour-long documentary \non President Jiang Zemin's state visit to the United States last \nyear.'' And it continues. On June 16, the New York Times reported that \nthe Japan Economic News Wire reported that, ``In the run-up of \nPresident Bill Clinton's visit to China, a veteran Chinese dissident \nhas been indicted for helping another activist escape to Hong Kong.''\n  Once again, do you know what gets the publicity? The four, or five, \nor six high-profile prisoners--I will not use the word ``release'' \nbecause they are not released, they are exiled. They are allowed out of \nprison and sent to the United States. They said, ``Don't return.'' This \nadministration would like to say that is a victory for human rights? We \nused to say that was a travesty of human rights, if you were released \nfrom prison, exiled from your country, and not allowed to go back to \nyour homes and families. This is hailed as a victory for human rights. \nThink about the five or six released. Just remember. Right now, in \npreparation for the President's visit, they are rounding up the \ndissidents so there won't be anything that might be embarrassing to the \nChinese Government or to the President. Freedom is embarrassing, you \nknow.\n  June 15, the Asian Pulse reported:\n\n       U.S. Ambassador to China, James Sasser, said today that \n     many of the sanctions imposed on China by the United States \n     after the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre could be lifted in \n     the ``not too distant future.''\n\n  The only reason I put this quote in from the Asia Pulse is that we \nwould be giving these signals out, that our Ambassador would be giving \nthese signals out, in view of--this is what they are doing. They are \ncracking down, they are rounding up the dissidents, they are \npersecuting believers, and we say we are going to lift the sanctions \nthat were imposed after the massacre.\n  On June 15, the South China Morning Post reported that, ``Dissidents \nin several areas, including Shanghai and Weifang In Shangdong Province \nand Xian, the first stop for President Clinton, have complained of \nharassment. Incidents include home raids, detention, telephone tapping, \nand confiscation of computers.''\n  I suppose the appropriate thing when you have a visit of the major \nheads of states, you clean up the streets, paint the buildings, you put \nyour best foot forward, and put your best face on. But the way the \nChinese Government views it is, round up anybody that might say \nsomething that could be contrary to the party line.\n  I am going to go back. This is back to June 6. The New York Times \nreported that ``a bishop in the underground Catholic church has been \narrested.'' This received about 2 inches of print in the New York \nTimes. When Wei was released, it was banner headlines. But when the \nunderground bishop was arrested, it got about 2 inches on page A4 of \nthe New York times. But at least it was there.\n\n  If you will take note, the American people can see that this is what \nis ongoing.\n  When I have the opportunity to offer this amendment--and I will--when \nthe Senate has an opportunity to work its will on this amendment, I \nwill urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment, \ncontroversial though it has been deemed, that passed the House of \nRepresentatives with over 350 votes, and, in so doing, to send a clear \nand unmistakable message to the Chinese Government that religious \npersecution is repugnant, reprehensible, and\n\n[[Page S6654]]\n\nthat such practices will have consequences.\n  I remind you once again that this amendment simply says: We condemn \nsuch practices. Not only do we condemn them, to the extent that we are \nable to identify those who are involved in those practices, we are not \ngoing to sanction your travel to this country by granting you a visa.\n  I don't know how well it can be enforced. I know there are human \nrights groups out there that monitor what is going on in China. I \nbelieve that for government officials, which have an egregious record \nof religious persecution, that we can identify them when credible \ninformation can be brought forward. The Secretary of State can make \nthat determination. And it will send a good and solid signal that this \nis an important issue to the American people, which would deny them the \nright to travel to this country.\n  Were I permitted to offer an additional amendment that I filed \noriginally back on May 20--a month ago--I would offer it were I able to \ntoday.\n  It is, once again, one of those amendments that mirrors the language \npassed by the House of Representatives several months ago by \noverwhelming bipartisan margins. This particular language passed 354 to \n59. I can't offer it today because it has been regarded as \ncontroversial. This is what it would do. It would direct the President \nto instruct the United States representatives to vote against \ntaxpayers' subsidized loans to the People's Republic of China.\n  The second thing it would do is, it would require United States \ndirectors at United States financial institutions, like the IMF and the \nWorld Bank, to vote against concessional loans to the People's Republic \nof China, and it defines concessional loans this way: as those with \nhighly subsidized interest rates, a grace period for repayment of 5 \nyears or more, and maturities of 20 years or more.\n  This is just not something that I offer lightly. I think the facts \nindicate that the People's Republic of China today has a tremendous \ninfusion of capital, the private sector primarily. In the international \nsector, they have great infusions of capital. They have an economy that \nis growing two or three times as fast as the U.S. economy. Given the \nhuman rights record of China, it is unconscionable for us to require \nUnited States taxpayers to subsidize loans to the People's Republic of \nChina. They have enjoyed ready access to international capital through \ncommercial loans, direct investments, sales of securities, bond sales, \nand through foreign aid.\n  International commercial lending to the People's Republic of China \nhad $49 billion in loans outstanding from private creditors in 1995. \nCapital is certainly available without the taxpayer subsidizing it.\n  Regarding international direct investment to the People's Republic of \nChina, from 1993 through 1995 it totaled $97 billion. In 1996 alone, \nthere was $47 billion directly invested in China securities. The \nChinese securities--the aggregate value of outstanding Chinese \nsecurities currently held by Chinese nationals and foreign persons is \n$175 billion. From 1993 to 1995, foreign persons invested over $10 \nbillion in Chinese stocks.\n  My point is that there is ample, there is ready, capital available \nfor Chinese economic development.\n  International assistance and foreign aid: The People's Republic of \nChina received almost $1 billion in foreign aid grants, and an \nadditional $1.5 billion in technical assistance grants from 1993 \nthrough 1995, and in 1995 received $5.5 billion in bilateral assistance \nloans, including concessional aid and export credits.\n  Mr. President, despite China's access to international capital and \nworld financial markets, international financial institutions, which \nhave annually provided it with more than $4 billion in loans in recent \nyears amounting to almost a third of the loan commitments of the Asian \nDevelopment Bank and 17 percent of the loan approvals by the \nInternational Bank for Reconstruction and Development in 1995, we are \nasked to continue to subsidize these loans to Chinese corporations.\n  I think it is time that we cease doing this. China borrows more from \nthe International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Asian \nDevelopment Bank than any other country in the world, and loan \ncommitments from those institutions to China quadrupled, from $1.1 \nbillion in 1985 to $4.3 billion by 1995. In spite of the fact that you \nhave all of this ready capital available for economic development in \nChina, they are utilizing these subsidized loans at an ever greater \nrate.\n  Mr. President, I believe strongly that America's taxpayer dollars \nshould not be used to create unfair advantages for industry's control \nby foreign governments. However, when the World Bank lends money to \nCommunist Chinese industries out of its Poverty Fund, that is exactly \nresult that we have.\n  I say to my colleagues that these loans are not only contrary to \nAmerican interests and the purposes of the Poverty Fund, but they are \nalso unnecessary, given Chinese industry's ready access to foreign \ninvestment, including $48 billion in loans from private creditors in \n1995 and $97 billion in international direct investments from 1993 to \n1995, and $10.5 billion in investment in Chinese stocks by foreigners \nfrom 1993 to 1995, and billions more in various types of foreign \ninvestments. I find it inappropriate that the World Bank and the Asian \nDevelopment Bank loaned China $4.3 billion in both 1995 and 1996, and \nof the 1995 loan amount, $480 million of it, almost $1/2 billion of it \ncame from the World Bank's poverty fund, its concessional loan \naffiliate, the International Development Association. As concessional \nloans, these funds are by definition below market and therefore \nsubsidized by those who fund it--the American taxpayer.\n\n  This amendment will address what I call the ``Chinese wall,'' the \nwall that was erected between economic and political considerations. \nInherent in the bylaws of international financial institutions are \nprovisions that direct the officers of these institutions to neither \ninterfere in the political affairs of any member nor shall they--and I \nam quoting from their bylaws, shall not interfere in the ``political \naffairs of any member, nor shall they be influenced in their decisions \nby the political character of the members or members concerned. Only \neconomic considerations shall be relevant to their decisions.''\n  So in the bylaws of these lending institutions, international lending \ninstitutions, there is a prohibition from considering the political \npractices of the applicant. I believe that it is these bylaws that \nprovide a shield behind which numerous international financial \ninstitutions continue to provide financing to countries, specifically \nCommunist China, that engage in the most egregious abuses of human \nrights; so long as they carry out the economic recommendations agreed \nupon, they can receive the loans. They can continue to receive these \nsubsidized loans. I think that is wrong. I think that should be a \nconsideration, these human rights abuses that are ongoing.\n  This amendment clearly states that ``repressive and oppressive'' \nregimes should not get a loan. In addition, this amendment clearly sets \nout substantive principles that should be adhered to by any U.S. \nnational conducting an industrial cooperation project in China.\n  In other words, while it is a sense of Congress and is nonbinding, \nthe amendment would lay out certain principles by which American \ncorporations conducting business, industrial cooperation in China \nshould adhere.\n  During my time in China and since, and visiting with large American \ncorporations doing business in China, I was continually told that an \nAmerican presence in China would have the effect of transmitting \nAmerican values. If we just allow these companies to set up shop, sell \ntheir products, or put the components together and export them back to \nour country, because we have a $50 billion trade imbalance with China, \nif we will do that, if we will increase trade and allow companies to \noperate there, the result will be a quicker liberalization and a more \nrapid democratization of China.\n  That is what I have heard for the last 5 years since I came to \nCongress. I haven't seen it happen. In fact, what I saw was corporate \nofficials who said we have a cozy relationship with Beijing and we have \nto maintain that cozy relationship in order to do business in China. \nAnd so instead of reflecting American values and human rights values \nand concern about repression and oppression, instead of concern about\n\n[[Page S6655]]\n\nreligious persecution, instead of concern about coerced abortions and \nAmerican officials standing up and denouncing the Beijing government \nfor these ongoing practices, they say in order to do business over \nhere, we can't say those kinds of things; we can't take those kinds of \nstands, but let us operate and somehow these values, which we hold deep \nin our heart--but, unfortunately, they are too often hidden--are going \nto be transmitted.\n\n  And so we would just simply, with a sense of the Congress, lay out \nsome principles that I think are important for American companies to \nutilize if we are, in fact, to help spark the kind of change that we \nall want to see in China.\n  So we suggest suspending the use of any goods, wares, articles, or \nmerchandise that the U.S. national has reason to believe were mined, \nproduced, or manufactured by convict labor or forced labor, and refuse \nto use forced labor in the industrial cooperation project.\n  Pretty good principle to start with, don't you think, for our \ncompanies operating in China to try to monitor better--some of them are \ndoing a good job, some of them are not doing a good job at all, but to \ntry to monitor those products that are coming from slave labor camps \nand to pledge they will not use those products.\n  Secondly, to seek to ensure that political or religious views, sex, \nethnic or national background involvement in political activities or \nnonviolent demonstrations, or association with suspected or known \ndissidents will not prohibit hiring, lead to harassment, demotion, or \ndismissal, or in any way affect the status or terms of employment in \nthe industrial cooperation project.\n  The second principle of the sense of the Congress would simply say \nthat because somebody spoke out and expressed themselves on a political \nissue which might be contrary to the party line, they should not be \nfired or be penalized because of that, not be not allowed to work or \nhave employment.\n  Then we suggest that these projects should discourage any Chinese \nmilitary presence on the premises of any industrial cooperation project \nwhich involves dual-use technologies.\n  The news accounts this morning which said that China has refused to \nagree to an agreement to retarget their missiles, 13 of which are \ncurrently aimed at American cities, I think underscores the importance \nof that principle for American companies doing business in China, that \nwe are not going to have a military presence on those premises that \ninvolve dual-use technologies.\n  And then we suggest that they provide the Department of State with \ninformation relevant to the Department's efforts to collect information \non prisoners for the purpose of the Prisoner Information Registry. If \nAmerican companies want to make a difference in operating in China, \nthat is something they can do, help our State Department monitor the \nhuman rights abuses that are ongoing.\n  And then finally we suggest they should promote freedom of \nexpression, including the freedom to seek, receive, and impart \ninformation on ideas of all kinds. Nonbinding for the private sector \nbut principles, I think, that lay out what our companies should be \nutilizing in their efforts to work in China.\n  Mr. President, this Chinese wall that has prohibited consideration of \npolitical practices and human rights abuses must come tumbling down. \nThis amendment would help do that.\n  And then if we accept this amendment when it is offered, and I hope \nwe will and I think we will--we should--it will spark a rethinking \ninside international financial institutions and our own Treasury \nDepartment. This rethinking should be based on the United States not \nwanting to reward repressive regimes, countries like China that commit \nthe most egregious of human rights abuses with taxpayer-subsidized \nloans.\n\n  Our watchwords on this floor have been and should be ``freedom and \nliberty.'' Part of those watchwords is that we not reward regimes with \nconcessional loans, subsidized by the American taxpayer, when these \nkinds of practices continue. So I am going to urge, when I have the \nopportunity to offer this amendment and have a vote on that amendment, \nmy colleagues to take that stand, not because the President is going to \nChina but because it is the right thing to do, because it was the right \nthing to do last year when the House of Representatives voted on it. It \nis the right thing for the Senate to do.\n  I wish we could have voted on it on May 20 when I filed the \namendment. It in no way is meant to embarrass the President. It is an \neffort to reflect the values of the American people and, as he takes \nthis trip, to buttress his ability to stand in Tiananmen Square and \nsay, ``Congress thinks this is important; the American people believe \nthis is important.''\n  Mr. President, if I were able to, I would offer a fourth amendment--I \nhad intended to offer a fourth amendment, and when I have the \nopportunity, I will. It is an amendment I filed June 16. It also is an \namendment that mirrors language that passed overwhelmingly on the floor \nof the House of Representatives. The vote was 401 to 21--401 to 21. It \nwould authorize an appropriation of $22 million for Radio Free Asia and \nVoice of America for fiscal year 1999. This amendment was deemed \ncontroversial, but it passed 401 to 121. It would authorize $22 million \nfor Radio Free Asia and Voice of America.\n  The President's fiscal year 1999 budget request for Radio Free Asia \nwas $19.4 million. This amendment would surpass the President's request \nby almost $3 million. Radio Free Asia funding comes out of the United \nStates Information Agency, which is a related agency of the State \nDepartment. It is funded through the Commerce-State-Justice \nappropriations bill.\n  The second thing the amendment would do would be to facilitate a 24-\nhour-a-day broadcast to China in the Mandarin, Cantonese, and Tibetan \ndialects as well as other major dialects, including those spoken in \nXinjiang.\n  Let's put that chart up.\n  Additional funding for RFA, Radio Free Asia, would also facilitate \nconstruction of transmitters in the Mariana Islands and accelerate the \nimprovements to the Tinian Island transmitters so they will be \ncompleted by June 30, 1998, instead of January 1, 1999.\n  This map of China is pockmarked with little orange labels. Each one \nof those orange labels represents a location in China in which the \ncitizens of China have managed to get correspondence out to Radio Free \nAsia, expressing their appreciation for the work that Radio Free Asia \ndoes. The greatest tool that we have in bringing about change in China \nis to get the truth, to get the message of democracy and freedom, in to \nthe Chinese people. This amendment will be a step toward doing that.\n  If passed, it will assist with the creation of a Cantonese language \nservice with 16 journalists, including 3 based in Hong Kong and 2 \nroving between the United States and east Asia. The amendment would \nrequire the President to report on a plan to achieve continuous \nbroadcasting in Asia within 90 days.\n  I believe this is a simple amendment to understand. It encourages \nfreedom in China, which we all want--freedom in China. We disagree \nsometimes on methods and strategies, we see different ways to achieve \nit, but I do believe all my colleagues in the U.S. Senate want to see a \nfree China.\n  I want to say to my colleagues, we should all agree also that \nreaching Chinese listeners in all dialects, encouraging the free flow \nof information, can and will serve as the greatest means by which we \ncan get the truth into China. It will be the surrogate media; it will \nbe the substitute for the absent free media in Communist China today.\n  A fundamental prerequisite to political and economic freedom is an \ninformed citizen. However, the Communist Chinese Government has \naccordingly made censorship and control of information available to its \ncitizens its top priority. The Communist Chinese Government maintains \ncontrol by simply not letting the people know. It is getting harder and \nharder to do, because of the Internet and other means of international \ncommunications, but they go to great lengths to keep the Chinese people \nfrom knowing the truth. Radio Free Asia plays a fundamental role, a \nvital role, in getting the truth in to the citizens of China. This \namendment will help to make that a priority.\n  In addition to China's traditional methods--controlling the media, \nsuffocating secrecy, and misinformation,\n\n[[Page S6656]]\n\nmassive use of wiretapping, informants, and other forms of surveillance \nto restrict private sources of accurate information--the regime is \nbuilding an infrastructure for Internet use that will permit the state \nto filter and monitor information on this freest communication media. \nIt is a perfect example of the priority Communist China places on the \npolitical control over economic development. The New China News Agency \neven censors commercial news from Dow Jones and Reuters.\n  The United States still supports the free flow of information around \nthe globe. This is one means by which we can underscore that. That is \nwhat this amendment does. In fact, people now free of communism's grip \non the now-defunct Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact attest to the role that \nRadio Free Europe and Radio Liberty played as surrogate news services \nin these countries. These relatively inexpensive, independently run \nnews services served as the best substitute for the free media that was \nabsent in the old Soviet Union. Similarly, Radio Free Asia provides \ncost-effective surrogate services to permit the free flow of \ninformation to the Chinese people.\n\n  I have come down to this floor time and time again to explain why I \nbelieve this administration's policy toward China is misguided. I do \nnot favor a policy of isolation; I favor a policy of true engagement; I \nfear this administration's policy has not been one of engagement; it \nhas been one of appeasement. We have not engaged them on human rights, \nwe have not engaged them on national security, we really haven't \nengaged them on trade, because we have a $50 billion trade deficit with \nthis Government. But while I have many disagreements with the \nPresident, I applaud his recent remarks concerning Radio Free Asia at \nthe National Geographic Society in a speech last week, I believe it \nwas. In the President's own words, the President said this:\n\n       I have told President Jiang that when it comes to human \n     rights and religious freedom, China remains on the wrong side \n     of history. . . . In support of that message, we are \n     strengthening Radio Free Asia.\n\n  It needs to be strengthened. I appreciate the President saying that, \nand I believe, because of that, he would be glad to support this \namendment. I applaud his words, because Radio Free Asia is broadcasting \nunder the banner of truthful information to the lingering Communist \nlands--specifically, China--and it has been too often underfinanced by \nthis Congress, they have been undermanned, and they have been \noverworked.\n  I believe that Radio Free Asia's mission is to do for Asia what Radio \nFree Europe did for Eastern Europe. That mission is to broadcast the \ntruthful information to countries where the Communist governments ban \nall free expression by their so-called domestic news services. The \nmission of Radio Free Asia is simply to replicate the kind of radio \nservices, in the Communist countries it targets, that those Communist \ncountries would have, were they really free countries, were the \ngovernment to allow it, were there not government censorship.\n  I live in northwest Arkansas. The population in Benton and in \nWashington Counties in northwest Arkansas is probably 250,000 people. \nIn those two counties we have over 20 independently-owned radio \nstations; population 250,000. I was in the radio business. I got out \nbecause that is too competitive--20 radio stations with 250,000 \npeople--but that is the free market. That is the right of every \nAmerican, every entrepreneur--to go out and scrape and take a loan out, \nif need be, apply with the FCC, get a license, get a building permit, \nbuild that tower, and start a radio station. That is what we did, from \nground up. We have 20 radio stations now in that two-county area.\n  When I was in Beijing in January--Beijing, China, one of the largest \ncities population-wise in the world--there was not one independent, \nfree, operating radio station. That says about all that needs to be \nsaid about whether China is really making progress, whether China is on \nthe right side of history. The President was right, they are on the \nwrong side of history. In all of Beijing, not one independent \nnewspaper. I get mad at the newspapers sometimes in Arkansas. They say \nthings I don't like, or they take a position I don't agree with. Boy, \nwhen I look at the alternative, when I look at China today and I think \nabout a city in which all of the newspapers are controlled by the \nGovernment, I thank God for that free press. Radio Free Asia, \nincreasing the funds, providing them the resources, ensuring that they \nare going to be broadcasting in all of the dialects in China and \nbroadcasting around the clock, is the best single step that we can take \nto bring about the wanted change in China.\n  Mr. President, current U.S.-China policies have been debated, are \nbeing debated, and will continue to be debated by this Congress. \nMembers on both sides of the aisle differ on the best paths and avenues \nto promote and secure freedom and liberty for the Chinese people, but \nthis amendment, although it has been called controversial this morning, \nalthough I have not been allowed to offer it this morning, even though \nthe vote would occur next week, this amendment is not controversial. \nThis amendment simply says the greatest means we have of changing China \nis to get information in.\n  The amendment is not pro-China or anti-China. The amendment is pro-\nfreedom. I am perplexed that we cannot offer it today. The Senate, the \nCongress, the President, the American people need to send a clear \nmessage to China and other Communist countries that the U.S. Congress \nwill take all necessary steps to ensure that freedom has a chance to \nblossom.\n  I am bothered, frankly, that as we have seen the preparations for the \nPresident's trip, it has become a microcosm of the broader China \npolicy. Originally, the President wanted to go to China in November. \nChina said, ``We want you to come in June.'' That is the anniversary, \nthe ninth anniversary, of the Tiananmen massacre, when hundreds of \nunarmed, innocent democracy protesters were gunned down by the Chinese \nGovernment. And the Chinese Government says, ``We want you, Mr. \nPresident, to come in June.'' The President agreed.\n  The President originally was going to stop in Japan on this trip, but \nthe Chinese Communist Government objected: ``We don't want you to stop \nin Japan, we don't want you to stop anywhere, because President Jiang, \nwhen he went to the United States, went directly to the United States; \nthat is exactly what we want you to do because we are equals.'' The \nPresident said, ``OK, we won't stop in Japan, we'll make a direct \ntrip.''\n  The President originally was going to have a shorter trip. The \nChinese Government said, ``President Jiang stayed 9 days in the United \nStates, and we want a 9-day visit to China.'' We don't want to \nembarrass, we don't want a loss of face, so we conceded, we acquiesced.\n  The U.S. House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly, over 400, to \nsay, ``Mr. President, please don't be received at Tiananmen Square.'' \nThat is what the elected representatives of the people of this country \nsaid, but the Chinese Government said, ``This is where we give official \nreceptions.'' We acquiesced. We didn't want to violate protocol. You \nknow what I thought about protocol, I thought about that student, that \nportrait, that picture of that lone student standing in the way of \noncoming tanks. Boy, did he violate protocol. Thank goodness he did. \nBut we acquiesced once again, and the fact is, I can't find where we \ndidn't acquiesce. It is not a policy of give and take. It is a policy \nof give and give.\n  These modest amendments, which I will some day be able to offer and \non which we will have a vote--such as increasing the funding for Radio \nFree Asia--is a useful instrument for demonstrating, along with \ndiplomatic and economic ties, concern for the well-being, concern for \nhuman rights. Basic human rights in China will always be an integral \npart of the foreign policy of this country. That is the debate that is \nongoing: Are we going to have a foreign policy devoid of values that \nsays trade at any price, or will we, as we always have done, say human \nrights matters and that values will be reflected in our basic policies \nof this country toward the nations of the world?\n  I look forward to the continuing debate, and I look forward to the \nopportunity that we will have to offer these amendments. I reiterate \nbefore I yield the floor, Mr. President, the timing of the offering of \nthese amendments is\n\n[[Page S6657]]\n\nnot to embarrass the President. These amendments were announced over a \nmonth ago. Most of them were filed a month ago and would have been \noffered a month ago had we had the DOD authorization on the floor a \nmonth ago. Timing is not to embarrass the President on the eve of his \ntrip.\n  I might add that since they are being debated and will be voted on, \neither before or during the President's trip to China, I hope they will \nstrengthen the President's hand, that they will give him a stronger \nargument to make on behalf of human rights as he visits with Chinese \nGovernment leaders. I hope the President will be able to point to these \nvotes in the House and the Senate as he stands on Tiananmen Square, or \nas he makes his speech in the People's Congress and he says, ``These \nare values that are important. Look at the votes in the U.S. Senate, \nlook at what we are doing on Radio Free Asia, on human rights, on \ncoerced abortions, on religious persecution. For the representatives \nelected by the people of my country, these are important issues, and I \nam going to speak about them.'' I hope the President will say this to \nthe Chinese Communist Government leaders: ``You may gag your people, \nbut you cannot gag me, and I will speak for them.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have listened with great interest to our \ndistinguished colleague. The fervor of his beliefs and his goals is \nquite clear through the excellent delivery of his remarks.\n  We spoke yesterday, I in the capacity of assisting the distinguished \nchairman in trying to manage this bill. I think the Senator is aware of \nthe fact that there are bipartisan objections to bringing up his \namendments. The Senator has seen this letter, I presume?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. If the Senator will yield, I will respond to the \nSenator from Virginia. I only became aware only as you speak that there \nwere bipartisan objections. Earlier today, on the other side of the \naisle there were objections to bringing these amendments up today. I \nmight add, these amendments were filed a month ago. As I spoke to the \nmajority leader earlier this week, he was aware and it has been \npublicly reported these amendments were going to be offered to the DOD \nauthorization.\n  The majority leader encouraged me to stay on Friday so I would be \nable to offer these amendments earlier as opposed to later. He \nencouraged me not to wait until Monday or Tuesday in the debate, but \noffer them today, Friday. It was my plan not to return to my home State \nso I would be able to offer these amendments today.\n  I am now aware there are objections, perplexing to me, obviously, \nbecause they passed by such margins in the House. Yes, I am aware there \nare objections. I am certainly no less committed to ensuring that these \namendments will be debated and will be voted on. I think they are \ngreatly important, and I think they are germane, and I think they are \nappropriate. I intend, when given the opportunity, to press for debate \nand for a vote.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished colleague. \nCertainly, I defer to the understandings that he has reached with our \ndistinguished majority leader. Momentarily, I hope to be in \nconsultation with him--Mr. Thurmond and I--on the phone, and I wonder \nif time permits the Senator to wait just for a brief period until we \ncan clarify this.\n  In the meantime, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record the ``Dear colleague'' letter which both \nRepublicans and Democrats have indicated a desire not to have these \namendments brought up, just for purposes of the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 15, 1998.\n       Dear Colleague: When the Senate returns to consideration of \n     the DOD Authorization bill, S. 2057, we expect a series of \n     amendments to be offered concerning the People's Republic of \n     China. These amendments, if accepted, would do serious damage \n     to our bilateral relationship and halt a decade of U.S. \n     efforts to encourage greater Chinese adherence to \n     international norms in such areas of nonproliferation, human \n     rights, and trade.\n       In relative terms, in the last year China has shown \n     improvement in several areas which the U.S. has specifically \n     indicated are important to us. Relations with Taiwan have \n     stabilized, several prominent dissidents have been released \n     from prison, enforcement of our agreements on intellectual \n     property rights has been stepped up, the reversion of Hong \n     Kong has gone smoothly, and China's agreement not to devalue \n     its currency helped to stabilize Asia's economic crisis.\n       Has this been enough change? Clearly not. But the question \n     is: how do we best encourage more change in China? Do we do \n     so by isolating one fourth of the world's population, by \n     denying visas to most members of its government, by denying \n     it access to any international concessional loans, and by \n     backing it into a corner and declaring it a pariah as these \n     amendments would do?\n       Or, rather, is the better course to engage China, to expand \n     dialogue, to invite China to live up to its aspirations as a \n     world power, to expose the country to the norms of democracy \n     and human rights and thereby draw it further into the family \n     of nations?\n       We are all for human rights; there's no dispute about that. \n     But the question is, how do we best achieve human rights? We \n     think it's through engagement.\n       We urge you to look beyond the artfully-crafted titles of \n     these amendments to their actual content and effect. One \n     would require the United States to oppose the provision of \n     any international concessional loan to China, its citizens, \n     or businesses, even if the loan were to be used in a manner \n     which would promote democracy or human rights. This same \n     amendment would require every U.S. national involved in \n     conducting any significant business in China to register with \n     the Commerce Department and to agree to abide by a set of \n     government-imposed ``business principles'' mandated in the \n     amendment. On the eve of President Clinton's trip to China, \n     the raft of radical China-related amendments threatens to \n     undermine our relationship just when it is most crucial to \n     advance vital U.S. interests.\n       Several of the amendments contain provisions which are \n     sufficiently vague so as to effectively bar the grant of any \n     entrance visa to the United States to every member of the \n     Chinese government. Those provisions not only countervene \n     many of our international treaty commitments, but are \n     completely at odds with one of the amendments which would \n     prohibit the United States from funding the participation of \n     a great proportion of Chinese officials in any State \n     Department, USIA, or USAID conference, exchange program, or \n     activity; and with another amendment which urges agencies of \n     the U.S. Government to increase exchange programs between our \n     two countries.\n       Finally, many of the amendments are drawn from bills which \n     have yet to be considered by the committee of jurisdiction, \n     the Foreign Relations Committee. That committee will review \n     the bills at a June 18 hearing, and they are scheduled to be \n     marked-up in committee on June 23. Legislation such as this \n     that would have such a profound effect on U.S.-China \n     relations warrants careful committee consideration. They \n     should not be the subject of an attempt to circumvent the \n     committee process.\n       In the short twenty years since we first officially engaged \n     China, that country has opened up to the outside world, \n     rejected Maoism, initiated extensive market reforms, \n     witnessed a growing grass-roots movement towards increased \n     democratization, agreed to be bound by major international \n     nonproliferation and human rights agreements, and is on the \n     verge of dismantling its state-run enterprises. We can \n     continue to nurture that transformation through further \n     engagement, or we can capitulate to the voices of isolation \n     and containment that these amendments represent and negate \n     all the advances made so far.\n       We hope that you will agree with us and choose engagement. \n     We strongly urge you to vote against these amendments.\n           Sincerely,\n         Craig Thomas, Chairman, Subcommittee on East Asian and \n           Pacific Affairs, Committee on Foreign Relations;\n         Frank H.

I will have an opportunity to visit with my distinguished\n\n[[Page S6658]]\n\nfriend momentarily. I thank you very much for the opportunity to do so.\n  Mr. President, I see the presence of the former distinguished \nmajority leader, a member of the Armed Services Committee. I think he \ndesires to seek recognition.\n  So I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia, Mr. Warner. I have some remarks, but they are not on the \nbill, and I will be happy to wait until others have had a chance to \nspeak on the bill, if it is so desired. I wanted to address some \nremarks to West Virginia's birthday which is on the morrow and also to \nFather's Day, which is on Sunday. But I will be very happy to delay my \nremarks until a later hour, if I can just get some indication of when I \nmight be able to have the floor. I yield to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Michigan, if he can enlighten me on this point.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if I might just have the floor for \na few moments to comment on the remarks of our friend from Arkansas. It \nwon't take me more than 2 or 3 minutes, if he can yield the floor for \nthat purpose. I ask unanimous consent that I be yielded 5 minutes at \nthis time and then the floor return to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I so ask.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will address our friend from Arkansas \nfirst. Let me add my comments to the Senator from Virginia. We were \njust informed last night that this bill was going to be brought back to \nthe floor. We expected there would be the resolution of two \nappropriations bills before this bill came to the floor. We didn't know \nwhen the bill would come back until late last night.\n  As the Senator from Virginia has indicated, there was a ``Dear \nColleague'' letter circulated indicating objections to any \nconsideration of amendments relative to China, specifically those that \nmight involve visas and other things in that letter, of which I am sure \nthe Senator has a copy.\n  In addition, there is a specific objection which the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, as indicated in his \nletter to the majority leader, to any setting aside, or to quote him: \n``I object to any unanimous consent request designed to come to a time \nagreement on or to bring up such an amendment.'' And the amendment that \nhe is referring to is any amendment in this dealing with the People's \nRepublic of China.\n\n  So as one of the managers of the bill here, the minority manager, I \nhave the responsibility, as does the manager on the majority side, to \nprotect Members when there are unanimous consent requests, knowing of \nobjections to those requests.\n  I, too, join our good friend from Virginia in expressing regret to \nthe Senator from Arkansas for his inconvenience, but we were just \ninformed last night. We were never asked whether or not there would be \nagreement to setting aside amendments and so forth so that the \namendment or amendments of the Senator from Arkansas can be brought up.\n  Having said all that, there is at least one of these amendments which \nI am hoping, perhaps, we might be able to get agreement on before this \nday is over; that is the fourth amendment, which has been dealt with by \nthe Foreign Relations Committee. Unlike the first three amendments, \nwhich have not been, the fourth amendment, I understand, has been dealt \nwith by the Foreign Relations Committee. Perhaps we could get that \namendment cleared before the debate is over today. We would have to go \nback to the signers of these letters with these objections in order to \naccomplish that. But I surely would like to accommodate our friend from \nArkansas, if we can, at least to that extent.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my distinguished colleague. Momentarily, a \ntelephone message or conversation will take place with the \ndistinguished majority leader, and quite likely, the writers of that \nletter. So we may have further developments here shortly, I wish to \nadvise my colleague, and the distinguished Senator from Arkansas. I \nknow you have a pressing need to return home, and we are going to try \nand accommodate everybody as much as we can.\n  Mr. President, I see the presence of a distinguished member of the \ncommittee here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia, Mr. Warner, for his kindness. And I also thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan, Mr. Levin, for his consideration \nand courtesy and kindness as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/19/senate-section/article/S6641-5", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6658-S6659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HAPPY BIRTHDAY, WEST VIRGINIA\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on June 20, 1863, in the midst of the great \nCivil War, in which father fought against son and brother fought \nagainst brother, a new star in the constellation that we see on that \nflag was born. It was the 35th star. The great State of West Virginia \nbecame a separate government. Its motto, quite appropriate, considering \nthe history of its birth, is ``Montani semper liberi''--``Mountaineers \nare always free.'' And so I salute my State on its birthday, which will \nbe on tomorrow, as I said; 1863-1998, 135 years, its 135th birthday. \nHappy Birthday, West Virginia!\n  Mr. President, I invite my friends in the Senate to visit West \nVirginia. When I was in the State legislature, 52 years ago, we had \nonly 4 miles of divided four-lane highways. Think of it--4 miles of \ndivided four-lane highways in all of West Virginia, 52 years ago.\n  Then commenting on that fact was Raul Tunley, writing in the Saturday \nEvening Post of February 6, 1960, when he said, with reference to West \nVirginia's highway system, that it was not to be compared with the \nhighway systems of its neighboring States. His exact words were ``Its \n[highway system] is decades behind that of its neighbors.'' That was \n1960. I was in the Senate at that time, and those words were seared on \nmy memory. ``Its highway system is decades behind that of its \nneighbors.''\n  Well, Mr. President, come to West Virginia now. Many times I have \nstopped in hotels and motels in West Virginia. I have met travelers \nfrom other States, tourists who have come to West Virginia to see its \nmajestic mountains, its viridescent hills and its iridescent sunsets, \nand they have commented to me, glowingly, upon our highways, the \nhighways that we now have in West Virginia, the State which Raul Tunley \ndisparagingly wrote about in 1960, saying that ``Its highway system is \ndecades''--not years --``decades behind that of its neighbors.''\n  Well, Mr. President, we in West Virginia welcome visitors from other \nStates. I trust that Senators at one time or another will have traveled \nin West Virginia, and that they will have met its fine citizens and \ntested their hospitality and seen the beauties of nature, all of God's \ncreation, in those mountains.\n  I have visited over 800 of the 1,000 post offices in West Virginia. \nSo I have had an opportunity to get up the hollows and visit up the \ncreeks and over the hills and in the mountains. I have had an \nopportunity to see much of West Virginia by virtue of my travels.\n  And interestingly, Mr. President, West Virginia's post offices, the \nnames of communities and places in West Virginia, tell many stories. If \nyou travel through West Virginia, you can go from Acme to Zenith, from \nPax to War. You can sample Justice, Independence and Liberty without \nleaving your car, and you can drive in Harmony or Confidence, or, if \ntraffic is bad, in Shock. You may even choose to settle in New Era or \nperhaps in Paradise. Maybe Friendly or Hometown is where you want to \nsink your roots.\n  On the other hand, Odd may suit your fancy, if Looneyville, Pickle \nStreet, Pinch, Droop, or Left Hand fail to meet your requirements. \nThese are all place names in West Virginia--towns, cities, and small \ncommunities whose names still reflect the hopes and humors of those who \nsettled my quirky but wonderful home state.\n  Some of these new inhabitants clearly had been elsewhere, or perhaps \nhad missed the homes they left behind, for the map of West Virginia \nreads like a world atlas. You can tour the sights of\n\n[[Page S6659]]\n\nAthens, Belgium, Cairo, Turkey, Ireland, London, Rangoon, Shanghai, \nWaterloo, Medina, Vienna, Congo, Glasgow, Ghent, and Genoa without a \npassport--without crossing more than a county line! You could even \nTango in Montecarlo. You can see much of the United States as well, \nincluding Auburn, Augusta, Bismark, Cleveland, Miami, Dallas, Newark, \nDenver, Washington, and Wyoming. And if these big cities overwhelm you, \nthe lower key attractions of Minnie, Little, or Peewee might be \nsoothing, but if your dreams and fantasies are truly wondrous, then \nCinderella--Cinderella, Cinderella--is the place for you.\n  Some names are more evocative of the settlers' beautiful and wild new \nsurroundings, such as Grassy Meadows, Green Valley, Clear Creek, \nDeepwater, Lake, Limestone, Shady Spring, Cold Stream, Coldwater, Three \nForks, Falling Waters, and even Falling Rock. And speaking of Three \nForks, West Virginia's schoolchildren are good in math. When I was a \nboy, we had the old spelling matches and the arithemetic matches on \nFriday afternoons. So we are good in math. So there is Onego, there is \nTwo Run, there is Three Forks, there is Three Mile, Three Churches, \nthere is Four Mile, Four States, Five Forks, and Six and even Hundred.\n\n  Speaking of falling rock, in fact, rocks figure rather prominently in \nmy state of old mountains. West Virginia communities include, simply, \nRock, as well as Rock Camp, Rock Castle, Rock Cave, Rock Creek, Rock \nOak, Rockport, Rockcliff, Rockford, Rock Gap, Rock Lick, Rock Valley, \nand Rock View, in addition to the more flavorful Salt Rock. And of \ncourse the trees and animals are not to be overlooked, trees and \nanimals discovered by the settlers are also recorded on the maps--Apple \nGrove, Birch River, Oak Hill, Paw Paw, Piney View, Willow Island, \nBeaver, Bob White, Pidgeon, Buffalo, Panther, Wildcat, Deerwalk, Trout, \nPike, Wolfcreek--Wolfcreek Hollow is where I spent my boyhood years--\nElk Garden, Crow, Duck, and of course, as was already mentioned, \nTurkey, West Virginia. I am proud to say that in West Virginia, sites \nas pristine and beautiful as those discovered over two centuries ago \ncan still be savored by today's generations. I proudly offer the \nspectacular chasm of the New River Gorge, the monumental beauty of \nSeneca Rocks, the ecological rarity of Dolly Sods, the unique variety \nand interest of Canaan Valley, where, when I was minority leader, I \ntook all of the democratic Senators there on a weekend for meetings. \nSometimes these meetings are called retreats. I think I was the first \nSenate leader to take Members of the Senate to retreats and especially \nto the choice, unique retreat, sui generis, in Canaan Valley, WV.\n\n  There are the scenic and historic virtues of Harpers Ferry at the \nconfluence of two famous rivers--the gentle Shenandoah and the mighty \nPotomac. The Potomac River rises where? In the highlands of West \nVirginia. This is just a short list of West Virginia's many natural \ntreasures.\n  Of course, West Virginia and King Coal were once nearly synonymous, \nand the importance that mining played in the life and economy of early \nWest Virginia is also evident in her place names. Alloy, Coalburg, Coal \nCity, Coalfield, Coal Fork, Coal Mountain, Coalton, Coalwood, Coketon, \nColliers, Lead Mine, Montcoal, Nitro, Petroleum, and Vulcan, West \nVirginia, all clearly pay homage to the valuable natural treasure that \nunderlies West Virginia's beauty.\n  Romance--Shakespeare--had he lived in a later time--may have been \nthinking of Romance, WV, when he wrote ``Romeo and Juliet.'' Romance \nhas its place as well, both as a community and in the affection of the \nearly settlers for their lady loves, enshrined in countless communities \nnamed after them, from Alice and Rachel and Sarah to Minnie and Dollie \nand Naoma, West Virginia. But some of the most interesting place names \nrelate to the concern that our forebears had to pay to the weather and \natmospheric conditions in those days before electricity, central \nheating, and air conditioning. Ah, what a world it was! West Virginia \nhas towns named Cyclone, Hurricane, Mt. Storm, Skygusty, Tornado, Sun, \nTwilight, Snowflake, Frost, Mud, and Windy. Clearly, El Nino is not the \nonly weather phenomenon to etch a name for itself in people's memories.\n  If West Virginia had much to offer those who ventured into her steep \nmountains, followed her coursing streams in those early days, she has \nso, so much more to offer the world today. Instead of 4 miles of four-\nlane, divided highways, as in 1947, she today has 900 miles of four-\nlane, divided highways. In addition to her stunning good looks, this \nlady State of the mountains offers the brawn, the brain, and the \ntalents of her hard-working and thoroughly modern populace.\n  In towns and cities dotted with institutions of higher learning, West \nVirginia produces the intellectual firepower to combine with the fabled \nbrute strength of her coal miners, her ``John Henrys'' of old. The \ntransportation system, including the interstate highways and \nconnectors, rail, air, and even river routes, is increasingly \ninterconnected and modern. For those who do not wish to transport goods \nor to commute in traffic, West Virginia offers an extensive fiberoptic \ntelecommunications network that allows today's cyber workers to combine \nhigh-technology jobs with an uncrowded pastoral setting--imagine that, \nan uncrowded pastoral setting; how majestic, how beautiful West \nVirginia seems--a low crime rate, and great family life.\n  By this fall, West Virginia will even boast eight distance learning \nnodes, allowing her citizens to maintain and expand their high-\ntechnology edge. In West Virginia, you can surf a standing river wave \nin a brightly colored kayak or surf the net through a computer modem.\n  Well, Mr. President, may I say to my good friend from Nebraska, \nSenator Kerrey, I have spent my career in public service, and the \nunderlying theme of that half-century of labor is one of nurturing the \ninfrastructure that will allow the natural talents of West Virginia's \npeople to flourish, providing the support and encouragement for West \nVirginians of all ages to come, come to West Virginia, come to seek a \ngood education, and the necessary transportation links and other \nservices to attract businesses to the State so that these skilled and \ndevoted sons and daughters of the mountains might remain close to home.\n  While my work has required that I spend much of my time away from the \nhills and hollows of my youth, I cherish every report of new businesses \nchoosing to establish themselves in West Virginia and West Virginia \ncompanies adding jobs and products to their operations in the State. \nThese reports mean that my dreams for West Virginia are coming true, \nthat the dream of so many West Virginians to remain in West Virginia \nand to raise new generations of mountaineers is becoming a reality. I \nsee that energy and optimism throughout the State as new opportunities, \nnew roads, and new buildings rise alongside the gentle reminders of the \ngreat and historic legacy of West Virginia's earlier settlers. It is, \nafter all, proof that Confidence and Paradise can still be found in \nWest Virginia, not far from Prosperity in Raleigh County, WV.\n  So, Saturday, June 20, is the 135th birthday of West Virginia's \nestablishment as the 35th star in the constellation on our national \nflag. I know that God's blessings have shone down on her people, on her \nmountains, on her green hills, and on her green valleys, and that I \nhave been blessed to be a part of securing for her a bright future.\n  Happy birthday, West Virginia, and best wishes to you always! Montani \nsemper liberi--mountaineers are always free! Mr. President, take that \nmessage to China: Mountaineers are always free.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/19/senate-section/article/S6658-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6659-S6662]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              FATHER'S DAY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on Sunday, June 21, Americans will take time \nto honor the Nation's fathers. The Bible tells us to ``honor thy father \nand thy mother.'' But at times, fathers have received less public \nattention and appreciation than mothers. Mother's Day, after all, has \nbeen recognized on a continuing basis since 1914, while Father's Day \nhas only been an official holiday for a little over 25 years.\n  Mr. President, my State has a proud, though little noted, role in the \nhistory of Father's Day. According to the American Book of Days, \nFairmont, WV, held a church service honoring fathers in July 1908. The \nidea did not begin to catch on, however, until a\n\n[[Page S6660]]\n\nwoman by the name of Sonora Smart Dodd launched a campaign the \nfollowing year to establish a day celebrating fatherhood. A resident of \nSpokane, WA--one of Washington's diligent, able, and respected Senators \npresently presides over the U.S. Senate--Mrs. Dodd reportedly wanted to \nhonor her own father, a widower who raised her and her five brothers by \nhimself on a farm in eastern Washington State. As I mentioned, a \nSenator from Washington State is presiding over the Senate, Senator \nSlade Gorton. He is the chairman of the Interior Appropriations \nSubcommittee in the Senate and is one of the most knowledgeable Members \non the subject matter of that subcommittee. He is an excellent \nchairman. But we are talking today about a lady from his State, the \nState which he so honorably represents, the State of Washington.\n  Thanks to Mrs. Dodd's efforts, the first official Father's Day was \nheld in Spokane on June 19, on the third Sunday in June 1910. President \nWoodrow Wilson, who fathered three daughters, and President Calvin \nCoolidge, who had two sons, endorsed the concept of Father's Day, and \nvarious Congresses considered different resolutions making Father's Day \nan official holiday.\n  Finally, in 1972, Congress passed and President Nixon signed into law \na bill making Fathers' Day a national holiday.\n  I remember as a child watching my stepfather, my uncle, who was the \nonly dad I ever knew, Titus Dalton Byrd. I remember watching him set \nforth to toil in the mines, a hard way to make a living, no future, \nsometimes $2 a day, working in the black bowels of the Earth, in water \nholes, under mountains of rocks overhead, loading coal. I saw him set \nforth to work. I suspect that much of what I have achieved in life can \nbe traced to the example of patience, tireless diligence, that he set \nfor me.\n  He was a poor man, a humble man, a quiet man. I never heard him use \nGod's name in vain in all my days with him. And when he left this \nworld, he left owing no man a penny. He was an honest, hard-working \nman, one who accepted his lot in life without complaint. I never in my \nlife saw him sit down at the table--no matter how meager, how humble, \nthe fare--and utter the slightest complaint, never a complaint about \nmom's cooking, although she was an excellent cook, never a complaint. \nHe never complained about anything.\n  Like so many children with their fathers, I continue to be indebted \nto that man, one of the greatest men that I have ever known in life. \nAnd I have known a lot of so-called great men, statesmen, leaders, \nSenators, Governors, shahs, kings, princes. My dad was a truly great \nman, great because he symbolized the great things in life: honesty, \nintegrity, respect for his neighbor, love for his God, faith in his \ncountry. He loved his family. He loved me.\n  I shall always be indebted to him for teaching me by his conduct the \nvirtuous and proper path to take in life, not that I have always \nfollowed that path. But if a parent will ingrain these principles in \nhis children, the child may from time to time wander from the righteous \npath, but in time he will return because the old lessons, the old \nverities, the eternal values, taught and inculcated into the minds of \nthe children, will always, always remain and will become a part of that \nlife and a part of the next generation.\n  The Bible tells us in Ecclesiastes, chapter 9, 10th verse, \n``Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might.'' That old \ndad taught me that. And I took the maxim seriously because he took it \nseriously. He worked hard, very hard.\n  Senators can't know it unless they lived in the mining towns. They \ncan't know the hard drudgery, the discouraging life of the coal miner \nand his family.\n  And my old dad always strove to do his very best, no matter how \nsimple or unexciting the job in the mines. Many men's lives--my \nneighbors, my friends, fathers--depended in a very literal sense upon \nthe quality of each other's work and upon the carefulness of each \nother's work. A careless lighting of a match might snuff out the lives \nof the fathers of hundreds of children. Think of Monongah, WV, where \nmore than 300 lives were taken in one day by an explosion, an explosion \nin a mine.\n  I recall now how late in the afternoon I would go out on the porch \nand look up the railroad tracks and wait for my uncle, my dad. I never \nlived with my natural father. My mother died with the influenza \nepidemic in 1918. I lacked just a few days being 1 year old. I never \nlived with my father after the day she died. And I never saw him during \nthe next 15 years, and then I was able only to visit with him 1 week. \nThat was my natural father. I had three brothers and a sister, but only \nrecently did I learn that I had a fourth brother, who died at \nchildbirth. I grew up in the hands of these wonderful, wonderful \npeople, this old couple who had had one child before I was born. He \ndied of scarlet fever. This old couple took me on my mother's leaving \nthis earthly life. And they brought me from North Carolina to West \nVirginia. So this was my dad. This was my mom. I have no recollections \nof my natural mother.\n\n  But these were the people who raised me. They didn't have much, but \nthey had love for me. I never heard them quarrel at any time in their \n53 years of marriage. Not a quarrel did I ever hear. My wife and I have \nbeen married 61 years. I can't say we haven't had a few spats. But my \nold mom used to say, ``One thing you must remember, both of you, don't \nyou both get mad at the same time.'' When one gets mad, the other \nshouldn't get mad. The other shouldn't say anything. Just sit down, be \nquiet. So that was her recipe, and it worked.\n  I used to look up the railroad tracks and wait for my dad to return \nfrom his day in the mines, swinging his dinner bucket beside him. I \ntreasured my time with him. He encouraged me to read, to draw, and to \nlearn music. Like so many fathers, he wanted me to have a better life \nthan he had had. He set about encouraging my interests and in building \nmy confidence.\n  I suspect that many of my colleagues learned to throw a ball or to \nfly a kite under the tutelage of their fathers. Fathers played such an \nintegral role in many of the memories that many of us have of our \nchildhood. We picture those fathers tending the weekend barbecue, fork \nin one hand and a plate of hot dogs or hamburgers in the other, sitting \npatiently in the stands of the Little League ball game cheering our \nsuccesses, consoling us afterwards about our less than successful \nefforts; or teaching us with a mixture of stern caution and warm \naffection how to drive the family car. That is not an experience or \nmemory of mine. But I know that it is with many others. Such moments \nare as precious as pearls, and we string them together in our minds to \nmake a beautiful necklace of memories.\n  Fathers can be stern, of course, but what father is more worthy than \nthe one who selflessly serves as a garden stake for his young child?\n  I grow a few tomato plants, and I always have a stake to hold those \ntomato plants until they are strong enough that they can climb and make \nit with the help of still larger stakes.\n  So, what father is more worthy than the father who serves as a garden \nstake for his child, using his own example to encourage the tender \nyoung sapling to grow up straight and to grow tall? Good fathers are \nlike good gardeners. They prepare the soil carefully and they coddle \nthe seedlings before handing them off and planting them in the soil of \nlife. And, even then, they weed out the bad influences, prune the bad \nhabits, support and train the tender shoots with discipline and order \nand fertilize with affection.\n  Let me close, Mr. President, with a short poem by Grace V. Watkins \nentitled, ``I Heard My Father Pray.''\n\n     Once in the night I heard my father pray.\n       The house was sleeping, and the dark above\n       The hill was wide. I listened to him say\n       Such phrases of devotion and of love,\n       So far beyond his customary fashion,\n       I held my breath for wonder. Then he spoke\n       My name with tenderness and such compassion.\n       Forgotten fountains in my heart awoke.\n\n       That night I learned that love is not a thing\n       Measured by eloquence of hand or tongue,\n       That sometimes those who voice no whispering\n       Of their affection harbor love as strong,\n       As powerful and deathless as the sod,\n       But mentioned only when they talk with God.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S6661]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I want to commend the able Senator from \nWest Virginia for the remarks he just made. He has told us about that \ngreat State that has so many places named for other places in this \ncountry, so many places. He has told us about his history and the \nhardships he underwent and he has overcome. We are very proud of him. I \nconsider him a man of integrity, ability and dedication. All that he \nhas done in this body is a credit to him.\n  I have never heard unfavorable remarks about Senator Byrd. Everything \nI have heard and learned about him has been good. And after hearing his \ntalk this morning, I am convinced that all the experience he has in his \nlife has influenced him throughout his entire career, which is quite \nremarkable. He has brought out so many instances of how other States \nare connected with his State; his State is intertwined with so many \ndifferent places.\n  Incidentally, in West Virginia there is a town or community named \nThurmond. I don't know whether the Senator is familiar with it or not. \nHe did not mention that, but I mention it to show that South Carolina \nhas a connection with West Virginia, and we are very proud of the \nconnection that we have with the Senator and his State. Again, I wish \nthe Senator long life and much happiness and continued success in all \nof his undertakings.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if I may again claim the floor just for 2 or \n3 minutes, I thank the senior Member of this body for his preeminently \ngracious and charitable remarks.\n  There is a place named Thurmond in West Virginia. It is down on the \nNew River, and it is a very historic place, an old railroad town. There \nwas a poker game there that continued for several years. I have heard \nvarious stories about this poker game that lasted 7 years. Some said it \nlasted 10, 11 or 12 years. It was evidently a long, long time in its \nexistence.\n  Thurmond is just a small town now--not to be called even a town. But \nI am very proud that Senator Thurmond of South Carolina has reminded me \nof Thurmond, WV. I hope Senators will travel through Thurmond at some \npoint. It is on one side of the river, and on one side of the railroad \ntracks. One can see the beautiful mountain peaks on each side.\n\n  I thank the Senator, too, for his services to his State and to his \ncountry. If one reads his biography, one will find that he is truly a \nremarkable Senator who has led an extraordinary and remarkable \npolitical career, a career in public service. He honors me with his \nkind words, and I am thankful to the divine hand that guides us all for \nhaving let me live and serve in this body with Strom Thurmond now for \n40 years. I am grateful for my friendship with him and most \nappreciative of his kind words this morning.\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me just join Senator Thurmond in \nthanking Senator Byrd for his eloquent remarks on his home State on its \nbirthday. We all join the Senator in wishing West Virginia happy \nbirthday and on his tribute to fathers. What the Senator said about his \nfamily, his stepfather, his uncle, and other men who had such an impact \non his life, brave men, modest men, men of modest means who had such an \nimpact on his life, all live through him in us and those memories are \nshared with us. They become part of all of us. And so I want to thank \nthe Senator from West Virginia for sharing those memories with us.\n  I talk a lot back home about lifelong learning. When I talk to \nstudents when they graduate, whether high school or college, I say it \nis the learning that lies ahead of them also which is so important and \nthey should never stop learning. We have greater opportunities for that \nnow as adults because of some of the efforts, as a matter of fact, \nwhich the Senator from West Virginia has made to make possible lifelong \nlearning for our citizens.\n  We all still learn from Senator Byrd. It has been a learning \nexperience for me, being with him in this Chamber, since the first day \nI was here, and that learning experience has never ceased. I do not \nknow of any Member of this body who has not gained a great deal of \nwisdom and knowledge from serving here with the senior Senator from \nWest Virginia. So I thank the Senator for taking the time he did this \nmorning to share those thoughts with us.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if I may just comment briefly, Tennyson \nsaid, ``I am a part of all that I have met, and we are all a part of \neach other.'' I am a part of Carl Levin. Carl Levin is a part of me. I \nam proud to serve in this body with Carl Levin, Senator Levin. He is a \nman who when he studies a bill, studies it with infinite care, \ndissecting each comma and period, semicolon, colon, each word, each \nphrase.\n  The Bible says, ``See us now a man diligent in his business; he shall \nstand before kings.'' Senator Levin is a man with diligence and \nability, and I am proud to know him, proud to serve with him. He is the \nranking member on the Armed Services Committee on which I serve with \nSenator Warner, who is the ranking member on the Republican side. I \nthank him. He has always been very generous, very kind, very thoughtful \nto me. And I hope to predict that within just a few weeks he will join \nme in lauding the Supreme Court of the United States for holding that \nthe Line-Item Veto Act is unconstitutional. He has fought that battle \nwith me, and I hope we are able to join in triumph as Roman Emperors on \nthat great day. May it come.\n  Mr. LEVIN. A hope in which I share, may I say. Thank you, Robert.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the \nremarks of the distinguished Senator from Michigan and our great and \ncourageous chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Mr. Thurmond. For \nall of us who have joined here today, and Senator Kerrey and others, to \nlisten to those beautiful remarks, of course they evoke memories of our \nown parents.\n  My father was a medical doctor who practiced surgery and gynecology \nin the greater metropolitan Washington area all his life. He was proud \nof his heritage from the central part of Virginia, from whence his \nfather and mother came. I often think that no matter what riches there \nare available in the world, there is no greater gift of God or anyone \nelse than to have loving and strong parents. To the extent I have \nsucceeded modestly in life, I owe it almost entirely to a wonderful \nfather and a wonderful mother, who lived to be 96 years old.\n  Senator Byrd, you have left a profound mark on all of our lives. We \nvisited momentarily here before those remarks about the birthday of \nWest Virginia. I continue to make the offer to rejoin Virginia and West \nVirginia, bond them together as they once were, and I will yield the \nposition of the senior Senator from Virginia and allow my colleague to \nbe the senior Senator. Just how Senator Robb will fit into that, I am \nnot sure.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Where does that leave Chuck?\n  Mr. WARNER. We will work out those modest details as we go along. But \nyou have greatly enriched the lives of all of us.\n  What a treasured experience--to have the opportunity to listen to \nSenator Byrd on the floor on this and many other subjects.\n  Perhaps before the day ends, you will give us a quote, relative to \nCicero, as you give Senator Levin and me a little token of what you \nfeel about so strongly.\n  Mr. President, I will be consulting with the distinguished chairman \nof our committee and the ranking member regarding the remainder of the \nday. But we will continue actively on this bill. At this moment, I \nyield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the Senator from Nebraska allow me to \nrespond just briefly to the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner? I want \nto express my gratitude to him for his very lavish and profuse words \nwith respect to me. He shares with us great riches, as we enjoy his \nfriendship and work with him. I look upon him as a great American. He \nis on the Armed Services Committee, a former Member of a President's \nCabinet--Secretary of the Navy. He has demonstrated by his patriotism \nand public service the kind of service that we should try to emulate.\n  I thank him very much for his kind words. They mean much to me.\n\n[[Page S6662]]\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator from West Virginia, my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. First of all, I come to the floor to offer some comments \non S. 2057, a 412-page law that is before us. But I had the pleasure, \nas many others did on the floor, to listen to the statement of the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia about not only West Virginia, \nbut also on Father's Day.\n  I want to offer my praise as well, not just for the Senator's \nstatement, but for the Senator's service. The senior Senator from West \nVirginia has not only made the lives of the people of West Virginia \nbetter, but he has also made the lives of the people of America better \nand, for those of us who have had the opportunity to learn from him, we \nhope our service better as well.\n  I am grateful for the advice and counsel and the assistance that the \ndistinguished Senator has given me. But I am most grateful for those \ntimes when I had the opportunity to sit and listen to his views and his \ncapacity to connect the strength and courage of individuals in the past \nto what we do here on this floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/19/senate-section/article/S6659-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6662-S6693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1999\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I will connect what I say here about this \npiece of legislation with Father's Day. I had the occasion, during our \nlast recess, to take my 23-year-old son and my 21-year-old daughter to \nOmaha Beach. I was in the audience on the 6th of June, 1994, in \nAntelope Park in Lincoln, NE, where, among other people, I heard at \nthat time the senior Senator from Nebraska, Senator Exon, and many \nother speakers talk about that day on the 6th of June, 1944, when very \nyoung men crossed the English Channel in the early morning and, as they \napproached the beaches of Normandy in France--now quite quiet, now \nnowhere near as hostile as it was on that morning--the bullets from the \nGerman trenches rained down upon the beach. And the soldiers, as they \napproached the beach that morning, could hear the bullets raking the \nfront of their landing craft. Those of us who have experienced bullets \nraking in any environment at all understand the courage that it took to \nlower those gates and leave those boats, knowing that it was highly \nlikely that they were going to be shot and that it was even a higher \nprobability, in those early landing craft, that they would die.\n  On the occasion that I took my son and daughter, this year, to Omaha \nBeach, I pointed out the crosses there in this very quiet, reverential \nplace--that each one of them is a story. Each one of them is a son. \nEach one of them was either a potential father or perhaps was a father \nthemselves, leaving behind grieving sons and daughters who remember \nthat extraordinary service.\n  So, on Father's Day I am apt, I suspect as many of us who have served \nare--apt to reflect, not only upon my father, but also upon the fathers \nwho are no longer with us as a consequence of their service, as a \nconsequence of their heroism, as a consequence of their courage. And I, \nas an individual, am always more impressed with the courage and the \nheroism that is done, as the distinguished Senator from West Virginia \nwas describing in his own father, without any expectation that there \nwould be a television camera recording the act, or a newspaper reporter \nwriting it down, or any glory whatsoever, necessarily, coming to that \nindividual.\n  The most important act of heroism is that act of heroism that occurs \nwhen nobody is observing what you do. That is when character is built. \nThat is when the strength of, not just the individual, but the strength \nof the Nation, comes through as well. These young men who landed on \nthat beach on the 6th of June, 1944, knew that they perhaps would die \nwith no one there recording what it was that they had done.\n  I am struck, not just on Father's Day, but on many other days as \nwell, how blessed we are as a result of the sacrifices that our fathers \nmade for us and our forefathers made for us.\n  As I begin my comments on this piece of legislation, I can't help but \nconnect with what the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, the \nsenior Senator, was talking about earlier about fathers and sacrifice \nand the nobility of character that is developed in that moment when you \ndo what your father told you to do. You follow not just the straight \nand narrow path, but often the most difficult path. My own father's \nmost important lesson to me was that the easy road is apt to be the \nwrong road; the easy course is apt to be the wrong course. It is that \ndifficult path that we very often must choose.\n  I am here on the floor to make that observation about this particular \npiece of legislation, Mr. President, S. 2057, 35 titles, 412 pages. I \ncame here as a former Governor, as a former businessperson, and the \nlonger that I am on the job of writing laws, the more impressed I am \nthat there is a connection between these laws and our lives. It may be \nthat some of these words in this piece of legislation I disagree with, \nand I may come to the floor and try to change some of these words, but \nnone of us should doubt that these words are important, that they \ncreate an authorization in law that enables us to have an Army, a \nMarine Corps, a Navy, an Air Force, and a Coast Guard. It frames for us \nand authorizes for us what we will need to defend our Nation.\n  One of the things that I hear very often when I am talking to the \ncitizens of my State whom I represent is they will say to me, ``Well, \nSenator, what threats are there? The cold war is over. For gosh sakes, \nwhat threats are there today to the people of the United States of \nAmerica that would justify this expenditure, not just of money but of \nlives?''\n  Understand, we are not just authorizing the creation of an Army, a \nNavy, a Marine Corps, an Air Force, and a Coast Guard, we are asking \nyoung men and women to come in and swear an oath to their country and \ndefend the people and, if necessary, not only to risk their lives, but \neven to give their lives in a cause that we on this floor declared \nimportant, as we have done in Bosnia, as we have done throughout the \nworld not just in this year but in past years.\n  My answer is, unfortunately it was not readily apparent in the 1920s \nthat there was a threat. Thus, Americans in the 1920s said, ``We have \nsuffered enough in the Great War,'' the so-called war to end all wars. \nIt was supposed to be the last war of mankind. We had a treaty at \nVersailles in 1919. It was believed that was all we had to do. So we \ncame home and wrote laws in response to people saying, ``We've had \nenough.'' We wrote laws that downsized our military, that said there is \nno apparent threat in the 1920s, so we maintained just a skeleton \nforce, if that.\n  Mr. President, my father was a 6-year-old in Chicago in 1919, and \nlittle did he know that the move to demilitarize this Nation, the move \nto isolate this Nation, the move to say that we are going to take care \nof America first and only would result not just in his having to serve \nin the Army, and he was being prepared for the assault of Japan when \nHiroshima and Nagasaki bombs were dropped and Japan surrendered, but \nhis older brother, John, went to the Philippines expecting in 1941 to \nreturn happily a year later, but he was among those who were, on the \n8th of December, the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, he \nwas among those who were on the island in the Philippines unprepared \nfor an attack--unprepared--and, as a consequence, they not only \nsuffered the Bataan death march, but suffered horribly over the next \nfew years.\n\n  It may not be that we see a threat of enormous dimensions today, but \nthis piece of legislation, I hope, prepares us for the threat that we \ndon't see, for the threat that may occur tomorrow. I hope that we \nunderstand as we write this piece of legislation that there are men and \nwomen who are serving us in our Armed Forces.\n  I know that the Armed Services Committee has written in to make \ncertain that they are not only given a sufficient amount of resources \nto train and prepare themselves, but that they are given adequate \nhousing and that they are given adequate health care and that they are \ngiven other things as a consequence of us knowing and understanding \nthat they are serving us and putting themselves at risk in service to \nus.\n\n[[Page S6663]]\n\n  Another area that I think we also need to understand is that there is \ndiplomacy that occurs simultaneously with our authorizing and preparing \nour defenses. One very important piece of diplomacy will occur next \nweek when our President, our Commander in Chief, travels to the \nPeople's Republic of China, the largest nation on Earth, the most \npopulous nation on Earth, still a Communist nation, still, in my \nopinion, suffering as a result of not having what we have, and that is \nthe blessings of liberty, of a government of, by and for the people.\n  I hope that on this defense authorization bill we will not make it \nmore difficult for the President to engage in diplomacy. I hope that we \nare able to restrain ourselves. I know that there is interest in China. \nI know there will be amendments that will come to the floor, but I hope \nthat we will not make diplomacy more difficult, Mr. President.\n  Diplomacy is the effort that we make to say that we are going to do \nall we can, not just to keep our defenses strong to prepare for a \nthreat we may not see today, not just to keep our defenses strong so we \ndiscourage bad behavior, but diplomacy is an effort we make to prevent \nwars from happening in the first place.\n  To that end, I would like to comment a bit on some diplomacy. On \nWednesday of this week, the Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, \ngave a speech about Asia, and especially she commented about the need \nto change our policies carefully towards the nation of Iran.\n  I rise, indeed, to note two important events in the often troubled \nrelationship between the United States and Iran. One of these events, \nSecretary of State Albright's speech to the Asia Society on Wednesday \nnight, and the other event is the World Cup soccer match in France \nbetween the teams of the United States and Iran. This event on Sunday \nis a far smaller event, but it is, nonetheless, still important. First, \nthe speech of Secretary Albright is an intellectual event, and the \nsecond, the soccer match between the United States and Iran, is a \nphysical event.\n  The first deals with the sweep of history, the sweep of culture and \nreligion, and the second takes place in the here and now. Yet, both, in \nmy judgment, are major departures in a complex and extremely difficult \nrelationship. At the level of Governments, the United States and Iran \nhave disliked and suspected each other for 19 years. At the human \nlevel, Americans and Iranians have expressed their resentments towards \nthe other country as they almost unconsciously grow closer to each \nother at the same time.\n  Mr. President, with each passing year, and especially with events \nsuch as the election of President Khatami and the warm reception \naccorded to the American wrestling team in Iran, the gulf between our \nantagonistic Government-to-Government relations, and the more positive \nrelations between the Americans and Iranians are becoming more \napparent.\n  Secretary Albright took an important first step Wednesday night \ntowards closing that gulf. The importance is by no means diminished by \nthe initial negative response that was heard yesterday on Iran's state \nradio. Secretary Albright recognized Mr. Khatami as the choice of 70 \npercent of the Iranian voters, and that he embodies their desire for \nchange for greater freedom, for a society based on the rule of law, for \na more moderate foreign policy leading to an end of Iran's \ninternational isolation.\n  She also noted that Mr. Khatami has started to change Iranian \npolicies of long-term concern to us. At the same time, Secretary \nAlbright noted considerable caution. She said Mr. Khatami does not \ncontrol the entire Iranian Government, and that is perhaps the most \nnotable observation for all of us who are trying to decide what to do, \non the one hand, with Mr. Khatami's very moderate and positive \nstatements and the continued behavior in the overall Government that \nappears to be in conflict.\n  The intelligence services, the military, the Revolutionary Guards are \noutside the control of Mr. Khatami. They respond to Supreme \nJurisconsult Khamenei and the more controversial leaders whose \ncandidate was defeated by Khatami in last year's election. As a result, \nIran's behavior is somewhat schizophrenic.\n\n  For example, with regard to the Arab-Israel peace process, Mr. \nKhatami invited Yasser Arafat to Tehran and accepted Palestinian \ndecisions to negotiate for peace. But Iran also continues to emit harsh \nanti-Israeli rhetoric, which does not advance the cause of peace. \nKhatami has condemned terrorism, but Iran continues to support anti-\nIsraeli terrorist groups like Hezbollah and terrorizes Iranian exile \nopponents of the regime. Iran has made progress against illegal drugs \nand is beginning to reform its institutions. But allies of Khatami, \nsuch as the mayor of Tehran and the Interior Minister, are threatened \nwith trials, which are forms of intimidation by the old guard.\n  As Secretary of State Albright noted, Iran has welcomed large numbers \nof Afghan refugees. Iran has also improved its relations with its Arab \nneighbors in the Gulf. But its development of weapons of mass \ndestruction must give these same neighbors considerable pause. In no \nway could today's Iran be called a force for stability in the region.\n  Secretary Albright was clear that American concerns remain and that \nU.S. policy towards Iran will not change until Iranian policies, and \nthe actions flowing from those policies, change first. But she also \nheld out the possibility for better relations, which must be \ntantalizing to many of the Iranian majority who voted for Khatami. The \npossibility should be equally tantalizing to Americans who want peace, \nwho want security, and who want democracy for all the states of the \nMiddle East.\n  But closure will not come easily, Mr. President, or quickly. I will \nnever completely get over the Iranian holding of our Embassy staff \nhostage in Tehran for over a year, and I suspect many other Americans \nagree with me. The death sentence which Iran applies to a writer whose \nbook offends them and who is thereby condemned to a life in hiding \ndeeply offends me. Let me add that if it is proven beyond a reasonable \ndoubt that Iran was involved in the killing of 19 American airmen at \nKhobar Towers, the consequences for Iran will be severe and the \npossibility for better relations with us will be zero.\n  Major changes in Iranian behavior must precede an improvement in \nrelations between the United States and Iran, and Secretary Albright's \nmeasured tone this Wednesday reflects the administration's sober \nunderstanding of this reality. But she reminded Iran that our problem \nwith them is not their culture or their religion, both of which we \nrespect; the problem is Iranian actions. If those actions change, we \nwill develop a roadmap for better relations over time.\n  Meanwhile, at the human level of athletics, this coming Sunday in \nLyons, France, or in universities across the United States, Iranians \nand Americans accept each other as individuals, compete fairly, and \ncome to know each other as friends. We relearn how much more we have in \ncommon in our fundamental aspirations for our lives and our children's \nlives. If the Iranian Government chooses, our Governments can relate in \nthe same way, and a key region will be safer.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cochran). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  May I commend my friend and colleague from Nebraska for his usual \neloquence. When he reflects on past experiences and provides some \ninsight into some of the actions that this country has taken, and those \nwho wear the uniform of this country have taken, all Americans do well \nto listen, in my judgment. I have enormous respect for him.\n\n  He has drawn our attention today to some important developments that \nhave taken place or will take place in the next week. And I continue to \ncommend him for his leadership in those areas. I have enjoyed an \nassociation that goes over a long time. We did not know each other in \nVietnam, but we served together as Governors, and we came to this \ninstitution together. And I am very proud to call him a friend.\n  Mr. WARNER. If the Senator will yield, I wish to associate myself \nwith the remarks of my colleague from Virginia in regards to the \ndistinguished Senator from Nebraska and how we all\n\n[[Page S6664]]\n\nhave profound respect for his judgments, his remarks, particularly as \nthey relate to the security interests of this country, which he has \nserved and continues to serve very aptly.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I was pleased to be able to yield to my \ndistinguished senior colleague notwithstanding an earlier conversation \nthat appeared to combine two very fine States in ways that might not \nwork to the complete satisfaction of the two junior Senators from those \nStates.\n  Mr. President, the defense bill before us today is a solid package. \nIt represents a bipartisan effort on the part of the committee and a \ndelicate balance between funding our readiness today and preparing for \nthe wars of tomorrow.\n  We are hearing a familiar ring with regard to defense spending. Force \nstructure and end strength have been slashed by over 30 percent. \nOverseas commitments have increased significantly and are pushing our \ntroops to their limits. Procurement funding is down by over 70 percent. \nAnd our vehicles, ships, and aircraft inventories are too old and \ncannot be sustained at current production rates.\n  On the other hand, we are now, in the context of imminent major \nmilitary challenges, in a relatively benign period. The end of the cold \nwar has allowed us to reduce force structure and end strength by \nroughly one-third and procurement by well over half. Despite this, we \nare still spending at 85 percent of the average cold war peacetime \nspending levels, and we will continue to do so at least through 2003--\n85 percent.\n  We have gone from 18 to 10 Army divisions, 36 to 20 fighter wing \nequivalents, and 15 to 11 carriers. Yet we have only cut the budget top \nline by 15 percent.\n  How do we explain this? In part, Mr. President, by increased overseas \ncommitments. Yet even Bosnia involves only about a third of the \ndivision and is costing us less than 1 percent of the defense budget. \nIn part, we are spending more for weapons. But weapons procurement is \ndown by over 70 percent, and each new weapon is much more lethal than \nits predecessor, allowing us to buy fewer.\n  In part, we are having to spend much more for maintenance per vehicle \nor ship or aircraft or weapon because many of these systems are so old. \nBut new systems entering the inventory require far less maintenance, \nand much of the maintenance is now being done for less by the private \nsector.\n  How then can we explain to the American taxpayer that we have cut \nforces by over a third but have only cut the budget by half? And that \namounts to only about 15 percent. The obvious and unequivocal answer is \ninfrastructure. Infrastructure means the facilities and other assets \nthat support our troops on the front line. Above all, it means bases.\n  Last month, we received a BRAC report required by last year's defense \nauthorization bill. The report involved analysis of 259 bases that the \nmilitary departments identified as major installations and concluded \nthat DOD has about 23 percent excess capacity.\n  The report went on to indicate that new base closure commissions in \n2001 and 2005, if bold enough to close the bulk of the remaining \nexcess, will add $21 billion in the years 2008 through 2015 and $3 \nbillion every year thereafter.\n  Needless to say, Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed that this \nCongress is unwilling to authorize another base realignment and closure \ncommission at this time.\n  If we don't have the courage to shut down these unneeded facilities \nto quit wasting so flagrantly the taxpayers' money, we will continue to \nstress our forces to their limits, to lose troops in droves that we've \nspent billions to recruit and train, and to fail to invest in the \nweapons, that will maintain our substantial military edge.\n  I am especially troubled by those who will not support another BRAC \nthen turn around and attack the Administration and the Congress for \nunderfunding the military for deploying U.S. forces to contingencies \noverseas, or for procuring too few weapons.\n  Mr. President, I understand, objections to BRAC, related to \nprivatization-in-place of depot work in Texas and California even \nthough this issue is mostly behind us, the atmosphere, remains \nunnecessarily charged. But the real issue here concerns who is being \npunished by Congressional indignation, with the BRAC process as a \nresult of the recent depot controversy?\n  In the end, we only punish those who most need the benefits of \ninfrastructure savings. First, we punish the nation's taxpayers when we \nfail to make the best use of the resources with which they entrust us. \nSecond, we punish today's soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines, whose \nreadiness depends on sufficient reliable resources for equipment, \ntraining and operations through the year. Finally, we punish tomorrow's \nforce, as we continue to mortgage, research, development, and \nmodernization of equipment necessary to keep America strong into the \n21st century.\n  At its most basic level, getting rid of excess infrastructure, \nconsistent with American public expectations, is just a good \ngovernment. I reiterate may disappointment that we do not have the \nsupport needed to deal with this wasteful situation.\n  Mr. President, I nonetheless support the bill in its current form. It \nincludes many badly needed provisions, including a 3.1 percent pay \nraise for our troops, funding for Bosnia, and funding for numerous \nmodern systems to replace those that are simply too old to effectively \nwage future battles and to be maintained at reasonable costs. I look \nforward to the continued deliberations on this important \nlegislation, not only with my fellow members of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee but with the entire Senate on the important issues \nand challenges that face our Nation today.\n\n  With that, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n\n\n                       oil spills in puget sound\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I will take this opportunity to thank my \ncolleague, Senator Thurmond, and the other managers of this bill, for \nagreeing to a modest amendment of my own in their bill. They and their \nstaffs have been most helpful in this effort.\n  That amendment is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution urging the Navy to \ntake immediate action to control oil spills from Naval vessels at U.S. \nports. This amendment is the result of a discouraging performance by \nthe navy in my home state of Washington this year. There have been six \nsignificant oil spills from Naval vessels in Puget Sound in 1998. In my \nopinion, that is six spills too many.\n  The Puget Sound is the jewel of Washington. With Mount Rainer to the \neast and the Olympic Peninsula to the West, Puget Sound is one of the \nmost beautiful places in the state, and in my admittedly biased \nopinion, in the country. Tourists and recreationists alike enjoy \nsailing, fishing, and ferry rides on the Sound. The Sound is home to \nabundant marine life. Thousands of people in Washington are dedicated \nto keeping Puget Sound clean so that its magnificence can be enjoyed by \ngenerations to come.\n  So, Mr. President, I am disturbed when the carelessness of Naval \npersonnel on vessels docked in the Sound for repairs at the Naval \nShipyard in Bremerton or Naval Station Everett pollutes that beautiful \nbody of water. Six oil spills in as many months is a poor record by any \nstandard.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in pushing the Navy to take immediate \nsteps to curb the number of oil spills caused by Naval personnel in \nU.S. waters. More attention to the risk of oil spills, more training to \nteach Naval personnel how to avoid spills, and improved liaison with \nlocal communities where spills occur should go a long way to improve \nthe Navy's environmental record. Oil spills, Mr. President, can and \nshould be limited.\n  I thank the Armed Services Committee, the bill managers and their \nstaffs for working with me to pass this important amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes \nas in morning business on two additional subjects.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Gorton pertaining to the introduction of S. 2196 \nare located in today's Record under ``Submission on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Forced Abortion \n     Condemnation Act''.\n\n     SEC.   . FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Forced abortion was rightly denounced as a crime \n     against humanity by the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal.\n       (2) For over 15 years there have been frequent and credible \n     reports of forced abortion and forced sterilization in \n     connection with the population control policies of the \n     People's Republic of China. These reports indicate the \n     following:\n       (A) Although it is the stated position of the politburo of \n     the Chinese Communist Party that forced abortion and forced \n     sterilization have no role in the population control program, \n     in fact the Communist Chinese Government encourages both \n     forced abortion and forced sterilization through a \n     combination of strictly enforced birth quotas and immunity \n     for local population control officials who engage in \n     coercion. Officials acknowledge that there have been \n     instances of forced abortions and sterilization, and no \n     evidence has been made available to suggest that the \n     perpetrators have been punished.\n       (B) People's Republic of China population control \n     officials, in cooperation with employers and works unit \n     officials, routinely monitor women's menstrual cycles and \n     subject women who conceive without government authorization \n     to extreme psychological pressure, to harsh economic \n     sanctions, including unpayable fines and loss of employment, \n     and often to physical force.\n       (C) Official sanctions for giving birth to unauthorized \n     children include fines in amounts several times larger than \n     the per capita annual incomes of residents of the People's \n     Republic of China. In Fujian, for example, the average fine \n     is estimated to be twice a family's gross annual income. \n     Families which cannot pay the fine may be subject to \n     confiscation and destruction of their homes and personal \n     property.\n       (D) Especially harsh punishments have been inflicted on \n     those whose resistance is motivated by religion. For example, \n     according to a 1995 Amnesty International report, the \n     Catholic inhabitants of 2 villages in Hebei Province were \n     subjected to population control under the slogan ``better to \n     have more graves than one more child''. Enforcement measures \n     included torture, sexual abuse, and the detention of \n     resisters' relatives as hostages.\n       (E) Forced abortions in Communist China often have taken \n     place in the very late stages of pregnancy.\n       (F) Since 1994 forced abortion and sterilization have been \n     used in Communist China not only to regulate the number of \n     children, but also to eliminate those who are regarded as \n     defective in accordance with the official eugenic policy \n     known as the ``Natal and Health Care Law''.\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  The Chair is advised by the Parliamentarian that 11 are needed to get \nthe yeas and nays.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, while the Chair is seeking to consult with \nthe Parliamentarian, I want to say that this is an effort to keep this \nvery important bill moving. I feel very strongly that this is a limited \nopportunity for the Senate to consider the annual authorization bill. \nThe majority leader, in consultation with the Democrat leader, has \ndecided that we have the balance of this day. We hope to have votes at \n5 o'clock on Monday. I will address that later. We will have Tuesday \nand such part of Wednesday as the leadership will give us to complete \nthis very important piece of legislation.\n  Given this extremely narrow window of opportunity, I hope that we can \nproceed today to have a parliamentary situation, which is in place and \nwhich will enable the distinguished majority leader and the Democrat \nleader, on Monday, to address the Senate and keep this bill active.\n  It is so important because I had the opportunity last night to visit \nwith the Secretary of State, as I had earlier in the day the \nopportunity to have breakfast with the Secretary of Defense.\n  And our country is working with our principal allies in regard to the \nvery serious issues and fractious situations surrounding Kosovo and the \nneed for clarification of our position as it relates to Bosnia.\n  Mr. President, It is very interesting. I remember the extensive \ndebates here on the issue of Bosnia. This Senator time and time again \nwas opposed to sending in the ground forces. But, nevertheless, that \ndecision was made. It was always the thought that you have to contain \nthe Bosnia-Herzegovina geographic area to preclude a spillover into the \nKosovo region, a region which I visited at one point with the \ndistinguished former majority leader, Senator Dole.\n  Mr. President, I understand that I can at this time ask for the yeas \nand nays on the first-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Are the yeas and nays ordered on the second-degree \namendment, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second for the yeas and \nnays on the second-degree?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I understand the ruling of the Chair is that the yeas and \nnays are on all of the amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The Parliamentarian advises me that the yeas and nays have been \nordered on the motion and on the first-degree amendment to the motion.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2737 to Amendment No. 2736\n\n (Purpose: Condemning human rights abuses in the People's Republic of \n                                 China)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send a cloture motion, at the \ninstruction of the distinguished majority leader, to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate upon S. 2057 \n     (Calendar No. 362), a bill to authorize appropriations for \n     fiscal year 1999 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the Armed \n     Forces, and for other purposes.\n         Strom Thurmond, John Warner, Dan Coats, James Inhofe, \n           Dirk Kempthorne, Pat Roberts, Bob Smith, Rick Santorum, \n           John McCain, Olympia Snowe, Larry Craig, Jesse Helms, \n           Charles Robb, Trent Lott, Don Nickles, and Ted Stevens.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, this \ncloture vote will occur on Tuesday, June 23, at a time to be determined \nby the majority leader after notification of the Democratic leader. I \ndo now, however, ask that the mandatory quorum under rule XXII be \nwaived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. For the information of all Senators, a cloture motion was \njust filed on the DOD authorization bill in an effort to keep the bill \nfree from extraneous matters. Under rule XXII, all Senators must file \nfirst-degree amendments by 1 p.m. on Monday, and the second-degree \namendments up to 1 hour prior to the cloture vote.\n  Mr. President, the amendments which have just been filed, of course, \nare offered by the distinguished Senator from Arkansas. I will be in \nconsultation with the majority leader. But at the present time, it is \nthe intention of the Senator from Virginia, in his capacity as \ncomanager of the chairman, Mr. Thurmond, to have a taking of those \namendments. I just wish to inform all Senators of that intention, \nbecause this is an effort to keep this bill once again moving so that \nwe can continue to have action by the Senate on this bill.\n  Does my distinguished colleague at this point wish to address the \nclearances of the amendments that are pending?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Virginia will \nyield.\n  Mr. WARNER. I just yield for a question.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder whether or not it is inconvenient to anyone if we \nput in a brief quorum call for 5 minutes to allow me to do something \nthat I need to attend to, if that would not inconvenience any other \nSenator.\n  Mr. WARNER. Perhaps there are some who wish to address the Senate in \nthe intervening period.\n  I see no Senator seeking recognition. Mr. President, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, earlier today I had the distinct honor of \nattending a 75th anniversary ceremony held at the Naval Research \nLaboratory here in the Anacostia area of our Nation's capital. For 75 \nyears, the U.S. Navy has conducted research on all aspects of radio, \nradar, sonar, space, and the like. It is a facility that is without \ncomparison anywhere in the world in terms of its excellence.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article in today's Washington Post be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1)\n  Mr. WARNER. In today's Washington Post, on page 23, is a brief \ndescription of the historic work that has been performed by this \nlaboratory.\n  I say with a great sense of humility I was asked to speak because of \nthe fact that I am a graduate of a school that was conducted at this \nlaboratory during World War II. Young men, and to my recollection, a \nfew young women, were trained as radio/radar technicians. It was a 15-\nmonth course. Barely a third of those who started this course ever \ncompleted it because it was 6 days and 6 nights, and those were not \nunusual hours during wartime, and then\n\n[[Page S6667]]\n\nfor the period after the cessation of the war in Europe and the \nPacific, the momentum kept up, but they turned out remarkably trained \nyoung people, and I was privileged to be one of them.\n  I remember on the day of graduation--and these are the basic remarks \nthat I deliver today--an admiral stood up and addressed us, and he \nsaid, ``You understand how to maintain,'' which means fix, ``every \npiece of equipment in the United States Navy through which an electron \nflows.''\n  Thousands of young persons went through that program, then reported \nto the fleet, whether it was a ship or submarine or an airplane, and \nthey were immediately able to go in and examine the most complicated \npieces of equipment and repair them. And that was before the black box \nera, where today, if there is a malfunction of a piece of electronic \nequipment, by and large, the technician goes in and pulls the box, \ntakes a spare box out and pushes it right in, and the equipment starts \nup.\n  No, in those days we had to take the time to take off the covering, \ngo in with electronic devices to try to find the faulty vacuum tube. We \ndid not have solid circuitry in those days to any extent. It was vacuum \ntubes, great big capacitors. But that was the equipment that gave the \neyes and ears to the U.S. Navy, and we shared it with our allies.\n  I always believed that this laboratory contributed in a very \nsignificant way to the ultimate victory of the U.S. forces, together \nwith our allies. Radar, which was a distinct advantage that the United \nStates and Britain had, was basically developed simultaneously in Great \nBritain and at this laboratory. That gave us an enormous, what we \ncalled a force multiplier, over the axis forces, because we had the \neyes and ears to project out distances which are small by today's \nmeasure but in those days very significant, and to detect the presence \nof ships and aircraft to give the American and allied forces early \nwarning. I don't know how many lives were saved.\n  This laboratory really was the vision of Thomas Alva Edison, who we \nall recognize as one of the great pioneer scientists in American \nhistory. He had an active role in this institution in 1923. Then for a \nwhile he phased out, and then he came back.\n  I commend the tens of thousands of people who through the 75 years of \nhistory, both civilian and uniform, Navy and Marine, and, indeed, \nofficers and enlisted of other services who have trained there and \ntheir contribution to world freedom.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n        Navy Lab Uncloaks a Secret, Celebrates Its Breakthroughs\n\n                            (By Steve Vogel)\n\n       The veil was pulled away from a Cold War secret this week \n     at the Naval Research Laboratory in Southwest Washington.\n       Speaking to an audience of scientists, lab employees and \n     reporters, top U.S. intelligence officials on Wednesday \n     disclosed the existence of a previously classified spy \n     satellite system.\n       The system, known as Galactic Radiation and Background \n     (GRAB), was launched in June 1960 and became the nation's \n     first reconnaissance satellite system, gathering information \n     on Soviet air defense radars only weeks after Francis Gary \n     Power's U-2 was shot down over the Soviet Union.\n       For the NRL, which this week is celebrating its 75th \n     anniversary, the public disclosure of GRAB was a relatively \n     rare moment in the sun.\n       Spread over 100 buildings on a 130 acre site along the \n     Potomac, NRL has been responsible for a host of critical \n     scientific developments, from the discovery of radar in the \n     1920s to directing the first American satellite program--the \n     Vanguard project--in the 1950s, to a pivotal role more \n     recently in developing the Global Positioning System.\n       GRAB, which was proposed, developed, built and operated by \n     NRL, was ``a milestone in the history of the laboratory in \n     the history of U.S. intelligence,'' said Keith Hall, director \n     of the National Reconnaissance Office, in announcing the \n     declassification.\n       Addressing the family members of NRL employees in the \n     audience, Rear Adm. Lowell Jacoby, the director of naval \n     intelligence, said, ``For many of you, this is the first \n     opportunity to hear what your husband or your father or your \n     grandfather or whoever were doing every day when they came to \n     work at NRL.''\n       The lab, though little known today to many Washingtonians, \n     including the thousands of commuters who drive past it every \n     day on Interstate 295 just above the Blue Plains water \n     treatment plant, is inextricably linked to some of the 20th \n     century's major scientific breakthroughs.\n       Those accomplishments are being celebrated this week in a \n     ceremony and a five-day symposium.\n       ``There's a real long history of firsts that came out of \n     this lab,'' said Ed Senasack, head of the lab's spacecraft \n     engineering department.\n       The lab has provided many things, not the least of them \n     ``time to think,'' said Jerome Karle, who has worked at the \n     lab since 1946. Karle, with his partner and wife, Isabella \n     Karle, used his time to develop a theory for determining \n     molecular structure, for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize \n     for chemistry in 1985.\n       That research, like much of the work at NRL, has had \n     implications far beyond military technology. ``The ability to \n     get these fundamental structures has revolutionized the \n     pharmaceutical industry, because it provides fundamental \n     information about drugs and their activities and processes,'' \n     Karle, 80, said in an interview at the lab where he and his \n     76-year-old wife still lead groundbreaking research.\n       ``NRL is a research lab. It's where the ideas come from,'' \n     says Gerald Borsuk, a scientist who has worked at the lab for \n     three decades. ``NRL has kept research going here when \n     industry has shut theirs down. Nobody wants to spend money on \n     research, because it won't pay off for 10 years.''\n       The lab began with an offhand remark made by Thomas Edison \n     to a newspaper reporter. What the country needed, the great \n     American inventor told an interviewer in 1915, was an idea \n     factory.\n       It took eight years and even some lobbying help from Edison \n     to get congressional funding, but in 1923, the lab opened on \n     the site of an annex to the Navy's Bellevue Arsenal, a \n     location that won out over competing proposals from Annapolis \n     and West Orange, N.J.\n       Peeved that the site near his own lab in New Jersey had not \n     been selected, Edison refused to attend the commissioning \n     ceremony and predicted the lab would develop into a home for \n     incompetent naval officers who would take the work out of the \n     hands of scientists. But within a few years, impressed by the \n     lab's early successes, Edison admitted that his fears were \n     without foundation.\n       One of those early successes--the discovery of radar--\n     happened more or less by accident in the early 1920s. NRL \n     researchers who were experimenting with radio sent signals \n     across the Potomac to a receiver on Hains Point. ``As ship \n     traffic would pass through, they noticed the phenomenon that \n     was radar,'' said Capt. Bruce Buckley, commanding officer of \n     the NRL. Though the Navy was slow to act on the discovery, \n     the NRL was to play a key role in developing radar for \n     military use.\n       In the early years, because NRL was off the beaten track, \n     some hardy employees living in Virginia rowed to work across \n     the Potomac. Well into the 1950s, many employees commuted to \n     work on launches that ferried workers from Alexandria and the \n     Washington Navy Yard.\n       Space exploration became a major part of the lab's \n     operations in the 1940s, when NRL scientists conducted cosmic \n     ray and other experiments by launching captured German V-2 \n     rockets. Many of the most important V-2 experiments were the \n     brainchild of a NRL scientist named Herbert Friedman, a man \n     now considered a space pioneer.\n       ``It was a wonderful opportunity,'' Friedman, 82, but still \n     active at NRL, recalled recently. ``It opened up an entirely \n     new vision of how the sun interacts with the ionosphere.''\n       The lab's most recognizable physical feature, a 50-foot \n     radio telescope atop the headquarters building, was installed \n     in the early 1950s. Though no longer operating, the telescope \n     was used in determining the surface temperatures of Venus, \n     Mars and Jupiter.\n       Vanguard I, developed by NRL, was launched into orbit in \n     1958 and is still there; in March, the satellite marked its \n     40th year in space, by far the record for any man-made \n     satellite.\n       Civilian scientists at NRL praise the Navy's stewardship of \n     the lab, which operates with about $800 million in annual \n     funding and has around 3,400 employees. ``The Navy has kept \n     NRL alive, despite having lots of freaks here, and guys in \n     sandals, and geeks, and you don't know what they'll come up \n     with next,'' said Borsuk.\n       Throughout much of NRL's history, the military leadership \n     has been ``very quick to support anybody with ideas,'' said \n     Friedman.\n       But there is concern at the lab about a growing sentiment \n     in Congress, in the aftermath of the Cold War, against \n     funding research unless it is guaranteed to have concrete \n     results.\n       ``In the past, there weren't [funding problems], but there \n     are pressures outside the military that have made life much \n     more difficult,'' said Nobel laureate Karle. ``It is post-\n     Cold War, but it's accelerating now.''\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about an indispensable \ngroup of people in our military. Mid- and senior level enlisted air \ncrew men and women are critical to America's military and need to be \nproperly compensated for their valuable service. Last year's Defense \nAuthorization bill included a provision to adjust hazardous duty \nincentive pay upward by $50 for E-1 to E-3 enlisted air crew personnel \nand upward by $25 for E-4 air crew personnel. All other enlisted \npersonnel and officers eligible for hazardous duty incentive pay also \nreceived an upward adjustment. Unfortunately, E-5 to E-9 air crew \npersonnel were not included in this adjustment.\n  My amendment provides that $40 increase in hazardous duty incentive \npay for the E-5 to E-9 air crew personnel and adds $15 to the increase \ngiven to E-4 air crew personnel as of this year.\n  I thank the managers of this bill, Senator Thurmond and Senator \nLevin, for their support of this important amendment and for their \nunflagging efforts every year to help the dedicated men and women in \nour armed services.\n  It is crucial that we show our appreciation for America's dedicated \nmid- and senior level enlisted personnel. They provide vital experience \nin all of the military's flying missions. They are also in demand in \nthe private sector. Commercial airlines are willing to pay for well-\ntrained and experienced flight crews. One look at the missions being \nflown by U.S. armed forces, from Bosnia to the Persian Gulf to the \nKorean Peninsula, shows how indispensable experienced air crews are to \nthe defense of U.S. national interests. We cannot afford to keep losing \nthese seasoned professionals.\n  My amendment is one step toward addressing the problem now--letting \nthese experienced aircrew personnel know that as our armed forces \ncontinue to work at a high operations tempo we value their unique and \nindispensable contribution to America's national interests.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I believe this amendment has been cleared by the other \nside.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the amendment has been cleared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If there is no objection to the amendment, without objection, the \namendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2739) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2449\n\n(Purpose: To authorize the transfer of naval vessels to certain foreign \n                               countries)\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I call up amendment 2449 which would \nreplace section 1013 of the bill regarding ship transfers to foreign \ncountries.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Ford, Bond, Lott and \nGrassley, I offer an amendment which would authorize the expansion of \ncounterdrug activities currently performed by the National Guard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

REVISION AND CLARIFICATION OF AUTHORITY FOR FEDERAL \n                   SUPPORT OF NATIONAL GUARD DRUG INTERDICTION AND \n                   COUNTER-DRUG ACTIVITIES.\n\n       (a) Procurement of Equipment.--Subsection (a)(3) of section \n     112 of title 32, United States Code, is amended by striking \n     out ``and leasing of equipment'' and inserting in lieu \n     thereof ``and equipment, and the leasing of equipment,''.\n       (b) Training and Readiness.--Subsection (b)(2) of such \n     section is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(2)(A) A member of the National Guard serving on full-\n     time National Guard duty under orders authorized under \n     paragraph (1) shall participate in the training required \n     under section 502(a) of this title in addition to the duty \n     performed for the purpose authorized under that paragraph. \n     The pay, allowances, and other benefits of the member while \n     participating in the training shall be the same as those to \n     which the member is entitled while performing duty for the \n     purpose of carrying out drug interdiction and counter-drug \n     activities.\n       ``(B) Appropriations available for the Department of \n     Defense for drug interdiction and counter-drug activities may \n     be used for paying costs associated with a member's \n     participation in training described in subparagraph (A).

Mr. President, I'm offering this amendment for myself and \nmy Co-Chairman of the Senate National Guard Caucus, Senator Bond, along \nwith Senators Lott, Stevens and Grassely.\n  Last year conferees added language to the Fiscal Year 1998 Defense \nAuthorization bill requiring all counter-drug missions conducted by \nNational Guard units to comply with section 2012 of Title 10 and \nsection 508 of Title 32. Before these changes, National Guard men and \nwomen supported Federal, State and Local law enforcement agencies in a \nwide variety of ways from transcription and translation of DEA wiretaps \nto aerial and ground thermal imaging of suspected indoor marijuana \ngrowing to maintaining listening and Observation posts along the \nSouthwest Border. But because of changes in last year's bill, National \nGuard members now can only participate in counter drug missions if the \nmission contributes to their military speciality skills or MOS. For \nexample, this means a member of National Guard whose MOS is a radio \nspecialist could only work in that speciality or if an airman is a \nmechanic he or she could only repair an airplane!\n  You won't find anyone in the Guard Bureau or the Department of \nDefense who has ever claimed that counter-drug duty has a negative \nimpact on the training and readiness of National Guard personnel. In \nfact, there's empirical evidence that counter-drug duty enhances the \nmilitary readiness of National Guard personnel. And because counter-\ndrug duty is in addition to the required readiness training, it adds no \nextra readiness training costs. Our amendment will correct this \nproblem, deleting the provisions added in the Fiscal Year 1998 bill, \nand allowing the National Guard to continue this supportive role in \nfederal, state and local drug demand reduction, as well as interdiction \nmissions.\n  The amendment would also clarify how National Guard personnel can be \nused in counter-drug activity when providing support to certain youth \nand charitable organizations. Our amendment would amend the definition \nof\n\n[[Page S6671]]\n\ndrug interdiction and counter-drug activities to specify that such \nactivities include drug demand reduction activities. By providing \nsupport to youth and charitable organizations as part of state counter-\ndrug activities, demand reduction has been part of the National Guard \nprogram since its inception and has had the approval of the Secretary \nof Defense. Language in last year's Defense Authorization bill \npresented major problems in the Guard's ability to interact with these \ngroups.\n  Our amendment also says that federal funds provided to a state for \ncounter-drug activity can be used to procure or lease equipment. \nCurrent law authorizes leasing, but precludes the procurement of \nequipment. This forces states to lease equipment even though it would \nbe more cost effective to purchase the equipment. Examples of equipment \nthat would be more cost effective to purchase then lease would be Night \nVision goggles, Infrared I.D. equipment and Range Finders.\n  Mr. President, these are just the highlights of the major provisions \nof this amendment. I ask unanimous consent that a section by section \nexplanation of this amendment be printed in the Record immediately \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. FORD. In closing, I want to tell the members of the Armed \nServices Committee and their staffs how much I appreciate their \nconsideration and willingness to accept this amendment. I know they'll \ndo the best they can to assure this amendment remains in the final \nbill.\n\n                               Exhibit 1.\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Subsection (a) would specify that Federal Funds provided to \n     a State under a State plan can be used to procure or lease \n     equipment for the National Guard to use in support of drug \n     interdiction and counter-drug activities. A strict \n     interpretation of the current statutory language would \n     authorize the leasing, but preclude the procurement, of \n     equipment necessary to carry out the purposes of the statute. \n     Such an interpretation would impose unnecessary expenses on \n     the program because it would force states to lease equipment \n     in situations where procuring equipment would be more cost \n     effective. This interpretation would also prevent \n     participation in authorized support missions when necessary \n     equipment cannot be leased. The statute needs to be clarified \n     to ensure that States have flexibility in deciding whether to \n     lease or purchase equipment based on considerations of \n     economy and determinations of necessity.\n       Subsection (b) would eliminate the provision in paragraph \n     (b)(2) of section 112 that provides that units and personnel \n     of the National Guard can only perform drug interdiction and \n     counter-drug activities that comply with the requirements of \n     section 2012(d) of title 10, United States Code. Paragraph \n     (b)(2) was enacted as part of the Department of Defense \n     Authorization Act for fiscal year 1998 (public law 105-85) to \n     ensure that the use of units and personnel of the National \n     Guard pursuant to a State drug interdiction and counter-drug \n     activities plan is not detrimental to their training and \n     readiness. However, the restrictions in section 2012(d) are \n     not tailored to address the unique nature of the National \n     Guard drug interdiction and counter-drug program. National \n     Guard personnel may derive readiness and preparedness \n     benefits from their participation in activities under section \n     112, but such activities are in addition to, not in lieu of, \n     required training. If this provision is enacted, National \n     Guard personnel on extended Counterdrug orders will not lose \n     any benefits while performing their required IDT and Annual \n     Training requirements.\n       Subsection (b) would also facilitate the accomplishment of \n     training, by adding a new provision to enable National Guard \n     members on extended tours of duty in the drug interdiction \n     and counter-drug program to participate in required IDT and \n     AT with their units without breaking their orders for \n     counter-drug duty. During such training periods, covered \n     individuals would be entitled to the same pay and benefits \n     which they would otherwise receive if continuously performing \n     duty for the purpose of carrying out drug interdiction and \n     counter-drug activities. This will ensure that these \n     individuals, while performing AT, do not lose any of the \n     benefits associated with the longer period of counter-drug \n     duty. This will also clarify that such individuals, while \n     performing IDT, are entitled to pay associated with full-time \n     National Guard duty, but not additional drill pay.\n       Subsection (c) would clarify and revise the provision in \n     subsection (b)(3) of section 112 that makes the restrictions \n     in section 508 of title 32 applicable to situations in which \n     units or members of the National Guard are used, pursuant to \n     a State drug interdiction and counter-drug activities plan, \n     to provide support to certain youth and charitable \n     organizations. Under subsections (a)(3) and (a)(4) of section \n     508, services cannot be provided to eligible organizations \n     unless the provision of such services enhances military \n     skills and does not result in a significant increase in the \n     cost of training. Because counter-drug activities are not \n     incidental to training, but are in addition to training, \n     these restrictions present a problem. The proposed revision \n     would eliminate these restrictions, but would continue to \n     make the other provisions in section 508 applicable to \n     situations in which services or assistance are provided to an \n     eligible organization as part of a state counter-drug \n     activities plan.\n       Subsection (d) would amend the definition of drug \n     interdiction and counter-drug activities to specify that such \n     activities for purposes of section 112 include drug demand \n     reduction activities. Although drug demand reduction has been \n     part of the activities carried out under section 112 since \n     the inception of the program, the statute needs to be \n     clarified to specifically include such activities to avoid \n     confusion that results from a strict interpretation of the \n     statute. Like any other counter-drug activities, proposed \n     drug demand reduction activities must have a law enforcement \n     nexus in order to be acceptable under a State plan.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I believe the other side has cleared this \namendment.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the amendment has been cleared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am very pleased to be joining Senator \nKempthorne and Senator Cleland, chairman and ranking member of the \nSubcommittee on Personnel, in offering an amendment to the 1999 Defense \nAuthorization Act that would waive current statutory time limitations \nfor award of the Distinguished Service Cross, Distinguished Flying \nCross, and the Distinguished Service Medal to certain deserving \nveterans.\n  Mr. President, I am especially pleased that this amendment will \nenable the Department of the Army to award the Distinguished Service \nMedal (DSM), our third-highest award after the Medal of Honor and \nDistinguished Service Cross, to the late Lt. Colonel Richard Motoso \nSakakida of Fremont, California. The award would honor Colonel \nSakakida's meritorious service as an Army intelligence officer and \nundercover agent in the Philippines during World War II.\n  Colonel Sakakida, a second-generation Japanese American and former \nHawaii native, was recruited by Army military intelligence well before \nthe attack on Pearl Harbor to conduct undercover activities in the \nPhilippines. Then-Sergeant Sakakida served in the Philippines from 1941 \nto 1945, first as a covert operative spying on the Japanese community, \nsubsequently as a military intelligence staffer for General MacArthur, \nand still later, after giving up a seat on an escape aircraft to a \nfellow nisei, as the only Japanese American prisoner of war captured by \nthe Japanese during that conflict.\n  While a POW, Sakakida was subjected to severe torture--beatings, \ndislocation of his shoulders, and cigarette burns--by the feared \nJapanese secret police, the kempeitai, without revealing his covert \nstatus. After gaining the trust of his captors and assigned menial \ntasks in the Judge Advocate's office of the Japanese 14th Army, he was \nable to purloin vital military intelligence, including information on \ntroop movements. He reported this information to General MacArthur's \nheadquarters in Australia via a secret courier service that he helped \nestablish comprising Filipino guerrillas. Some of the information he \nconveyed to the Allies in this way may have contributed to the \ndestruction of a Japanese naval task force.\n  He also took advantage of his position to aid secretly a number of \nAllied prisoners of war who were being held there for trial for \nattempting to escape; Sakakida smuggled food to them and imaginatively \ninterpreted for them during their trials. One of these men, a naval \nofficer who would later become an Oklahoma supreme court justice, \nasserted that he escaped execution only through Sakakida's intervention \nand assistance during his trial.\n  During this period, Sakakida engaged in perhaps his most daring \nexploit, the jailbreak of hundreds of Filipino guerrillas from a \nJapanese prison. Disguised in a stolen Japanese officer's uniform, he \nmanaged to free the guerrilla leader Ernest Tupas and hundreds of other \nimprisoned fighters, who later augmented his intelligence pipeline to \nMacArthur. Yet, despite the opportunity for escape that was offered on \nthis and other occasions, Sakakida chose to remain a prisoner of war in \norder to continue his undercover work.\n  After American forces invaded the Philippines, Sakakida escaped from \nthe retreating Japanese forces at Baguio. During a firefight between \nAmerican and Japanese troops, he suffered shrapnel wounds in the \nstomach. For the next several months Sakakida wandered alone in the \njungle, living off the land, debilitated by his injuries. He finally \nhappened upon American troops, whom he eventually convinced of his \nidentity. At that point, he was informed that the war was over.\n  After the war, Sakakida served with the War Crimes Tribunal, \nobtaining information on war crimes committed by the Japanese in the \nPhilippines. He later transferred to the Air Force, where he led a long \nand distinguished career with the Office of Special Investigations.\n  Mr. President, aside from a Purple Heart Award and Prisoner of War \nMedal, Colonel Sakakida has yet to be honored with an official U.S. \nmilitary decoration for his amazing service in the Philippines. There \nare a number of reasons for this oversight, but most are attributable \nto the official secrecy surrounding his work, which prevented his story \nfrom being recognized for what it was until it was too late to consider \nhim for an appropriate decoration. When his accomplishments at last \ncame to light at a veterans convention in 1991, some of Sakakida's \nsupporters, including myself, sought to have him considered for a high \naward for valor; however, the Army refused to consider any award \napplications in Sakakida's behalf on the basis that the statutory \napplication deadlines for these awards had expired.\n  After numerous failed attempts to waive these rules, an opportunity \nrecently presented itself to seek equity for Sakakida under a new \nprovision of law (section 526 of Public Law 104-106) that requires the \nmilitary services to review the merits of an application for an award, \nregardless of any statutory time restrictions, if a member of Congress \nsubmits such an application. Under the measure, if the military \ndetermines that such an award is merited, it may request a waiver from \nCongress to make the award.\n  Last March, pursuant to section 526, I asked the Army to review \nSakakida's record to determine if he deserved the DSM. In May, the Army \nresponded positively to the request and officially recommended that \nCongress grant the late veteran a waiver from all time limits \npertaining to the award. The amendment that Senator Kempthorne, Senator \nCleland, and I are offering would effectively grant this waiver, \nclearing the way for the Army to confer the DSM on this amazing \nindividual.\n  Mr. President, for the late Colonel Sakakida and his wife Cherry, \nthis day has been long in the making. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment to ensure that a true American hero can receive his due, \nalbeit posthumously. This award means a great deal not only to his \nwidow, but to the entire Japanese American community and all those who \nhonor military service to their country.\n  Should this amendment become law, I would like to recognize the many \nnisei veterans, including members of the all-nisei Military \nIntelligence Service, and other supporters whose enthusiasm sustained \nSakakida's case. I would also like to single out the efforts of three \nindividuals without whose hard work the Army would never have \nconsidered Sakakida's case: Wayne Kiyosaki, who wrote the definitive \nbiography of Colonel Sakakida; Ted Tsukiyama, who served as a key \nhistorical resource; and, most importantly, Colonel Harry Fukuhara, \nwhose tireless advocacy in behalf of the late hero reflects his own \ndedicated service to his nation.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the assistance of Senator Kempthorne, \nSenator Cleland, and Charlie Abell of the Personnel Subcommittee staff \nfor their support and guidance on this matter. I eagerly await the day \nwhen Colonel Sakakida's accomplishments are officially recognized by \nthe U.S. Army.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The amendment has been cleared by this side.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2744) was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n\n[[Page S6674]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2745\n\n (Purpose: To reduce the authority in section 1012 to enter into long-\nterm charters for three vessels in support of submarine rescue, escort, \n                              and towing)\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senator McCain, I offer an \namendment that would broaden the eligibility for giving special duty \npay in the Navy. I believe this amendment has been cleared by the other \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Thurmond] for Mr. \n     McCain proposes an amendment numbered 2746.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title VI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 620. DIVING DUTY SPECIAL PAY FOR DIVERS HAVING DIVING \n                   DUTY AS A NONPRIMARY DUTY.\n\n       (a) Eligibility for Maintaining Proficiency.--Section \n     304(a)(3) of title 37, United States Code, is amended to read \n     as follows:\n       ``(3) either--\n       ``(A) actually performs diving duty while serving in an \n     assignment for which diving is a primary duty; or\n       ``(B) meets the requirements to maintain proficiency as \n     described in paragraph (2) while serving in an assignment \n     that includes diving duty other than as a primary duty.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect on October 1, 1998, and shall apply with \n     respect to months beginning on or after that date.\n\n  Mr. McCain. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment that \nauthorizes the Department of Defense to continue ``Special Pay: Diving \nDuty'' for Career Divers in assignments where diving is performed as a \nnon-primary duty.\n  This amendment will allow the services to continue dive pay for \nindividual career divers who maintain diving currency while serving in \ncritical shore and staff assignments in execution of ``duty of diving'' \norders.\n  The services plan, as a part of the FY00 legislative review process, \nto incorporate this clear policy regarding dive pay. The Navy intends, \nin FY99, to terminate dive pay for divers on shore and staff duty \npending legislative clarification. Terminating this pay for the \nintervening year would alienate each and every service member affected. \nIt also makes no sense.\n  Accepting this amendment will be cost neutral. It simply allows the \nservices to continue paying these critical personnel in the same manner \nas they are currently being paid. In fact, as in previous years, the FY \n1999 Presidential Budget Request includes the funds for this special \npay.\n  The costs associated with rejecting this amendment are much more \ndear. It will cost 4.5 times more to retrain career divers whose \nqualifications expire than it would to have those same personnel \nmaintain currency. Additionally--and more importantly--terminating this \npay for Army divers, Navy SEALs, Explosive Ordnance Disposal personnel \nand Air Force Para-rescue members, will take money out of the pockets \nof the very highly skilled personnel that the services are desperately \nstruggling to retain.\n  Mr. President, this amendment provides a simple, fiscally smart \nsolution to maintaining critical diving skills for our armed services, \nand at the same time, sends a positive message to our service \npersonnel. I urge my colleagues to support this critical amendment.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I urge the Senate adopt the amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The amendment has been cleared.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2746) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Coats and Glenn, I \noffer an amendment which would provide authority for the Department of \nDefense to enter into multiyear contracts for the T-45, E-2C, and AV-8B \naircraft.

The specific authority included:\n  A raise in the minor construction threshold from $1.5 million to $3.0 \nmillion for projects that the Secretary concerned may carry out without \nspecific authorization.\n  A raise in the threshold for unspecified construction projects for \nwhich operations and maintenance funds may be used from $300,000 to \n$1.0 million.\n  A raise in the threshold for minor military construction projects \nrequiring prior approval by the Secretary concerned from $500,000 to \n$1.5 million.\n  These authorities extended for a two-year period and will expire \nSeptember 30, 1998, unless specifically renewed by Congress. The \nlegislation also directed the Secretary to submit a report to the \nCongress regarding the program and specifically provide recommendations \nas to whether this authority should be extended to all DoD \nlaboratories.\n  On May 14, 1998, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, John Hamre, \nsubmitted the required report with the recommendation that the \nauthority should be extended to all DoD owned laboratories and test \ncenters for a five-year full demonstration program.\n  Mr. President, the experience gained from the two-year demonstration \nhas shown that this program works and that it should be expanded to all \nlaboratories and test centers for a limited time period for further \nevaluation. Our amendment would support Dr. Hamre's recommendation. At \nthe conclusion of the test the Secretary of Defense would be required \nto submit a report on the program along with a recommendation regarding \nthe desirability of making the authority permanent.\n  Mr. President, our amendment would not require any additional funds \nand would not impose any additional fiscal burden on the Department of \nDefense. It does hold out the possibility of improving the facilities \nthat conduct the important research and tests on the Nation's military \ncapabilities.\n  I believe this amendment has been cleared by the other side. I urge \nthe Senate adopt the amendment.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2749) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2750\n\n (Purpose: To redesignate the position of Director of Defense Research \nand Engineering, abolish the position of Assistant to the Secretary of \n Defense for Nuclear and Chemical and Biological Defense Programs, and \n   transfer the duties of the latter position to the former position)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I offer an amendment that would change the \nname of the Director, Defense Research and Engineering, DDR, to \nDirector, Defense Technology and Counter-proliferation, and would also \nabolish the position of the Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for \nNuclear, Chemical and Biological matters and move the Nuclear Weapons \nCouncil responsibilities now carried out by that position to the \nrenamed Director, Defense Technology and Counterproliferation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PLAN FOR RAPID TRANSITION FROM COMPLETION OF SMALL \n                   BUSINESS INNOVATION RESEARCH INTO DEFENSE \n                   ACQUISITION PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Plan Required.--Not later than February 1, 1999, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Committee on Armed \n     Services of the Senate and the Committee on National Security \n     of the House of Representatives a plan for facilitating the \n     rapid transition into Department of Defense acquisition \n     programs of successful first phase and second phase \n     activities under the Small Business Innovation Research \n     program under section 9 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. \n     638).\n       (b) Conditions.--The plan submitted under subsection (a) \n     shall--\n       (1) be consistent with the Small Business Innovation \n     Research program and with recent acquisition reforms that are \n     applicable to the Department of Defense; and\n       (2) provide--\n       (A) a high priority for funding the projects under the \n     Small Business Innovation Research program that are likely to \n     be successful under a third phase agreement entered into \n     pursuant to section 9(r) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. \n     638(r)); and\n       (B) for favorable consideration, in the acquisition \n     planning process, for funding projects under the Small \n     Business Innovation Research program that are subject to a \n     third phase agreement described in subparagraph (A).\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to the \nDefense Authorization Bill that will begin to address concerns that I \nhave with regard to the ability of high technology, small businesses to \ncompete in the defense acquisition arena. This amendment, I hope, will \nlay the groundwork for reforming the acquisition and budgeting process \nso that the Department of Defense can take greater advantage of \ntechnological innovations developed by small, high-tech companies. The \namendment does not change any law or policy, it simply directs the \nSecretary of Defense to investigate ways that the Department of Defense \ncould improve the acquisition process so as to enable the rapid \nincorporation of high technology innovations into existing defense \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, small businesses generate a disproportionately large \nshare of the technological innovations in this country. Studies have \nfound that small businesses originate more than two times as many \ninnovations per employee as large businesses.\n  The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program was created by \nthe Small Business Innovation Development Act of 1982. It is intended \nto stimulate technological innovation by using small businesses to meet \nfederal research and development needs. The SBIR program has proven to \nbe a highly effective way of leveraging the creativity of small, high \ntechnology companies. A 1997 Government Accounting Office (GAO) study \nof the Department of Defense's SBIR program concluded that ``quality \nprojects are being funded.''\n  The SBIR program provides small businesses with the opportunity to \ndemonstrate innovative ideas that\n\n[[Page S6677]]\n\nmeet the specific research and development needs of the Department of \nDefense. Under Phases I and II of the program--the research and \ndevelopment phases--small businesses can develop and prove their ideas. \nPhase III of the SBIR program is for the acquisition and procurement of \nsuccessful projects. Due to the rapid pace of technological change, the \ninnovative products developed under the SBIR program often have direct \napplicability to ongoing major defense acquisition programs, where \nincorporation of the product could immediately result in performance \nimprovement and/or cost reduction. The problem lies in taking a worthy \nhigh technology project--one that could provide an immediate benefit to \nan ongoing defense program--and moving rapidly from SBIR's Phases I and \nII (R), to Phase III (acquisition).\n  In the current environment, where major defense acquisition programs \nare often contracted with a single large contractor, it is difficult \nfor a small business to get their high tech innovation inserted into \nthe acquisition cycle. The amendment that I am introducing simply \ndirects the Secretary of Defense to investigate and report on processes \nthat would facilitate the rapid transition of successful SBIR projects \ninto DoD acquisition programs. My goal is to lay the foundation for \nchanges that will improve the incorporation of high technology \ninnovation in defense programs.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I believe this amendment has been cleared by the other \nside.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The amendment has been cleared on this side.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I urge the Senate adopt this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2752) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2753\n\n     (Purpose: To set aside RDT funds for a NATO alliance ground \n                    surveillance concept definition)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Lieberman, I offer an \namendment that provides authority for the Department of Defense to set \naside funds for a NATO alliance ground surveillance concept definition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin, for Mr. Lieberman, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2753.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 219. NATO ALLIANCE GROUND SURVEILLANCE CONCEPT \n                   DEFINITION.\n\n       Amounts authorized to be appropriated under subtitle A are \n     available for a NATO alliance ground surveillance concept \n     definition that is based on the Joint Surveillance Target \n     Attack Radar System (Joint STARS) Radar Technology Insertion \n     Program (RTIP) sensor of the United States, as follows:\n       (1) Of the amount authorized to be appropriated under \n     section 201(1), $6,400,000.\n       (2) Of the amount authorized to be appropriated under \n     section 201(3), $3,500,000.\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, last year DOD had an initiative to have \nNATO adopt the JSTARS system as the NATO alliance ground surveillance \nsystem, but NATO subsequently decided not to acquire the B-707-based US \nJSTARS aircraft.\n  After that decision, the US offered a concept to integrate a variant \nof the US JSTARS Radar Technology Insertion Program (RTIP) sensor into \nan aircraft of NATO's choice. In April, NATO's Conference of National \nArmaments Directors (CNAD) approved a one year concept definition study \nto flesh out this alternative. However, the April decision was too late \nto affect the budget request, so that unless the Department gets the \nauthority that would be provided by this amendment, the concept \ndefinition effort would slip by a year.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the amendment has been cleared here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2753) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, since its enactment some 26 years ago, the \nSurvivor Benefit Plan has been a source of financial security for \nmilitary retirees and their dependents. Should the military retiree \npre-decease his or her spouse, the plan allows for the spouse to \ncontinue to receive a percentage of the retiree's income benefit. This \nis a program that truly works for our retirees, those who dedicated a \nlarge portion of their lives to the service of their country, and I \nstrongly support its continuation.\n  In the past, Congress has understood that changes occur in the lives \nof military retirees and has tailored the Survivor Benefit Program \naccordingly. Retirement from the military is unlike retirement from any \nother type of employment. Military personnel generally retire in their \nlate 30s or early 40s. They spend a large portion of their lives in \nmilitary retirement. During this period, their lives can change \nsignificantly. The circumstances in which they found themselves at the \ntime of their retirement may be dramatically altered over the years. \nAdmittedly, this is more the exception than the rule, but for some \nretirees it is a fact of life.\n  The Congress has previously offered limited open enrollment periods, \nor ``open seasons'' for retirees to participate in the Survivor Benefit \nPlan: once in 1981 and again in 1991. These open seasons are a \nrecognition of the fact that some retirees who initially did not elect \nto participate in the Survivor Benefit Plan have found themselves in \ncircumstances where they would welcome the opportunity to participate \nin the Plan. In the case of the first two open seasons, retirees who \nentered the program after their retirement date were required to pay a \nlump sum amount appropriate to what they would have paid since their \nretirement date. This ensured that the system was fair to those who \nchose to enroll upon retirement.\n  I believe it is once again time to offer an open season to address \nthe concerns of a small number of retirees who are interested in \nparticipating in the plan. The amendment that I am offering allows \nretirees who had not elected to participate in the Survivor Benefit \nPlan at the time of their retirement the opportunity to do so. The \nenrollment period would be limited to one year and would require a lump \nsum payment by the retiree in the amount that he or she would have paid \nin premiums, with accrued interest, since the date of their retirement. \nThe amendment also allows the defense secretary to make adjustments to \nthe retirees premium to ensure the actuarial soundness of the Plan's \nfund.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to make a few remarks about \nthe amendment my friend, Senator Warner, has offered concerning an open \nseason for enrollment in the military Survivor Benefit Program.\n  I understand my colleague's views that it is time to offer the \npossibility of enrollment in this plan to retirees who have, under \ndifferent circumstances, chosen not to enroll.\n  I have been told that the Department of Defense has determined that \nthe amendment, as written, is actuarially sound. As I understand it, \nthat means that this amendment requires the Secretary of Defense to set \npremiums for those who enroll during the proposed open season so that \nthese individuals pay back amounts equal to the amounts they would have \npaid had they enrolled upon retirement.\n  According to DOD, this amendment is not unfair in a monetary sense to \nthose who enrolled upon retirement and have been paying premiums into \nthis program since that time.\n  Nonetheless, I still have several concerns. This amendment would \nallow all retirees, regardless of the state of their health, to buy \ninto the program and, in effect, purchase annuities for their spouses \nthat could cover any number of years. Even though the Department \nbelieves the amendment to be actuarially sound, this could, in my view, \nwork to the detriment of the military retirement fund from which \nsurvivors' annuities are paid.\n  What if all the new enrollees were terminally ill? A 90-year old \nretiree could conceivably enroll under the Warner amendment, pay \npremiums for two years and then leave an annuity for his survivors that \nwould be paid from the retirement funds for a long time.\n  I also remain concerned about the effect this open season would have \non the tendency of younger military personnel to enroll in the program \nupon retirement. I am concerned that an open season like this would \nserve as a disincentive to enrollment by encouraging service men and \nwomen not to enroll at the time they retire and, instead, gamble that \nCongress will authorize another open season at some point before they \ndie. If this is the case, it would not be in the best interests of the \nprogram or the service members.\n  Because of these concerns and the Department's objections, I look \nforward to working with Senator Warner between now and the end of \nconference to address these concerns.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I believe this amendment has been cleared by the other \nside. I urge the Senate adopt the amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the amendment has been cleared on this \nside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2754) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

The provision was intended to \napply to the five most highly-paid executives of a defense contractor, \nand of each division of the contractor. However, the provision caused \nunnecessary confusion as to which contractor officials were covered, \nbecause it used terms that are not currently defined in statute or \nregulation.\n  The proposed amendment would address this problem by defining \n``senior executives'' of a contractor as ``the five most highly \ncompensated employees in management positions at each home office and \nsegment of the contractor.'' The terms ``home office'' and ``segment'' \nare defined in regulation (subpart 31.001 of the Federal Acquisition \nRegulation and Cost Accounting Standard 403-30(a)) and are understood \nby both government and private sector procurement officials.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

SEPARATE DETERMINATIONS OF EXCEPTIONAL WAIVERS OF \n                   TRUTH IN NEGOTIATION REQUIREMENTS FOR PRIME \n                   CONTRACTS AND SUBCONTRACTS.\n\n       (a) Defense Procurements.--Section 2306a(a)(5) of title 10, \n     United States Code, is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(5) A waiver of requirements for submission of certified \n     cost or pricing data that is granted under subsection \n     (b)(1)(C) in the case of a contract or subcontract does not \n     waive the requirement under paragraph (1)(C) for submission \n     of cost or pricing data in the case of subcontracts under \n     that contract or subcontract unless the head of the agency \n     concerned determines that the requirement under that \n     paragraph should be waived in the case of such subcontracts \n     and justifies in writing the reasons for the \n     determination.''.\n       (b) Non-Defense Procurements.--Section 304A(a)(5) of the \n     Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 \n     U.S.C. 254b(a)(5)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(5) A waiver of requirements for submission of certified \n     cost or pricing data that is granted under subsection \n     (b)(1)(C) in the case of a contract or subcontract does not \n     waive the requirement under paragraph (1)(C) for submission \n     of cost or pricing data in the case of subcontracts under \n     that contract or subcontract unless the head of the executive \n     agency concerned determines that the requirement under that \n     paragraph should be waived in the case of such subcontracts \n     and justifies in writing the reasons for the \n     determination.''.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, the Truth In Negotiations Act authorizes \nagencies to waive the requirement for contractors to provide certified \ncost or pricing data in ``exceptional circumstances.'' Under current \nlaw, however, a subcontractor under a contract or subcontract for which \nan exceptional circumstances waiver has been granted may still be \nsubject to the requirement to provide certified cost or pricing data.\n\n[[Page S6680]]\n\n  The administration has requested a change to this law to provide that \nexceptional circumstances waivers extend not only to a contract or \nsubcontract, but also to subcontractors under that contract or \nsubcontract. The proposed amendment would give agencies the authority \nto grant waivers that extend to subcontractors under a contract or \nsubcontract, but would not require that they do so in every case. In \naddition, it would make a technical change to correct a section \nreference.\n  At the same time, the sponsors of the amendment are concerned by some \nof the statements made by the Administration in submitting the proposed \namendment. The section-by-section analysis of the Administration \nproposal contains the following statements:\n\n       The Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act revised [the Truth \n     in Negotiations Act] to permit the head of the procuring \n     activity to grant waivers, rather than the head of the \n     agency. In response to the legislative change, the Federal \n     Acquisition Regulation was revised to encourage the use of \n     waivers when the contracting officer can determine the \n     contract price to be fair and reasonable without the \n     submission of cost or pricing data. As a result, more waivers \n     are being granted today than previously.\n       If the government does not require certified cost or \n     pricing data from a prime contractor because contract price \n     can be determined to be fair and reasonable without the \n     submission of such data, then it should be presumed that \n     there is no need to collect the data from lower tiers.\n\n  The sponsors disagree with the implication that a waiver is \nappropriate whenever a contracting officer thinks that he can determine \nthe contract price to be fair and reasonable without the submission of \ncost or pricing data. The Truth In Negotiations Act, as amended, still \nspecifies that a waiver may be granted only in ``exceptional \ncircumstances.''\n  It is the view of the sponsors that the term ``exceptional \ncircumstances'' requires more than the mere belief of the contracting \nofficer that it may be possible to determine the contract price to be \nfair and reasonable without the submission of cost or pricing data. For \nexample, a waiver may be appropriate in circumstances where it would be \npossible to determine price reasonableness without the submission of \ncost or pricing data and the contracting officer determines that it \nwould not be possible to enter a contract with a particular contractor \nin the absence of a waiver.\n  The amendment would give agencies the flexibility to extend \nexceptional circumstances waivers to subcontractors when it is \nappropriate to do so. However, it is the expectation of the sponsors \nthat the executive branch will clarify the circumstances in which an \n``exceptional circumstances'' waiver may be granted, consistent with \nthe understanding of Congress, as expressed in this statement.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The amendment has been cleared on this side, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I urge the Senate adopt the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is adopted.\n  The amendment (No. 2757) was agreed to.\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Mr. President, the amendment I am offering today on \nbehalf of myself and my colleague from Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe, is a very \nsimple, straightforward amendment. It would simply require that all \nDefense Department physicians have unrestricted licenses in order to \npractice medicine. In addition, our amendment would require the \nDepartment of Defense to set up a monitoring system to ensure that \nmilitary physicians obtain continuing medical education in his or her \nspecialty. This amendment is about ensuring that the men and women of \nour armed forces, as well as their families, are guaranteed a physician \ncorps that meets the same professional standards of civilian \npractitioners.\n  A number of individuals deserve credit for this initiative. First, I \ncommend my friend and colleague from Springfield, Ohio, Congressman \nDave Hobson. Congressman Hobson is one of the true best friends of our \nmilitary families, and he has been a true leader in Congress to ensure \nthese families have available to them a high quality health care \nsystem. He is the lead sponsor of similar legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives, along with thirteen of his colleagues.\n  Congressman Hobson is not the only one from the Dayton area that has \nshown an interest in health care quality for military families. Last \nOctober, a series of articles were written by the Dayton Daily News on \nthe quality of military health care.\n  One particular issue highlighted in this series involved the license \nrequirements for doctors who practice medicine at military facilities. \nWhile civilian doctors hold a license in the state where they practice, \nmilitary physicians can hold a license from one state and practice \nmedicine in U.S. military facilities in all fifty states and around the \nworld. This exemption is needed obviously because military doctors \nfrequently are transferred to other facilities.\n  That general requirement makes good sense. After all, it is \nimpractical to have more than 13,000 military doctors applying and \ntesting for a new license every time they move, which can average one \nmove for every two to three years, and does not include the possibility \nof no notice deployments and yearly exercises. Two of the key \nrequirements of military health care is mobility and flexibility, and \nboth must remain to be the case.\n  Generally, the system works well. Unfortunately, one state has been \noffering ``special'' licenses for doctors practicing at mental \ninstitutions, Indian reservations, and military facilities.\n  The Dayton Daily News reported last year that 77 military doctors \nreceived ``special'' medical licenses, which were easier to obtain and \nhas less rigorous testing requirements. In essence, the ``special'' \nlicense lowered the level of standardized competency.\n\n[[Page S6681]]\n\n  The amendment I introduced today will eliminate this loop hole. \nSpecifically, it will require the Defense Department to have their \nphysicians carry a current ``unrestricted'' license.\n  To their credit, our armed forces, through the regulatory process, \nalready are moving toward the very same goals of this legislation. Our \namendment simply codifies in the law this basic requirement--to ensure \nthat there is a minimum standard of professional competency.\n  Just as important, under our amendment, the mobility and flexibility \nof military health care would be maintained by allowing the \n``unrestricted'' license to be issued by any state, but it will not be \na ``specialized'' license that would be able to circumnavigate \nproficiency standards.\n  Military personnel and their families deserve to have the peace of \nmind that no matter where they are stationed, or where they are \ntreated, they will receive the same level of competent health care.\n  This amendment, Mr. President, gives military personnel and their \nfamilies this peace of mind.\n  I am pleased that our amendment has the support of the National \nMilitary Families Association (NFMA) and the American Association of \nPhysician Specialists (AAPS). I ask unanimous consent that the letters \nof support for this amendment from NFMA and AAPS be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     AAPS, American Association of\n\n\n                                  Physician Specialists, Inc.,\n\n                                        Atlanta, GA, May 14, 1998.\n     Hon. Mike DeWine,\n     U.S. Senate, 140 Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator DeWine: On behalf of the American Association \n     of Physician Specialists (AAPS), I am writing to express our \n     support for your proposed amendment to the Defense \n     Authorization Bill, S. 2057, regarding providing military \n     health care. As a national organization representing \n     thousands of physicians in all specialties and types of \n     practices throughout the United States, AAPS is deeply \n     concerned with the issue of professional standards and \n     qualifications for physicians in practice areas. AAPS was \n     founded in 1952 to provide a clinically recognized mechanism \n     for specialty certification of physicians with advanced \n     training. As the administrative home for 12 approved Boards \n     of Certification, AAPS strives daily to ensure the \n     availability of verifiably trained, certified physicians to \n     provide quality health care to both military personnel, and \n     the civilian population.\n       We thank you for your attention to this important issue, \n     and offer our support and services, should our expertise be \n     of any assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               William J.

Mike DeWine,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator DeWine: The National Military Family \n     Association (NMFA) strongly supports your proposed amendment \n     that would place into law the requirement that all military \n     physicians must possess an unrestricted license to practice \n     medicine. The discovery earlier this year, by members of the \n     media, that military physicians with restricted licenses were \n     providing medical care to service members, military retirees, \n     and their family members created significant concerns within \n     the military beneficiary community. The fact that the current \n     Surgeons General and the Acting Assistant Secretary of \n     Defense for Health Affairs was unaware of this situation was \n     most troubling.\n       NMFA is aware that the Department of Defense has instituted \n     policies to require unrestricted licenses of their military \n     physicians, but feel it important that this initiative is \n     incorporated into law. Since present military health care \n     leaders were unaware of the restricted license situation, \n     NMFA fears that corporate memory could again become blurred \n     and a repeat of the problem could occur.\n       NMFA very much appreciates your concern for military \n     families and your interest in assuring them of the quality of \n     the physicians within the military health care system.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  James M.

Mr. President, I would like to draw attention to a \nproblem in our drug control program. It concerns something that the \nDepartment of Defense (DoD) is not doing. And frankly it's \nembarrassing. Today, the men and women of federal law enforcement \nconstantly put their lives at risk in an effort to fight the increasing \nflow of illicit drugs into our country. Not only do we face the threat \nof an increase of drugs in our children's\n\n[[Page S6682]]\n\nschools and on our streets, but our law enforcement officers continue \nto face a rising tide of violence at our borders and in our cities as a \nresult of the drug trade. We continue to see the flow of narcotics \nacross the Southern tier of the U.S. to include Puerto Rico. Law \nenforcement personnel and their commitment to the mission to fight the \nwar on drugs work many long hours, sometimes late into the evening and \nare subject to changes in their schedules at a moments notice. The \nfamilies of these officers also feel the pressures of the job they \nperform. This brings me to the point I would like to make.\n  The front lines of the U.S. Customs Service are not just a problem of \ngun-toting drug thugs. They face more than long hours and risky \nsituations. While they deal with all these things, they must shoulder \nthe additional burden of coping with bureaucratic bumbledom. This added \nload is a result of DoD officiousness and unwillingness to cooperate. \nThe language of instruction in Puerto Rico public schools is Spanish \nand not English. Therefore, the only affordable English-language school \noption for U.S. Customs' personnel is the DoD school. However, current \nlegislation and DoD policy is creating a hardship for Customs' \nemployees and their families. This unnecessarily affects our counter-\ndrug efforts by undermining morale.\n  It is my understanding that the children of these law enforcement \npersonnel have been attending DoD schools in Puerto Rico for more than \n20 years. Throughout the years, changes in legislation and DoD policy \nhave placed numerous restrictions on Customs and other Federal civilian \nagencies. Customs has recently augmented its workforce in Puerto Rico \nunder its Operation Gateway initiative in light of the continuing and \nheightened threat of narcotics smuggling and money laundering in the \nCaribbean Basin. I supported this initiative. This session I will also \nstress the need for better coordination of our interdiction strategy, \nparticularly the need to develop a ``Southern Tier' concept. This \ninitiative will strive to focus resources in a more comprehensive way \nto protect our southern frontier. Puerto Rico is crucial to this \nstrategy. Current legislation and DoD's policy requirements are, \nhowever, obstacles to the effective implementation of this aggressive \nenforcement initiative in terms of recruitment and retention of Customs \nemployers because as I stated earlier, there are no English speaking \npublic schools in Puerto Rico.\n  I think it is ridiculous that Customs' efforts in Puerto Rico--the \nmen and women who deal daily with difficult and dangerous situations--\nshould find their attention distracted by something like this.\n  The U.S. Customs Service interdicts more drugs than any other \nGovernment Agency. Based on the size of the workforce of Customs in \nPuerto Rico, their critical law enforcement mission, difficulty in \nrecruiting, and the negative affect this policy is having on their \nemployees and families (over 150 children of Customs employees are \ncurrently enrolled in the program), I would like to see a swift \nsolution to these problems.\n\n  Recently, a Customs Special Agent was killed in an accident while \nassisting the U.S. Secret Service on a Presidential detail that \nhighlights another problem. My legislation will also address a concern \nraised by this case. It happens that the children of this agent \ncurrently attend classes in the DoD school. It is my understanding, \nthat a special exception from the Secretary of Defense was necessary in \norder for these children to continue in the DoD school program for the \nremainder of the school year. DoD has dragged its feet. My amendment \nwill deal with this and similar situations.\n  My staff has tried to work out a deal, But DoD has not been very \nresponsive. I personally wrote the Secretary of Defense to work out a \nsolution. I got a response from a low-level bureaucrat who responded \njust like, well, a bureaucrat. It is my understanding that the only \nanswer from DoD is, ``nothing can be done'', I am told that the only \nsolution is to ``change the legislation''.\n  This amendment is essential in order to address the current problems \nthat I have described for these employees and their families and I look \nforward to working with you to ensure that our efforts to protect our \ncountry from illicit drugs is effective and adequately supported. I \nhope that my colleagues will look at this legislation and join me in \nsupporting this. It is enough of a burden on the families of the \ndedicated men and women who labor to protect our borders without \nfurther weighing them down with senseless red tape.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The amendment has been cleared on this side.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I urge the Senate adopt the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FIVE-YEAR AUTHORITY FOR SECRETARY OF THE NAVY TO \n                   EXCHANGE CERTAIN ITEMS.\n\n       (a) Barter Authority.--The Secretary of the Navy may enter \n     into a barter agreement to exchange trucks and other tactical \n     vehicles for the repair and remanufacture of ribbon bridges \n     for the Marine Corps in accordance with section 201(c) of the \n     Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 \n     U.S.C. 481(c)), except that the requirement for items \n     exchanged under that section to be similar items shall not \n     apply to the authority under this subsection.\n       (b) Period of Authority.--The authority to enter into \n     agreements under subsection (a) and to make exchanges under \n     any such agreement is effective during the 5-year period \n     beginning on October 1, 1998, and ending at the end of \n     September 30, 2003.\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM.

The ribbon bridge is the Marine Corps' only floating \nbridge capability and is used to allow vehicles to cross streams and \ngullies. The ribbon bridge bays used by the Marine Corps are \napproximately 20 years old. Due to limited fiscal resources and higher \npriorities, it is unlikely that the ribbon bridge upgrade will \nsuccessfully compete for funding.\n  It is my understanding that a remanufacture of these existing bridges \nto the Improved Ribbon Bridge configuration will provide an additional \n15-20 years of service from these bridges.

The Secretary of each military \n     department shall administer the pilot program for the armed \n     force or armed forces under the jurisdiction of the \n     Secretary.\n       (b) Eligible Recipients.--(1) Under the pilot program, a \n     person shall be treated as having graduated from high school \n     with a high school diploma for the purpose described in \n     subsection (a) if the person--\n       (A) has completed a general education development program \n     while participating in the National Guard Challenge Program \n     and is a GED recipient; or\n       (B) is a home school diploma recipient and provides a \n     transcript demonstrating completion of high school to the \n     military department involved under the pilot program.\n       (2) For the purposes of this section, a person is a GED \n     recipient if the person, after completing a general education \n     development program, has obtained certification of high \n     school equivalency by meeting State requirements and passing \n     a State approved exam that is administered for the purpose of \n     providing an appraisal of the person's achievement or \n     performance in the broad subject matter areas usually \n     required for high school graduates.\n       (3) For the purposes of this section, a person is a home \n     school diploma recipient if the person has received a diploma \n     for completing a program of education through the high school \n     level at a home school, without regard to whether the home \n     school is treated as a private school under the law of the \n     State in which located.\n       (c) Annual Limit on Number.--Not more than 1,250 GED \n     recipients, and not more than 1,250 home school diploma \n     recipients, enlisted by an armed force in any fiscal year may \n     be treated under the pilot program as having graduated from \n     high school with a high school diploma.\n       (d) Period for Pilot Program.--The pilot program shall be \n     in effect for five fiscal years beginning on October 1, 1998.\n       (e) Report.--(1) Not later than February 1, 2004, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall submit a report on the pilot \n     program to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate and \n     the Committee on National Security of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (2)(A) The report shall include the assessment of the \n     Secretary of Defense, and any assessment of any of the \n     Secretaries of the military departments, regarding the value \n     of, and any necessity for, authority to treat GED recipients \n     and home school diploma recipients as having graduated from \n     high school with a high school diploma for the purpose of \n     determining the eligibility of those persons to enlist in the \n     Armed Forces.\n       (B) The Secretary shall also set forth in the report, by \n     armed force for each fiscal year of the pilot program, a \n     comparison of the performance of the persons who enlisted in \n     that armed force during the fiscal year as GED or home school \n     diploma recipients treated under the pilot program as having \n     graduated from high school with a high school diploma with \n     the performance of the persons who enlisted in that armed \n     force during the same fiscal year after having graduated from \n     high school with a high school diploma, with respect to the \n     following:\n       (i) Attrition.\n       (ii) Discipline.\n       (iii) Adaptability to military life.\n       (iv) Aptitude for mastering the skills necessary for \n     technical specialties.\n       (v) Reenlistment rates.\n       (f) Reference to National Guard Challenge Program.--The \n     National Guard Challenge Program referred to in this section \n     is a program conducted under section 509 of title 32, United \n     States Code.\n       (g) State Defined.--In this section, the term ``State'' has \n     the meaning given that term in section 509(l)(1) of title 32, \n     United States Code.\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to \nS. 2057, the Defense Authorization Bill. The Defense Authorization bill \nas currently written contains a section authorizing a pilot program \npromoting GED recipients to Tier I recruiting status for the Armed \nForces. My amendment would simply add graduates of home schools to this \npilot program.\n  All service branches of the military have limited openings for \nrecruits. As a result, military recruiters utilize a system in which \nthey give preference to applicants who have at least graduated from \nhigh school. These are Tier I applicants. Currently, home schoolers \nhave Tier II status, meaning only when a recruiter cannot find a Tier I \napplicant to fill an opening does a home schooler come up for \nconsideration. This is true despite evidence indicating that the \naverage home schooled student scores in at least the 80th percentile in \nall subjects on standardized tests while the typical public school \nstudent scores around the 50th percentile. This would indicate that \nhome schoolers complete an educational program at least as rigorous as \nthat of the average high school student. Why then should home schoolers \nnot be placed in the same recruiting tier as their high school \ncounterparts?\n  While the Department of Defense has concerns that home schoolers have \nhigher attrition rates than other Tier I candidates, there is not a \nsignificant enough body of evidence to support these claims. Certainly, \nretaining soldiers is a large concern for all services. However, due to \ntheir Tier II status, very few home schoolers have been recruited into \nthe military over the past ten years. Accordingly, no valid statistical \nsample exists demonstrating home schoolers' attrition rates. It is the \nintent of my amendment to establish a valid statistical sample of \nattrition rates for home schoolers upon which the Armed Services can \nmake a more educated assessment of its tier assignments.\n  Mr. President, the Armed Forces in recent years have experienced \nrecruiting problems. While they actively work to address these issues I \nbelieve Congress should also look at possible solutions. My amendment \nis an attempt to do just that. I offer today not only an opportunity \nfor home schoolers, but an opportunity for the military to explore \nfully a new recruiting tool.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I believe the amendment has been cleared by the other \nside.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The amendment has been cleared.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I urge that the Senate adopt this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is adopted.\n  The amendment (No. 2765) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2766\n\n    (Purpose: To state the sense of the Senate regarding oil spill \n        prevention training for personnel on board Navy vessels)\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. On behalf of Senator Gorton, I offer an amendment that \nwould express the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of the Navy \nshould ensure that appropriate Navy personnel assigned to ships are \ntrained in oil spill prevention measures.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Kitty Hawk, one \n     from the U.S.S. Carl Vinson, and one from the U.S.S. \n     Sacramento) and one at Naval Station Everett from the U.S.S. \n     Paul F. Foster.\n       (2) Navy personnel on board vessels, and not shipyard \n     employees, were primarily responsible for a majority of these \n     oil spills at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.\n       (3) Oil spills have the potential to damage the local \n     environment, killing microscopic organisms, contributing to \n     air pollution, harming plants and marine animals, and \n     increasing overall pollution levels in Puget Sound.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that \n     the Secretary of the Navy should take immediate action to \n     significantly reduce the risk of vessel oil spills, including \n     the minimization of fuel oil transfers, the assurance of \n     proper training and qualifications of all Naval personnel in \n     occupations that may contribute to or minimize the risk of \n     shipboard oil spills, and the improvement of liaison with \n     local authorities concerning oil spill prevention and \n     response activities.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Mr. President, this amendment allows for the inclusion of \nbudget authority to continue work on the expeditionary common automatic \nrecovery system (ECARS), which is a launch and recovery system that DoD \nis using for unmanned aerial vehicles. ECARS would be an adaptation of \nthat system to provide a landing system for Marine Corps helicopters in \nplaces where the Marines have not had an opportunity to establish the \nfull air control system.\n  The K-band testing obscuration pairing system (K-TOPS) program would \nprovide a training scoring system to allow the Marines to conduct \nrealistic training in the presence of smoke or other obscurants on a \nsimulated battlefield. Since these programs are for the Marine Corps, \nthe source of budget authority for them is in the communications and \ninfrastructure support program contained in the Procurement, Marine \nCorps (PMC) account.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, today Senator Campbell and I are offering \na technical amendment to the 1999 Defense Authorization Bill which \nwould authorize the transfer of water interests held by the Army at the \nRocky Mountain Arsenal, including rights in Highland Canal and Antero \nReservoir. Before I give the details of the amendment, I want to thank \nChairman Thurmond and Senator Levin for accepting this amendment and \nfor all the hard work by the Armed Service staff, who without their \nactive engagement in this process, this important amendment would never \nhave been possible.\n  As the clean-up at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal has progressed, quite \nwell I might add, there has always been a great need for water. \nHowever, as with much of the West, water is a commodity and a way to \nprovide water has been an area of discussion between all the parties \nsince the clean-up began. Unfortunately, the United States' acre rights \nto water in the High Line Canal have proved inadequate to supply the \nArmy's needs for non-potable water at the Arsenal.\n  In a June 11, 1996 Record of Decision, the Army, Shell, and South \nAdams County Water and Sanitation District (SACWSD) entered into a \nMemorandum of Understanding by which the Army and Shell agreed to \nacquire and deliver 4000 acre-feet of water to SACWSD.\n  However, after a lengthy investigation, it was determined that the \nonly realistic source of potable water for SACWSD was by arranging a \npermanent contract with the Denver Water Board. Also, it was determined \nthat the only way to be certain that the Refuge received a long term \nsupply of 1200 acre-feet of non-potable water was to obtain the same \nfrom the Denver Water Board's non-potable reuse facility pursuant to a \nperpetual contract.\n  During these discussions, the Denver Water Board desired to acquire \nall of the Army's interest in the irrigation canal and reservoir \ncompany in order to reduce the cost of operating those facilities and \nconsolidate its ownership to the rights of the rights to receive water \nfrom those facilities. On December 19, 1997, the Army, the Fish & \nWildlife Service, SACWSD, and the Denver Water Board entered into a \nMemorandum of Understanding (MOU). The purpose of the MOU was to \naccomplish the goals of each of the parties as follows:\n  a. Denver will provide SACWSD with 4000 acre-feet of potable water in \nfulfillment of the Army's responsibility under the June 11, 1996 MOU.\n  b. SACWSD will provide Denver with certain storage facilities and \ncash to compensate Denver for the potable water supply.\n  c. Denver will provide the Army and the Fish & Wildlife Service with \nshort and long term water supplies. The short term supplies will be \n2800 acre-feet, and the permanent supply will be 1200 acre-feet of non-\npotable reuse water per year as a guaranteed supply. In addition, \nDenver will supply 50 acre-feet of annual potable water supply.\n  d. The Army will transfer to Denver its interests in the canal and \nreservoir companies which currently serve as the source of the Arsenal \nwater supply.\n  The result of these understandings fulfills the federal government's \nresponsibility under the Record of Decision to insure a permanent and a \nfirm supply of water for the ultimate needs of the Refuge and the \nfederal government's responsibility to provide a potable supply of \nSACWSD.\n  Because of the nature of the legal status of the Army's interest in \nthe canal and reservoir companies and the nature of the interests to be \nreceived by the federal government from Denver as a permanent supply, \nthere was uncertainty whether federal legislation would be required. It \nwas determined federal legislation is required to avoid the problems \nassociated with the disposal of government property, pursuant to the \nFederal Property and Administrative Services Act.\n  However, the property being disposed of is not excess property and, \ntherefore, not readily disposed of under normal procedures. The water \nsupply being received in exchange is a perpetual contract supply and \nnot a real property interest, precluding a like kind exchange. This \nexchange is for utility contracts or lease agreements that will replace \nacre rights to water as the mechanisms for the delivery of nonpotable \nwater to the Arsenal and Fitzsimons. My understanding is that this has \nbeen confirmed by GSA, which is the main decisionmaker on excess \nproperty.\n  All of the federal agencies and involved divisions of local and State \ngovernments are supportive of federal legislation and the agreements \nthat it will implement, including Fitzsimons. It must be underscored \nthat this amendment recognizes that the legal status of these rights \nare not being changed, nor are the rights being disposed of, rather the \nrights are being exchanged for permanent water contracts from Denver. \nThere will be no change in the amount of flow through the South Platte \nand that Colorado water law will fully apply to this situation.\n  While this amendment may seem technical and minor on the surface, \nthis transfer of water interests is an important part of the overall \nsolution in the clean-up of the Arsenal.\n  Again, I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for accepting this \nimportant amendment and I thank their staff in working with my staff to \nmake this happen.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I believe the amendment has been cleared \nby the other side.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The amendment has been cleared.\n  Mr. THURMOND.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Grams and D'Amato, \nI offer an amendment which would reauthorize the Defense Production Act \nof 1950 for a period of 1 year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

EXTENSION AND REAUTHORIZATION OF DEFENSE \n                   PRODUCTION ACT OF 1950.\n\n       (a) Extension of Termination Date.--Section 717(a) of the \n     Defense Production Act of 1950 (50 U.S.C.

App. 2161(b)) is \n     amended by striking ``and 1998'' and inserting ``1998, and \n     1999''.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, this amendment will extend the \nauthorization of the authorities under the Defense Production Act for \none year through September 30, 1999.\n  This matter is under the jurisdiction of the Senate Banking \nCommittee, on which I serve as the Subcommittee on International \nFinance Chairman which handles this issue. Chairman D'Amato and Ranking \nMember Sarbanes of the Banking Committee, as well as Ranking Member of \nthe International Finance Subcommittee, Senator Moseley-Braun, all have \nagreed to support this one-year extension as an amendment to the \nDefense Authorization bill to facilitate this matter in a year when \nfloor time is becoming scarce.\n  The Defense Production Act (DPA) is the primary authority for \nexecutive branch activities to ensure the timely availability of \nresources for national defense and civil emergency preparedness and \nresponse. It was first enacted in 1950 to mobilize the nation's \nproductive capacity during the Korean War and ensures the availability \nof critical materials needed both for national defense and for \ncatastrophic civil disasters. It allows criminal sanctions to prevent \nhoarding of critical materials. The DPA also authorizes the President \nto use financial incentives to encourage contractors to establish or \nexpand industrial capacity for defense needs.\n  The ``Exon-Florio'' language which authorizes the President to \nprohibit foreign investment if such investment threatens national \nsecurity is also included in this Act.\n  While DPA's primary function is to ensure resources are available in \ntimes of war, the DPA, as administered through the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency (FEMA) also provides\n\n[[Page S6688]]\n\nassistance during natural disasters. For instance, FEMA used the DPA to \nprocure resources needed during the 1997 flood disaster in my own State \nof Minnesota.\n  The Administration had requested some minor changes in the DPA. \nHowever, because committee and floor time is scarce this year, they \nagreed to a one-year extension. It is the goal of the Banking Committee \nto consider these changes, and a longer term reauthorization, next \nyear.\n  Mr. President, I thank the floor leaders for agreeing to facilitate \nthis amendment as part of the DOD bill.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I believe this amendment has been \ncleared by the other side.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the amendment has been cleared.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I urge that the Senate adopt this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2773) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, I offer an Armed Services Committee \namendment that would express the sense of Congress that future year \nfunding for operations in Bosnia be included above the topline in the \ndefense budget and that U.S. forces in Bosnia should not act as civil \npolice. In addition, our amendment would require the President to \nsubmit a report to Congress on the status of the establishment of the \nMultinational Support Unit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Thurmond] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2774.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1064. BUDGETING FOR CONTINUED PARTICIPATION OF UNITED \n                   STATES FORCES IN NATO OPERATIONS IN BOSNIA AND \n                   HERZEGOVINA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Funding levels in the Department of Defense budget have \n     not been sufficient to pay for the deployment of United \n     States ground combat forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina that \n     began in fiscal year 1996.\n       (2) The Department of Defense has used funds from the \n     operation and maintenance accounts of the Armed Forces to pay \n     for the operations because the funding levels included in the \n     defense budgets for fiscal years 1996 and 1997 have not been \n     adequate to maintain operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n       (3) Funds necessary to continue United States participation \n     in the NATO operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to \n     replace operation and maintenance funds used for the \n     operations, have been requested by the President as \n     supplemental appropriations in fiscal years 1996 and 1997. \n     The Department of Defense has also proposed to reprogram \n     previously appropriated funds to make up the shortfall for \n     continued United States operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n       (4) In February 1998, the President certified to Congress \n     that the continued presence of United States forces in Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina after June 30, 1998, was necessary in order \n     to meet national security interests of the United States.\n       (5) The discretionary spending limit established for the \n     defense category for fiscal year 1998 in the Balanced Budget \n     and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 does not take into \n     account the continued deployment of United States forces in \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina after June 30, 1998. Therefore, the \n     President requested emergency supplemental appropriations for \n     the Bosnia and Herzegovina mission through September 30, \n     1998.\n       (6) Amounts for operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina were \n     not included in the original budget proposed by the President \n     for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 1999.\n       (7) The President requested $1,858,600,000 in emergency \n     appropriations in his March 4, 1998 amendment to the fiscal \n     year 1999 budget to cover the shortfall in funding in the \n     fiscal year 1999 for the costs of extending the mission in \n     Bosnia.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the President should include in the budget for the \n     Department of Defense that the President submits to Congress \n     under section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, for \n     each fiscal year sufficient amounts to pay for any proposed \n     continuation of the participation of United States forces in \n     NATO operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina for that fiscal \n     year; and\n       (2) amounts included in the budget for that purpose should \n     not be transferred from amounts that would otherwise be \n     proposed in the budget of any of the Armed Forces in \n     accordance with the future-years defense program related to \n     that budget, or any other agency of the Executive Branch, \n     but, instead, should be an overall increase in the budget for \n     the Department of Defense.\n\n     SEC. 1065. NATO PARTICIPATION IN THE PERFORMANCE OF PUBLIC \n                   SECURITY FUNCTIONS OF CIVILIAN AUTHORITIES IN \n                   BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has \n     approved the creation of a multi-national specialized unit of \n     gendarmes- or para-military police composed of European \n     security forces to help promote public security in Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina as a part of the post-June 1998 mission for the \n     Stabilization Force (SFOR) authorized under the United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 1088 (December 12, 1996).\n       (2) On at least four occasions, beginning in July 1997, the \n     Stabilization Force (SFOR) has been involved, pursuant to \n     military annex 1(A) of the Dayton Agreement, in carrying out \n     missions for the specific purpose of detaining war criminals, \n     and on at least one of those occasions United States forces \n     were directly involved in carrying out the mission.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     United States forces should not serve as civil police in \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n       (c) Requirement for Report.--The President shall submit to \n     Congress, not later than October 1, 1998, a report on the \n     status of the NATO force of gendarmes or paramilitary police \n     referred to in subsection (a)(1), including the mission of \n     the force, the composition of the force, and the extent, if \n     any, to which members of the Armed Forces of the United \n     States are participating (or are to participate) in the \n     force.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, my amendment would address three items, \nfunds in the future years defense program for operations in Bosnia, \nconcern about the use of U.S. forces in a law enforcement capacity, and \nthe status of establishing the NATO multinational security force.\n  Funding for military forces participating in the NATO operation in \nBosnia is the responsibility of the contributing nation. It is \nestimated that the U.S. costs of participating in the NATO operation \nwill be close to $10 billion by the end of fiscal year 1999.\n  The Administration has failed to provide adequate funds in the \ndefense budget to fund U.S. participation in the NATO operation since \nNovember 1995, consequently reprogramming and rescissions of defense \nfunds, as well as supplemental appropriations have been used to pay for \nthose costs.\n  In March, pursuant to legislation in the fiscal year 1998 defense \nauthorization and appropriations bills, the President notified the \nCongress of his intention to extend the deployment of U.S. forces in \nBosnia beyond June 30, 1998, and certified that it was in the national \nsecurity interests for U.S. forces to remain in Bosnia so that \nconditions could be established to allow the implementation of the \nDayton Accords without the support of a major NATO-led military force.\n  The President's announcement to extend the deployment of U.S. forces \nin Bosnia after June 30, 1998 once again resulted in a funding \nshortfall for operations in Bosnia for fiscal year 1998, as well as for \nfiscal year 1999. To take care of the shortfalls in fiscal year 1998, \nthe Congress provided an emergency appropriation.\n  Once again, because they were unaware that the President would extend \nthe participation of U.S. forces in the NATO operation in Bosnia, the \nDepartment of Defense and the military services did not include funds \nin the President's fiscal year 1999 budget request for defense. Thereby \ncreating once again, a funding shortfall for operations in Bosnia in \nfiscal year 1999. To cover those costs anticipated in fiscal year 1999, \nbut not provided for in the defense budget, the Committee has \nrecommended an emergency authorization of $1.9 billion for operations \nin Bosnia in fiscal year 1999.\n  Mr. President, U.S. forces will be in Bosnia for at least another \nyear or two, if not longer, unless the Congress mandates their \nwithdrawal. It is time for the President to include the funds necessary \nto pay for the operations in Bosnia in the fiscal year 2000 and future \nyear budgets for defense above the top line in the balanced budget \nagreement. If the defense budget is not increased\n\n[[Page S6689]]\n\nto pay for the costs associated with this operation in Bosnia, the \nCongress will once again be faced with reprogramming defense funds, or \nproviding emergency appropriations.\n  If the Congress has to reprogram defense funds, or rescind defense \nprograms, the military services will most likely have to transfer \nprocurement and research and development dollars meant for \nmodernization and replacement of equipment before it becomes obsolete \nand unsupportable.\n  Transferring funds from the military service budgets for operations \nin Bosnia will result in reducing training opportunities, delaying real \nproperty maintenance, deferring depot maintenance, or reducing base \noperations and quality of life. We need to protect the readiness of our \nforces. Failure of the Administration to increase funding in future \ndefense budgets to pay for operations in Bosnia would cause disruptions \nand in funding inefficiencies in our acquisition programs.\n  My amendment would express the sense of Congress that the President \nshould include funds for operations in Bosnia in the future years \ndefense funds, and that those funds should not come from amounts that \nwould otherwise be proposed for defense or the military services in \naccordance with the future years defense plan, but should be provided \nabove the top line in the balanced budget agreement.\n  My amendment would also express the concerns of Congress, as it did \nsimilarly in the fiscal year 1998 defense authorization and \nappropriation bills, that U.S. forces should not participate in law \nenforcement activities as civil police.\n  The International Police Task Force was formed by the United Nations \nin response to a requirement in the Dayton Accords. In addition to \ntraining and advising local law enforcement authorities and personnel, \nthe responsibility of this international police task force is to \nmonitor, observe and facilitate law enforcement activities. The \ninternational police force also has no authority to arrest or detain \npeople, to include indicted war criminals. Because the international \npolice force is not armed, on many occasions NATO military forces have \naccompanied members of the IPTF to provide protection in the event \nthere is a breakdown in law and order. NATO forces have not intervened \nduring incidents of violence involving unarmed civilians. However, NATO \ntroops have taken action against paramilitary or ``special police'' \nunits, such as the kind that guard indicted war criminals like Mr. \nKaradicz.\n  Earlier this year, the Congress was informed by the Secretary of \nDefense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that NATO would \nbe establishing an 800-man paramilitary police force to respond to \ncivil disturbances, such as the ones I just mentioned.\n  Lastly, with regard with NATO's establishment of a Multinational \nSpecialized Unit to respond to civil disturbances, my amendment would \nrequire the President to report on the status of NATO establishing the \nMSU, the mission of the MSU, its composition, and the extent to which \nU.S. military forces will participate in the MSU, if any role.\n  Mr. President, I believe the amendment has been cleared by the other \nside.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the amendment has been cleared.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I urge that the Senate adopt this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2774) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2775\n\n (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Defense to submit to Congress a \nreport on the objectives of a contingency operation when the President \n    submits to Congress the first request for funding the operation)\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, on behalf of Senators Snowe and Cleland, \nI offer an amendment which has been approved by the Armed Services \nCommittee and that would require the Secretary of Defense to submit to \nCongress a report on the objectives of any contingency operation \ninvolving the deployment of 500 or more U.S. military forces when the \nPresident requests funds for those operations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

and\n       (C) the complex web of policies and regulatory constraints \n     that restrict authority of managers to operate the \n     laboratories and centers in a businesslike fashion.\n       (3) Congress has provided tools to deal with the changing \n     nature of technological development in the defense sector by \n     encouraging closer cooperation with industry and university \n     research and by authorizing demonstrations of alternative \n     personnel systems.\n       (4) A number of laboratories and test and evaluation \n     centers have addressed the challenges and are employing a \n     variety of innovative methods, such as the so-called \n     ``Federated Lab Concept'' undertaken at the Army Research \n     Laboratory, to maintain the high quality of the technical \n     program, to provide a challenging work environment for \n     researchers, and to meet the high cost demands of maintaining \n     facilities that are equal or superior in quality to \n     comparable facilities anywhere in the world.\n       (b) Commendation.--Congress commends the Secretary of \n     Defense for the progress made by the science and technology \n     laboratories and test and evaluation centers to achieve the \n     results described in subsection (a)(4) and encourages the \n     Secretary to take the actions necessary to ensure continued \n     progress for the laboratories and test and evaluation centers \n     in developing cooperative relationships with universities and \n     other private sector entities for the performance of research \n     and development functions.\n       (c) Pilot Program.--(1) In conjunction with the plan for \n     restructuring and revitalizing the science and technology \n     laboratories and test and evaluation centers of the \n     Department of Defense that is required by section 906 of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Defense may carry out a pilot program \n     to demonstrate improved cooperative relationships with \n     universities and other private sector entities for the \n     performance of research and development functions.\n       (2) Under the pilot program, the Secretary of Defense shall \n     provide the director of one science and technology \n     laboratory, and the director of one test and evaluation \n     center, of each military department with authority for the \n     following:\n       (A) To explore innovative methods for quickly, efficiently, \n     and fairly entering into cooperative relationships with \n     universities and other private sector entities with respect \n     to the performance of research and development functions.\n       (B) To waive any restrictions on the demonstration and \n     implementation of such methods that are not required by law.\n       (C) To develop or expand innovative methods of operation \n     that provide more defense research for each dollar of cost, \n     including to carry out such initiatives as focusing on the \n     performance of core functions and adopting more business-like \n     practices.\n       (3) In selecting the laboratories and centers for \n     participation in the pilot program, the Secretary shall \n     consider laboratories and centers where innovative management \n     techniques have been demonstrated, particularly as documented \n     under sections 1115 through 1119 of title 31, United States \n     Code, relating to Government agency performance and results.\n       (4) The Secretary may carry out the pilot program at each \n     selected laboratory and center for a period of three years \n     beginning not later than March 1, 1999.\n       (d) Reports.--(1) Not later than March 1, 1999, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall submit a report on the \n     implementation of the pilot program to Congress. The report \n     shall include the following:\n       (A) Each laboratory and center selected for the pilot \n     program.\n       (B) To the extent possible, a description of the innovative \n     concepts that are to be tested at each laboratory or center.\n       (C) The criteria to be used for measuring the success of \n     each concept to be tested.\n       (2) Promptly after the expiration of the period for \n     participation of a laboratory or center in the pilot program, \n     the Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a final \n     report on the participation of the laboratory or center in \n     the pilot program. The report shall contain the following:\n       (A) A description of the concepts tested.\n       (B) The results of the testing.\n       (C) The lessons learned.\n       (D) Any proposal for legislation that the Secretary \n     recommends on the basis of the experience at the laboratory \n     or center under the pilot program.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an amendment on \nbehalf of myself, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Coverdell, and Mr. Faircloth.\n  This vital measure would enhance the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Program (FEHBP) demonstration provisions currently included in \nthe Department of Defense Authorization bill to evaluate the \nfeasibility of using this effective program to ensure the availability \nof adequate health care for Medicare-eligible retirees under the \nmilitary health care system.\n  Specifically, this amendment increases the number of FEHBP sites from \ntwo to four and accelerates the implementation of the program from \nJanuary of 2000 to July of 1999.\n  Mr. President, our nation's military retirees are facing a grave \nhealth care crisis. Current trends, such as base closures, the \ndownsizing of military treatment facilities, and the introduction of \nTRICARE, have all hindered access to health care services for military \nretirees aged 65 and over. In theory, Medicare-eligible retirees can \nreceive health care services at military treatment facilities on a \nspace available basis; however, active duty and their dependents have \npriority.\n  Therefore, in reality, space is rarely available--resulting in \nmilitary retirees being ``locked out'' of the Department of Defense's \n(DoD) health care delivery system. And because of their considered \n``secondary status'', many retirees are forced to travel great \ndistances to receive even the minimum of care.\n  Further, when compared to what other Federal and private sector \nretirees receive in terms of health care options, it is clear that the \ncurrent health care choices for military retirees are woefully \ninadequate and downright inexcusable.\n  This is outrageous. The bottom line is military retirees aged 65 and \nolder do not have time to wait for health care solutions, especially \nwhen our nation is losing 30,000 world War II veterans each month. It \nis high time that the federal government lives up to its promise of \nproviding health care to those who honorably served our country.\n  Although this amendment is not everything I wanted, it is a step in \nthe right direction. I am pleased that the Armed Services Committee was \nable to address this problem, but I remain concerned that the DoD \nAuthorization bill caps total funding for all the various demonstration \nprojects at $60 million a year, of which only a portion would be \navailable for the FEHBP demonstration.\n  Mr. President, I understand the budgetary constraints that the \nCommittee faces; however, this does not excuse us from our moral \nobligation to provide those military retirees who faithfully and \nselflessly served our country in times of war and in times of peace the \nhealth care they deserve. Our country must live up to the promise of \nproviding military retirees more dependable, consistent, and affordable \ncare while simultaneously applying equitable standards of health care \nfor all federal retirees.\n  Make no doubt about it--this battle has just begun. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues in conference in securing increased funding \nand sites for this purpose--as represented in the House's DoD \nAuthorization bill. And again, I thank the distinguished Chairmen, \nSenator Thurmond, and Senator Kempthorne, for their efforts.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I believe this amendment has been cleared by the other \nside.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The amendment has been cleared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2779) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. THURMOND.

I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have brief remarks in concluding today, \na very productive day on the defense authorization bill.\n  I wish to personally thank the distinguished chairman, Mr. Thurmond, \nand the ranking member, for covering a number of amendments today, \nincluding those of the Senator from Virginia while I was momentarily \noff the floor. Chairman Thurmond will bring the bill back up again on \nMonday. It will be the business.\n  I will have further extensive remarks on Monday as regards the \ncomplex issue of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The American commitments there \nin connection with our NATO allies are very important commitments, and \ncertain observations relative to Kosovo.\n  Given the cloture motion, I am not sure whether our bill will have \nopened the opportunity for amendments on these issues. It is a subject \nthat has been carefully considered by the Armed Services Committee in \nfour meetings. We feel very strongly that there is an obligation in the \nCongress, which no one has spoken to with greater clarity and greater \nsincerity than the senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd. He did \nso at a hearing of the Armed Services Committee on June 4 of this year. \nSenator Byrd and Senator Hutchison of Texas have worked very hard and \ndiligently on this subject. But I am not sure as to what will evolve in \nthe days to come on this bill.\n  I wish to make several observations about this subject. I, too, have \nthought about introducing an amendment on this subject. But these are \nthe concerns that I have.\n  None of us could perceive with specificity what has happened in \nKosovo, what is happening today, and what could happen in the future. \nThat is a key that is directly linked to the continuing policies of the \nUnited States, together with our allies in Bosnia.\n  Great progress has been made in Bosnia towards the Dayton accords. I \nwas not in favor at any time and voted against the introduction of U.S. \nground forces. Nevertheless, that decision was made and endorsed by the \nCongress of the United States. They have performed absolutely \ncourageously, and have contributed to a measure of peace and stability \nthat exists in Bosnia today. They have worked remarkably well with our \nallies. There are some 13 various allies which have contributed to this \nNATO-led force to bring about the current stability. I will speak \nfurther on Monday as to the details.\n  But I want to comment on a couple of factors that I hope Senators \nwill take into consideration should they want to go into further \ndiscussions of this area.\n  First, there will be very important elections held in the political \nstructure of Bosnia in September. Hopefully, the outcome of those \nelections, in terms of the candidates that succeed, will further move \nefforts towards achieving the Dayton accords. We cannot anticipate here \nin June what that situation will be, nor can we anticipate with any \nspecificity the problems in Kosovo. Hopefully, the initiatives, indeed, \nby President Yeltsin, by President Clinton, and by many others in the \nUnited Kingdom and France will address that situation so that we will \nnot witness further tragic displacement of people from their homes, \ncommunities, and to\n\n[[Page S6693]]\n\nworsen the flow of refugees from that region. We simply cannot stand by \nand watch that persecution.\n  I remember so well. We always talked in terms of Bosnia, that we have \nto contain that so it will not spill over into the Kosovo region. Now \njust the reverse has taken place. It is Kosovo which threatens to spill \nover, dislodge, and disrupt some of the achievements that have occurred \nso far in Bosnia.\n  So the elections are important. The unfolding developments in \nKosovo--we cannot predict today what they will be a month from now, or \n6 months from now.\n  Further, there will be a new Congress elected by the people of our \ncountry in November. They will take their seats, such Members as new \nMembers who come and those who will depart. We will have a new \nCongress.\n  It seems to me that the new Congress is entitled to take a fresh look \nat this situation.\n  We also must take into consideration that we are working today with \nour allies on a variety of contingencies as they relate to Kosovo, and \nany legislation which is directed to the future of our commitment in \nBosnia; that is, the extent the ground forces remain in place, the \nextent perhaps of their withdrawal and the force levels and the like, \nsends signals to people, particularly President Milosevic, who, indeed, \nis the prime perpetrator of the problems in that region, in my \njudgment, and we have to be very careful, because on the one hand if we \naddress the future of U.S. commitments in Bosnia and at the same time \nwe are trying to work out contingency plans with our allies, those two \nactions, in my judgment, have to go hand in hand.\n  So it is terribly important that those addressing this issue take \ninto consideration again the transitory nature of the Kosovo problem, \nthe elections that are coming up, and the fact there will be a new \nCongress, and therefore any action that we take should not be taken--\nand I am hesitant to think we should take any action now--with regard \nto dictating in many respects to the Commander in Chief what is to be \ndone in that region beginning, say, next spring. I think we have to be \nvery careful to recognize the constitutional responsibilities of \nPresident Clinton in this area, and we should do nothing to abridge \nthose constitutional responsibilities.\n  So having said that, I will address this subject further on Monday, \nbut I just wanted to lay down in today's Record some of my concerns \nabout this very important issue. It is driven in large measure by the \nfact that the Armed Forces of the United States today have expended \nsome $9.4 billion for the Bosnia action to date and through fiscal year \n1998, and those dollars could, in my judgment, have been spent very \nwisely for modernization, for research and development, and for \nreadiness. Those three areas are of prime concern as regards our \nmilitary today, and they are very, very serious concerns. We will \naddress those areas further as we consider the authorization bill. But \nit is an expensive commitment there in terms of dollars and U.S. \ntroops, and it seems to me that we have to continually work with our \nallies so that those allies, particularly the European allies, take a \ngreater percentage of this burden in the months to come.\n  It is clear that we cannot hope to achieve the Dayton accords in a \nperiod of time, perhaps within a year or so. General Clarke, when he \nappeared before our committee, could not in any way--and we understand \nthis--specify his estimate of time within which those accords of Dayton \ncould be achieved. But nevertheless, it is the allied forces under the \nNATO in place today that have enabled the progress to date that we are \nall very fortunate to witness.\n  Now, Mr. President, I will return now to the closing business of \ntoday's session of the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/19/senate-section/article/S6662-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, the Senate Judiciary Committee heard \ntestimony on Tuesday from Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan \nand the Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust, Joel Klein. The \nhearing was called to discuss the economic impacts of the recent wave \nof mergers and acquisitions and the role of federal antitrust enforcers \nin today's economy.\n  While the subject matter was narrow, nothing less than the future of \nthe American economy is at stake in the debate between those in this \nnation who believe in the power and efficiency of the free market and \nthose who advocate government control of the market.\n  Both sides in the debate, and both witnesses at the hearing, claim to \nbe working toward the same goals: consumer protection, competition, and \neconomic expansion. But the contrast in the means each side advocates \nto achieve those ends is astonishing.\n  Alan Greenspan, arguably one of the most powerful men in the world, \nurged ``humility'' on the part of government antitrust enforcers, while \nJoel Klein pushed for more government intervention and more taxpayer \nmoney for his division at the Department of Justice.\n  Once again Mr. President, I find the attitude of the Clinton/Gore \nAdministration's Justice Department disturbing. It is quite apparent to \nthis Senator that Joel Klein and his staff are anti-business, anti-\nsuccess, and anti-economic growth.\n  Mr. Klein pled for more, not less, government control of the economy. \nIn fact, in his testimony Mr. Klein said, ``we reject categorically the \nnotion that markets will self-correct and we should sit back and \nwatch.'' Instead, Mr. Klein believes the government should control \nevery move of America's most successful and innovative companies in the \nname of competition and consumer protection. His statement strikes me \nas an endorsement of the very kind of socialist-style command and \ncontrol economics embraced by the Soviet Union that led to its \ncollapse, not the free market principles on which the United States \neconomy is based.\n  Mr. Greenspan, on the other hand, a long-time champion of the free \nmarket, made the case that the Justice Department and the Federal Trade \nCommission have been overstepping their bounds recently in predicting \nhow mergers will affect the economy of the future, and in prohibiting \nmergers on the basis of predictions about that economic future. He \nsaid, ``I would like to see far more firm roots to our judgments as to \nwhether particular market positions do, in fact, undercut competition \nor are only presumed on the basis of some generalized judgment of how \neconomic forces are going to evolve.'' Chairman Greenspan went on to \npoint out that, ``history is strewn with people making projections \nwhich have turned out to be grossly inaccurate.''\n  The Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, despite his power to do \notherwise, represents and advocates the same common sense approach to \ncompetition and consumer welfare as that advocated by our founding \nfathers. His vision is one in which the government rarely intervenes in \nthe free market that, left alone, can provide more benefits and broader \neconomic wealth for consumers than the smartest government planners and \npoliticians. His vision is one in which American entrepreneurs invent \namazing new products and compete openly with one another in a free, but \nrelentless marketplace, to meet the constantly changing demands of \nconsumers.\n  It is Mr. Greenspan's vision that has contributed to the greatest \neconomic growth in this nation's history; that of the Justice \nDepartment would undermine it.\n  In contrast to those of Mr. Greenspan's, Mr. Klein's comments reveal \nan elitist, government-knows-best approach to economics. Under the \nguise of consumer protection, Mr. Klein advocates government control of \nthe marketplace in order to prop up businesses that cannot compete \nsuccessfully on their own.\n  I, for one, Mr. President, believe Mr. Greenspan's approach to be \ncorrect and to be the one that has and will serve the American \nconsumers and the American economy best.\n\n[[Page S6694]]\n\n  As Mr. Greenspan so eloquently put it, ``Through skill, perseverance, \nluck, or political connections, competitors have always pressed for \nmarket dominance. It is free, open markets that act to thwart \nachievement of such dominance, and in the process direct the \ncompetitive drive, which seeks economic survival, towards the \nimprovement of products, greater productivity, and the amassing and \ndistribution of wealth. Adam Smith's invisible hand does apparently \nwork.''\n  Let us look, for example, at the Justice Department's case against \nMicrosoft--the most successful and innovative company in the U.S. \nsoftware industry. In this case, the Justice Department argues that \nMicrosoft does not allow computer manufacturers to customize the \ndesktop. Mr. Klein's solution to this problem is for the government to \nforce Microsoft to allow competing desktops to be displayed on \nMicrosoft's own operating system software.\n  But only a few weeks after Mr. Klein filed suit against Microsoft on \nthis front, the free market has produced its own solution. A small, \nstart-up software company in Seattle called Pixel has begun marketing a \nproduct that makes use of the sliver of black screen space surrounding \nMicrosoft's Windows display on the desktop. Using this empty space, \nPixel's software will allow computer manufacturers to display their own \ncontrol bar. The control bar gives users direct access to web sites \nchosen by the computer manufacturer.\n  In the next few weeks, Packard Bell and NEC will start shipping \ncomputers with Pixel's new control bar on the opening screen.\n  Compaq Computer has come up with its own alternative. The company \nannounced last week that it will provide a special keyboard with a new \nrange of personal computers that incorporate function keys for instant \naccess to e-mail, news, weather, shopping, and other features.\n  Like the Pixel software, this new keyboard enables Compaq to partner \ndirectly with Internet publishers and access providers, effectively \nbypassing Windows.\n  These innovations make it clear that the free market works much \nfaster and much more effectively than government intervention. It is a \nlesson that the Administration and Assistant Attorney General Klein \nshould take to heart.\n  Mr. Klein's counterpart at the Federal Trade Commission, Robert \nPitofsky, recently filed a similar case against Intel, another highly \nsuccessful high tech company that has come under fire for its very \nsuccess.\n  The FTC has charged that Intel, in attempting to protect its own \nintellectual property, is engaging in anti-competitive business \npractices. This suit comes at the very time that Intel is facing the \ntoughest competition in the microprocessor market that it has faced in \nits history as a company. The FTC is as perverse as is the Department \nof Justice.\n  Mr. Greenspan's testimony is a breath of fresh air in an increasingly \nstifling era of big government intervention in the free market. I urge \nmy colleagues in the United States Senate to heed Mr. Greenspan's words \nand to join me in my efforts to bring reason back into the debate over \nantitrust policy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/19/senate-section/article/S6693-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6694-S6696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        SENATOR LOTT'S PROPOSED HEALTH UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I hope very much that in the coming days, \nwe will be able to begin debate in the full Senate on another major \nissue of vital importance to the country--the reforms needed in our \nhealth care system to end the abuses by HMOs and health insurance \ncompanies. Critical decisions on health care should be made by doctors \nand their patients, not by insurance industry accountants. It is long \npast time for Congress to act to protect patients and end these abuses. \nWe face a growing crisis of confidence in health care.\n  A recent survey found that an astonishing 80 percent of Americans now \nbelieve that their quality of care is often compromised by their \ninsurance plan to save money. And, too often, they are absolutely \nright.\n  One reason for this concern is the explosive growth in managed care. \nIn 1987, only 13 percent of privately insured Americans were enrolled \nin HMOs. Today 75 percent are in some form of managed care.\n  This issue goes to the heart of health care and the fundamental \ndoctor-patient relationship. At its best, managed care offers the \nopportunity to achieve greater efficiency and greater quality in health \ncare.\n  In too many cases, however, the priority has become greater profits, \nnot greater health. HMOs and conventional insurance companies alike \nhave abused the system by denying coverage for treatments that their \ncustomers need and that their premiums should have guaranteed.\n  In California, a Kaiser Foundation study found that almost half of \nall patients reported a problem with their health plan. Substantial \nnumbers reported that the plan's actions caused unnecessary pain and \nsuffering, delayed recovery, or even resulted in permanent \ndisabilities.\n  Projected to the national level, these results indicate that 30 \nmillion Americans develop additional health problems because of their \nplan's abusive practices--and a shocking 11 million develop permanent \ndisabilities.\n  The dishonor roll of those victimized by insurance company abuse \ngrows every day. A baby loses his hands and feet because his parents \nbelieve they have to take him to a distant emergency room rather than \nthe one close to their home.\n  A Senate aide suffers a devastating stoke, which might have been far \nmilder if her HMO had not refused to send her to an emergency room. The \nHMO now even refuses to pay for her wheelchair.\n  A woman is forced to undergo a mastectomy as an outpatient, against \nher doctor's recommendation. She is sent home in pain, with tubes still \ndangling from her body.\n  A doctor is denied future referrals under a managed car plan, because \nhe told a patient about an expensive treatment that could save her \nlife.\n  The parents of a child suffering from a rare cancer are told that \nlife-saving surgery should be performed by an unqualified doctor who \nhappens to be on the plan's list, rather than by a specialist at the \nnearby cancer center equipped to perform the operation.\n  A San Diego paraplegic asks for referral to a rehabilitation \nspecialist. Her HMO refuses, and she develops a severe pressure wound \nthat a rehabilitation specialist would have routinely checked and \ntreated. She is forced to undergo surgery, and is hospitalized for a \nyear with round-the-clock nursing care.\n  A child suffers a severe shoulder dislocation in a gym class. Frantic \nschool officials make repeated calls to her HMO for authorization to \ncall an ambulance. The accident has cut off the flow of blood to her \narm. Fortunately, a mother who was also an emergency room physician was \nthere and was able to give immediate treatment. Otherwise, the child \nmight have lost her arm.\n  The list of these abuses goes on and on.\n  Many of us in Congress have offered legislation to end these abuses.\n  Our proposal is a common sense program that guarantees the American \npeople the fundamental protections that every good insurance company \nalready provides, and that every American who pays insurance premiums \ndeserves to have when serious illness strikes.\n  But the Republican Leadership's position on these protections is to \nprotect the insurance industry instead of protecting patients. They \nknow that they can't do that in the light of day before the American \npeople. So their strategy has been to work behind closed doors to kill \nthe bill. Keep it bottled up in committee. No markup. No floor vote. \nDelay, deny, and obfuscate--and hope the clock runs out.\n  And while the Republican Leadership keeps the bill bottled up, they \ncall on the insurance companies and their right-wing allies to use \ntheir vast resources to manipulate public opinion. The National Journal \nreported in November that ``a coalition of business groups, \ncorporations, and health care associations is planning a $1 million-\nplus public relations and grass roots blitz to derail new legislation \ncalling for increased regulation of health\n\n[[Page S6695]]\n\nplans.'' Just a few weeks ago, it was reported that the special \ninterest opponents have now spent more than $3 million to defeat our \ncommon sense proposals.\n  According to the Washington Post of November 5 last year, ``Three \nyears after they killed President Clinton's massive health plan, \nRepublican leaders in Congress have embarked on a crusade to block a \nnew generation of federal efforts aimed at regulating the quality of \nmedical care Americans receive.''\n  The article goes on to report that members of the antireform \ncoalition were invited to what was billed as the first in a Series of \nBriefings for Republican Staff Members. ``Clinton Care Returns: The \nTrojan Horse Strategy.'' That is what the invitation said to the \nbriefing, sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and Senate \nMajority Whip Don Nickles--``Clinton Care Returns: The Trojan Horse \nStrategy.''\n  It is obvious that the Senate Republican leadership is no friend of \nhealth reform.\n  According to a memo from one of the participants in the briefing, \n``The message we are getting from House and Senate leadership is that \nwe are in a war and we need to start fighting like we are in a war.'' \nIt went on to say, ``Republican leadership is now engaged on this issue \nand is issuing strong directives to all players in the insurance and \nemployer community to get activated.'' Their message: ``Get off your \nbutts; get out your wallets.''\n  The special interests have responded. They are now pouring millions \nof dollars into a PR campaign to confuse and intimidate patients, and \nthey are pouring hundreds of thousands of dollars into Republican \ncampaign committees.\n  One of the directives the GOP leadership gave to their anti-reform \ncoalition was to ``write the definitive piece of paper trashing all \nthese bills''--trashing all these bills. It apparently did not matter \nto the Republican leadership what was actually in the bills--they were \nall to be trashed.\n  Willis Gradison, the head of the Health Insurance Association of \nAmerica, was asked in an interview published in the Rocky Mountain News \nto sum up the coalition's strategy. According to the article, Mr. \nGradison replied, ``There's a lot to be said for `just say no.' '' The \nauthor of the article goes on to report that, ``At a strategy session \nlast month called by a top aide to Senator Don Nickles, Gradison \nadvised Republicans to avoid taking public positions that could draw \nfire during the election campaign. Opponents will rely on Republican \nleaders in both chambers to keep managed care legislation bottled up in \ncommittee.''\n  So there you have it. Keep patient protections bottled up. Order your \nspecial interest friends to ``get off their butts and get out their \nwallets.'' Deliver a massive campaign of misinformation and \ndisinformation. Just say yes to the special interests--and just say no \nto the American people.\n  We saw the results of that strategy in the Senate yesterday when the \nRepublicans put the interests of the tobacco companies ahead of the \ninterests of the American children. Next, it is good medical care for \nAmerican families that will be sacrificed on the altar of special \ninterest profits, if the Republican leadership has its way.\n  But those leaders are feeling the heat. Yesterday, the Republican \nleader tried a new tactic to try to persuade the American people that \nhe is not trying to block managed care reform. But the tactic was \nanother transparent attempt to dodge full and fair debate on this \nimportant issue of health reform.\n  The Republican leader proposed an agreement under which the Senate \ncould potentially take up our legislation, which is called the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. But the proposal is clearly not defined to \nallow a fair debate or give American families the protections they \nneed. Instead, it is designed to give Republican Senators yet one more \nexcuse for not taking up this critical legislation.\n  First, it puts off action for several more weeks, even though time is \nclearly running out in this session of Congress, even though the \nAmerican people have already been waiting for more than a year for \naction, even though every day we delay, more abuses take place and more \npatients suffer needless pain and illness.\n  Next, the agreement proposed by the Republican leader would let him \nbring up any health care bill at all--not a hint of what that could be. \nYet he would limit Democrats to offering the text of S. 1891, as \nintroduced, without revisions. The Republican leader is not even \nproposing that we bring up the complete Patients' Bill of Rights, which \nis S. 1890. Instead, he wants us to offer a companion bill that does \nnot provide patients with the right to hold health plans accountable \nfor medical decisions that result in injury or death. It does not \nprovide protections for those who buy health insurance on their own, \nwithout assistance from an employer. It is not the real Patients' Bill \nof Rights.\n\n  In addition, the proposed agreement asks for a vote ``on or in \nrelation to'' the unnamed Republican bill and the Democratic \nsubstitute. Again, a Trojan horse. This does not guarantee a clear vote \nor final action. The Republican leadership could meet this requirement \nby simply having procedural votes--on cloture, a point of order, or \nmotion to table. Under this proposal, the American people will never \nfind out where the Senate stands on patient protections.\n  Adding insult to injury, the proposal further states that even if we \nwin a vote--even if we win a vote--he reserves the right to kill the \nbill by returning it to the Senate calendar after the vote.\n  This is what his proposal says:\n\n       . . . and following those votes, it be in order for the \n     majority leader to return the legislation to the calendar.\n\n  So even if we win the vote, this gives the authority to the majority \nleader to send it back to the calendar. Generally, if you win the vote \naround here on a piece of legislation, it goes to the House of \nRepresentatives, or if it has been in the House of Representatives, it \ngoes to the President of the United States. That is the way you \nlegislate--but not under the proposal of the Republican leadership, and \nnot on the issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights, which he continues to \nrefuse to schedule in this session of the Congress.\n  This is bizarre, Mr. President. I know he announced it at a press \nconference, rather than sharing it with the Democratic leader and those \nwho have been involved in the issue, which is generally the process and \nprocedure. I don't know whether he thought that by issuing it at a \npress conference he would be able to flummox the American people into \nthinking he was really doing something, in order for the majority \nleader to return the legislation to the calendar.\n  So after we debate for weeks, he is instructing the Democrats which \nbill to bring up, while he is keeping open his options. He is saying \nthat any vote that is in relation to it, any vote at all, will answer \nthe requirements of the proposal; and if we win the final vote, he can \nstill put the legislation right back on the calendar.\n  Mr. President, that is not even the end of it. Finally, the proposed \nagreement states that no other health care proposal--no bills, no \namendments--can be considered this year on the issue. No health care \nproposal--none. This could even preclude further consideration of \ntobacco legislation.\n  This is what it says, Mr. President:\n\n       Finally, I ask unanimous consent that it not be in order to \n     offer any legislation, motion, or amendment relative to \n     health care prior to the initiation of this agreement, and \n     following the execution of the agreement, it not be in order \n     to offer any legislation, motion, or amendment relative to \n     health care for the remainder of the 105th Congress.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this unanimous consent \nrequest be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          Health Care Consent\n\n       I ask unanimous consent that prior to the August recess, \n     the majority leader, after notification of the minority \n     leader, shall turn to the consideration of a bill to be \n     introduced by the majority leader, or his designee, regarding \n     Health Care.\n       I further ask that the Senate proceed to its immediate \n     consideration and following the reporting by the clerk, \n     Senator Daschle or his designee be recognized to offer as a \n     substitute the text of S. 1891, as introduced on March 31, \n     1998.\n       I further ask that during the consideration of the Health \n     Care issue, it be in order for members to offer Health Care \n     amendments in the first and second degree.\n\n[[Page S6696]]\n\n       I further ask unanimous consent that the chair not \n     entertain a motion to adjourn or recess for the August recess \n     prior to a vote on or in relation to the majority leader's \n     bill and the minority leader's amendment, and following those \n     votes, it be in order for the majority leader, to return the \n     legislation to the calendar.\n       Finally, I ask unanimous consent that it not be in order to \n     offer any legislation, motion or amendment relative to Health \n     Care prior to the initiation of this agreement, and following \n     the execution of the agreement, it not be in order to offer \n     any legislation, motion or amendment relative to Health Care \n     for the remainder of the 105th Congress.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So you can't offer anything to do with the health care \nof the American people prior to this, or after this, or after the \nRepublican leader puts this proposal back on the calendar to shelve it. \nIn other words, the Republican leadership says to the Senate of the \nUnited States: You can't deal with anything affecting the health care \nof the American people for the rest of this Congress.\n  Come on, Mr. President. Come on, Mr. President. This is just the day \nafter the Republican leadership tried to sink the tobacco bill. Now \nthey are out there trying to deny us the opportunity to debate one of \nthe most important health care bills that is before the American \npeople.\n\n  Mr. President, it is just unbelievable to me to think that the \nmajority leader's proposal was going to be considered in good faith by \nour Democratic leader, or by any Member--not just leadership--by any \nMember. We are all equals in this body.\n  Those who are interested in health care ought to be concerned when a \nproposal is put forward to muzzle the U.S. Senate on health care. What \ndoes the Republican leadership fear? What do they fear about a full and \nopen debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights? What do they fear in a \ndebate about trying to give an opportunity for the Senate to express \nitself to permit our uninsured citizens between the ages of 55 and 64 \nto be able to buy into the Medicare system? What do they fear about \nhaving an open and full debate on that issue, if the individuals are \ngoing to pay full premiums? What do they have to fear about the \npossibility of requiring that companies of 50 or more employees have \nsome requirement to provide health care for their employees? Can't we \nhave a debate on that issue? Can't we have a rollcall on that issue?\n  Some will agree. Some will differ. Let the American people make a \njudgment about how their representatives stand. No, no, not if the \nmajority leader, on behalf of the Republicans, have their way.\n  This proposal says ``not be in order to offer any legislation, \nmotion, or amendment relative to health care prior to the initiation of \nthe agreement,'' which is sometime just before the August recess, for \nthe next several weeks, and for the rest of this session following \ncompletion of this proposed agreement. If we were to proceed with it, \nwe would be absolutely curtailed from any kind of effort to try to \naddress health care for the American people. This could even preclude \nfurther consideration of tobacco legislation, or proposals to extend \nhealth insurance to uninsured Americans between the ages of 55 and 64, \nor improvements in Medicare package for senior citizens, or \nappropriations for the National Institutes of Health and other health \nprograms, or legislation on the privacy of medical records--the list \ngoes on and on.\n\n  Many of us believe that as we move on into the millennium, it is \ngoing to be the millennium of the life sciences with extraordinary \nscientific breakthroughs. And the Republican leader wants to silence us \nfrom having some opportunity to debate that priority?\n  Mr. President, it prohibits consideration of any legislation dealing \nwith the problems of the privacy of our medical records, and the \ndangers that exist in terms of the proliferation of medical records. \nThere are enormously important issues relating to the privacy of \nmedical records that Republicans and Democrats have tried to address. \nBut we are foreclosed from any opportunity to consider that under this \nproposal.\n  Mr. President, it often takes, as we all know, many votes to pass \nlegislation important to American families. Rarely can we do so on the \nfirst attempt. These arbitrary, unfair restrictions serve only to \nstrengthen the power of the special interests. We have heard where \nthose special interests are. We understand what they are doing at the \npresent time--raising millions of dollars, and going on with these \ndistortions and misrepresentations.\n  The networks were hardly quiet after the tobacco industry was able to \ndisrupt the kind of successful conclusion of legislation here in the \nU.S. Senate that would protect our children. The airwaves are polluted \nagain with distortions and millions of dollars in trying to do a \nsimilar job on the Patients' Bill of Rights.

Mr. President, I rise to comment on the concerns I have \nabout recent proposals to dramatically change the regulatory structure \nof the Tennessee Valley Authority. Recently, legislation was introduced \nto make dramatic changes in the regulatory structure of TVA, starting \nwith the granting of regulatory authority to the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission.\n  TVA has had remarkably stable rates over the last decade, with only \none significant rate increase during this time period. I agreed that \nTVA has not been run perfectly through the years. However, to consider \na substantial regulatory overhaul for this agency at a time when \ncomprehensive electric industry deregulation is right around the corner \nappears to me to be premature and unwise. Legislation to impose \nadditional regulatory controls at a time when the Congress is beginning \nto seriously consider significantly less regulation for the rest of the \nindustry seems contradictory to me.\n  In addition, I have concerns about the impact of such a proposal on \nthe coal industry in my state. I would strongly oppose efforts to \nimpose a new federal regulatory layer that may limit the flexibility of \nTVA to purchase Kentucky coal. TVA buys over 26 million tons of \nKentucky coal per year, which adds $600 million to the economy of my \nState. TVA is responsible for more than 20 percent of all coal \npurchases in Kentucky.\n  I have heard from many Kentuckians who are concerned about this new \nregulatory proposal. I wish to place my colleagues on notice that I \nwill strongly oppose any such regulatory scheme, and will oppose other \noverhaul efforts outside of the context of deregulation legislation. It \nmakes no sense to consider two major regulatory changes in such a short \nperiod of time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/19/senate-section/article/S6696-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6696-S6697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                UTAH JAZZ--WESTERN CONFERENCE NBA CHAMPS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate my home team, \nthe Utah Jazz, on their remarkable season and thrilling playoff run. \nFor the second straight year, the Jazz won the NBA's Western Conference \nin impressive fashion and lost a well-fought series to the Chicago \nBulls by the slimmest of margins.\n  As one of the team's most faithful fans, I share the heartache of the \nplayers and coaches, who came so close to reaching their goal only to \nfall one point short of a seventh game. However, I am confident that \nJazz fans everywhere share my feelings of pride in the season that \nthese gutsy, tenacious players gave us to enjoy.\n  To those players who believe that professional sports have become \njust another business with big salaries and product licenses, I will \nsimply say that the Utah Jazz personify everything that is good about \nthe game of basketball. The Jazz believe in teamwork, pure \nfundamentals, courage, and determination.\n  Basketball fans throughout the country have become enamored with the\n\n[[Page S6697]]\n\nJazz and their old-fashioned work ethic. Often facing younger and more \nathletic teams, the Jazz have relied on their trademark discipline and \nteamwork to overwhelm their opponents.\n  However, it is not just the Jazz's triumphs on the basketball court \nthat are spectacular--such as winning over 76 percent of this season's \ngames and compiling an 11-3 mark through the Western Conference \nplayoffs, punctuated by a 4-game sweep of the formidable Los Angeles \nLakers. The examples they set for our youth off the court are just as \nnoteworthy. Many of the players give of their time, talents and money \nto better our community. They have been unafraid to display to the \nworld that you can be a superstar and a good citizen, friend, and \nfather. Our team is made up of high caliber individuals. They have \nworked hard, believed in each other, and have displayed tremendous \npoise and dignity throughout a challenging season.\n  Once again this year, Utahns were privileged to watch the timeless \nduo of John Stockton and Karl Marlone work their magic.\n  By flawlessly executing there signature pick-and-roll time and time \nagain, these two basketball legends led the Jazz to a 62-win season \nthat classified as the best record in the NBA this season and included \n2 wins and no losses in match-up with the Bulls. In fact, if you take \ninto account every game in which the Jazz and the Bulls faced one \nanother this year, each team won four. So, the way I see it, the Bulls \nwin in Game 6 achieved a draw in the Jazz-Bulls rivalry for the entire \n'97-'98.\n\n  I do want to congratulate the Chicago Bulls on another fine season \nand a tremendous victory in the Finals. My hat is off to Michael Jordan \nand the Bulls for a spectacular playoff performance. Michael Jordan's \nskills and superb performances will be applauded for many years to \ncome. No one can dispute that this team is comprised of very talented \nplayers who have excited and entertained basketball fans around the \nworld for most of this decade.\n  Years from now, as I look back at this Jazz team, I will fondly \nremember this remarkable season and the joy they brought to all their \nfans. It has been my pleasure to attend many games at the Delta Center \nand to join in the cheering and excitement. It has been my honor to \nrepresent the state with the classiest team in the NBA.\n  The Utah Jazz would not have been able to achieve such success \nwithout the contributions and talents of some very key people. I \ncommend head coach Jerry Sloan and his staff for the gritty, hard-nosed \napproach that they have given to the team. Coach Sloan never gave \nexcuses when things went awry and always expected his players to give \ntheir best efforts, every minute of every game. He has the complete \nrespect of all of his players--the greatest accolade a coach can \nreceive.\n  Jazz Owner Larry Miller knew what it would mean for Utah to have its \nown NBA basketball team. He enabled the Jazz to stay in Salt Lake City. \nHe has displayed great leadership and commitment to the team and the \ncommunity throughout his many years of owning this team.\n  Team President Frank Layden has always encouraged, motivated, and \ncommanded respect from the players and the community. His enthusiasm \ncreates community spirit and strengthens conviction in our team.\n  And Scott Layden's savvy, and superb sense of what makes a champion \nhas continued to propel the Jazz to greater heights. He has always \nconducted the business of the Jazz with professionalism, and is one of \nthe most highly-respected front office people in the league.\n  To the players, I offer my congratulations on an exceptional season. \nEach of these fine individuals--Karl, John, Jeff, Byron, Greg, Antoine, \nShandon, Howard, Chris, Adam, Greg, and Jacque--contributed greatly to \nthe success of this team. On behalf of Jazz fans everywhere, I thank \nyou all for taking us on yet another memorable journey to the NBA \nFinals. Let's do it gain next year.\n  Mr. President, I am proud of the Jazz and the unique spirit of unity \nthat they have brought to the state of Utah. Win or lose, they act with \nprofessionalism and class both on and off the court. They are champions \nin every sense of the word.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/19/senate-section/article/S6696-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CHANGES TO THE RULES FOR REGULATION OF THE SENATE WING OF THE UNITED \n                             STATES CAPITOL\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Obviously, one of the \nbest policy weapons we have available is hard-nosed diplomacy to \nprevent such nuclear incidents from occurring in the first place.\n  The President must have full flexibility to implement a strong \nforeign policy that addresses the recklessness of Pakistan, India or \nany other nation that defines the world community. However, the \nAdministration should be able to do so without the constraints of a \nCongressionally mandated list of sanctions. This flexibility should \nalso include the authority to remove sanctions when appropriate or when \nin the best interest of the United States.\n  Under current law, the United States must impose specific and \nmandatory sanctions on any non-nuclear weapons state that receives or \ndetonates a nuclear device. This mandated action removes the \nPresident's authority to custom-tailor sanctions and set them for a \nspecific period of time. These constraints dangerously restrict the \nPresident's ability to respond to world events.\n  My bill provides the Administration with discretionary authority over \nsanctions placed on nations that practice nuclear proliferation. The \nPresident and his diplomatic corp are given the authority to either \nimpose or not impose sanctions. They can decide the degree of \nsanctions. They can later remove or modify any sanctions. Additionally, \nthe President is required to report his intentions to Congress within \n30 days of informing the violating country of the sanctions. If it \ndisagrees, Congress remains free to react legislatively.\n  This bill represents an important step toward what I hope will be a \ncritical debate regarding U.S. foreign policy. Unilateral sanctions \nrarely achieve their goals. Instead, they damage U.S. businesses and \nworkers. They diminish U.S. strength and prestige in international \naffairs. They generate resentment from allies and competitors alike.\n  I would remind you that we now have in place unilateral sanctions \nagainst more than 70 nations representing almost three-fourths of the \nworld's populations. Those are markets lost to the American economy.\n  Congress and the Administration must now work together to reassess \nall instances where unilateral sanctions are imposed. This bill \nrepresent an excellent step in the right direction.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GORTON (for himself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Grams, and Mr. \n        Bingaman):\n  S. 2196. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nestablishment at the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of a \nprogram regarding lifesaving interventions for individuals who \nexperience cardiac arrest, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                      cardiac arrest survival act\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, every day almost 1,000 Americans suffer \nfrom Sudden Cardiac Arrest. It can claim the life of a promising young \nathlete, a friend or family member regardless of age or health. Sudden \nCardiac Arrest occurs when the heart's electrical impulses become \nchaotic causing the heart to stop pumping blood. Tragically, 95 percent \nof Americans who suffer from sudden cardiac arrest will die. Today, I \nam introducing a bill that can change that statistic.\n  We know that quick implementation of ``Chain of Survival''--calling \n911, administering CPR and early access to defibrillation can \ndramatically improve survival rates for victims of Sudden Cardiac \nArrest. Unfortunately, early access to defibrillation may be the most \ncritical link in the chain and the most difficult to come by. The \nCardiac Arrest Survival Act aims to improve community access to \nautomatic external defibrillators (AEDs), a machine designed to shock \nthe heart and restore its normal rhythm. If every community across \nAmerica made this easy-to-use technology more readily available, we \ncould increase the survival rate of cardiac arrest and possibly save \n250 lives each day and 100,000 lives each year.\n  My home state of Washington has a long history of encouraging the use \nof AEDs. King County, Washington boasts one of the highest cardiac \narrest survival rates in the nation at 30 percent--far above the \nnational average survival rate of 5 percent. Communities that have \nimproved survival rates have ensured that Emergency Medical Technicians \nare trained and equipped with automatic external defibrillators. Some \ncommunities have located AEDs in public places like sports stadiums, \nairports and shopping malls, and others have worked to ensure that \npolice and firefighters, often the first to respond to an emergency, \nare trained and equipped with AEDs.\n  Although the technology is proven effective, access to defibrillators \noutside the hospital setting is limited. Patient care and survival \nsuffer from a patchwork of different state laws. Less than half of the \nnation's Emergency Medical Technicians are even trained and equipped to \nuse AEDs. The Cardiac Arrest Survival Act aims to reduce the number of \ncardiac arrest fatalities by encouraging a uniform system of state laws \nand to improve current emergency medical training programs.\n  The bill asks the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to work \non model state legislation that addresses some of the barriers to \ncommunity access to AEDs such as good samaritan immunity and public \nplacement of these machines. NHLBI will also work with the National \nHighway Transportation and Safety Administration to update the current \nmedical training curriculum to reflect the improvement in technology. \nThe bill will also coordinate a database to collect information on \ncardiac arrest from existing databases on emergency care. While the \nbill is far from mandating anything, I am convinced we can reduce the \nnumber of cardiac arrest fatalities by encouraging states to train more \npeople to use AEDs right on the scene in a way that the state of \nWashington is already doing.\n  The Cardiac Arrest Survival Act is the Senate companion to a bill \nintroduced by Congressman Stearns in the House of Representatives that \ncurrently has 80 cosponsors. The bill enjoys broad support from more \nthan seventy associations including the American Heart Association, the \nAmerican Red Cross, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the \nCongressional Fire Services Institute Advisory Committee with some 45 \nmembers, the Washington State Medical Association, the Washington State \nHospital Association and a number of other supporters. I am also \npleased to be joined by my colleagues Senators Murray, Grams, and \nBingaman as original cosponsors of the bill, the full text of which I \nask be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2196\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Cardiac Arrest Survival \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Each year more than 350,000 adults suffer cardiac \n     arrest, usually away from a hospital. More than 95 percent of \n     them will die, in many cases, because lifesaving \n     defibrillators arrive on the scene too late, if at all.\n       (2) These cardiac arrest deaths occur primarily from occult \n     underlying heart disease and from drownings, allergic or \n     sensitivity reactions, or electrical shocks.\n       (3) Survival from cardiac arrest requires successful early \n     implementation of a chain of events, the chain of survival \n     which begins when the person sustains a cardiac arrest and \n     continues until the person arrives at the hospital.\n       (4) A successful chain of survival requires the first \n     person on the scene to take rapid and simple initial steps to \n     care for the patient and to assure the patient promptly \n     enters the emergency medical services system.\n       (5) The first persons on the scene when an arrest occurs \n     are typically lay persons who are friends or family of the \n     victim, fire services, public safety personnel, basic life \n     support emergency medical services providers, teachers, \n     coaches, and supervisors of sports or other extracurricular \n     activities, providers of day care, school bus drivers, \n     lifeguards, attendants at public gatherings, coworkers, and \n     other leaders within the community.\n       (6) A coordinated Federal response is necessary to ensure \n     that appropriate and timely lifesaving interventions are \n     provided to persons sustaining nontraumatic cardiac arrest. \n     The Federal response should include, but not be limited to--\n       (A) significantly expanded research concerning the efficacy \n     of various methods of providing immediate out-of-hospital \n     lifesaving interventions to the nontraumatic cardiac arrest \n     patient;\n\n[[Page S6700]]\n\n       (B) the development of research-based, nationally uniform, \n     easily learned and well retained model core educational \n     content concerning the use of such lifesaving interventions \n     by health care professionals, allied health personnel, \n     emergency medical services personnel, public safety \n     personnel, and other persons who are likely to arrive \n     immediately at the scene of a sudden cardiac arrest;\n       (C) an identification of the legal, political, financial, \n     and other barriers to implementing these lifesaving \n     interventions; and\n       (D) the development of model State legislation to reduce \n     identified barriers and to enhance each State's response to \n     this significant problem.\n\n     SEC. 3. NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH MODEL PROGRAM ON THE \n                   FIRST LINKS IN THE CHAIN OF SURVIVAL.\n\n       Section 421 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n     285b-3) is amended by adding at the end the following \n     subsection:\n       ``(c) Programs under subsection (a)(1)(E) (relating to \n     emergency medical services and preventive, diagnostic, \n     therapeutic, and rehabilitative approaches) shall include \n     programs for the following:\n       ``(1) The development and dissemination, in coordination \n     with the emergency services guidelines promulgated under \n     section 402(a) of title 23, United States Code, by the \n     Associate Administrator for Traffic Safety Programs, \n     Department of Transportation, of a core content for a model \n     State training program applicable to cardiac arrest for \n     inclusion in appropriate current emergency medical services \n     educational curricula and training programs that address \n     lifesaving interventions, including cardiopulmonary \n     resuscitation and defibrillation. In developing the core \n     content for such program, the Director of the Institute may \n     rely upon the content of similar curricula and training \n     programs developed by national nonprofit entities. The core \n     content of such program--\n       ``(A) may be used by health care professionals, allied \n     health personnel, emergency medical services personnel, \n     public safety personnel, and any other persons who are likely \n     to arrive immediately at the scene of a sudden cardiac arrest \n     (in this subsection referred to as `cardiac arrest care \n     providers') to provide lifesaving interventions, including \n     cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation;\n       ``(B) shall include age-specific criteria for the use of \n     particular techniques, which shall include infants and \n     children; and\n       ``(C) shall be reevaluated as additional interventions are \n     shown to be effective.\n       ``(2) The operation of a limited demonstration project to \n     provide training in such core content for cardiac arrest care \n     providers to validate the effectiveness of the training \n     program.\n       ``(3) The definition and identification of cardiac arrest \n     care providers, by personal relationship, exposure to arrest \n     or trauma, occupation (including health professionals), or \n     otherwise, who could provide benefit to victims of out-of-\n     hospital arrest by comprehension of such core content.\n       ``(4) The establishment of criteria for completion and \n     comprehension of such core content, including consideration \n     of inclusion in health and safety educational curricula.\n       ``(5) The identification and development of equipment and \n     supplies that should be accessible to cardiac arrest care \n     providers to permit lifesaving interventions by preplacement \n     of such equipment in appropriate locations insofar as such \n     activities are consistent with the development of the core \n     content and utilize information derived from such studies by \n     the National Institutes of Health on investigation in cardiac \n     resuscitation.\n       ``(6) The development in accordance with this paragraph of \n     model State legislation (or Federal legislation applicable to \n     Federal territories, facilities, and employees).

A bill to amend title 5, United States Code, to provide for \nCongressional review of rules establishing or increasing taxes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n                       the taxpayers' defense act\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Taxpayer's \nDefense Act. Quite simply, this bill prohibits any agency from \nestablishing a tax on the American people.\n  Mr. President, as we all know, the United States was founded on one \nsimple and fundamental principle--no taxation without representation.\n  In ``The Second Treatise of Government'', John Locke said, ``if \nanyone shall claim a power to lay and levy taxes on the people . . . \nwithout . . . consent of the people, he thereby . . . subverts the end \nof government.'' According to Locke, consent required agreement by a \nmajority of the people, ``either by themselves or their representatives \nchosen by them.'' The Declaration of Independence listed, among the \ndespotic acts of King George, his ``imposing taxes on us without our \nconsent.''\n  The Boston Tea Party remains the symbol of Americans' opposition to \ntaxation without representation. The Constitutional authority--given \nonly to Congress--to establish federal taxes is clear. Its reasoning \nalso is clear. It is the Congress that represents the people. Only \nCongress considers and weighs every issue that rises to national \nimportance. While federal agencies consider their own priorities to be \nparamount, only Congress can determine which goals merit a tax on the \nAmerican people.\n  The modern era of restricted federal budgets, however, threatens to \nerode the essential principle of ``no taxation without \nrepresentation.'' In many subtle and often hidden ways, federal \nagencies are receiving from Congress the power to tax.\n  They tax by adding unnecessary charges to legitimate government user \nfees. They tax through federal mandates. These taxes pass the cost of \ngovernment on to the American people--without their knowledge.\n  The worst example of administrative taxation is the Federal \nCommunications Commission's Universal Service tax. ``Universal \nservice'' is the idea that everyone should have access to affordable \ntelecommunications services. It originated at the beginning of the \ncentury when the first national telecommunications service was still \nbeing created. This idea was expanded in the Telecommunications Act of \n1996, which allowed the FCC to extend universal service funds to \nprovide ``discount telecommunications services'' to schools, libraries, \nand rural health care facilities.\n  Most importantly, the Act gave the FCC the power to decide the level \nof ``contributions''--taxes--that telecommunications companies would \nhave to pay to support universal service. The FCC now determines how \nmuch must be collected in taxes that subsidize a variety of ``universal \nservice'' spending programs. Long distance providers pass the costs on \nto consumers in the form of higher telephone bills. In the first half \nof 1998, the tax was $625 million, and the Clinton Administration's \nbudget projects it will rise to $10 billion per year. This \nadministrative tax is already out of control.\n\n  This is possible because Congress delegated its authority to tax. The \nFCC is able to collect taxpayer dollars at levels it sets--without \napproval from Congress or the people. The FCC can defy Congress and the \npeople because it has the power to levy taxes.\n  Mr. President, some people thought the tax and spend liberals had \nleft Washington. Not so. Washington interest groups who want to feed at \nthis new federal trough already are geared up to accuse the Republic \nCongress of cutting funding for education and health care if any \nattempt is made to rein in the FCC. They will frame the issue as a \nmatter of federal entitlements for sympathetic causes and groups.\n  The most sympathetic group is the American taxpayer, whose money is \nbeing taken, laundered through the Washington bureaucracy, and returned \nfor purposes set by unelected Washington bureaucrats. This is why the \nFCC must be required to get the approval of\n\n[[Page S6701]]\n\nCongress before setting future tax rates.\n  Should tax dollars be used for federal universal service programs and \nwhat amounts or should Americans spend what they earn on their own, \nreal, local priorities? Requiring Congress to review any administrative \ntaxes would answer this question.\n  My bill would create a new section to the Congressional Review Act \nfor mandatory review of certain agency rules. Any rule that establishes \nor raises a tax would have to be submitted to and receive the approval \nof Congress before taking effect. In essence, the Act would disable \nagencies from setting taxes, but would allow them to formulate \nproposals under existing rulemaking procedures.\n  Once submitted to Congress, a taxing regulation would be introduced \nin both the House and Senate by the Majority Leader. The rule would \nthen be subject to expedited procedures, allowing a prompt decision on \nwhether or not to approve a rule. The rule would have to be approved by \nboth Houses and signed by the President.\n  Congress must not allow a federal agency--unelected and unaccountable \nfederal bureaucrats--to determine the amount of taxes hardworking \nAmericans must pay. The Taxpayers' Defense Act will require Congress to \nstand up and face the American people when it decides to tax. The cry \nof ``no taxation without representation'' has gone up in the land \nbefore, and today we are hearing it again. It is time that we respond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/19/senate-section/article/S6698-2", "month":

Res. 104\n\n       Whereas 50 years ago on July 28, 1948, President Truman \n     issued Executive Order No. 9981 that stated that it is \n     essential that there be maintained in the Armed Services of \n     the United States the highest standards of democracy, with \n     equality of treatment and opportunity for all those who serve \n     in our country's defense;\n       Whereas President Truman declared that there shall be \n     equality of treatment and opportunity for all persons in the \n     Armed Services without regard to race, color, religion, or \n     national origin;\n       Whereas soon after the Executive order was issued American \n     soldiers fighting in Korea led the way to a fully integrated \n     Army;\n       Whereas after the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of \n     1964, the Armed Forces resolved to implement the legislation \n     as a new opportunity to provide all members of the Armed \n     Forces with freedom from discrimination within and outside \n     its military communities;\n       Whereas the efforts of the Armed Forces to ensure the \n     equality of treatment and opportunity for its members \n     contributed significantly to the advancement of that goal for \n     all Americans;\n       Whereas minorities serve today in senior leadership \n     positions throughout the Armed Forces, as officers, senior \n     noncommissioned officers, and civilian leaders; and\n       Whereas the Armed Forces have demonstrated a total and \n     continuing commitment to ensuring the equality of treatment \n     and opportunity for all persons in the Total Force, both \n     military and civilian: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) commends the United States Armed Forces for its \n     efforts, leadership, and success in providing equality of \n     treatment and opportunity; and\n       (2) recognizes the commemoration by the Department of \n     Defense on July 24, 1998, of the 50th anniversary of the \n     integration of the Armed Forces.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/19/senate-section/article/S6701-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6701-S6702]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 252--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING A \n                   RESOLUTION TO THE KASHMIR DISPUTE\n\n  Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Brownback, and Mr. Torricelli) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nForeign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, today I submit a resolution on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Brownback and Senator Torricelli, which addresses a \ncritical issue in South Asia. It calls for a peaceful and just \nsettlement of the dispute over Kashmir.\n  For the better part of half a century, Pakistan and India have had a \nterritorial dispute involving the Jammu and Kashmir region--commonly \nreferred to simply as Kashmir. Three times in the past 50 years, these \ntwo nations have fought against one another, two of these wars were \nover Kashmir. International security experts have long considered South \nAsia generally, and Kashmir specifically, a ``nuclear flash point.'' \nThese longstanding tensions between Pakistan and India have only \nworsened with their testing of nuclear weapons last month. It is more \nimportant than ever to take a serious look at Pakistan-India relations.\n  A peaceful resolution to the Kashmir dispute is not only in the \ninterest of the peoples of South Asia, it is also in the interest of \nthe United States. Our nation has had a long and important history with \nboth countries. I think the United states is very aware of the dangers \nto our own national security, as well as the peace and security of the \nwhole world, if the Kashmir dispute continues without resolution.\n  Further, a peaceful resolution to this conflict would foster economic \nand social development of the Kashmir region, as well as the rest of \nSouth Asia. It would also curb many of the human rights abuses which \ncontinue despite the efforts by many international groups.\n  As a world leader, we must take the initiative to help negotiate a \npeaceful and just end to the dispute in the Kashmir region that follows \nthe wishes of those affected. And both the United States and the United \nNations can play an important role in finding a resolution to the \ndispute over Kashmir, and in improving relations between Pakistan and \nIndia. While the Administration and the international community have \ntaken several steps to address these problems, more action is required.\n  This Senate resolution states that resolving the Kashmir dispute \nshould be a top US priority, as well as that of the world community. \nFurthermore, this resolution asks our Ambassador to the United Nations \nto call a meeting of the Security Council with representatives from \nboth India and Pakistan for the purpose of discussing security in South \nAsia. It also advises the Administration to raise the issue of Kashmir \nwith the Security Council and promote the possibility of a UN sponsored \nmediator for the conflict. Finally, this resolution requests that the \nPresident ask the Indian government to allow UN human rights officials \nto visit the Kashmir region.\n  I believe the resolution outlines some important next steps for the \nU.S. to help facilitate a reasonable and just solution to the Kashmir \ndispute and normalization of relations between India and Pakistan. It \nis time for the United States Government and the world to act in a \nproductive manner that will help attain stability in South Asia. We \ncannot turn a blind eye to this long-standing conflict any longer and \nmust seek a peaceful end to this dispute which not only benefits the \ncountries involved, but will ultimately benefit the world.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/19/senate-section/article/S6701-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6702-S6716]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1999\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       ROBERTS AMENDMENT NO. 2730\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. ROBERTS submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill (S. 2057) to authorize appropriations for the fiscal year \n19099 for military activities of the Department of Defense, for \nmilitary construction, and for defense activities of the Department of \nEnergy, to prescribe personnel strengths for such fiscal year for the \nArmed Forces, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Forced abortion was rightly denounced as a crime \n     against humanity by the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal.\n       (2) For over 15 years there have been frequent and credible \n     reports of forced abortion and forced sterilization in \n     connection with the population control policies of the \n     People's Republic of China. These reports indicate the \n     following:\n       (A) Although it is the stated position of the politburo of \n     the Chinese Communist Party that forced abortion and forced \n     sterilization have no role in the population control program, \n     in fact the Communist Chinese Government encourages both \n     forced abortion and forced sterilization through a \n     combination of strictly enforced birth quotas and immunity \n     for local population control officials who engage in \n     coercion. Officials acknowledge that there have been \n     instances of forced abortions and sterilization, and no \n     evidence has been made available to suggest that the \n     perpetrators have been punished.\n       (B) People's Republic of China population control \n     officials, in cooperation with employers and works unit \n     officials, routinely monitor women's menstrual cycles and \n     subject women who conceive without government authorization \n     to extreme psychological pressure, to harsh economic \n     sanctions, including unpayable fines and loss of employment, \n     and often to physical force.\n       (C) Official sanctions for giving birth to unauthorized \n     children include fines in amounts several times larger than \n     the per capita annual incomes of residents of the People's \n     Republic of China. In Fujian, for example, the average fine \n     is estimated to be twice a family's gross annual income. \n     Families which cannot pay the fine may be subject to \n     confiscation and destruction of their homes and personal \n     property.\n       (D) Especially harsh punishments have been inflicted on \n     those whose resistance is motivated by religion. For example, \n     according to a 1995 Amnesty International report, the \n     Catholic inhabitants of 2 villages in Hebei Province were \n     subjected to population control under the slogan ``better to \n     have more graves than one more child''. Enforcement measures \n     included torture, sexual abuse, and the detention of \n     resisters' relatives as hostages.\n       (E) Forced abortions in Communist China often have taken \n     place in the very late stages of pregnancy.\n       (F) Since 1994 forced abortion and sterilization have been \n     used in Communist China not only to regulate the number of \n     children, but also to eliminate those who are regarded as \n     defective in accordance with the official eugenic policy \n     known as the ``Natal and Health Care Law''.\n\n     SEC.   .

As part of this \n     policy, the Department of State should raise in every \n     relevant bilateral and multilateral forum the issue of \n     individuals imprisoned, detained, confined, or otherwise \n     harassed by the Chinese Government on religious grounds.

Mr. President, with this week's defeat of S. 1415, \nthe National Tobacco Policy and Youth Smoking Reduction Act of 1998, \nthe Senate has for the time being lost a unique opportunity to create a \nbetter future for our nation's children. Cloaked in a procedural vote, \nthe Republican leadership of this body voted to override the will of a \nmajority of our colleagues and scuttle an historic effort to protect \nour children from the ravages of tobacco. In the end, a determined \nminority of Republican Senators was more responsible to the wishes of \nthe tobacco industry than the need's of America's children.\n  Preventing the devastation that tobacco wreaks on our children was \nthe impetus for the considerable work that went into the drafting of \nthis bill over the past several months. It is also the reason why many \nof us have been willing to devote a significant portion of the Senate's \ntime--almost four weeks--to this cause.\n  We know that ninety-five percent of all adult smokers begin smoking \nas children. An estimated 3,000 youth start to smoke each day--a number \nthat has been increasing for the last five years. One thousand of those \nchildren will die early as a result of taking up this deadly habit. \nProvisions in this legislation would have reduced by two-thirds the \nnumber of children who smoke.\n  Those who voted to abandon this effort have chosen to allow our \nchildren to continue purchasing over 256 million packs of cigarettes \nper year, providing over $500 million in revenues to tobacco companies. \nThey have chosen to do nothing to prevent sickness and death that are \ncertain to befall millions of children who become addicted to tobacco.\n  This bill would have been a tremendous step in the right direction. \nAs originally drafted it would have comprehensively addressed the \nepidemic of youth smoking by funding anti-smoking campaigns and smoking \ncessation programs, reducing the ability of young people to buy \ncigarettes, and limiting the ability of tobacco manufacturers to market \nto children. There were also a number of other improvements offered to \nthe bill during debate on the floor, which I was proud to support.\n  In particular, I was pleased to see two amendments incorporated into \nthe bill that would have provided strong disincentives for tobacco \nmanufacturers to continue to market to America's children. The first \nprovision would have ensured that tobacco companies would be penalized \nif they marketed to children by denying them the ability to claim a tax \ndeduction for those advertising expenses. A second amendment would \nrequire the tobacco industry to pay stiffer lookback penalties if youth \nsmoking reduction targets were not met.\n  Public health and economic experts agree that the cornerstone of any \neffort to reduce youth smoking is a steep increase in the price of \ntobacco over a short time. That is why I strongly supported an \namendment to increase the price of cigarettes by $1.50 per pack, the \nminimum amount of increase that experts agree is needed to reduce youth \nsmoking. This price increase would have reduced the number of children \nsmoking by 60% in one year, kept 2.7 million kids from starting \nsmoking, and would have saved 800,000 lives. While I was disappointed \nthat the proposal was defeated, I was encouraged that a majority of the \nSenate resoundingly rejected an attempt to strip from the bill the \noriginal $1.10 per pack increase--one of the bill's strongest weapons \nagainst youth smoking.\n  I was also proud to support a provision that would have improved the \nquality of child care and made it more affordable and accessible to all \nAmericans. By setting aside for child care 50 percent of the federal \nportion of tobacco funds going to states, this provision would have \nprovided a solid foundation and a concrete committment to the future \nhealth and safety of our children.\n  There were also a number of amendments to this legislation which I \nopposed out of concern that they would have significantly weakened its \nimpact. First, I was unable to support an amendment that would have \ndenied tobacco manufacturers any limitation on annual liabilities. Like \nthe Administration, I believe that some limitations on liability were \nnecessary in order to maximize our chances of passing a bill that would \nactually succeed in curbing youth smoking. Without such provisions, \nmembers of the industry were prepared to argue that their First \nAmendment rights were violated. They would have tied the legislation up \nin courts for decades, while leaving America's children unprotected.\n  Several amendments concerning limits on lawyers fees were also \nconsidered as part of the debate on this bill. While the lowest \nproposed limit would have perhaps inadvertently limited access by \nindividuals to attorneys willing to take their cases, I supported \nsubsequent amendments which offered less onerous limitations on the \namount attorneys can charge to bring suit against the misdeeds of the \ntobacco industry.\n  I was troubled by efforts of some Members to divert the funds \ndedicated in this bill for public health purposes. For instance, while \nI have been a staunch supporter of anti-drug legislation, I was unable \nto support an amendment that would have gutted anti-tobacco public \nhealth programs in the bill in favor of poorly crafted anti-drug \nprovisions. This amendment would have diverted public education funds \nto private-school vouchers for victims of school violence. A main flaw \nin this concept is that it offers assistance only after a student has \nbeen victimized, but does nothing to prevent crimes against children \nbefore they happen. This amendment would have also overridden the \ncollective bargaining rights of employees of the Customs Service, \nundermining a successful anti-drug program developed through \ncooperative labor-management relations. It would have also barred \nFederal funds and limited non-federal funds for needle exchange \nprograms--programs that have effectively helped control the spread of \nthe deadly AIDS virus in our communities. Not surprisingly, this \namendment was opposed by several law enforcement entities.\n  In contrast, the Democratic alternative, which I did support, would \nnot have jeopardized funding for public health. This alternative would \nhave included tough money laundering provisions, not present in the \nCoverdell amendment, which would have provided critical assistance to \nlaw enforcement to combat drug problems. Rather than weakening the \nCustoms Service, it would have increased the drug interdiction budget \nfor the agency as well as for the Coast Guard and the Department of \nDefense, using general revenues. In addition, the Democratic \nalternative would have created financial incentives for states to \nreport on and improve the safety of schools.\n  I also felt compelled to vote against the marriage penalty amendment \noffered by the Republicans because, in my view, the amendment did not \nprovide targeted relief to those who need it most. In fact, 60 percent \nof the tax cut in the provision would have gone to couples who \ncurrently enjoy a marriage bonus. Moreover, this amendment was a costly \nmeasure--costing 50 percent more in the first 10 years than the \nDemocratic alternative that was offered, which I was pleased to \nsupport. In addition, the Republican amendment would have been \npartially funded\n\n[[Page S6719]]\n\nin the out-years by tapping into the projected budget surplus, \npotentially leaving fewer funds available for long-term Social Security \nreform.\n  The Democratic alternative to this amendment would have reduced the \nmarriage penalty in the tax code by a much greater extent than the \nRepublican proposal for most couples with incomes below $60,000. \nIndeed, this amendment was carefully targeted and would cut the \nmarriage tax penalty more for a greater number of families. \nFurthermore, this proposal would have cost far less than the Republican \nproposal, while preserving the capacity of the tobacco bill to fulfill \nits fundamental purposes: cutting youth smoking, recompensing states \nand tobacco farmers, and improving the medical knowledge about the \ntreatment of tobacco-related illnesses.\n  Mr. President, this was not a perfect bill. However, even with its \nflaws, it would have marked a dramatic step forward in the effort to \nprotect children from the dangers of smoking. I was disappointed by its \ndemise. But I firmly believe that its defeat is only a temporary one. \nThe health of our children is simply too important for this Congress to \nignore. I look forward to working with colleagues on both sides of the \naisle in the days to come to address this critical issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/19/senate-section/article/S6718-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6719]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO ADITI GARG OF NEW HAMPSHIRE, 1998 DISCOVER CARD STATE \n                  TRIBUTE AWARD SCHOLARSHIP RECIPIENT\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \ncommend Aditi Garg of New Hampshire for receiving the Discover Card \nState Tribute Award Scholarship for 1998.\n  Established in 1992, the Discover Card Tribute Award program honors \noutstanding high school juniors and seniors across the United States \nand overseas schools. The Tribute Award Program honors excellence in \ncommunity service, leadership, special talents, unique endeavors and \nobstacles overcome. Of nearly 11,000 students nationwide who applied \nthis year, only those who most exemplify these characteristics receive \nthe scholarships. Winners may use their scholarships for any type of \npost-high school education or training.\n  Gold, silver, bronze and merit State Tribute Award scholarships are \nawarded in three categories of study: Arts and Humanities, Trade and \nTechnical or Science, Business and Technology. Due to her outstanding \nwritten statement, Aditi received a silver award in the category of \nScience, Business and Technology Studies.\n  It is no wonder Aditi is one of the recipients of such a competitive \naward. She is a member of the National Honor Society at her high school \nin Salem, New Hampshire. She is also a member of the varsity tennis \nteam, studies Indian classical dance and enjoys her volunteer work at \nHoly Family Hospital in Methuen, Massachusetts. Both in school and in \nthe greater society, Aditi stands out as a model student and citizen.\n  I wish to congratulate Aditi for all of her accomplishments, and \nespecially for being a distinguished recipient of the Discover Card \nState Tribute Award. It is an honor to represent Aditi Garg in the \nUnited States Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/19/senate-section/article/S6719-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6719-S6720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                AN AUTHENTIC AMERICAN HERO IN OUR MIDST\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, those of us who serve with our \ndistinguished colleague from Ohio, Senator John Glenn, have long known \nhim to be a very special American. We have had the privilege of working \nwith someone who, in his Senate service that might be characterized as \nhis third career, has demonstrated his capability as an accomplished \nstatesman and politician. He has capably provided strong leadership to \nthe committees on which he has served, notably including but certainly \nnot limited to his work as Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee \non Governmental Affairs in fields as diverse as counterproliferation \nand government efficiency.\n  John Glenn's public service, of course, follows his other two \ncareers--most recently as a very successful businessman in our free \nenterprise economy, and, of course, as an accomplished military pilot \nwith a distinguished record culminating in the distinction of being the \nfirst American to orbit the earth in space as one of the original seven \nMercury astronauts.\n  This fall, Senator Glenn expects to return to space to participate in \nimportant experiments concerning the effects of space travel on senior \ncitizens. In some ways to those of us who know him well, and watch the \npace at which he works and his amazing capacity for the nearly \ninterminable activity that consumes the lives of our nation's elected \nofficials, it is difficult for us to see him as a senior citizen. But \nthe calendar tells us that Senator Glenn is well into his 70's--and, in \nfact, will see his 77th birthday very soon. We wish him well, and, once \nagain, many years after the first time our nation held its breath and \noffered him our prayers and best wishes, we will do so again later this \nyear when he and his fellow Discovery crew members board the shuttle \nfor the flight in which he will serve as a crew member.\n  On Tuesday night of this week, we colleagues in the Senate honored \nSenator Glenn, and met his fellow crew members, at a dinner in the \nCapitol. On that occasion, the Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle \ndelivered remarks in honor of John Glenn. Because Senator Daschle's \nremarks eloquently and succinctly captured much about John Glenn that I \nbelieve others should know, I ask that those remarks be printed in the \nRecord. \n\n Remarks by Senate Democrat Leader Tom Daschle Honoring John Glenn, an \n                      Old-fashioned American Hero\n\n       Every time I hear John talk about wanting to go back up \n     into space to study the effects of space flight on aging \n     bodies I think, ``Right. What does he know about aging \n     bodies?'' John Glenn is the only person I know who can do \n     pushups with one hand and salute the flag with the other at \n     the same time.\n       So, I appointed a task force to investigate the real \n     reasons John wants to blast back into space. Tonight, I'm \n     releasing their report. Here are the top three reasons, in \n     Letterman style:\n       Number three: It turns out, he left his billfold up there \n     the first trip.\n       Number two: Before he leaves Congress, he wants to pioneer \n     the ultimate CODEL.\n       And reason number one: He wants to explore places to send \n     Ken Starr on his next assignment.\n       Actually, the reason John is going back into space is the \n     same reason he's doing practically everything in his life. It \n     is, quite simply, to serve his country.\n       We are here tonight to pay tribute to an old-fashioned \n     American hero, and to thank Annie, and all the Glenn children \n     and grandchildren, for sharing so much of John with America \n     for so long.\n       About two years ago, Linda and I had the privilege of \n     flying to China with several other members, including John \n     and Annie. During the flight, we were able to persuade John \n     to recollect that incredible mission aboard Friendship 7.\n       He told us about losing all communication during re-entry, \n     about having to guide his spacecraft manually during the most \n     critical point in re-entry, about seeing pieces of his \n     spacecraft splitting off in a big fireball.\n       We all huddled around him with our eyes wide open. No one \n     said a word. Listening to him, I felt the same awe I had felt \n     when I was 14 years old, sitting in a classroom in Aberdeen, \n     South Dakota, watching TV accounts of that flight.\n       I feel that inspiration now, when I think about what will \n     be the next chapter in the life of this amazing man.\n       A lot of people tend to think of two John Glenns: Colonel \n     John Glenn, the astronaut-hero; and Senator John Glenn. The \n     truth is, there is only John Glenn--the patriot.\n       Love for his country is what sent John into space. It's \n     what brought him to Washington, and compelled him to work so \n     diligently over all these years in the Senate. As he said, \n     when he announced that he would not seek re-election: Despite \n     all our problems--despite our sometimes inefficient \n     bureaucracies . . . or any of the other problems we love to \n     complain about, America--this grand experiment in democracy--\n     this ongoing work in progress--is still the greatest nation \n     in the history of the world and still a shining beacon of \n     hope and opportunity.\n       People who have been there say you see the world \n     differently from space. You see the ``big picture.'' You see \n     how small and interconnected our planet is. Perhaps it's \n     because he came to the Senate with that perspective that John \n     has fought so hard against nuclear proliferation. As a Wall \n     Street Journal reporter wrote recently, ``He has been the \n     Senate scold who lectured everybody who would listen, and \n     some who wouldn't, about the need to stop the spread of \n     nuclear arms.''\n       I don't know about that ``Senate scold'' part. But I do \n     know that America is lucky that John Glenn went up the first \n     time and gained that perspective. And the country is very \n     lucky that he is going up again. And those of us who are his \n     colleagues are the luckiest of all, for having had the chance \n     to serve with, and be inspired by him, between his two \n     trips.\n\n[[Page S6720]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/19/senate-section/article/S6719-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6719-S6720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                AN AUTHENTIC AMERICAN HERO IN OUR MIDST\n\n Mr. KERRY.

As he said, \n     when he announced that he would not seek re-election: Despite \n     all our problems--despite our sometimes inefficient \n     bureaucracies . . . or any of the other problems we love to \n     complain about, America--this grand experiment in democracy--\n     this ongoing work in progress--is still the greatest nation \n     in the history of the world and still a shining beacon of \n     hope and opportunity.\n       People who have been there say you see the world \n     differently from space. You see the ``big picture.'' You see \n     how small and interconnected our planet is. Perhaps it's \n     because he came to the Senate with that perspective that John \n     has fought so hard against nuclear proliferation. As a Wall \n     Street Journal reporter wrote recently, ``He has been the \n     Senate scold who lectured everybody who would listen, and \n     some who wouldn't, about the need to stop the spread of \n     nuclear arms.''\n       I don't know about that ``Senate scold'' part. But I do \n     know that America is lucky that John Glenn went up the first \n     time and gained that perspective. And the country is very \n     lucky that he is going up again. And those of us who are his \n     colleagues are the luckiest of all, for having had the chance \n     to serve with, and be inspired by him, between his two \n     trips.\n\n[[Page S6720]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/19/senate-section/article/S6719-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO SUSAN WOOD OF NEW HAMPSHIRE 1998 DISCOVER CARD STATE TRIBUTE \n                      AWARD SCHOLARSHIP RECIPIENT\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

She has performed with the Minnesota Orchestra and St. Paul \nChamber Orchestra and her performances have been aired on both \nMinnesota and National Public Radio. She is a recipient of the \nprestigious McKnight Artist Fellowship award with violinist Leslie \nShank. This award will allow the two performers to record the Bartok \nSonatas for violin and piano and showcase their talents to a national \naudience.\n  Mr. Johnston is the founder of the Minneapolis Guitar Quartet (MGC) \nwhich is nationally recognized for its excellence. The MGC has \nperformed throughout the United States and on the nationally syndicated \nradio program St. Paul Sunday Morning. In addition, they have also \nrepresented the United States abroad, performing in South America and \nSpain.\n  On June 4, these two outstanding performers were invited to showcase \ntheir talents here in our nation's capital at the Kennedy Center for \nthe Performing Arts. Through this performance the people of Washington \nbenefitted from the talent that we in Minnesota have already been \nexposed to.\n  MacLaughlin and Johnston carry on the tradition of great performers \nwho share their knowledge with others so that they, too, may realize \ntheir potential. Both are teachers at the MacPhail Center for the Arts \nin Minneapolis. The MacPhail Center was founded by Minneapolis Symphony \nmember William S. MacPhail in 1907. It has grown out of its humble \nbeginnings of four teachers and 82 students into the second largest \ncommunity music school in the country. Its 125 instructors teach in \nover 40 instrument areas, and the school has exceptional programs in \nEarly Childhood Arts and in Suzuki Talent Education.\n  We in Minnesota are proud of our strong arts community and of the \ntradition that the Twin Cities area is developing as a center for \nartistic and cultural expression. The MacPhail Center has made an \nenormous contribution to the study and enjoyment of music in our \ncommunity. I am pleased to congratulate the MacPhail Center as well as \nHeather MacLaughlin and Alan Johnston.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/19/senate-section/article/S6720-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO SARA D.

Mr. President, I would like to pause for a \nmoment to recognize the achievements of the great state of West \nVirginia, a land of rugged beauty, vast natural and mineral resources, \nand a hard-working citizenry. The people of West Virginia celebrate \nthese qualities every day, but today is a special occasion when we \ncelebrate West Virginia's 135th anniversary. It was June 20, 1863 when \nWest Virginia rose from the pain of a house divided and took its place \nas the nation's 35th state.\n  The patriotism and commitment to freedom that led West Virginia to \nsplit from Virginia in this country's darkest hour have defined the \nstate's history since then. West Virginia was the first state to \ninstitute Rural Free Delivery of mail, and its miners led the way in \nthe progressive labor movements of the early 1900's. A leading producer \nof coal and steel, West Virginia and its people were essential to this \nnation's wartime economy.\n  West Virginia's economy continues to expand into the 21st Century. \nThe state is now on track to become a major producer of everything from \nautomobile engines to aircraft to telemarketing services. In addition, \nmore tourists than ever flock to West Virginia's mountains and valleys \nfor their scenic beauty, recreation opportunities, and friendly folk. \nWest Virginia offers skiing in the winter, blazing colors in the fall, \nhiking and water sports\n\n[[Page S6721]]\n\nin the spring and summer, and treasures like historic Harpers Ferry \nyear-round.\n  I am proud to represent West Virginia in this distinguished body. I \nhope my colleagues will join me in celebrating West Virginia's 135th \nyear in the Union, and that they and their constituents can gain \ninspiration from West Virginia's motto, Mountaineers Are Always \nFree.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/19/senate-section/article/S6720-4", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO ANDREA L.

Mr. President, I voted in favor of this bill, the \nFY 1999 Energy/Water Appropriations bill. There is much to support in \nthe bill.\n  In particular, it provides essential resources to preserve and \nmaintain our nation's waterways, support safe and efficient cleanup of \nnuclear waste, and promote more constructive utilization of our energy \nresources. And while the bill increases spending for these items over \nlast year's level, the overall spending provided in this bill is more \nthan $350 million less than the amount requested by the Administration.\n  However, as elected officials, we bear no greater responsibility than \nto ensure that the American people's hard-earned tax dollars are \nutilized in the most prudent fashion for essential government functions \nand services. Open and fair consideration of federal expenditures is \nthe cornerstone of maintaining public confidence in their government.\n  I fully realize the daunting task faced by the Appropriations \nCommittee in allocating limited funds among diverse, competing \ninterests and priorities. Yet I am disappointed when the decisions on \npriorities reflect not national priorities, but parochial and political \npriorities.\n  As we begin the appropriations season with consideration of the FY \n1999 Energy/Water Appropriations bill, I am once again astounded at the \nvolume and creativity of the shortcuts that the Congress uses to \ncircumvent the normal, merit-based review of spending decisions.\n  This bill includes over $920 million for hundreds of earmarks in both \nbill and report language. These are earmarks for projects that are \nunrequested, unauthorized, and location-specific, and that have not \nbeen considered in the appropriate merit-based review process. It also \ncontains earmarks for vaguely stated projects for which only a cursory \nexplanation, or none at all, is provided to the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I prepared a list of objectionable provisions in this \nbill, which totalled 19 pages. This list is available on my website at \nhttp://www.senate.gov/mccain.\n  Let me take just a moment to bring to my colleagues' attention some \nof the most egregious provisions in this legislation:\n  An earmark of an additional $3.9 million for maintaining outdoor \nrecreation facilities at Ponce de Leon, Florida. It is somewhat hard to \nimagine what types of facilities in a single location require nearly $4 \nmillion in maintenance per year.\n  An earmark of $200,000 for feasibility studies along the Alabama \nRiver below the Claiborne Lock and Dam to determine measures necessary \nto improve the navigation channel in order for projects along the river \nto realize their full economic potential.\n  Certainly, it would be unfortunate if the businesses located along \nthis stretch of the Alabama River were hindered in any way from \neconomic success by virtue of the condition of the navigation channel. \nHowever, would it not be reasonable to expect those businesses and \nlocal communities to contribute at least to studying possible \nimprovements to enhance their operations?\n  An earmark of $8 million to initiate a general reevaluation report to \ndetermine the feasibility of further deepening the Miami Harbor Channel \nin Florida and providing reimbursement to local sponsors. Mind you, \nthis is not $8 million to deepen the channel--it is simply to study the \nfeasibility of deepening the channel. And this $8 million is not \nnecessarily the full amount that will be required to complete that \nstudy and, of course, to reimburse local sponsors of the project.\n  An earmark of an additional $5 million in the flood control account \nfor construction at the Louisiana State Penitentiary. Unfortunately, \nthe committee report sheds no light on what type of construction is \ninvolved, nor does it provide any justification for an increase of $5 \nmillion above a request of just $400,000.\n  An additional $2.3 million earmarked in a line item entitled \n``Project modification for improvement of the environment'' for the \nLower Hamm Creek, Washington, restoration project. This seems to be a \nstart-to-finish sort of add-on; the report language states this funding \nis to be used to ``complete plans and specifications, and initiate and \ncomplete construction'' of the project. Let's hope there is not another \nadd-on next year.\n  An earmarked add-on of $5 million for the Alaska Power \nAdministration, for which no funding was requested. This entity is in \nthe process of being sold to the State of Alaska, but this bill \nrequires the taxpayers to spend $5 million, in addition to the $2.5 \nmillion already spent, to repair or replace a cable prior to the sale.\n  And finally, with all due respect to my colleague from Alaska, the \nChairman of the Appropriations Committee, I must question the earmark \nof $20 million to establish a new commission, called the Denali \nCommission. This commission is established to prepare a comprehensive \nplan to spur Alaska's economic growth. I have several concerns about \nthis supposedly temporary commission. Why are all Americans required to \ncontribute to the preparation of this study, which will benefit only \nAlaska? Will this commission follow the same costly footsteps as the \nAppalachian Regional Commission, which\n\n[[Page S6722]]\n\nwas established as a temporary entity and, 30 years later, will receive \n$67 million more from taxpayers across America?\n  Mr. President, this is the kind of behind-the-scenes sidestepping of \nthe checks and balances on federal spending that continues to undermine \nthe public's trust in their elected officials. The practice of \nearmarking projects based on parochial, rather than national, interests \nis one of the principal reasons the public holds the Congress in low \nesteem.\n  Ironically, Mr. President, the Committee admonishes the \nAdministration for ``inappropriate uses of appropriations'' in its \nreport language. Yet, this bill endorses, in fact, mandates \ninappropriate spending to the tune of $920 million.\n  I had thought that we were making positive progress in eliminating \nwasteful and unnecessary spending from the legislative process. \nUnfortunately, the earmarks and set-asides in this bill greatly exceed \nthe level in last year's Energy/Water Appropriations bill. Last year, \nthe Senate earmarked $312 million in its version of the bill. This bill \nearmarks $920 million, which is nearly three times the amount of \nearmarks in last year's bill.\n  Mr. President, is it any wonder that Americans continue to express a \nsense of cynicism about government?\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and in \nboth Houses to work harder to curb our habit of funneling resources to \nprovincial ventures. Serving the public good must continue to be our \nmandate, and we can only live up to that charge by keeping the process \nfree of unfair and unnecessary spending that further burdens the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/19/senate-section/article/S6721-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n FIFTEENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CONGRESS-BUNDESTAG YOUTH EXCHANGE PROGRAM\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, it is my pleasure today to recall \nthat fifteen years ago, the U.S. Congress and the Bundestag of the \nFederal Republic of Germany resolved to establish and co-sponsor the \nCongress-Bundestag Youth Exchange Program (CBYX). This decision was in \nrecognition of the long-standing ties of friendship between the peoples \nof Germany and the United States, in particular the special sense of \npartnership that existed, and still exists, between our two \nlegislatures, and the importance of continuing to build and strengthen \nthat relationship.\n  Our common aim was to make a lasting and substantial contribution to \nthe peace of the world by making it possible for young people from our \ntwo countries, regardless of their means, to spend a school year \nabroad, learning about the other country's culture and way of life \nthrough extended first-hand experience. We recognized then, and we \nshould reaffirm now, that this kind and quality of people-to-people \nexchange is crucial to building and maintaining understanding between \nnations.\n  Since June of 1983, over 11,000 young people from Germany and the \nU.S. have participated in this exchange. Perhaps more importantly, \nGerman and American families have hosted these 11,000 participants, \ntaking them into their homes and communities, forming enduring \nfriendships, and nurturing their ability to see the world through \nanother's eyes. The earliest of these participants are mature adults \nnow, many of them assuming positions of leadership in their \ncommunities, their horizons forever broadened in their youth by their \nexperience in the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange.\n  Citizens like these are the foundation upon which the close \npartnership between Germany and the U.S. ultimately rests. As we look \nforward to even greater unity among the nations of a Europe that will \nsoon include countries once separated by the Iron Curtain and we \nrecognize the leading role that Germany plays in that process, the \nimportance of this partnership is abundantly clear. The success of the \nCBYX program over the past fifteen years forms one of the essential \nelements of this bond, and we should do whatever we can to ensure the \nprogram's future.\n  Threfore, on the occasion of the fifteenth anniversary of this \nremarkable program, I extend very special greetings on behalf of the \nUnited States Senate to our fellow legislators in the German Bundestag. \nI sincerely hope that the Congress-Bundestag Youth Exchange Program \ncontinues to strengthen the deep ties of friendship and understanding \nbetween our two peoples.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/19/senate-section/article/S6722-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6722]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO TOM A.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. Con. Res. 104 introduced earlier today by \nSenator Moseley-Braun.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Con. Res. 104) commemorating the 50th \n     anniversary of the Armed Forces.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I am honored today to offer a \nresolution that celebrates the 50 year anniversary of the integration \nof the U.S. Armed Forces. This resolution commemorates that historic \nday, July 28, 1948, when this country took a bold new step toward \nensuring that our Armed Services reflected the tenets of democracy that \nthis country stands for.\n  Dr. Martin Luther King once said that the Declaration of Independence \nwas a Declaration of Intent. By that he meant that the commitments of \nthat eternal document, when written, did not at the time apply to all \nAmericans, but only to some of them. Women are excluded altogether, \nnative Americans and poor had less rights than landowners, and blacks \nwere counted as three-fifths of a person. And yet, the vision and the \ntruth of the principles set forth in the Declaration and Constitution \nof this great country have been the bedrock foundation of the \npatriotism of all Americans over time, no matter their condition at the \ntime of its crafting, and no matter how difficult the struggle for \nequality and realization of that intent.\n  ``We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created \nequal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable \nRights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of \nHappiness.''\n  The rights so eloquently articulated in the Declaration defined in \nthe Constitution could only be established, and later defended, by a \nstrong military. Our armed forces, indeed all Americans, owe a debt of \ngratitude to President Truman, who fifty years ago strengthened our \nmilitary and our society by issuing Executive Order No. 9981 thereby \nintegrating the U.S. Armed Forces.\n  Americans of African descent were eager to defend the ideal and the \npromise of this noble experiment in self-government from the very \nbeginning. During the Revolutionary War, more than 5,000 free blacks \nfought to establish these United States of America. Rhode Island had a \nblack battalion, and African-American men and women served in units \nfrom the various states as laborers, spies, nurses, cavalry, and \ninfantrymen. During the Civil War, Harriet Tubman served as a union \nspy, a volunteer nurse, and a freedom fighter. So often was she in the \nfield, that some soldiers affectionately dubbed her ``General Tubman.''\n  In no military conflict were Americans of African descent unwilling \nto offer their very lives to the service of their country, no matter \nthe condition of their citizenship. My own grandfather served in the \nArmy in World War 1, and I have vague recollections of stories of the \nexperiences he had in France during that world-shaping cataclysm. He \nleft, and returned to an America of Jim Crow apartheid, but was proud \nto have done his part to preserve freedom. His service, and that of \nothers was founded on their sincere love of America, and their belief \nin its ideals. He believed in the Declaration of Intent, and was \nprepared to give his life in behalf of its promise.\n  Continuing that tradition, my father served in World War II. Up until \nWorld War II, enlistment of Americans of African descent had been \nlimited, but one year after Pearl Harbor, there were approximately \n400,000 African Americans in the Army. By the end of the war, there \nwere more than 150,000 in the Navy. In 1948, Harry Truman moved the \nDeclaration of Intent closer to reality when he integrated the armed \nforces. He made it possible for Americans of color to participate as \nAmericans in defense of the ideal liberty. By Executive Order 9981, he \nwas able to breath life into the promise of equality, and in so doing \ngave added honor to the valor and commitment of all Americans.\n  In all branches of the military service, the decision to end the \ndivisions\n\n[[Page S6724]]\n\nbased on color and race allowed this country to tap the talents of 100% \nof her people, and in so doing, expand and strengthened the pool of \ntalent in defense of the liberties of us all.\n  The audacity of Truman's decision and his vision, were controversial \nat the time, but the wisdom of it paved the way not only or a winning \nmilitary, but a nation's opportunity to live up to its promise. The \nvalor of many of those who served was overlooked or downplayed at the \ntime, as the nation undertook the slow adjustment to the change Truman \nencouraged. We are just now, after a Shaw University study and the \nreexamination of some of their contributions, acknowledging the role \nand heroism of some of those soldiers. Just last year, the President \nawarded medals of honor to seven black Americans for their valor in \nWorld War II.\n  Truman recognized the value of diversity. It lay not only in the \nsingular talent and contributions of some, but in the collective vigor \nof the whole. Our great nation has been forged by the sacrifice of \nAmericans of every stripe, by the values which define us as one people. \nThe military services have led the country in providing opportunities \nfor excellence, and the defense of our country has benefitted from that \nleadership. Excellence and honor, valor and patriotism are values which \nbring us together as Americans, and shape our national character. \nTruman's decision made us a ``More Perfect Nation'' and continues to \nthis day to be a shinning example of leadership.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in sponsoring this resolution, and in \ndoing so celebrating the diversity of our nation's Armed Forces.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution and preamble \nbe agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand any statements relating to the concurrent resolution be printed in \nthe Record at the appropriate place as if read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Con. Res. 104), with its preamble, reads as \nfollows:\n       Whereas 50 years ago on July 28, 1948, President Truman \n     issued Executive Order No. 9981 that stated that it is \n     essential that there be maintained in the Armed Services of \n     the United States the highest standards of democracy, with \n     equality of treatment and opportunity for all those who serve \n     in our country's defense;\n       Whereas President Truman declared that there shall be \n     equality of treatment and opportunity for all persons in the \n     Armed Services without regard to race, color, religion, or \n     national origin;\n       Whereas soon after the Executive order was issued American \n     soldiers fighting in Korea led the way to a fully integrated \n     Army;\n       Whereas after the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of \n     1964, the Armed Forces resolved to implement the legislation \n     as a new opportunity to provide all members of the Armed \n     Forces with freedom from discrimination within and outside \n     its military communities;\n       Whereas the efforts of the Armed Forces to ensure the \n     equality of treatment and opportunity for its members \n     contributed significantly to the advancement of that goal for \n     all Americans;\n       Whereas minorities serve today in senior leadership \n     positions throughout the Armed Forces, as officers, senior \n     non-commissioned officers, and civilian leaders; and\n       Whereas the Armed Forces have demonstrated a total and \n     continuing commitment to ensuring the equality of treatment \n     and opportunity for all persons in the Total Force, both \n     military and civilian: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) commends the United States Armed Forces for its \n     efforts, leadership, and success in providing equality of \n     treatment and opportunity; and\n       (2) recognizes the commemoration by the Department of \n     Defense on July 24, 1998, of the 50th anniversary of the \n     integration of the Armed Forces.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/19/senate-section/article/S6723-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6724-S6730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NAZI WAR CRIMES DISCLOSURE ACT\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

REQUIREMENT OF DISCLOSURE OF RECORDS REGARDING \n                   PERSONS WHO COMMITTED NAZI WAR CRIMES.\n\n       (a) Nazi War Criminal Records.--For purposes of this Act, \n     the term ``Nazi war criminal records'' means classified \n     records or portions of records that--\n       (1) pertain to any person with respect to whom the United \n     States Government, in its sole discretion, has grounds to \n     believe ordered, incited, assisted, or otherwise participated \n     in the persecution of any person because of race, religion, \n     national origin, or political opinion, during the period \n     beginning on March 23, 1933, and ending on May 8, 1945, under \n     the direction of, or in association with--\n       (A) the Nazi government of Germany;\n       (B) any government in any area occupied by the military \n     forces of the Nazi government of Germany;\n       (C) any government established with the assistance or \n     cooperation of the Nazi government of Germany; or\n       (D) any government which was an ally of the Nazi government \n     of Germany; or\n       (2) pertain to any transaction as to which the United \n     States Government, in its sole discretion, has grounds to \n     believe--\n       (A) involved assets taken from persecuted persons during \n     the period beginning on March 23, 1933, and ending on May 8, \n     1945, by, under the direction of, on behalf of, or under \n     authority granted by the Nazi government of Germany or any \n     nation then allied with that government; and\n       (B) such transaction was completed without the assent of \n     the owners of those assets or their heirs or assigns or other \n     legitimate representatives.\n       (b) Release of Records.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to paragraphs (2), (3), and (4), \n     the Nazi War Criminal Records Interagency Working Group shall \n     release in their entirety Nazi war criminal records that are \n     described in subsection (a).\n       (2) Exception for privacy, etc.--An agency head may exempt \n     from release under paragraph (1) specific information, that \n     would--\n       (A) constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal \n     privacy;\n       (B) reveal the identity of a confidential human source, or \n     reveal information about the application of an intelligence \n     source or method, or reveal the identity of a human \n     intelligence source when the unauthorized disclosure of that \n     source would clearly and demonstrably damage the national \n     security interests of the United States;\n       (C) reveal information that would assist in the development \n     or use of weapons of mass destruction;\n       (D) reveal information that would impair United States \n     cryptologic systems or activities;\n       (E) reveal information that would impair the application of \n     state-of-the-art technology within a United States weapon \n     system;\n       (F) reveal actual United States military war plans that \n     remain in effect;\n\n[[Page S6726]]\n\n       (G) reveal information that would seriously and \n     demonstrably impair relations between the United States and a \n     foreign government, or seriously and demonstrably undermine \n     ongoing diplomatic activities of the United States;\n       (H) reveal information that would clearly and demonstrably \n     impair the current ability of United States Government \n     officials to protect the President, Vice President, and other \n     officials for whom protection services, in the interest of \n     national security, are authorized;\n       (I) reveal information that would seriously and \n     demonstrably impair current national security emergency \n     preparedness plans; or\n       (J) violate a treaty or international agreement.\n       (3) Application of exemptions.--\n       (A) In general.--In applying the exemptions listed in \n     subparagraphs (B) through (J) of paragraph (2), there shall \n     be a presumption that the public interest in the release of \n     Nazi war criminal records will be served by disclosure and \n     release of the records. Assertion of such exemption may only \n     be made when the agency head determines that disclosure and \n     release would be harmful to a specific interest identified in \n     the exemption. An agency head who makes such a determination \n     shall promptly report it to the committees of Congress with \n     appropriate jurisdiction, including the Committee on the \n     Judiciary of the Senate and the Committee on Government \n     Reform and Oversight of the House of Representatives. The \n     exemptions set forth in paragraph (2) shall constitute the \n     only authority pursuant to which an agency head may exempt \n     records otherwise subject to release under paragraph (1).\n       (B) Application of title 5.--A determination by an agency \n     head to apply an exemption listed in subparagraphs (B) \n     through (I) of paragraph (2) shall be subject to the same \n     standard of review that applies in the case of records \n     withheld under section 552(b)(1) of title 5, United States \n     Code.\n       (4) Limitation on application.--This subsection shall not \n     apply to records--\n       (A) related to or supporting any active or inactive \n     investigation, inquiry, or prosecution by the Office of \n     Special Investigations of the Department of Justice; or\n       (B) solely in the possession, custody, or control of that \n     office.\n       (c) Inapplicability of National Security Act of 1947 \n     Exemption.--Section 701(a) of the National Security Act of \n     1947 (50 U.S.C. 431) shall not apply to any operational file, \n     or any portion of any operational file, that constitutes a \n     Nazi war criminal record under section 3 of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 4. EXPEDITED PROCESSING OF FOIA REQUESTS FOR NAZI WAR \n                   CRIMINAL RECORDS.\n\n       (a) Expedited Processing.--For purposes of expedited \n     processing under section 552(a)(6)(E) of title 5, United \n     States Code, any requester of a Nazi war criminal record \n     shall be deemed to have a compelling need for such record.\n       (b) Requester.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     ``requester'' means any person who was persecuted in the \n     manner described under section 3(a)(1) of this Act who \n     requests a Nazi war criminal record.\n\n     SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act and the amendments made by this Act shall take \n     effect on the date that is 90 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate is about \nto pass S. 1379, the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act. I introduced this \nlegislation along with my friend from New York, Senator Moynihan, and \nfifteen of my colleagues on November 5 of last year. Our Judiciary \nCommittee Chairman, Senator Hatch, and the Ranking Member, Senator \nLeahy, strongly support this bill. Indeed, I want to thank Senator \nLeahy and his staff for their tireless work in helping to bring this \nlegislation to the floor. As an authority on the Freedom of Information \nAct, or ``FOIA'' (pronounced FOYA), Senator Leahy has made very useful \nsuggestions that I have incorporated into the substitute. These changes \nsatisfy privacy concerns raised by FOIA and Privacy Act professionals. \nFinally, I want to underscore that we would not be here today without \nSenator Moynihan and his staff. He has brought to our work the unique \ninsights on the classification system that he gained as chairman of the \nCommission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy \nClassification.\n  The Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act represents what I hope will be the \nculmination of work begun in the last Congress to release U.S. \ngovernment-held records of Nazi war criminals, the Nazi Holocaust and \nthe trafficking of Nazi-held assets.\n  Just two years ago, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the end of \nthe Second World War, and with it, the end of the Nazis' death grip on \nan entire continent. Since that time, searingly detailed accounts of \nthe Nazi Holocaust have provided more and more evidence of the true \nmagnitude of the atrocities that were committed.\n  We have learned so much. Yet, if the last few years are any \nindication, we still have a great deal more to learn.\n  After the fall of communist rule, Russia and several former Soviet-\nbloc nations opened volumes of secret files on Nazi war crimes. \nArgentina has cooperated in the public release of its files. British \ngovernment records are being declassified and made available for public \nscrutiny. And over the course of last year, Swiss banks and the Swiss \ngovernment have been under intense international pressure to make a \nfull accounting of unclaimed funds belonging to Holocaust victims, as \nwell as Nazi assets that may have once belonged to Holocaust victims.\n  Mr. President, here at home, our own government has been gradually \nmaking records available about what it knew of Nazi-related activities \nand atrocities. Last year, a government-conducted study revealed new \ninformation about what the U.S. Government knew regarding the transfer \nand flow of funds held by Nazi officials. This report found that the \nU.S. government was aware that the Nazi mint took gold stolen from \nEuropean central banks and melted it together with gold obtained in \nhorrible fashion--gold obtained from tooth-fillings, wedding bands and \nother items seized from death-camp victims.\n  Mr. Chairman, the photos I have on display are several aerial U.S. \nintelligence photographs taken in 1944 of Auschwitz, with prisoners \nbeing led to the gas chambers. These pictures were discovered by photo \nanalysts from the Central Intelligence Agency in 1978. They confirm \nwhat we had heard from the Polish underground that a ``death camp'' did \nin fact exist at Auschwitz. They also demonstrated that our government \nhad photographs of these camps as these atrocities were occurring.\n  These pictures tell a grisly story. How many more such pictures or \ndocuments exist? With the legislation before us, we intend to answer \nthat question.\n  Both Congress and the President have taken action to promote the \nrelease of government-held records during this tragic era. On April 17, \n1995, the President issued an executive order calling for the release \nof national security data and information older than 25 years. Late in \nthe 104th Congress, thanks to the tireless efforts of my friend from \nNew York, Senator Moynihan, and Representative Carolyn Maloney and \nseveral others, we passed a sense of the Congress resolution, which \nstated that all U.S. Government agencies should make public any records \nin its possession about individuals who are alleged to have committed \nNazi war crimes. The President agreed, noting that learning the \nremaining secrets about the Holocaust is clearly in the public \ninterest.\n  The Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act is designed to put the concerns \nexpressed by the last Congress into strong action. First, the bill \nwould allow for expedited processing of FOIA requests of survivors of \nNazi persecution. These individuals are growing older every day, and \nthe time remaining for them to obtain answers to the questions that \nhave troubled them for five decades will soon come to an end. We owe it \nto those who suffered--and to those who seek to prevent future \ngenocides--to disclose fully and completely all the records in the \nUnited States on this issue.\n  Second, the bill would establish the Nazi War Criminal Records \nInteragency Working Group. This Working Group would to the greatest \nextent possible locate, identify, inventory, declassify and make \navailable for the public all Nazi war records held by the United \nStates. This means that all materials would be required to be released \nin their entirety unless a Federal agency head concludes that the \nrelease of all or part of these records would compromise privacy or \nnational security interests. The agency head must notify Congress of \nany determination to not release records. Thus, we in the Senate would \nbe in a position to review the material being withheld to ensure that \nit was being done for valid reasons consistent with this legislation.\n  The Director of the Holocaust Museum, the Archivist of the United \nStates, and the Historian of the Department of State are specifically \nappointed to sit on the task force because of their unique expertise on \nthis subject. Further, to help the interagency\n\n[[Page S6727]]\n\ngroup complete its task, the President is authorized to appoint the \nhead of any other Agency and up to three additional people with \nexpertise on this subject who can assist with the identification and \ndisclosure of relevant documents.\n  This pro-active search is necessary, because a full government search \nand inventory has never been completed. For example, some documents \nthat surfaced this spring were found among materials related to \nSoutheast Asia.\n  Our bill is targeted toward two classes of Nazi-related materials: \nFirst, war crimes information regarding Nazi persecutions; and two, any \ninformation related to transactions involving assets of Holocaust and \nother Nazi victims.\n  In summary, what we are trying to do with this bill is strike a clear \nbalance among our government's legitimate national security interests, \nthe legitimate privacy interests of individuals, and the people's \ndesire to know the truth about Nazi atrocities. These records, once \nreleased, will be held in a repository at the National Archives.\n  Let me enumerate several changes which we have made since the bill \nwas unanimously reported out by the full Judiciary Committee last \nMarch:\n  Section 3(b)3(B) was revised to make clear that the standard of \njudicial deference currently accorded to agency classification \ndecisions under exemption (b)(1) of the FOIA applies to exemption \ndecisions rendered by Heads of Agency's making a withholding decision \nunder Section 3(b). As the Committee of Conference recognized when \nexemption (b)(1) was amended in 1974, executive departments responsible \nfor national defense and foreign policy matters have unique insights \ninto what possible adverse effects might occur as a result of public \ndisclosure of a particular classified record. Accordingly, it is \nexpected that federal courts, in reviewing a decision by an Agency head \nthat disclosure and release of a Nazi War Record would be harmful to a \nspecific interest identified in an exemption herein, will accord \nsubstantial weight to an agency's affidavit or other submission \nconcerning the record in question.\n\n  Records held by the Office of Special Investigations (OSI) of the \nDepartment of Justice are specifically exempted. Nonetheless, because \nof the substantial expertise at OSI, it can reasonably be expected that \nOSI will be asked to assist with the review of records held by other \nagencies. OSI is currently engaged in an effort to close ongoing \ninvestigations and prosecutions of alleged war criminals. Thus, to \nensure that the high priority investigations continue and all relevant \ndocuments found during the search are quickly reviewed for \ndeclassification, my colleagues and I have asked the Appropriations \nCommittee to provide a small increase of $2 million in OSI's budget to \nenable the staff to take on and complete both of these tasks.\n  Section 2(b)(1) has been revised to extend the life of the \ninteragency group from one to three years in recognition of the fact \nthat there are extensive document holdings that must be reviewed. The \nbulk of this work should be done in the first year. The three year life \nof the Working Group cannot become an excuse to proceed slowly.\n  This bill not only addresses the acts of Nazi War Criminals, but also \naddresses those who transferred, sold or otherwise disposed of assets \ninvoluntarily taken from persecuted persons by, under the direction of, \nor on behalf of, or under the authority of the former Nazi Government \nof Germany or any nation then allied with that government.\n  This bill is a bipartisan effort to ensure the Federal Government has \ndone all it can to ensure Holocaust victims and their families can \nobtain the answers they need.\n  The clock is running, and time is running out for so many victims of \nthe Holocaust. They, and history itself, deserve to know as much as \npossible about this tragic chapter in the story of humanity.\n  I thank my colleagues for their strong support for this legislation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of S. 1379, the \nNazi War Crimes Disclosure Act, I am very pleased that the Senate is \nabout to pass this important piece of legislation. I congratulate \nSenator DeWine and Senator Leahy for their bipartisan effort in \ndrafting a bill which addresses the legitimate concerns of federal \nagencies which will be subject to this legislation, while at the same \ntime ensuring that the original intent and purpose of the law is \ncarried out. Passage of the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act will \nfacilitate the speedy gathering and release of documents in the \npossession of the government which relate to the persecution of, and \ntheft of assets from, the many millions of victims of Nazi atrocities.\n  Our government has an obligation to locate, and make public, \ndocuments in the government's possession which shed light on Nazi war \ncriminals, their nefarious allies, and their crimes. Over the fifty-\nthree years since the defeat of Germany and its cohorts, and the \ndiscovery of the atrocities committed in the name of Naziism, we have \nlearned a great deal about the organization, operation, and financial \nstructure of that regime. However, recent revelations concerning the \nacts of certain Swiss banks in the laundering of Holocaust victims' \nassets show us how much more there is to learn.\n  By passing this bill, we are providing a means of access to \ninformation that will be of invaluable assistance in providing answers \nto those seeking to learn about the past. But just as importantly, by \nstudying that information and learning the lessons of history, we can \nhelp ensure that such actions will never be repeated in the future.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today the Senate takes an important step \nin the search to unfold the events of the holocaust by adopting the \nNazi War Crimes Disclosure Act. This bill requires the disclosure of \nclassified information, currently held by the United States government, \nregarding individuals who participated in Nazi war crimes, and stolen \nassets of the victims of Nazi war crimes. The bill also requires a \ngovernment-wide search of records to ensure the release of as many \nrelevant documents as possible.\n  Researchers seeking information on Nazi war criminals and the assets \nof their victims will have unprecedented access to relevant materials \nin the possession of the United States government, which until now have \nremained classified. It is my view that these documents have been held \nfar too long. Well beyond the time when their disclosure might have \nposed a threat to national security--if indeed such disclosure ever \ndid.\n  While reviewing relevant material for declassification, officials \nwill be required to maintain a strong presumption that relevant \nmaterial should be declassified. This is based on the ``balancing \ntest'' included in the bill which presumes that the public interest in \nthe release of Holocaust records outweighs the damage to national \nsecurity that might reasonably be expected to result from disclosure. \nThis provision is in keeping with the Report of the Commission on \nProtecting and Reducing Government Secrecy which recommended that such \na balancing test be applied in all classification decisions.\n  With the passing of time it becomes ever more important to document \nNazi war crimes, lest the enormity of those crimes be lost to history. \nThe greater access which this legislation provides will add clarity to \nthis subject. I applaud those researchers who continue to pursue this \nimportant work. Those who suffered from the Holocaust are reaching the \nend of their life-span. We owe it to them to make available as much \ninformation about that terrible period as possible. This is our solemn \ntask.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is passing \nthis important legislation, the ``Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act,'' S. \n1379. Last year, Congress passed a resolution calling upon federal \nagencies to make public any records in their possession about \nindividuals who are alleged to have committed Nazi war crimes. I agree \nwith the original sponsors of this bill, Senators Moynihan, DeWine, \nKohl, D'Amato, Dodd and Hatch, who said in a Dear Colleague letter in \nOctober, 1997, that this bill ``would put last year's words into \naction.''\n  The substitute amendment we consider today requires creation of an \ninteragency working group to collect and release classified Nazi war \ncrime records within one year, and gives Nazi war crime victims \nexpedited access to these records under the Freedom of Information Act \n(FOIA). These victims\n\n[[Page S6728]]\n\nare growing older and we should ensure that if they are interested in \nseeing these records, their requests should be honored as speedily as \npossible.\n  I first became aware of this bill when I testified in June 1996 at a \nhearing before the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee \n(GRO). That hearing focused on my Electronic FOIA amendments, which \nwere enacted later that year, and the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act, \nH.R. 1281, which had been introduced by that Committee's Ranking \nMember, Representative Carolyn Maloney.\n  Moving oral testimony and written statements were presented at that \nhearing about the need for full disclosure by federal agencies about \nwhat our government knew, and when, about Nazi atrocities and the \ncriminals who committed those atrocities. Rabbi Marvin Hier (the Dean \nand Founder of the Simon Wiesenthal Center), the Jewish Community \nRelations Council, the Anti-Defamation League, the Orthodox Union, the \nAmerican Jewish Committee, and others, committed to teaching the \nlessons of the Holocaust expressed their strong support for full \ndisclosure of Nazi war crime records. War Crimes Disclosure Act, Health \nInformation Privacy Protection Act, and S. 1090, Electronic Freedom of \nInformation Improvement Act of 1995: Hearing on H.R. 1281 and S. 1090 \nbefore the Subcomm. on Government Management, Information, and \nTechnology of the House Comm. on Government Reform and Oversight, 104th \nCong., 2d Sess. 17-30 (1996).\n  To the extent that records pertaining to Nazi war criminals remain \nclassified over fifty years since the end of the war, we should take \naction to disclose those records. No Nazi war criminal should be \nprotected by government secrecy rules. This is what happened with \ngovernment records pertaining to Kurt Waldheim: the Central \nIntelligence Agency withheld critical information from researchers \nabout Waldheim's collaboration with the Nazis, even as other government \nagencies were placing him on the list of individuals forbidden to enter \nour country because of suspected war crimes. Moreover, an extensive \nJustice Department report on Waldheim completed in 1987 was then kept \nsecret for six long years, before Attorney General Reno, in response to \na FOIA lawsuit, released the document in 1994. The United States \ngovernment should not help Nazi war criminals keep their past crimes \nsecret. This bill is an important step to ensure our government does \nnot.\n\n  Senator DeWine and I worked closely on a substitute amendment to this \nbill that was offered in the Judiciary Committee and favorably reported \non March 5, 1998, with the unanimous backing of Committee Members. \nFurther refinements to the bill are reflected in the Manager's \namendment considered by the Senate today to address the legitimate \nconcerns raised by the Department of Justice, our intelligence \nagencies, press associations and others who use the FOIA regularly, as \nwell as those who have a personal stake and interest in full disclosure \nof Nazi War crime records.\n  The bill calls for the Nazi War Criminal Records Interagency Working \nGroup to be created by the President shortly after enactment and \nauthorizes this Group to operate for three years. The Working Group \nwill include as members the Director of the Holocaust Museum, the \nHistorian of the Department of State, the Archivist of the United \nStates, and heads of agencies selected by the President. In addition, \nthe President may select from the private sector up to three other \npersons whom he considers appropriate to assist in completely and \neffectively carrying out the functions of the Interagency Group.\n  The Interagency Group is tasked under the bill with locating, \nidentifying, inventorying, recommending for declassification and making \navailable to the public at the National Archives and Records \nAdministration all classified Nazi War criminal records in the \npossession of federal agencies, and submit to Congress, including to \nthe Senate Committee on the Judiciary and the House Committee on GRO, a \nreport describing its activities. While the bill requires that these \ntasks be completed within one year, the Interagency Group is authorized \nfor a full three years in the event that certain of these tasks require \nadditional time. The bill also authorizes the appropriation of any \nnecessary funds.\n  The original Senate bill defined the records of suspected Nazis \nsubject to disclosure so broadly that it could conceivably have covered \nmany irrelevant records, such as social security records, medical \nrecords or tax records, even though such records may have had nothing \nto do with the person's possible activities as a Nazi. This raised \ncertain privacy issues as well as concerns about the burden on federal \nagencies to collect, review and disclose records, which had no bearing \non the person's activities as a Nazi or our government's knowledge of \nthat person's war crimes.\n  The Manager's amendment addresses these concerns by limiting the \nrecords subject to disclosure to classified Nazi war criminal records \nand retaining an exemption for those records, or parts thereof, that \nwould ``constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal \nprivacy.''\n  The bill now defines ``Nazi war criminal records'' as those \nclassified records or portions of records pertaining to persons who, \nfrom March 23, 1933 through May 8, 1945, under the direction or in \nassociation with the Nazis ordered, incited, assisted or otherwise \nparticipated in the persecution of any person on account of their race, \nreligion, national origin or political opinion, as well as to any \ntransaction involving the assets of those persecuted persons when \nthe transaction involved assets taken without their consent or the \nconsent of their heirs. Determination of the classified records that \nfall within the scope of the bill is given to the ``sole discretion'' \nof the agencies in possession of the records.\n\n  The original bill would have amended the FOIA with a new section of \nNazi war crime records containing ten newly-created exemptions separate \nfrom those under the current FOIA. I have spent many years fighting for \nmore openness in government. I was very concerned that creating these \nnew exemptions might set a dangerous precedent--though entirely \nunintentional on the part of the original sponsors--of expanding FOIA \nexemptions. At a minimum, these new exemptions would have created \nconfusion about how the current FOIA exemptions were to be interpreted \nand applied. These concerns about the new exemptions have been resolved \nby taking the work of the Interagency Group out of the FOIA and making \nits activities the subject of a free standing law.\n  The Interagency Group is required to release the classified Nazi war \ncriminal records covered by the bill in their entirety, subject to ten \nenumerated exemptions. The first exemption in section 3(b)(2)(A) of the \nbill is for records or parts thereof that ``constitute a clearly \nunwarranted invasion of personal privacy.'' This is the same standard \nused in the sixth exemption of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA, 5 \nU.S.C. 552(b)(6)). In the FOIA context, the phrase enunciates a policy \nof a balancing of interests between the protection of an individual's \nprivate affairs from unnecessary public scrutiny, and the preservation \nof the public's right to government records. Committee reports \nunderlying the original FOIA of 1966 indicate that the exemption is to \nprotect ``intimate'' or ``personal'' details in files such as those \nmaintained by the Veterans Administration (now the Department of \nVeterans Affairs), the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare \n(now the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of \nEducation), and the Selective Service System. As with the other FOIA \nexemptions, the personal privacy exception in the FOIA is permissively \napplied, and it has come to be understood that the balancing of \ninterests tilts in favor of disclosure.\n  Transferring the FOIA experience to the use of the same phrase in \nexemption (A) of the Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act, it is the intent \nthat the same balancing of interests--between the protection of an \nindividual's private affairs from unnecessary public scrutiny and the \npreservation of the public's right to government records--occur when \nthe disclosure of Nazi war criminal records is under consideration. The \nexemption may be used to protect intimate or personal details, such as \nan individual's medical history, marital status, legitimacy of \nchildren, family fights or domestic affairs, and sexual inclination or \nassociations. While the\n\n[[Page S6729]]\n\nright to privacy of deceased persons is not entirely settled, we expect \nthe Department of Justice and other agencies to follow the majority \nrule that death extinguishes a person's privacy rights. Indeed, I note \nthat ``[t]he Department of Justice has long followed this rule as a \nmatter of policy.'' U.S. Dep't of Justice, Freedom of Information Act \nGuide & Privacy Act Overview, September 1997.\n  Thus, the personal privacy exemption in the bill is to be \npermissively applied, and the balancing of interests tilts in favor of \ndisclosure.\n  Likewise, the balancing of the other Nazi War Crimes Disclosure Act \nexemptions tilts in favor of disclosure. Section 3(b)(3)(A) of the bill \nstates that, in applying exemptions (B) through (J), ``there shall be a \npresumption that the public interest in the release of Nazi war \ncriminal records will be served by disclosure and release of the \nrecords.'' The bill conditions exercise of all the exemptions, \nincluding the privacy exemption in section 3(b)(2)(A), by an agency \nhead on a determination that the disclosure and release would be \nharmful to a specific interest identified in the exemption. To \nfacilitate oversight of this legislation, an agency head who makes this \ndetermination is required to report the application of the exemption \npromptly to the appropriate Committees of the Congress, including the \nSenate Committee on the Judiciary and the House Committee on GRO.\n\n  The original bill contained a presumption that public disclosure of \nthe Nazi war crime records outweighs national security interests. The \nDepartment of Justice questioned whether this provision, and others, \nraised separation of powers concerns by encroaching on the Presidential \nprerogative to decide what records and information should be classified \nto protect national security. The presumption was modified during \nCommittee consideration of the bill simply to make clear that the \npublic interest would be served by disclosure and release of the \nsubject records.\n  The bill does not provide a blanket exemption for classified \nmaterial, but instead lists a number of particular national security \nconcerns that could warrant nondisclosure. The Justice Department may \ncontinue to have constitutional separation of powers concerns that the \nbill substitutes congressional rules for the President's executive \norder on the classification of documents. This would be unfortunate and \nunjustified.\n  The 1997 Report of the Commission on Protecting and Reducing \nGovernment Secrecy Classification (hereafter, the ``1997 Report''), at \npage 15, notes that the security classification system is ``an area in \nwhich the President and the Congress `may have concurrent authority, or \nin which its distribution is uncertain,'' citing Youngstown Sheet & \nTube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 637 (1952). Moreover, Congress has \nprescribed standards to govern elements of classification and \ndeclassification in other contexts, including the Atomic Energy Act of \n1954, the National Security Act of 1947, and the Assassination Records \nCollection Act of 1992, which the 1997 Report explains ``established \nbroad standards for the declassification of records concerning the \nassassination of President Kennedy.''\n  ``The classification . . . systems are no longer trusted by many \ninside and outside the Government.'' 1997 Report, at page XXI. This is \nparticularly true with respect to classified Nazi war crimes records \nsince, at least in the case of Kurt Waldheim, government secrecy rules \nwere used to shield what our government knew about his Nazi \ncollaboration from public view for too many years. I agree with the \ncomment in the 1997 Report that ``by allowing for a fuller \nunderstanding of the past, [greater openness] provides opportunities to \nlearn lessons from what has gone before--making it easier to resolve \nissues concerning the Government's past actions and helping prepare for \nthe future.''\n  The bill makes clear, in section 3(b)(3)(A), that the enumerated \nexemptions shall constitute the only authority whereby an agency head \nmay exempt records subject to this Act from release. This provision \nclarifies legislative intent that, in the case of Nazi war criminal \nrecords only, no other protective authority is controlling except the \nenumerated exemptions. Thus, the exemptions in section 3(b)(2) take \nprecedence over the protective provisions of statutes such as the \nPrivacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a), the National Security Act of 1947 (50 \nU.S.C. 403-3(c)(6)), and the Central Intelligence Agency Act (50 U.S.C. \n403g). Indeed, section 3(c) of the bill, expressly waives the \noperational file exemption contained in section 701 of the National \nSecurity Act of 1947. The amendment also eliminates the application of \nthe exemptions of the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)-\n(9)); it also overrides the privacy protections of all other statues, \nin favor of the privacy exemption set forth in section 3(b)(2)(A). \nThese waivers of other statutory protections and, most particularly \nthose waivers of the National Security Act provisions, recognize the \nextraordinary and unique nature of the Nazi war criminal records. These \nrecords warrant this special treatment so that the United States may \nlead and fully participate in the growing international movement to \nopen to public scrutiny official records on the conduct of particular \ngovernments and institutions during World War II.\n\n  In addition to the enumerated exemptions, the bill exempts from \ndisclosure the records of the Office of Special Investigations (OSI) of \nthe Department of Justice, which continues to investigate, prosecute \nand extradite suspected Nazi war criminals. Concerns about the impact \nof this bill on the work of OSI were raised by the Department of \nJustice, and others, at the original House hearing on this bill in \n1996. This bill addresses those concerns and will do nothing to \nundermine the critical work of this section. Moreover, Senators DeWine \nand I, and others, have requested that funding for OSI be increased to \nensure adequate personnel are available to handle any increased \nworkload due to the passage of this legislation.\n  While the number of arrests of suspected Nazi war criminals may be \ndwindling, some are still on the loose, as we so dramatically witnessed \nby the arrest in Germany just a few short months ago, in March 1998, of \na man identified in news reports as Alfons Goetzfried. This suspected \nNazi war criminal was a former low-ranking Gestapo officer who \napparently acknowledged in prior statements personally shooting to \ndeath 500 people, including women and children, at a death camp in \nPoland in November 1943. The work of the OSI continues to be of vital \nimportance.\n  Judicial review of agency determinations to apply the exemptions and \nthe operations of the Interagency Group will be available under the \nAdministrative Procedure Act. We appreciate, however, that executive \nagencies responsible for national defense and foreign policy matters \nhave unique insights into the adverse effects that might occur as a \nresult of the inappropriate public disclosure of a particular \nclassified record. Accordingly, we expect that federal courts, in \nreviewing determinations by agency heads that disclosure and release of \na record covered by this bill would be harmful to a specific interest \nidentified in an exemption, will accord substantial weight to the \nagency's affidavit or other submission concerning the status of the \ndisputed record. Indeed, the bill makes this expectation explicit in \nsection 3(b)(3)(B), which states that in applying the exemptions in \nparagraphs (3)(b)(2)(B) through (I) dealing with specific national \ndefense and foreign policy information, the standard of review is the \nsame as applied to the withholding of records under the FOIA for \nproperly classified matters.\n  Finally, section 4 of the bill provides for the expedited processing \nof FOIA requests for Nazi war criminal records by any Holocaust \nvictims, as provided in section 552(a)(6)(E) of title 5, United States \nCode. We expect that any withholding of requested records due to their \nclassified nature, under section (b)(1) of the FOIA, will be highly \nlimited once the Working Group has been able to perform its work.\n  It has been a pleasure to work with Senator DeWine on this matter in \nthe Judiciary Committee, and with Senator Moynihan and others on \nreaching a consensus on this important bill. This legislation is long \noverdue, and I urge its prompt enactment.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent the amendment be agreed to, the \nbill be considered read a third time and\n\n[[Page S6730]]\n\npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements relating to the bill appear in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I had not intended to come to the floor to \nmake a few comments today until I read a story about a press conference \nthat was held in the Senate here yesterday by some Senators about farm \npolicy. A group of Senators held a press conference on farm policy of \nthis country and said, ``We've got a good, solid farm policy. The \nproblem is not the farm bill. The problem is the farm bill is not being \nimplemented properly.''\n  We have a good, solid farm policy? Are they kidding? What planet are \nthey living on if they think we have a good, solid farm policy? What we \nhave is a new farm policy written by people who don't know much about \nfarming and it is called the Agricultural Market Transition Act, and \nwhat it is transitioning is family farmers straight out of business.\n  Farm families are going broke in our State in record numbers. In \nfact, there are more auction sales of family farmers this year than \never before, and they have had so many auction sales of family farmers \nin North Dakota that they have had to call auctioneers out of \nretirement to handle the sales.\n  There is a lot more than statistics about losing these farmers. \nFarmers plant a seed in the spring and then hope it will grow. They \nhope it doesn't hail and insects don't come and the crop doesn't get \ndiseased. And if it does come above the ground and then eventually if \nthey escape all those weather disasters, they harvest in the fall and \nthey hope maybe they will get a decent price for their crop.\n  These families struggle hard, they work hard and they risk everything \nthey have. Guess what? This current farm policy is a mess. We have \nprices that are in the tank for grain, and family farmers out there, \nwho are raising grain and trying to take it to the market these days, \ndiscover that they have lost their shirts. And then we have people \nsaying that we have a good, solid farm policy.\n  I had a farm meeting in North Dakota and a fellow stood up. He was a \nbig rugged fellow, kind of a husky build. He had kind of a black beard. \nHe stood up and he started speaking. He\n\n[[Page S6731]]\n\nsaid, ``My granddad farmed, my dad farmed, and I farmed for 23 years.'' \nThen he got tears in his eyes and his chin began to quiver, and he \nsaid, ``The problem is, I can't continue anymore.'' That is more than \njust losing a business. That is losing their life's dream. And, now, we \nhave people who say we have a good, solid farm policy.\n  I didn't vote for this previous farm bill that was passed a couple of \nyears ago. There were people involved in writing that who wouldn't know \na dairy cow from a Dairy Queen. The fact is, they don't know much about \nfarming. I would counsel them, if they think it is a good farm policy: \nGo buy yourself a farm. Go buy yourself a farm, take your suit off and \ngas up the tractor and plant a crop. Then risk your money and hope all \nsummer you are able to harvest, and when you do, then truck it to the \nelevator and sell it for $3 a bushel after you put $5 a bushel into \nraising it.\n  Then add up your bank balance, and then ask yourself if you think it \nis good farm policy? Ask yourself, after you have lost your shirt and \nlost your suit and lost your savings, ask yourself whether you think it \nis a good farm policy.\n  Of course it is not a good farm policy. The fact is, the little guy \nis going broke; the big guys are getting rich. I am talking about the \nfolks who take the product off the farm and they haul it and they \nprocess it. They take that grain and they puff it and they crisp it, \nthey do everything with it. The miller and grocery manufacturers and \neverybody else are all making money. But it is the person out there who \nis trying to run a family farm who is not doing well.\n  I find it interesting, the people who do not seem to care much about \nthat are the same people around here who bellow every day about being \nprofamily. Nobody in politics in this town is profamily if they are not \nwilling to stand up and be profamily farmer, in my judgment.\n  Let me show a chart that demonstrates part of the problem in my \nState, the State of North Dakota. This area here, the red area, means \nthat these folks have had a disaster declaration every single year for \n5 years in a row, weather related. One third of our counties, you can't \ndo much about that. That is not a family farm's fault. These are \nweather-related disasters, 5 years in a row, every year. The orange \none-half our counties is 4 out of 5; the yellow two-thirds of our \ncounties have had disasters 3 out of 5 years.\n  In addition to having the weather problem--here is what has happened \nto the price of wheat. It has fallen like an elevator, straight down. \nThe price of wheat was up here when the Freedom to Farm bill or the \nMarket Transition Act was passed. Here is the price of wheat now at a \nfive-year low.\n  Here is what happened to net income to North Dakota farmers, \naccording to the U.S. Department of Labor statistics. North Dakota's \nnet farm income dropped 98 percent for family farmers. That is 98 \npercent. They virtually lost all of their income. What has happened to \nthose family farmers out there struggling with grain prices that are \nterrible, and with weather problems?\n\n  The price of a tractor goes up, as you can see. The price of a \ncombine goes up. The price of fertilizer goes up. The price of diesel \nfuel goes up. So their income goes down, way down, and all the prices \nthey pay for their input go up.\n  Then what has happened to the folks who take that grain and do \nsomething with it? Bread profits, the price of a bushel of wheat goes \nfrom $5.50 to $3. Do you think you see lower bread prices in the \ngrocery store? You don't. What happens is the profits for the folks who \nare making bread go right here.\n  These folks who constructed the farm policy that we have in this \ncountry today called this ``Market Transition Act''; that is, \ntransitioning family farmers right off the family farm. They said, ``We \ndon't need a price support anymore for family farmers. Let them take \ntheir own risks, and if the market price for grain is dropping, too \nbad. Tough luck.'' So they set up a circumstance where you end up \nhaving no deficiency payments. They put, instead, a declining payment, \nwhich at the end of 7 years phases out and goes to zero.\n  It is interesting, at the press conference yesterday that was held by \nsome Senators, they said the problem is we cannot retreat. The rest of \nthe world is not going to retreat. The fact is, in much of the rest of \nthe world they understand family farmers are important and they have \npolicies that try to support and help family farmers and keep them on \nthe farm. It is this country that has decided, as a matter of policy by \nthe majority party in this Congress, that family farmers really don't \nmatter very much. Oh, giant agrifactories will farm the land from \nCalifornia to Maine, I suppose. They don't seem to care who farms the \nland, because they think family farmers don't matter.\n  They say, ``We can fix all this. First of all, the policy is sound, \nand we can fix it. We will fix it with fast track, fast track trade \nauthority.''\n  Gosh, there is a new idea. Fast track trade authority. We send an \nAmerican trade negotiator up to Canada to negotiate with Canada; send \nhim to Mexico to negotiate with Mexico; send him to Geneva to negotiate \nGATT. We had an $11 billion trade deficit with Canada and we negotiated \nwith them and it went from an $11 billion deficit to a $23 billion \ndeficit. Does anybody think that is going to help family farmers? And, \nincidentally, the trade deficit with Canada is exacerbated by a flood \nof Canadian grain coming to our border, undercutting our grain. It is \nunfairly subsidized. Nobody seems to be willing to do much about it.\n  We have a $2 billion surplus with Mexico, negotiate a treaty, and the \nsurplus goes to a huge deficit, $15 billion deficit. It doesn't look \nlike that is progress to me.\n  Do you want to see how the Mexican trade agreement works? Look at it \nthrough the eye of a potato. Try to take a potato across the Mexican \nborder, a raw potato. You can't do that very easily, but you can see \nfrench fries coming north. Or how about a bean? How about a bean going \nacross the Mexican border? Do you think we can export unlimited \nquantities of beans? I am sorry, no, our negotiator said no, we don't \ncare much about beans.\n  What about beer? Do you like Mexican beer? You can buy plenty of it \nin the United States. You like American beer, in Mexico? I am sorry, \nyou will have great trouble finding it because our negotiators, in my \njudgment, did an incompetent job in negotiating the trade agreement \nwith Canada and Mexico.\n  And, yes, GATT. When I say the GATT agreement, do you know a ship \npulled up at a dock in Stockton, CA, a few weeks ago loaded with \nEuropean barley. This was feed barley, which in fact is not worth very \nmuch, probably a couple of dollars a bushel or less--subsidized by \n$1.10 a bushel by the Europeans, shipped into this country where we \nalready have a surplus of barley, and guess what, it was legal. It was \nlegal under GATT. You can do that under the trade agreement our \nnegotiators negotiated, you can ship in barley with a subsidy that is \nalmost 50 percent of the market price of the product. Who are these \npeople kidding?\n  Do we want to send negotiators out to negotiate more of these \nagreements, and they are going to help our country? I don't think so.\n  The fact is, the people who held a press conference yesterday and \nsaid this farm policy works just fine don't have the foggiest idea of \nwhat is going on on the family farm. They say, ``Well, let's go to fast \ntrack and have more of this trade.'' All that has done is set you back. \nI am for opening foreign markets and forcing opportunities to market \nmore of our grain overseas, but that is not what is happening with our \ntrade agreements.\n  I find it interesting. They said one of the ways that will solve this \nfarm problem is farmers' savings accounts. Oh, yeah? Where are the \nfarmers going to get the savings? If you are able to raise wheat and \nlose $2 a bushel for selling it, you are going to get a lot of savings, \nso we are going to produce farmers' savings accounts.\n  Maybe the people who held the press conference will be able to tell \nfarmers where they are going to get savings, when the price for wheat \nis in the tank, and when they pulled the rug out from under family \nfarmers saying they don't need a safety net. They said, in effect, we \ndon't care if there are family farmers left in this country.\n  What we need to do, Mr. President, is to reestablish a safety net and \nrecognize that this transition program\n\n[[Page S6732]]\n\ndoesn't make any sense. Yes, farmers ought to have all the planning \nflexibility in the world. This Congress ought to decide that family \nfarmers matter, and we ought to do as Europe and others do and decide \nthere ought to be some basic support mechanism for family farming. We \nhave a minimum wage for lower-income working folks, but we say to the \nfamily out there on the farm, ``You're on your own. Oh, you can try and \nmarket your beef to big packing plants''--where four of them control \nalmost 85 percent of the beef packing and they have a fist around the \nneck of the bottle. They say to the farmer and rancher, ``You go ahead \nand market up in that direction and the big packing plants are going to \ntell you what you're going to get, and if you don't like what you get, \ntough luck; you're out of business.''\n  Or people raising wheat or barley, we say, ``You can market with the \ngrain companies. They have an iron fist around the neck of the bottle \nwhere you are going to market, and if you don't like the price, tough \nluck; you're out of business.''\n  The fact is, when we get an industry or a big special interest in \nthis country that has a headache, you have a dozen people in the Senate \nrushing to see if they can't pat their pillow and give them aspirin and \nhelp them take a nap.\n  The big interests in this country have plenty of friends around here. \nIt's just the little guy who is left in the dust. You have family \nfarmers who don't have a lot of money. They don't have a lot of clout. \nThey are not like the tobacco industry. They are not able to spend $50 \nmillion or $100 million worth of advertising on their issue. The \ntobacco industry this week was able to turn back this tobacco bill \nbecause they were able to advertise all across this country.\n  What about the issue of stopping teen smoking. Well, the tobacco \nindustry won; kids lost. The tobacco industry had money, kids didn't. \nIf you're a big interest, you have big money, and you can find plenty \nof folks to care about your interest in the Congress.\n  The question is, Will there be enough people caring about the \ninterests of family farmers in the coming weeks to decide we are going \nto intervene and try to save a network of family farms in this country? \nWe ought to resurrect the safety net. There ought to be at least some \nsort of marketing loan that gives farmers a decent price if they don't \nget it from the marketplace. I much sooner they get it from the \nmarketplace, but if it is not there, farmers need some help. They ought \nto get some indemnity payments for the crop diseases that have been \npervasive in my State and other States. The crop disease is called \nscab. We ought to have a Crop Insurance Program that works, and if it \ndoesn't work, let's make it work.\n  We ought to have something in place that starts to do something about \nmarket concentration. Yes, let's look into the livestock industry, the \nrailroads, the big packing plants, and in all the areas where \nconcentration exists. All that concentration squeezes down on family \nfarmers and takes potential profits away from family farmers.\n  Finally, those who talk about trade, it seems to me ought to spend \ntheir time not talking about going to some sort of fast track where the \nrecord has been a disaster for this country and for our producers and, \nyes, especially for our farmers. They ought to talk about sanctions.\n  We don't like Cuba, so we say we are going to have sanctions against \nCuba. We don't like Libya, so we have sanctions against Libya. We don't \nlike Iraq, so we're going to have sanctions against Iraq. We don't like \nIran, so we're going to have sanctions against Iran. India and Pakistan \ndetonate nuclear devices, so we're going to have sanctions against \nthose countries.\n  Ten percent of the markets in the world are off limits to farmers. \nThese sanctions have something to do with national security decisions. \nThe defense authorization bill deals with national security. It seems \nto me if you are taking markets away from family farmers, you ought to \npay them for it. Why should family farmers lose markets and be told, \n``Well, you're going to contribute now to our national security \ninterest because we are taking this market away from you; yes, your \nprice is going to go down, and, yes, you are going to lose money. Be a \ngood American; you accept the cost.''\n\n  In virtually every other area in this country, we do something about \nthat. If it were big business, we would come in with a big policy to \nreimburse them. You don't think when the big exporters lose money that \nthey are not reimbursed? It is interesting to me that virtually every \ntime something happens that causes a substantial disruption in part of \nour economy, somebody is here saying we ought to do something about it, \nbut there is not much discussion about family farmers, and I really \nregret that.\n  I know some people say, ``Well, this country is New York and Los \nAngeles and a few big airports in between, and what you fly over and \nlook out at is just rural territory.'' Food doesn't come from a plastic \nbottle; food doesn't come from a package. It comes, in most cases, from \nthe land, and the rural people in this country. These are people who \ncome from my home area in Hettinger County, ND, who decided long ago \nthey love the land and they want to live on the land. They want to \nraise their children on the land, and they have 500, 800, or 1,000 \nacres. They have risked everything they have and everything they own to \ntry to make a living. Yet, we come along with this farm policy that \nsays we are different from Europe, from Japan or other countries. We \nhave a policy that doesn't care whether family farmers continue to \nexist. Our policy says if the marketplace gives them a decent price, \nfine; if it doesn't, tough luck, because we believe in the free market.\n  There is no free market in agriculture. What an absurd contention. \nThere has never been a free market in agriculture and will not be a \nfree market. Our farmers are asked to compete not just against European \nfarmers, they are asked to compete against European farmers and the \nEuropean Governments. Our farmers are asked to sell in circumstances \nwhere our trade negotiators negotiate agreements and you can't get \nenough T-bone steak into Tokyo.\n  Did you know that T-bone steaks are roughly $30 a pound into Tokyo? \nDo you know why? Because we can't get enough beef into Japan. Why can't \nwe? Because their market is closed. We are getting more than we used \nto.\n  We have a $50 to $60 billion trade deficit with Japan, but we still \ndon't get enough beef into Japan. We don't get enough wheat into China. \nI can stand here all day and talk about the problems we impose on \nfamily farmers to interrupt their markets because of incompetent trade \nnegotiators and unenforced trade agreements. We negotiate an agreement \nand we forget about it in a month. They were bad agreements to start \nwith, and they are rarely enforced, if at all. I am just saying that \nthe economic all-stars in this country are its family farmers. If this \nCongress doesn't decide that broad-based economic ownership matters in \nthis country, then it will have made a very large mistake.\n  I am standing on this side of the aisle. So that means I am a \nDemocrat. That is how I came to Congress. I ran for the U.S. Senate as \na Democrat, and I believe in the Jeffersonian strain of the Democratic \nParty, and its support for broadly-based economic ownership. We believe \nthat the broad-based economic ownership provides the guarantee of \neconomic freedom and, therefore, the guarantee of ultimate political \nfreedoms in this country. I think that is a very, very important issue.\n  I have come to the floor of the Senate recently talking about \nconcentration in this country. Every day you hear about a new merger, \nwhen two huge behemoth American corporations decide to get married. We \ndidn't even know they were dating or having secret discussions. All of \na sudden, we discover they have taken out a marriage license. They love \neach other. What they love is the profits.\n  Now we have bank after bank, telecommunications companies--you name \nit--they are all marrying up. The bigger the better. The free market in \nthis country and the market system in this country works only when you \nhave broad-based ownership and robust competition. Concentration means \nless competition.\n  Family farmers, individuals all across this country turn on the yard \nlight at night, worship at their local church, and try to send their \nkids to school, and do a good job, and make a\n\n[[Page S6733]]\n\nlittle profit on the farm. All that those family farmers ask is to \nparticipate in a market system that works. Almost in every instance \nthey discover that all their input costs are increased by the largest \ncorporations in the land that produce these products. And when they go \nto market with the products they raise, they discover is worth very, \nvery little. When they try to market it up through an income stream, \nthey find that if they are marketing a cow or a hog, they are marketing \nthrough packing plants that are too concentrated to have what is called \na ``free market.'' And the same is true with grain.\n  So, Mr. President, in the coming week or so, you are going to see a \nlot of activity on this issue. Our family farmers deserve the same kind \nof interest, in their long-term economic health, as the large special \ninterests get here on the floor of the Senate.\n  The piece that I referenced at the start, written by Curt Anderson, \nan Associated Press farm writer, referenced a press conference \nyesterday. To all of those who attended the press conference yesterday, \ntelling us that we have a good solid farm policy, I say nonsense; this \nfarm policy is a miserable failure. Anybody here who cares about family \nfarmers as I do, and anybody here who cares whether we have family \nfarmers in this country's future ought to be coming to the floor of \nthis Senate and helping us change this farm policy to one that really \nprovides some help to families who are struggling in this country, \ntrying to run their family farms.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/19/senate-section/article/S6730-5", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, JUNE 22, 1998\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
