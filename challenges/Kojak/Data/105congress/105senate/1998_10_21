WARNER, Chairman.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n[[Page S12742]]\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of October 19, 1998.)\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if there is no objection, I would like to \nengage in a colloquy with the distinguished Chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, the senior Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would be happy to.\n  Mr. LOTT. I understand that this bill contains a provision which \nprohibits the FBI from charging a user fee or gun tax on all firearms \npurchases that take place once the national instant criminal background \ncheck system takes effect on November 30 of this year--Is that correct?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes. The Brady Act did not intend, nor did it authorize \nthe Department of Justice to charge a tax or fee to law abiding \ncitizens to exercise their Second Amendment right. The National Instant \nCheck System (NICS) is a national criminal justice program which was \ndesigned to quickly screen prospective firearms purchasers--weeding out \nprohibited gun pruchases while ensuring that the sale of a firearm to a \nlaw-abiding citizen could go forth without significant delay. The NICS \nis a federal program of benefit to all citizens and therefore the cost \nshould be and will be borne by the federal government in view of the \nabsence of any enabling provision relating to assessment of a user fee \nto gun owners.\n  Mr. LOTT. I am pleased to hear that, since I supported the \nestablishment and the creation of a national instant check program. It \nwas certainly my understanding that this program was meant to \nfacilitate gun purchases by law abiding Americans and not cause a \nchilling effect on our rights. We have provided millions of dollars--\nincluding $42 million in this bill--for the FBI to implement NICS \npursuant to the law. As I also remember, NICS is specifically \nprohibited from becoming a repository of approved firearms transfer \nrecords and firearms owners? Is that correct?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Again the Senator is correct. The establishment of NICS \ncontained important elements in the law designed to protect the privacy \nof individual law-abiding gun owners. One of the greatest concerns and \nlegitimate fears of law abiding gun owners is that the federal \ngovernment will create a federal gun owner registration system where \nlaw abiding gun owners exercise of their constitutional rights will be \ncarefully monitored. This is why there are a number of provisions in \nlaw which prohibit such action by the government. One such law is the \nFirearms Owners Protection Act, passed in 1986, which specifically \nprohibits any record of firearms owners and firearms purchases from \nbeing maintained or recorded, for any period of time, in a facility \nowned, managed, or controlled by the United States government.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the Senator for making that point clear. Is it not \nalso the case that the Brady law itself includes a prohibition on the \ncentralization and creation of a federal gun registration system?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, the Brady Act clearly states that upon approval of \na firearm transaction, the instant check system shall ``destroy all \nrecords of the system with respect to the call (other than the \nidentifying number and the date the number was assigned) and all \nrecords of the system relating to the transfer.'' 18 U.S.C. \nSec. 922(t)(2). Additionally, Section 103 of the Brady Act prohibits \nthe establishment of a firearms registration system to prevent any \nrecords generated by the instant check system from being transferred to \na facility owned, managed or controlled by the United States \ngovernment.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Well, let me understand something. Does that mean that the \nFBI or the Department of Justice would be able to collect and maintain \nall personally identifying information on transactions relating to \napproved firearms transfers for one and one half years, or for any \nperiod of time?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The national instant criminal background check system \nclearly prohibits such action by the FBI. The centralization and \nretention of firearms transaction information and records on firearm \nowners would create a de facto system of firearms registration which \nhas clearly not intended by the Brady Act or any other provision of \nfederal law. In fact it was specifically prohibited.\n  Mr. LOTT. Specifically, though, is the NICS statute clear on this \nprohibition of maintaining an audit log or other repository of approved \nfirearms transaction and personal information on firearms owners? Is \nthere any doubt as to Congress' intent in this regard?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I do not believe the law could be any clearer. The NICS \nstatute is transparent and unambiguous on the point that the instant \ncheck system ``shall destroy'' such records. Subsection (t)(2) of 18 \nUnited States Code, Section 922, is clearly drafted so that destruction \nof an approved firearms transaction and personal identifying records \nshall occur contemporaneously upon the system's approval of the \nfirearms transfer, the assignment of a unique identifying number, and \nupon the immediate voice or electronic conveyance of such approval and \nunique identifying number to the federal firearms dealer making the \nNICS inquiry.\n  Mr. LOTT. Is there any information that the FBI is permitted to \nmaintain from an approved firearms transaction that goes through NICS?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The only information or records on approved firearms \ntransfers that the FBI is permitted to maintain in a central registry \nis the ``NICS Transaction Number'' (NTN) and the date the transaction \nwas requested. See, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 922(t)(2)(C).\n  Mr. LOTT. I would like to be sure that the rights of law abiding gun \nowners are not violated by FBI's operation of NICS. Do you have any \nsuggestions in this regard, to ensure that the laws are being followed?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I suggest that a General Accounting Office (GAO) audit \nbe conducted periodically to ensure Americans that the retention of \ninformation and records run through the NICS is not being maintained, \nfor any purpose, unlawfully.\n  Mr. LOTT. I certainly would second that recommendation. This matter \nis too important to the American people to allow any opportunity for \nabuse.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the statement of managers contains \nlanguage concerning the proposed HCFA rule that would defer to state \nlaw on the issue of physician supervision of nurse anesthetists. As I \nunderstand it, this is non-statutory language, and nothing in the bill \nwould prohibit HCFA from moving forward with the publication of the \nfinal rule on this issue. I would like to ask my colleague from North \nDakota, who is a member of the Committee on Appropriations, is that his \nunderstanding of the language as well?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the language to which my colleague refers \nis only included in the statement of managers and does not have a \nbinding effect on HCFA. As a matter of law, nothing in the bill or the \nreport language would prohibit HCFA from moving forward with the final \nrule.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, then it would be correct that HCFA could \nbase its final decision on data or information that is already \navailable, rather than conducting any new studies. My concern here is \nto ensure that HCFA is neither discouraged from nor delayed in moving \nforward in publishing a final rule. It is my understanding that nothing \nin the report language of this year's Labor/HHS Appropriations bill \nwould prevent HCFA from moving ahead and that any further review of \ndata could follow HCFA's publication of a final rule.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. The statement of \nmanagers does not mandate, as a matter of law, any further studies by \nHCFA on this issue. Nor would HCFA be impeded from moving forward with \nissuing a final rule regarding the physician supervision issue. In \nfact, the language clearly states it is not intended to discourage or \ndelay HCFA from moving forward.\n  I know this issue is particularly important to some of us because \nnurse anesthetists are the sole anesthesia providers in 70% of rural \nhospitals. Finalizing this proposed rule is critical to rural America.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I appreciate the responses from my \ncolleague from North Dakota, and I wish to briefly comment on this \nmatter. As the\n\n[[Page S12743]]\n\nsponsor in previous congresses of legislation that would require HCFA \nto defer to state law on this issue, I am pleased that HCFA has finally \nissued a proposed rule that would in fact defer to state law. This \nissue has been hanging over us for many years, and it seems that the \nonly way to finally resolve it is for HCFA to publish its final rule \nbased upon the proposed rule and let the states decide. As a member of \nthe Senate Finance Committee, I would add that we included a provision \nin our Medicare package in 1995 that would defer to state law on the \nissue of physician supervision of nurse anesthetists. That provision \nwas not included in the final package as a result of an agreement \nbetween the two associations to focus on a reimbursement issue instead. \nHowever, I want to emphasize earlier comments that HCFA should neither \nbe discouraged nor delayed in moving forward in publishing a final \nrule.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I share my colleague from North Dakota's \nposition on the nurse anesthetist issue and thank him for his comments. \nI believe that HCFA should move forward and issue a final rule removing \nthe physician supervision requirement and defer to state law.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their comments \nregarding the statement of managers' language on nurse anesthetists, an \nissue important to all of us, and know we all will follow the issue \nclosely in the months to come.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nSenator form New Mexico, the chairman of the Energy and Water \nDevelopment Subcommittee, on the subject of funding which is provided \nin P.L. 105-245 for the existing joint U.S.--Russian program, for the \ndevelopment of gas reactor technology to dispose of excess weapons-\nderived plutonium.\n  As the chairman of the subcommittee knows, the purpose of this \nprogram is to develop a new reactor technology which is not only more \nefficient in burning weapons plutonium but is melt-down proof and more \nthermally efficient than existing reactors. Because of the promise of \nthis technology, the Russians are very enthusiastic about it and the \nFrench nuclear company Framatome and the Japanese company Fuji Electric \nhave been active participants. Further, because most of the technical \nwork on this program is being performed by Russian nuclear scientists \nand engineers, program costs are reduced considerably the those same \nRussian scientist and engineers are engaged in stimulating non-nuclear \nweapons work.\n  It is my understanding that this unique and innovative U.S.--Russian \nprogram to destroy weapons plutonium is the result of the very \nconsiderable expense and efforts of a particular U.S. company over \nseveral years. Is this also the Subcommittee Chairman's understanding?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is it also the Senator's understanding that from all \nindications, this program has been well run and has an existing and \neffective management structure with both U.S. and Russian \nrepresentation?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes it certainly is. I would note that Secretary of \nEnergy Pena noted and has appreciated the cooperation that has occurred \nin this area under the current partnership program. In a joint \nstatement signed on March 11 of this year, Secretary Pena and Deputy \nMinister of Minatom Mr. Ryabev specified those areas in which further \nscientific research will be necessary; plutonium fuel, neutron physics, \nand materials. That joint statement was an important indicator of the \nsuccess and purpose of the gas reactor partnership and future efforts \nshould be consistent with that statement.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Then I would like to ask the Senator from New Mexico his \nunderstanding of language in the report that states that of the $5 \nmillion made available for this program in Fiscal Year 1999, $2 million \nis for ``work to be performed in the United States by the Department of \nEnergy and other U.S. contractors.'' Specifically, is it the Senator's \nunderstanding or intent that the Department of Energy should receive \nmost of this money or impose a new management structure over this \nprogram that is working so well and is so well accepted by the \nRussians?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator from Alaska for raising this key \nissue. I can assure the Senator it is my wish that the Department of \nEnergy utilize the already established partnership that created this \nimportant program and has management it so well.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the distinguished Senator from New Mexico for \nthis clarification.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Otto von Bismarck, former Chancellor of \nGermany, once said, ``Laws are like sausages. It is better not to see \nthem being made.'' Yet even Bismarck would have gagged over how this \nbill evolved.\n  Several times in recent years, I have disparaged the process of \neleventh-hour budgeting because it inevitably leads to one thing: a \nrising tide that lifts all spending. All the Republican programs get \nhigher funding, all the Democrat programs get more funding. The budget \nbusts apart at the seams. The taxpayers are the losers.\n  And it's not just the budget process. Bismarck would have croaked had \nhe seen how the normal legislative process--bad as it is--was bypassed, \nbecoming a free-for-all. It's as if the Clinton Administration and the \nCongress had a power outage, and the looters came from everywhere and \npicked the taxpayers' pockets clean. The legislative process was \nstripped of its integrity.\n  This isn't an ``omnibus'' bill; it's an ``ominous'' bill.\n  Many of us in this body have brought the good news home to our \nconstituents. We have delivered the first balanced budget in a \ngeneration. We created surpluses as far as the eye can see. The debt is \nfinally being paid down. Our children have a brighter future because of \nit. And Social Security will be saved for the Baby Boomer generation. \nThis is the vision we had when we passed the bipartisan Balanced Budget \nAct of 1997.\n  I intend to vote against this bill. The reason is because it \nthreatens that vision. A vision we committed to just one year ago. \nSpecifically, there are three reasons I oppose it. First, it threatens \nwhat we accomplished last year. It compromises the Balanced Budget Act. \nThis bill proves that the Clinton White House and Congress can never \nresist the temptation to spend money, even though we've promised to \nsave the money for Social Security and to pay down the debt. That \nsignifies a total lack of fiscal discipline.\n  Second, it squanders the surplus. It would soak up $21 billion of it \nin the coming year alone. This is just one month after the announcement \nof the nation's first surplus in 29 years. Both sides were patting each \nother on the back. Meanwhile, we couldn't wait to spend it. We could \nhave and should have found offsets for this money. I predict that in \ncoming years, this will be Congress' way around the budget agreement--\nCall any program an emergency and the budget agreement is by-passed.\n  Third, the bill, is a budget-buster. Maybe not technically, maybe not \nnow. But in pushing $4.1 billion of spending decisions into next year, \nit's the first die cast in ensuring another rising tide of spending \nnext year. In addition, it's not really clear what the budgetary impact \nis of all the legislative mushrooms we're passing in this budget. The \nfunding for these programs is like fertilizer. And next year these \nmushrooms become BIG mushrooms. And that creates further budgetary \npressures for more spending.\n  In short, Mr. President, this process shows we have reverted to the \nsame attitude, the same mindset, the same practice, that brought us \nmonumental debt levels in the first place.\n  Moreover, I deplore the intellectual dishonesty of the President of \nthe United States. For nine months, I have been applauding his stated \ncommitment to save the surplus to ensure the viability of Social \nSecurity. Then he pushes for a budget that spends $21 billion of that \nsurplus in just one year. The following day, the President appears in \nthe Rose Garden and announces we've agreed to a budget deal, and saved \nSocial Security in the process.\n  Mr. President, this cynical statement by the President, and the \nprecedent it sets, hasn't saved Social Security. It has threatened \nSocial Security. It has opened up the flood gates. It ensures future \nraids on future surpluses. And the President now has no moral authority \nto use those surpluses exclusively for Social Security. He squandered \nthat moral authority.\n\n[[Page S12744]]\n\n  It is also intellectually dishonest of the President to oppose tax \ncuts, using the argument that tax cuts would jeopardize Social \nSecurity, yet assume that spending the surplus would not.\n  These reasons, Mr. President, constitute why I am seriously \ndisappointed in this process, and in this budget. I regret my vote \nagainst it because there are many provisions in this bill that I fully \nsupport. Some of them I am even responsible for.\n  For instance, there is approximately $300 million for Iowa farmers in \nadditional relief. The relief package includes AMTA payments, disaster \nassistance and new operating loans. In addition, there is tax relief \nfor farmers, including Permanent Income Averaging, accelerated health \ninsurance premium deductibility, and a 5-year net operating loss carry-\nback.\n  There are other provisions I fought for and support. Chief among them \nare:\n  Home health care funding; Education funding for new teachers; Head \nStart funding; IMF reforms and funding; Extension of Chapter 12 \nbankruptcy provisions for family farmers; LIHEAP funding at levels \nbeyond the administration's request; Anti-drug funding; and, Roads and \nhighways funding, at the highest levels in history.\n  These are all provisions that I worked hard for, supported and that I \nbelieve are essential. However, they could have been paid for without \nthis revival of the practice of incrementally mortgaging the future.\n  The easy thing for me to do would be to vote for this bill. But when \nthe process of governing breaks down and puts our commitments and our \nfuture at risk; when Congress's recent fiscal discipline falls apart; \nand, when our elected leadership abdicates its responsibilities of \ngoverning, it's time, in my view, to say ``no.''\n\n\n                  district of columbia appropriations\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks concerning \nthe conference report on the Columbia appropriations, fiscal year 1999. \nThis conference report is the product of a productive debate between \nthe Senate and House subcommittees. This is a good bill, a bipartisan \nbill, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I want to thank my subcommittee members, Senator Boxer, the ranking \nmember, and Senator Hutchison for their hard work and assistance in \nputting the Senate bill together. I would also like to thank the \nchairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, and \nthe distinguished ranking member, Senator Byrd, for their guidance and \nsupport.\n  Mr. President, the conference report largely ratifies the consensus \nbudget for local funds adopted by the Mayor, the Council, and the \nFinancial Authority. The Congress created that budget process, and it \nhas imposed some much needed fiscal discipline on the District's \nbudget. Instead of drowning in red ink, the budget of the Nation's \nCapital is now solidly in the black, with a surplus of over \n$300,000,000 for fiscal year 1998.\n  The conference report appropriates over $372,000,000 for \nimplementation of the National Capital Revitalization and Self-\nGovernment Improvement Act of 1997. With the exception of the capital \nbudget for the District court system, the conference report supports \nthe President's budget request for implementation of the act.\n  The conferees did not provide the $50,000,000 requested by the \nPresident to capitalize the National Capital Revitalization Corporation \n[NCRC]. The Congress has not been consulted as to either the \ncomposition of the Board of the NCRC, its duties, the scope of its \nactivities, the relationship between the NCRC and other Federal or \nlocal agencies, the relationship between the NCRC and Congress, or the \nextent to which actions taken by the NCRC may conflict with previous \neconomic incentives adopted by the Congress on behalf of the District. \nDespite these concerns, the President's nonemergency supplemental \nrequest included $25,000,000 to capitalize the NCRC.\n  The District of Columbia was recently named the worst city in the \ncountry to raise children. The children of our Nation's Capital deserve \nbetter. Our conference report provides $7,000,000 to pay for new \nfacilities at the Boys Town operations in the District; over \n$15,000,000 for public charter schools; and $200,000 for mentoring \nservices for at-risk children.\n  The conference report also provides funding for several nonprofit \norganizations located in the District of Columbia. These projects have \nbroad bipartisan support and will bolster the District's downtown \nrevitalization efforts.\n  The conference report provides over $75,000,000 in Federal funds to \nimprove public safety and repair a crumbling infrastructure in the \nNation's Capital. Included in this amount is over $18,000,000 for \nrepairs to the District's public safety facilities, including badly \nneeded capital improvements to Metropolitan Police Department [MPD] \nfacilities. In addition, the conference report provides the United \nStates Park Police with $8,500,000 for a new helicopter, which will \nassist the MPD in meeting the District's public safety needs. In \naddition, the conference report appropriates $25,000 to expand the \nsubway station next to the planned Washington Convention Center.\n  Perhaps most important, the conference report includes $25,000,000 to \ncontinue the work of management reform. If there is one reason why the \nNation's Capital has any hope of recovery, it is because District \nagencies which have been mismanaged for years are finally being \nreformed and restructured. The Financial Authority and the District's \nChief Management Officer, Camille Barnett, are now midway through the \nprocess of cleaning up the largest agencies of the District government. \nWhile the District is making headway in reversing years of \nmismanagement, much work needs to be done to improve service delivery \nto District residents. The funds provided in this bill will go toward \nprojects that will enhance government efficiency and service delivery, \nsuch as expanded emergency medical services and technology \nmodernization.\n  The conference report prohibits the use of Federal and local funds \nfor the implementation of a needle exchange program; for abortion; and \nfor a ballot initiative to legalize controlled substances. It also \nprovides badly needed adoption reforms for the District of Columbia.\n  This conference report would not have been possible without the hard \nwork and cooperation of my friend, Congressman Charles Taylor, the \nchairman of the House Subcommittee on the District of Columbia. We are \nconfident that this conference report will be supported by the Senate, \nthe House of Representatives, and the President.\n\n\n                     section 139 of interior title\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to express my appreciation \nto the managers of the Interior title of the Omnibus Appropriations Act \nfor including section 139, which ratifies payments made by small \nrefiners under preexisting onshore and offshore royalty-in-kind \nprograms. I was pleased to work with Senators Enzi, Domenici, Thomas, \nJohnson, and Landrieu on this issue. My office served as the point of \ncontact between the Minerals Management Service and the small refiners \nin negotiating the final text of this section, which was then included \nby the managers in the bill, so I would like to make two observations \nin relation to it. The purpose of this section is to relieve small \nrefiners of potential additional financial obligations that they are \nnot in a position to bear, and to avoid the likelihood that a number of \nsmall refiners who participated in a federal program to increase their \naccess to crude oil for refining would be forced into bankruptcy over a \nquestion as to whether the amount invoiced by government for that crude \noil was correct or not. I do not believe that anything in this section \nshould be construed as expressing congressional intent on any question \nother than the one of whether small refiners should be relieved of this \npotential problem. In my opinion, this section does not constitute a \ncongressional view for or against the use of posted prices for the \nvaluation of crude oil produced from federal leases.\n\n\n                     cwc implementation act of 1998\n\n Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, following Senate approval of the \nresolution of ratification for the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) \nand subsequent ratification of the treaty by the President, it became \nnecessary for the United States to enact legislation to implement its \nvarious domestic obligations. The Foreign Relations and Judiciary \nCommittees of the Senate immediately fulfilled their obligation to \nprepare implementing legislation once the treaty\n\n[[Page S12745]]\n\nhad been ratified. On May 23, 1997, the full Senate passed S. 610--\n``the Chemical Weapons Convention Implementation Act of 1997.'' Soon \nthereafter, on November 12, 1997, the House of Representatives passed \nthe implementing legislation, together with sanctions on Russian firms \nthat are assisting Iran's ballistic missile program.\n  I regret that it has taken so long to enact the implementing \nlegislation into law, if for no other reason than that I expect \nnumerous U.S. companies to challenge the constitutionality of the \ntreaty and overturn it in the courts. Unfortunately, final resolution \nof the legal issues surrounding the CWC, as well as full U.S. \ncompliance with the treaty, has been delayed this entire session of \nCongress because of President Clinton's opposition to the unrelated \nmissile sanctions provisions of the bill. Indeed, the President sought \nto delay and derail CWC implementing legislation throughout the entire \nspring. The President alone is responsible for putting the United \nStates into noncompliance by delaying and then ultimately vetoing the \nbill (on June 23, 1998).\n  It is important that those who are frustrated with the slow pace of \nU.S. implementation of the CWC understand that the Congress has \ndischarged its obligation to provide implementing legislation for the \nPresident's signature not once--but twice. It is the President, not \nCongress, who has blocked speedy and complete adherence to the treaty.\n  For the record, I note that two trade associations were directly \ninvolved in the crafting of the CWC's implementing legislation. The \nPresident and CEO of the Chemical Manufacturers Association wrote to me \non May 7, 1998, stating that S. 610 was ``a reasonable approach to meet \nU.S. obligations under the CWC and protect industry's interests.'' The \nVice President for Regulatory Affairs of the American Forest and Paper \nAssociation wrote to Senator Hatch on May 21, 1997, offering its \nsupport for S. 610 since the bill ``contains a number of provisions \nthat the forest products industry believes are crucial to ensuring that \nimplementation of the CWC is reasonable and meets the stated purpose of \nthe treaty.''\n  I submit the following assessment which details the most significant \nprovisions of the implementing legislation, together with an \nexplanation of the Senate's rationale.\n\n       Section 3. Definitions. Section 3 specifically lists those \n     chemical formulae (and a few bio-toxins) falling under the \n     terms: ``Schedule 1 chemical agent''; ``Schedule 2 chemical \n     agent''; and ``Schedule 3 chemical agent''. Any chemical not \n     listed in Section 3 as either a Schedule 1, 2, or 3 chemical \n     agent is not subject to the any of the requirements under the \n     legislation relating to such chemical agents (e.g. data \n     declaration and routine inspections).\n       The Annex on Chemicals of the CWC excludes some chemicals \n     which are capable of being used as chemical weapons \n     precursors, but which also have wide commercial applications. \n     As a result, verification measures are not applied under the \n     Convention to those chemicals. For this reason, if the CWC \n     were to be expanded in scope, the most likely candidates for \n     addition to the Annex are dual-use chemicals which are \n     produced in large commercial quantities for purposes not \n     prohibited under the Convention. The addition of these \n     chemicals to the Annex on Chemicals likely would increase the \n     number of businesses affected by the Convention's \n     verification regime, entailing additional reporting and data \n     declarations from companies, and subjecting additional \n     facilities to routine inspections.\n       Thus the implementing legislation is deliberately \n     structured to ensure that a change in law will be required \n     before any provision of the Verification Annex can be applied \n     to any new chemical or biological substance added to the \n     Annex on Chemicals. This will provide both the Congress and \n     the American public sufficient opportunity to examine \n     proposals by the executive branch to expand the CWC. Indeed, \n     depending upon the extent to which the addition of a chemical \n     (or other type of substance) is judged to substantively \n     increase the scope of application of the CWC, such a change \n     also might require the advice and consent of the Senate.\n       The American Forest and Paper Association specifically \n     supported the requirement that ``additions or deletions from \n     the list would only be permitted by legislative amendment, \n     and not through the administrative regulatory process.''\n       Section 102. No Abridgement of Constitutional Rights. This \n     section makes clear that the Federal Government may not force \n     anyone to waive any Constitutional right as a condition for \n     entering into a contract with the federal government or as a \n     condition for receiving any other form of benefits from the \n     government. This provision works in conjunction with Section \n     308, which amends The Office of Federal Procurement Policy \n     Act. Many of the companies subject to the reporting and \n     inspection requirements of the CWC work under contract to the \n     federal government. Sections 102 and 308 protect these \n     companies by prohibiting the government from imposing, as a \n     condition of a contract, the requirement that they must agree \n     to warrantless searches under the CWC or forego any other \n     Constitutional right (such as the right to challenge the \n     constitutionality of the CWC). The same protections apply to \n     individuals receiving benefits from the United States.\n       Section 103. Civil Liability of the United States. Section \n     103 is necessary to address Fifth Amendment problems which \n     arise with respect to the CWC. The Convention requires that \n     the United States provide foreign inspectors with intrusive \n     access into numerous U.S. businesses; this, together with the \n     mandatory data declaration requirements, holds at risk trade \n     secrets and critical proprietary information. For instance, \n     the authority of inspectors to collect data and take samples \n     for analysis may constitute a form of illegal seizure and the \n     taking of private property without compensation. But the CWC \n     contains no provisions to ensure just compensation to those \n     whose property has been taken.\n       Proprietary information is often the basis for a chemical \n     company's competitive edge. As a practical matter, a wide \n     variety of things are considered proprietary or sensitive. \n     For instance, the following are often considered to be \n     ``trade secrets'': (1) the formula of a new drug or specialty \n     chemical; (2) a synthetic route that requires the fewest \n     steps or the cheapest raw materials; (3) the form, source, \n     composition, and purity of raw materials or solvents; (4) a \n     new catalyst that improves the selectivity, efficiency, or \n     yield of a reaction; (5) the precise order and timing with \n     which chemicals are fed into a reactor; (6) subtle changes in \n     pressure or temperature at key steps in a process; (7) \n     isolation methods that give the highest yields consistent \n     with good recycling of solvents and reagents; (8) expansion \n     and marketing plans; (9) raw materials and suppliers; (10) \n     manufacturing cost data; (11) prices and sales figures; (12) \n     names of technical personnel working on a particular project; \n     and (13) customer lists.\n       The theft of any one of these items could result in a loss \n     of revenue and investment that could damage a large company, \n     and drive a small one out of business. Because some trade \n     secrets are not all that complex, even simple visual \n     inspection could reveal proprietary information of great \n     value to a competitor. During routine inspections, for \n     example, companies will run the risk that a skilled chemical \n     engineer equipped with knowledge of the target facility and a \n     list of specific questions to be answered will learn a great \n     deal about that business' activities.\n       The Fifth Amendment provides that no private property shall \n     ``be taken for public use without just compensation.'' As one \n     noted constitutional scholar, Ronald Rotunda, warned the \n     Foreign Relations Committee on March 31, 1997: ``If the \n     federal government would simply take this property, the \n     Constitution requires that it pay just compensation. If the \n     federal government sets up a legal structure that allows \n     international inspectors to make off with intellectual \n     property, there is a `taking' for purposes of the just \n     compensation clause.''\n       The CWC, however, does not provide for just compensation in \n     the event of misuse of treaty inspection rights. In the \n     absence of a treaty-mandated remedy, the only means of \n     guaranteeing Fifth Amendment protections is to hold the \n     federal government liable for the legal structure it has \n     created by ratifying the CWC. It is the federal government, \n     after all, which approved a treaty giving foreign nationals \n     access to U.S. facilities, thereby creating the potential for \n     the taking of private property.\n       Section 103 provides U.S. companies and citizens with the \n     right to bring a civil action for money damages against the \n     United States for the actions of foreign inspectors and other \n     OPCW employees (as well as U.S. government personnel) \n     undertaken pursuant to, or under the color of the CWC or the \n     implementing legislation. It precludes the federal government \n     from raising sovereign immunity as a defense, and establishes \n     a process whereby, once a prima facie case has been \n     established that proprietary information has been divulged or \n     taken, the burden to disprove the claim falls upon the United \n     States. In so doing, Section 103 establishes a reasonable \n     standard of evidence to be used in resolving this type of \n     civil action, given the ambiguity that often surrounds \n     suspicions of the theft of trade secrets.\n       Section 103 defers action on a civil claim for one year, \n     providing a period of time for the United States to pursue \n     diplomatic and other remedies to seek redress for the claim. \n     However, once the claim moves forward, Section 103 \n     establishes a clear policy and process by which the U.S. \n     government shall pursue recoupment of all funds paid in \n     satisfaction of any tort or taking for which the U.S. has \n     been held liable. In particular, the United States will \n     impose severe sanctions on all foreign entities (both \n     governmental and private) involved in the theft of the trade \n     secret in question. Sanctions against foreign governments can \n     be waived by the President on a case-by-case basis, though \n     sanctions against foreign persons are lifted only once the \n     U.S. has received ``full and complete compensation.''\n       These provisions are designed to operate together with the \n     requirements of Condition\n\n[[Page S12746]]\n\n     16 of the resolution of ratification for the CWC. Pursuant to \n     that condition, in the event that ``persuasive information'' \n     becomes available indicating that a U.S. citizen has suffered \n     financial losses or damages due to the unauthorized \n     disclosure of confidential business information, the \n     President is required to secure a waiver of immunity from \n     jurisdiction for any foreign person responsible for financial \n     losses or damages to a U.S. citizen, or to withhold half of \n     the U.S. contribution to the OPCW until the situation has \n     been resolved ``in a manner satisfactory to the United States \n     person who has suffered the damages. . .''\n       Section 302. Facility Agreements. Section 302 prohibits the \n     United States from concluding facility agreements which would \n     prohibit U.S. businesses from withholding consent to an \n     inspection request for any reason or no reason (thereby \n     triggering a requirement for a search warrant under Section \n     305). It also ensures that representatives from U.S. \n     companies may participate in preparations for the negotiation \n     of a facility agreement, and may observe such negotiations to \n     the maximum extent practicable.\n       Section 303. Authority to Conduct Inspections. In addition \n     to providing the legal basis by which U.S. companies may be \n     inspected by foreign personnel, Section 303 ensures that at \n     least one special agent of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation shall accompany each inspection conducted under \n     the Convention. This ensures a minimum of protection against \n     the possible theft of trade secrets for U.S. companies.\n       Section 303 also prohibits OSHA or EPA employees from \n     escorting or otherwise accompanying inspection teams, and \n     requires that the number of U.S. government personnel be kept \n     to the minimum number necessary. The Administration asserted, \n     in response to a question for the record before the Senate \n     Select Committee on Intelligence, that the U.S. Government \n     would be permitted ``to use information or materials obtained \n     during inspections in regulatory, civil, or criminal \n     proceedings conducted for the purpose of law enforcement, \n     including those that are not directly related to enforcement \n     of the CWC.'' This alarmed many companies.\n       The American Forest and Paper Association stated its \n     support for Section 302(b)(2)(B), noting that ``[t]he treaty \n     should not be used as an omnibus vehicle for regulatory \n     inspections unrelated to its intended purpose. We believe \n     that it would be inappropriate to include such government \n     officials [from OSHA and EPA] on an international \n     inspection team formed for the purposes set out in the CWC \n     and would merely serve to detract from the intent of the \n     inspection.''\n       By barring EPA and OSHA officials from participating in CWC \n     inspections, Section 303 prevents the Administration from \n     using the Convention to gain a degree of access to facilities \n     which it otherwise is denied. As Professor Rotunda noted in \n     his March 31, 1997, letter: ``Searches that violate the \n     Fourth Amendment are not cured of the violation by the simple \n     expedient of a treaty ratification or an executive \n     agreement.''\n       Finally, Section 303 establishes a reasonable legal \n     standard by which the President is expected to evaluate the \n     risk posed by an individual inspector to the national \n     security or economic well-being of the United States. The \n     President has the right under the CWC to object to an \n     individual serving as an inspector in the United States. \n     Section 303 obligates him to give ``great weight to his \n     reasonable belief that . . . the participation of such an \n     individual as a member of an inspection team would pose a \n     risk to the national security or economic well-being of the \n     United States.''\n       As has been noted, the CWC provides inspectors from foreign \n     countries unprecedented access to U.S. facilities--both \n     commercial and government-related. The risk that trade \n     secrets or national security secrets could be stolen during \n     an inspection is very high. In particular, because chemicals \n     covered by the CWC are used in a variety of aerospace \n     activities--from the manufacture of advanced composites and \n     ceramics to additives for paints and fuels--dozens of defense \n     contractors are targeted for routine inspections under the \n     CWC. Thus a threat to proprietary information often also will \n     constitute a threat to national security information.\n       Certainly a number of countries intend to use CWC \n     inspections for commercial espionage. Several incidents of \n     concern have already occurred in this respect. For this \n     reason, the Senate adopted a common-sense approach to the \n     standard of evidence required by the President in exercising \n     the right of inspector refusal. A decision to apply a higher \n     evidentiary standard than ``reasonable belief'' would be \n     inconsistent with Section 303.\n       Section 304. Procedures for Inspections. Section 304 \n     contains a number of critical protections for U.S. companies. \n     First, Section 304 (b)(3)(B) requires that notification of a \n     challenge inspection pursuant to Article IX of the Convention \n     ``shall also include all appropriate evidence of reasons \n     provided by the requesting state party to the Convention for \n     seeking the inspection. The requirement for specific \n     identification of the reasons for a challenge inspection will \n     enable companies to formulate their own views on the extent \n     to which ``probable cause'' exists for such an inspection. As \n     the Committee's analysis of Sections 305 makes clear, the CWC \n     does not require a foreign country to demonstrate ``probable \n     cause'' when it initiates a challenge inspection of a \n     commercial U.S. facility. For this reason, the Congress has \n     adopted implementing legislation which specifically raises \n     the question of the constitutionality of the CWC's challenge \n     inspection regime and provides for expedited review by the \n     courts (under Section 503). Many in the Senate expect the \n     Supreme Court to rule against the constitutionality of the \n     sweeping inspection rights under Article IX of the CWC.\n       Section 304(f) allows the U.S. company or person to be \n     inspected to determine who shall take samples during an \n     inspection. It also reiterates the requirement, imposed \n     pursuant to the resolution of ratification of the CWC, that \n     ``[n]o sample collected in the United States may be \n     transferred for analysis to any laboratory outside the \n     territory of the United States.'' This provision mirrors the \n     Presidential certification requirement contained in Condition \n     18 of the resolution of ratification for the CWC.\n       The CWC explicitly affords an inspection team the right to \n     take samples on-site and, pursuant to Part II paragraph \n     (E)(55) of the Verification Annex, ``if it deems necessary, \n     to transfer samples for analysis off-site at laboratories \n     designated by the Organization.'' As Part II paragraph \n     (E)(57) makes clear: ``when off-site analysis is to be \n     performed, samples shall be analysed in at least two \n     designated laboratories.''\n       In agreeing to both Condition 18 of the CWC's resolution of \n     ratification and Section 304(f) of the implementing \n     legislation, the Executive Branch acknowledged that the \n     United States intends to field two OPCW-designated \n     laboratories. Specifically, the Department of Defense intends \n     to field a mobile laboratory which will be available to \n     analyze samples taken in the United States. While sample \n     residue left in the laboratory's equipment would preclude it \n     from leaving U.S. territory, the lab is intended to serve as \n     a counterpart to a second mobile laboratory operated by the \n     OPCW (which could be deployed to countries unable to secure \n     OPCW approval for a facility).\n       There is no treaty-requirement that analysis be done in \n     laboratories operated by countries other than the one where a \n     sample was taken. The United States may legally preclude the \n     transfer of samples overseas while still meeting the CWC \n     requirement that samples-analysis be conducted in two \n     designated laboratories.\n       Some have argued that Section 304(f) sets a ``dreadful \n     example'' prompting countries to deny foreign inspectors the \n     ability to send chemical samples abroad for analysis at \n     independent laboratories. Such arguments fail to recognize \n     several key points. First, any country that succeeds in \n     obtaining OPCW accreditation for two laboratories has the \n     treaty-right to insist that samples be analyzed ``in \n     country,'' regardless of U.S. policy.\n       Second, opponents of sampling limitations overstate the \n     scientific capacity and technical capability of proliferant \n     countries to secure OPCW approval for two laboratories. To \n     date, the OPCW has not given approval to any lab in any \n     country; certainly no country has secured approval for two. \n     Indeed, only a handful of western European countries, and \n     perhaps Russia and China, have the ability to field two \n     approved laboratories. The former countries pose no \n     proliferation concern, and both Russia and China are capable \n     of completely concealing their chemical warfare program from \n     international inspectors (making sampling irrelevant). Thus \n     the argument that U.S. strictures on sampling transfers \n     will undo the CWC's verification regime are unsupportable.\n       Third, those who criticize Section 304(f) overstate the \n     value of sampling analysis to U.S. nonproliferation efforts. \n     On March 1, 1989, then-Director of Central Intelligence, \n     Judge William Webster, pointed out the ease with which \n     chemical weapons production can be concealed: ``. . . within \n     fewer than 24 hours, some say 8\\1/2\\ hours, it would be \n     relatively easy for the Libyans to make the site [at Rabta] \n     appear to be a pharmaceutical facility. All traces of \n     chemical weapons production could be removed in that amount \n     of time.'' Similarly, delays of just a few hours have \n     undercut UNSCOM's efforts to prove Iraqi chemical and \n     biological concealment activities.\n       In contrast, the CWC gives proliferant countries five days \n     of advance warning to conceal their activities before a \n     challenge inspection team must be allowed on-site. Very \n     simple techniques, such as the production of pesticides on a \n     line used to manufacture nerve agent (e.g. production of the \n     pesticide methyl-parathion instead of the nerve agent sarin), \n     will reduce or eliminate the utility of sampling analysis.\n       Fourth, the over-focus on analysis to be done by \n     ``independent'' laboratories ignores UNSCOM's experience with \n     Iraq's VX program. In the case of samples taken from warheads \n     believed to be weaponized with VX, ``independent'' \n     laboratories in France, Switzerland, and the United States \n     have given contradictory and inconsistent analyses. This has \n     only complicated U.S. efforts to prove to the international \n     community that Saddam Hussein's nerve agent program is far \n     more advanced than admitted by Iraq. This has occurred \n     despite UNSCOM's relatively unfettered ability--at least in \n     comparison with the CWC--to take samples when and where it \n     pleases. Because the CWC's timeframes provide cheating \n     nations with ample opportunity to mask chemical warfare \n     signatures, analysis of samples at foreign laboratories is \n     guaranteed to make U.S. efforts to prove noncompliance \n     harder, not easier. This\n\n[[Page S12747]]\n\n     will be the case regardless of whether sampling analysis is \n     done ``in-country.''\n       Fifth, in addition to overselling the value of sampling \n     analysis to the CWC's verification regime, opponents of \n     Section 304(f) persist in ignoring the threat that such \n     procedures pose to legitimate commercial activities. A loss \n     of proprietary information through sample analysis would \n     bankrupt many chemical, pharmaceutical, and biotechnology \n     industries. Moreover, chemical formulas, which are the type \n     of proprietary information put at greatest risk by sampling, \n     often are not patented. This is done to preserve competitive \n     advantage and to prevent disclosure pursuant to Freedom of \n     Information Act (FOIA) requests. But the lack of a patent \n     also will make it harder for U.S. companies to prove that a \n     trade secret has been stolen.\n       The Congressional Office of Technology Assessment estimated \n     in August, 1993, that the U.S. chemical industry loses \n     approximately $3-6 billion per year in counterfeited \n     chemicals and chemical products. A U.S. pharmaceutical firm \n     spends on average about $350 million to research and develop \n     a new compound. Clearly, while it is difficult to assess the \n     potential dollar losses associated with the CWC, information \n     gleaned from sampling analysis could be worth millions of \n     dollars to foreign competitors. Equally troubling is the fact \n     that the CWC does not require the return of samples to the \n     country from which they were taken, but instead gives the \n     Technical Secretariat of the OPCW responsibility over final \n     disposition. This further increases the possibility that \n     proprietary information contained in the sample will be \n     compromised.\n       As Kathleen Bailey, then-Senior Fellow at Lawrence \n     Livermore Laboratories, warned in testimony before the \n     Foreign Relations Committee: ``Experts in my laboratory \n     recently conducted experiments to determine whether or not \n     there would be a remainder inside of the equipment that is \n     used for sample analysis on-site. They found out that, \n     indeed, there is residue remaining. And if the equipment were \n     taken off-site, off of the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory \n     site, or off of the site of a biotechnology firm, for \n     example, and further analysis were done on those residues, \n     you would be able to get classified and/or proprietary \n     information.''\n       Numerous other distinguished witnesses expressed concern \n     regarding the threat to trade secrets posed by the CWC's \n     intrusiveness, including Donald Rumsfeld, former Secretary of \n     Defense and President and former Chairman and CEO of G.D. \n     Searle and Company; James Schlesinger, former Secretary of \n     Defense and former Director of Central Intelligence; \n     Lieutenant General William Odom, former Director of the \n     National Security Agency; Lieutenant General James Williams, \n     former Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency; Edward J. \n     O'Malley, former Assistant Director of Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation, Chief of Counterintelligence; and Bruce \n     Merrifield, former Assistant Secretary of Commerce for \n     Technology. It was on the basis of the testimony of these \n     individuals, and the concerns expressed by numerous companies \n     and industries (ranging from members of the Chemical \n     Manufacturers Association and the Aerospace Industries \n     Association to other types of companies such as the one that \n     manufactures special ink for the dollar bill) that the \n     Congress chose to prohibit the transfer of samples overseas \n     for analysis.\n       Section 305. Warrants. Section 305 builds upon Condition 28 \n     of the resolution of ratification for the CWC, which required \n     the President to certify to Congress that, for any challenge \n     inspection where consent has been withheld, the United States \n     ``will first obtain a criminal search warrant based upon \n     probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and \n     describing with particularity the place to be searched and \n     the persons or things to be seized. . . .'' Further, the \n     President certified pursuant to Condition 28 that an \n     administrative search warrant issued by a United States \n     magistrate judge would be required for involuntary routine \n     inspections.\n       Accordingly, Section 305 requires Administrative search \n     warrants for routine inspections where consent has been \n     withheld. It limits routine inspections to no more than one \n     per year per plant site. Additionally, for Schedule 3 \n     facilities and sites working with discrete organic chemicals, \n     Section 305 requires the federal government to affirm in \n     an affadavit, prior to obtaining an administrative search \n     warrant, that a given routine inspection: (1) ``will not \n     cause the number of routine inspections in the United \n     States to exceed 20 in a calendar year;'' and (2) the \n     facility to be inspected was selected randomly by the \n     Technical Secretariat, taking into account equitable \n     geographic distribution of inspections and other relevant \n     information relating to the site in question. Finally, \n     Section 305 requires that the federal government stipulate \n     in its affadavit that the routine inspection will not \n     exceed the time limits specified in the Convention unless \n     the owner, operator, or agent in charge of the plant \n     agrees.\n       Section 305 requires criminal search warrants for any \n     challenge inspection where consent has been withheld. In \n     seeking the warrant, the federal government is required to \n     provide to the judge of the United States all appropriate \n     evidence or reasons showing probable cause to believe that a \n     violation of the implementing legislation (and thus the \n     treaty) is occurring.\n       In the event that a frivolous challenge inspection is \n     initiated against the United States, perhaps in retribution \n     for a U.S.-initiated inspection, the federal government may \n     prove unable to provide sufficient probable cause to obtain a \n     criminal search warrant. Under the CWC, a country wishing to \n     initiate a challenge inspection is not required to provide \n     any supporting evidence. The request for an inspection simply \n     is made; unless 31 of 41 members of the Executive Council of \n     the OPCW vote against it proceeding within 12 hours of such a \n     request, the challenge inspection will move forward. Thus the \n     ``screen'' against frivolous or abusive inspections is of a \n     political, rather than evidentiary, nature. Moreover, review \n     under the CWC of whether the challenge inspection request was \n     within the scope of the CWC, or whether the right to request \n     a challenge inspection had been abused, is allowed only \n     retroactively (following conclusion of the inspection). \n     Therefore nothing in the Convention prevents a challenge \n     inspection from being initiated against a U.S. company \n     without ``probable cause'' having been demonstrated.\n       As will be discussed in connection with Section 503, the \n     courts will ultimately serve as the final arbiter over \n     questions of the CWC's constitutionality.\n       Section 307. National Security Exception. Section 307 \n     allows the President to deny any inspection request that \n     ``may pose a threat to the national security interests of the \n     United States.'' This simple provision is designed to protect \n     the United States from frivolous inspections.\n       A recent Stimson Center report makes the claim that ``[t]he \n     national security exception negates the treaty obligation to \n     accept a challenge inspection at any U.S. location.'' This \n     statement incorrectly asserts that the United States has such \n     an obligation. Condition 28 of the resolution of ratification \n     clearly established that the United States will not agree to \n     a broad treaty obligation to accept a challenge inspection at \n     any U.S. location. Rather, the United States will agree to \n     inspections under Article IX of the CWC only in those cases \n     where either consent to an inspection has been given, or \n     probable cause has been demonstrated and a criminal search \n     warrant obtained. Under any other circumstances, no access \n     will be given.\n       Thus the argument made against Section 307 is flawed on its \n     face. Moreover, the CWC explicitly gives the United States \n     the right, for instance, under paragraph 41 of Part X of the \n     Verification Annex, to ``take such measures as are necessary \n     to protect national security.'' Indeed, as paragraph 38 makes \n     clear, access to sensitive facilities must be negotiated \n     between the inspection team and the inspected State Party; \n     moreover, the inspection team is obligated to use of the \n     least intrusive procedures possible. Under paragraph 42, \n     should the United States provide ``less than full access to \n     places, activities, or information'' the United States incurs \n     the obligation to ``make every reasonable effort to provide \n     alternative means to clarify the possible non-compliance \n     concern that generated the challenge inspection.''\n       Section 307 clarifies the fact that the President has the \n     right, both under the Constitution and pursuant to the \n     treaty, to deny a potentially-damaging inspection. However, \n     the exercise of such a denial must be made ``consistent with \n     the objective of eliminating chemical weapons.'' Thus the \n     President is obligated to provide alternative means of \n     clarifying non-compliance concerns, and must consider the \n     implications of a denial for the operation of the CWC, and \n     for U.S. nonproliferation efforts. The national security \n     interests of the United States, however, must remain \n     paramount.\n       Section 402. Prohibition Relating to Low Concentrations of \n     Schedule 2 and Schedule 3 Chemicals. The CWC does not define \n     the term ``low concentration'' as it relates to Schedule 2 \n     and Schedule 3 chemicals. Section 402 establishes the intent \n     of the United States to interpret this term to mean a 10 \n     percent concentration of a Schedule 2 chemical and an 80 \n     percent concentration of a Schedule 3 chemical (measured \n     either by volume or total weight, whichever yields the lesser \n     percent). In setting the percentages at these levels, Section \n     402 ensures that Schedule 2 chemicals, which are of direct \n     concern for chemical weapons production, are captured in low \n     concentrations. It also recognizes the broad range of \n     commercial uses for Schedule 3 chemicals, and reduces the \n     regulatory impact of the CWC on many industries.\n       No chemical is placed on Schedule 2 of the CWC unless it \n     meets specific criteria: (1) it must be lethal enough that it \n     could be used as a chemical weapon by itself; (2) it can \n     serve as a precursor in the final stage of the manufacture of \n     a chemical weapon, or otherwise is important to the \n     production of a chemical weapon; and (3) is not produced ``in \n     large commercial quantities.'' Obviously, such chemicals \n     should be tightly controlled even at relatively dilute \n     levels.\n       Schedule 3, on the other hand, contains seventeen chemicals \n     which are produced in large commercial quantities for use in \n     production of various organic chemicals and agricultural \n     products. Additionally, these chemicals are used to make \n     gasoline additives, pharmaceuticals, detergents, flame \n     retardant materials, and dyestuffs, among other things. There \n     are 17 compounds on Schedule 3.\n       Schedule 3A (4), Chloropicrin, has important uses for the \n     disinfection of cereals and grains, considerably increasing \n     the potential storage life. It is also used as a soil \n     insecticide to sterilize the soil before the planting of \n     crops that are very sensitive to weed competition.\n\n[[Page S12748]]\n\n       Schedule 3B (5), Phosphorous oxychloride, is used as an \n     insecticide, as a chlorinating agent, flame retardant, \n     gasoline additive, hydraulic fluid, organic synthesis, \n     plasticizer, and as dopant for semiconductors.\n       Phosphorous trichloride, Schedule 3B (6), is used in \n     dyestuffs, surfactants, plasticizers, gasoline additives, \n     insecticides, and in organic synthesis.\n       Phosphorous pentachloride, Schedule 3B (7), is used as a \n     pesticide, in plastics, and in organic synthesis.\n       Trimethyl phosphite, Schedule 3B (8), is used in \n     insecticides, organic synthesis, veterinary drugs.\n       Triethyl phosphite, Schedule 3B (9), is used in insecticide \n     synthesis, as a lubricant additive, in organic synthesis, and \n     as a plasticizer.\n       Schedule 3B (10), Dimethyl phosphite, is used in \n     insecticide production, as a lubricant additive, in organic \n     synthesis, and as a veterinary drug.\n       Diethyl phosphite (Schedule 3B (11)) is used in the \n     production of insecticides, as a gasoline additive, as a \n     paint solvent, in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, and in \n     organic synthesis.\n       Sulfur monochloride (Schedule 3B (12)) is used extensively \n     as an intermediate and chlorinating agent in the production \n     of dyes and insecticides. It is also used for cold \n     vulcanisation of rubber, in the treatment of vegetable oils \n     and for hardening soft woods, in pharmaceuticals, organic \n     synthesis, as a polymerization catalyst, and in the \n     extraction of gold from ores.\n       Thionyl Chloride, Schedule 3B (14), is used in batteries, \n     engineering plastics, pesticides, as a catalyst, surfactant, \n     chlorinating agent, and in organic synthesis of herbicides, \n     drugs, vitamins, and dyestuffs. Common agricultural products \n     involving this chemical are: Fenvalerate, Endosulfan, \n     Methidathion, Flucythrinate, Fluvalinate, Lethane, \n     Diphenamit, Napromaide, Propamide, Tridiphane, Topan, and \n     Pipertain.\n       Schedule 3B (17), Triethanolamine, is another chemical with \n     a widespread use. Because of its surface active properties it \n     is added to waxes and polishes and is used as a solvent for \n     herbicides, shellac and various dyes. It is also used for \n     producing emulsions of various oils, paraffins and waxes, as \n     well as for breaking up emulsion. It is an important \n     ingredient of the cutting oil used for metal shaping. Further \n     uses include in detergents, cosmetics, corrosion inhibitors, \n     as a plasticizer, rubber accelerator, and in organic \n     synthesis.\n       As can be seen from this partial listing, the majority of \n     these chemicals are used in agriculture, the automobile \n     industry, and pharmaceuticals production. The vast majority \n     are used as herbicides or insecticides/pesticides. A decision \n     to lower the percentage associated with ``low \n     concentrations'' of Schedule 3 chemicals would dramatically \n     increase the number of agricultural companies and facilities \n     subject to the CWC's onerous reporting and inspection \n     requirements. The costs resulting from such a dramatic \n     expansion of the CWC's scope would invariably be passed by \n     such companies to the one consumer who can least afford an \n     increase in operating costs at this time--the U.S. farmer.\n       Section 403. Prohibition Relating to Unscheduled Discrete \n     Organic Chemicals and Coincidental Byproducts in Waste \n     Streams. Section 403 exempts from reporting and inspection \n     any ``unscheduled discrete organic chemical'' that is a \n     ``coincidental byproduct . . . that is not isolated or \n     captured for use or sale . . . and is routed to, or escapes, \n     from the waste stream of a stack, incinerator, or wastewater \n     treatment system or any other waste stream.''\n       The CWC does not list unscheduled discrete organic \n     chemicals. Instead, it generally defines these substances as: \n     ``any chemical belonging to the class of chemical compounds \n     consisting of all compounds of carbon except for its oxides, \n     sulfides and metal carbonates, identifiable by chemical name, \n     by structural formula, if known, and by Chemical Abstracts \n     Service registry number if assigned.'' This definition \n     captures thousands of chemical compounds--so many that it is \n     impossible to list them. The CWC's sweeping definition of a \n     ``discrete organic chemical'' captures thousands of U.S. \n     companies under its reporting and inspection obligations.\n       However, that number would expand exponentially without \n     Section 403's exclusion of discrete organic chemicals which \n     form as a byproduct in a variety of manufacturing processes. \n     The declaration and inspections costs under the CWC would \n     fall on a far broader number of U.S. companies. Moreover, the \n     costs of compliance for these additional companies will be \n     far greater. Companies must declare the aggregate tonnage of \n     discrete organic chemicals produced. If ``production'' is \n     defined as the formation of coincidental byproducts in a \n     waste stream, however, many companies would find it costly, \n     and perhaps impossible, to comply with the treaty.\n       The paper industry, in particular, has expressed concern \n     over the ``discrete organic chemical category,'' warning that \n     various chemicals such as methanol, phenol, methyl ethyl \n     ketone, and methyl mercaptan are formed in the process of \n     paper manufacturing. The American Forest and Paper \n     Association warned on May 25, 1994, that ``pulp digester \n     gases containing methanol are vented, and some methanol will \n     also be lost as fugitive air emissions from the wastewater \n     treatment system. Methanol is only one component of these \n     streams; it is not isolated or captured for use or sale.''\n       Without Section 403, numerous industries are at risk of \n     being required to measure and report on countless chemical \n     interactions in waste streams, and to undergo international \n     inspection to verify the accuracy of their data. On May 21, \n     1997, the American Forest and Paper Association reiterated \n     its concern over the broad scope of the CWC and stated its \n     support for Section 403: ``We strongly support the \n     prohibition of requirements under the treaty for chemical \n     byproducts that are coincidently manufactured. Due to the \n     broad nature of the category of `discrete organic chemicals,' \n     as defined by the treaty, it is critical to recognize that \n     inclusion of coincidental byproducts of manufacturing \n     processes that are not captured or isolated for use or sale \n     would exceed the stated purpose of the CWC.''\n       Section 503. Expedited Judicial Review. Section 503 allows \n     for U.S. citizens to challenge the constitutionality of any \n     provision of the implementing legislation (and, therefore, \n     the CWC). Such a challenge must be given priority in its \n     disposition, and a prompt hearing by a full Court of Appeals \n     sitting en banc must be given to a final order entered by a \n     district court.\n       In reviewing the constitutionality of legislation, the \n     courts often assume that Congress has exercised its \n     independent judgment and that the legislation in question is \n     constitutional. However, as the legislative history of the \n     CWC makes clear, Congress expressed numerous misgivings about \n     the constitutionality of the CWC (and thus about the \n     implementing legislation required). These concerns were \n     articulated in hearings before the Committees on Foreign \n     Relations and Judiciary, and in correspondence between the \n     Senate, Executive Branch, and U.S. businesses. As has been \n     noted elsewhere, the Senate expressed some specific concerns \n     over the constitutionality of the CWC as conditions in the \n     resolution of ratification. The resolution also included \n     Condition 12, which makes clear that nothing in the CWC \n     authorizes or requires legislation, or any other action \n     prohibited by the Constitution of the United States, as \n     interpreted by the United States.\n       Many in the Congress are convinced that the Chemical \n     Weapons Convention is incompatible with the Fourth and Fifth \n     Amendment rights of Americans. It therefore is expected that \n     the courts will hold that some, or all, of the CWC and its \n     implementing legislation is unconstitutional and issue the \n     appropriate injunctions. \n\n\n         American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, as part of the omnibus appropriations \nbill the Senate today will pass the ``American Competitiveness and \nWorkforce Improvement Act.'' This legislation represents a bipartisan \ncompromise resulting from tough negotiations between the House and the \nSenate, and between Congress and the White House. The bill will be \nincluded in this form rather than being adopted freestanding because of \na last minute objection from Senator Harkin that has prevented it from \nbeing brought to the floor on its own. Given the 78 to 20 vote for the \nAmerican Competitiveness Act prior to the agreement with the White \nHouse, and the 288 to 133 vote in the bill's favor just a few weeks ago \nin the House of Representatives, it is clear the legislation would have \npassed with overwhelming support in the Senate had it been permitted to \ncome to a separate vote.\n  I believe that the passage of the American Competitiveness and \nWorkforce Improvement Act today is a great victory for American workers \nand for the businesses that employ them.\n  This legislation will protect the competitiveness of American \nbusiness in the global marketplace and improve economic and career \nopportunities for American citizens.\n  Let me start by describing the history of this legislation. This past \nFebruary, the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing at my request \nto examine high technology labor market needs. We heard from leaders at \nAmerica's top high technology firms that they simply could not find \nenough qualified professionals to fill the jobs they needed filled. \nThey also emphasized that many of the individuals they hired on H-1B \ntemporary visas not only filled important jobs, but also typically \ncreated jobs for many Americans through their skills and innovations.\n  At that time, the 65,000 cap on H-1B visas was projected to be \nreached as early as June. Instead, it was reached the first week of \nMay.\n  In March, I introduced S. 1723, the American Competitiveness Act, to \nincrease the cap on H-1B visas for foreign born professionals. In \nApril, that bill passed the Senate Judiciary Committee on a 12 to 6 \nbipartisan vote. Then in May, the bill passed on a 78 to 20 vote of the \nfull Senate.\n  Some time after that, the House Judiciary Committee passed out an H-\n1B\n\n[[Page S12749]]\n\nvisa bill as well. However, many who supported the increase in \nprinciple found that the House version included so many conditions on \nthe use of H-1B visas that they would have more than negated the \nbenefits of raising the cap. Negotiations ensued between the House and \nSenate over these provisions, brokered by the leadership of both \nchambers. The hope was to find a compromise.\n  In the end, a compromise was reached that retained the core features \nof the Senate bill but also found common ground with the House by \nfocusing increased attention and requirements on employers, more than \n15% of whose workforce are in this country on H-1B visas. The \ncompromise also imposed a fee to be paid by the employer on each visa, \nthe proceeds of which would be used for job training and scholarships.\n  On account of this last provision, the compromise bill was required \nto originate in the House. Accordingly, it was incorporated into a \nproposed amendment, whose text was worked out by me and by House \nImmigration Subcommittee Chairman Smith--a proposed amendment which \nChairman Smith was going to offer as a substitute to H.R. 3736, the \nbill that had passed out of House Judiciary.\n  As the House was preparing to take that bill up before the August \nrecess, however, the White House issued a public veto threat and listed \n15 changes it was seeking to the bill. At that point, I was deputized \nto attempt to negotiate the remaining issues with the Administration, \nin consultation with Chairman Smith and the House and Senate \nleadership.\n  After several weeks of negotiations, we reached agreement at 7:00 \np.m. on September 23. We and the Administration were able to reach an \naccommodation on most of the points it had raised. The Administration \nwithdrew the remaining two points, points 6 and 7, that in our view \ncould not be accommodated within the existing structure of the bill and \nthe H-1B program. We instead agreed on a different approach with regard \nto the concerns underlying these two points, one that focused instead \non clarifying current program requirements and toughening sanctions for \nwillful violations of these requirements.\n  Because the bill was scheduled to be taken up on the House floor the \nfollowing day, the results of the agreement had to be quickly \nincorporated into a new substitute amendment to H.R. 3736. The \nsubstitute had to be filed by Chairman Smith that evening before the \nHouse went out at 8:30 p.m. so that it could be printed in the \nCongressional Record and be made available for Members to review the \nfollowing morning. We met this deadline, the amendment was filed, and \non September 24 the amendment was adopted and the bill passed by the \nHouse with the support of a majority of both the Republican and \nDemocratic caucuses. That bill, with some technical corrections \nnecessitated by a few omissions that resulted from the tight deadline \nunder which the original version was produced, is now incorporated into \nTitle IV of Division C of the Omnibus Appropriations Bill, titled The \nAmerican Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act.\n  Let me now turn to the reasons why I believe this bill remains needed \nand indeed timely. Mr. President, throughout this session of Congress I \nhave come to the floor repeatedly to urge that we address the growing \nshortage of skilled workers for certain positions in our high \ntechnology sector. I have done this because I believe that the \ncontinued competitiveness of our high-tech sector is crucial for our \neconomic well being as a nation, and for increased economic opportunity \nfor American workers.\n  The importance of high-tech for our economy is beyond doubt. The \nimportance of high-tech for our economy is beyond doubt. According to \nthe Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis, high \ntechnology companies contributed over one-quarter of America's real \neconomic growth between 1992 and 1997. Moreover, the declining prices \nof computers, software, and semiconductors have made a substantial \ncontribution to our nation's low level of inflation, thereby improving \nthe standard of living enjoyed by millions of Americans. Without IT \nindustries to keep prices down, according to the Bureau of Economic \nAnalysis, the inflation rate would have been much higher in 1997--3.1 \npercent versus the actual level of only 2.0.\n  But high technology firms are experiencing serious worker shortages. \nA study conducted by Virginia Tech estimates that right now we have \nmore than 340,000 unfilled positions for highly skilled information \ntechnology workers. And, while Department of Labor figures project our \neconomy will produce more than 1.3 million information technology jobs \nover the next 10 years, estimates are that our universities will not \nproduce nearly that number of graduates in related fields. And this is \nnot only what academic studies are telling us. Firms across the nation \nand across my home State of Michigan have been clamoring for people to \nfill these skilled positions.\n  Of course, this issue is not only about shortages, it is about \nopportunities for innovation and expansion, since people with valuable \nskills, whatever their national origin, will always benefit our nation \nby creating more jobs for everyone.\n  Mr. President, we want and need American companies to keep and expand \nmajor operations in this country. We do not want to see American jobs \ngo overseas. But, if they are to keep their major operations in the \nUnited States, firms must find workers here who have the skills needed \nto fill important positions in their companies.\n  To make that happen in the long term, we must do more as a nation to \nencourage our young people to choose high technology fields for study \nand for their careers. In the long run this is the only way we can stay \ncompetitive and protect American jobs.\n  Through scholarships and job training, the American Competitiveness \nand Workforce Improvement Act will help us achieve this goal. It will \nprovide money and training to low income students who choose to study \nsubjects, including math, computer science and engineering, that are \nimportant to our high-tech economy. In this way the American \nCompetitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act will help bridge the gap \nbetween current job skills and the requirements of high paying, \nimportant positions in our economy.\n  However, over the short term, until we are producing more qualified \nhigh technology graduates, we must also take other steps to bridge the \ngap between high technology needs and high technology skills.\n  We currently allow companies to hire a limited number of highly \nskilled foreign born professionals to fill essential roles. To do this \nthey must go through a fairly onerous process to get one of the 65,000 \n``H-1B'' temporary worker visas allotted by the INS. Unfortunately, \nlast year our companies hit the 65,000 annual limit at the end of \nAugust. This year that limit was hit in May.\n  This bill, in addition to providing significant incentives for \nAmericans to enter the high technology sector, will temporarily raise \nthe number of H-1B visas available for the next three years. These \nadditional visas will enable companies to find the workers they need to \nkeep facilities and jobs in the United States, and keep our high-tech \nindustry competitive in the global marketplace.\n  The legislation also includes a number of provisions ensuring that \ncompanies will not replace American workers with foreign born \nprofessionals, including increased penalties and oversight, as well as \nmeasures eliminating any economic incentive to hire a foreign born \nworker if there is an American available with the skills needed to fill \nthe position.\n  I would like to thank the members of my staff who worked long hours \nnegotiating this compromise. I would also especially like to express my \npersonal gratitude to my colleagues for their support for this \nimportant legislation. I would like to thank in particular Majority \nLeader Lott, Senator Hatch, Senator McCain, Senator Gramm, Senator \nGorton, Senator Lieberman, and Senator Graham, as well as the many \ncosponsors of the bill, for their crucial support at key moments in \nthis process. I am also grateful to Senator Kohl and Senator Feinstein \nfor their support for this legislation in Committee. Finally, I would \nlike to thank the Subcommittee's Ranking Member, Senator Kennedy, for \nthe cooperation he showed in moving forward this piece of legislation \ndespite disagreement with some aspects of the bill's content.\n\n[[Page S12750]]\n\n  In the House, I would like to extend special thanks to Speaker \nGingrich, Majority Leader Armey, and Chairman Smith for helping to \nreach a compromise that has achieved a true consensus on this issue. \nRepresentatives David Dreier, Jim Rogan and David McIntosh also \nprovided leadership and help at significant junctures in this process \nand I am also grateful for their important efforts.\n  Because much of this legislation was developed after the conclusion \nof the regular Committee process, I have also prepared an explanatory \ndocument that performs the function commonly performed by the Committee \nReport of describing the legislation and the purpose and \ninterrelationship of its various provisions in detail. I ask unanimous \nconsent that this document be printed in the Record, along with a few \npages of other materials to which the document makes reference.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   The American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of 1998\n\n\nSection 401. Short Title; Table of Contents; Amendments to Immigration \n                          and Nationality Act\n\n       This section specifies the short title, the ``American \n     Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act of 1998,'' the \n     table of contents for the legislation, and the rule that \n     unless otherwise specified, the legislation amends the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act.\n     Subtitle A\n       Subtitle A contains the changes the legislation is making \n     to current law regarding H-1B visas.\n\n\n    Section 411. Temporary Increase in Access to Temporary Skilled \n                      Personnel Under H-1B Program\n\n       This section specifies the new ceilings for these visas: \n     115,000 in FY 1999 and 2000, 107,500 in FY 2001, and 65,000 \n     thereafter.\n\n\n Section 412. Protection Against Displacement of United States Workers \n                  in Case of H-1B Dependent Employers\n\n       This section adds new statements that must be included on \n     certain H-1B applications and other provisions relating to \n     these new statements and related aspects of the H-1B program.\n       Subsection 412(a) amends section 212(n)(1) of the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act to add three new statements \n     and provisions relating to these statements that must be \n     included on applications for H-1B visas filed by certain \n     employers on behalf of certain H-1B nonimmigrants. Subsection \n     412(b) contains various definitions relating to the new \n     statement requirements. Given the close nexus between these \n     two subsections, they are discussed here together, so as to \n     allow the discussion of the substantive provisions to be \n     illuminated by the discussion of the definitions.\n       1. The ``non-displacement'' attestation. Subsection (a)(1) \n     first adds a new ``non-displacement'' attestation by amending \n     section 212(n)(1) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to \n     add a new subparagraph (E)(i). This provision requires a \n     covered employer to state that its hiring of the H-1B worker \n     is not displacing a U.S. worker. The term ``displace'' is \n     defined in new subparagraph (4)(B) of section 212(n), added \n     by section 412(b) of this legislation. That paragraph states \n     that an employer ``displaces'' a U.S. worker to hire the H-1B \n     if it lays off a U.S. worker with substantially the same \n     qualifications and experience who was doing essentially the \n     same job the H-1B worker is being brought in to do. This is a \n     slight change from a similar definition used in a related \n     context in an earlier version of this legislation passed by \n     the Senate, which imposed heightened penalties for a willful \n     violation of the prevailing wage attestation where the \n     employer had ``replace[d]'' the U.S. worker with an H-1B \n     nonimmigrant. In that context S. 1723 defined ``replace'' as \n     employment of the H-1B nonimmigrant ``at the specific place \n     of employment and in the specific employment opportunity from \n     which a United States worker with substantially equivalent \n     qualifications and experience in the specific employment \n     opportunity has been laid off.''\n       The current definition defines ``displace'' as employment \n     of the nonimmigrant in a job ``that is essentially the \n     equivalent of the job'' from which the U.S. worker has been \n     laid off. The reason for the change from the original Senate \n     language is that it was thought desirable to include within \n     the scope of this prohibition situations where an employer \n     sought to evade this prohibition by laying off a U.S. worker, \n     making a trivial change in the job responsibilities, and then \n     hiring the H-1B worker for a ``different'' job. This language \n     is designed to be broad enough to cover those situations as \n     well. For similar reasons, especially given the nature of the \n     jobs in question, the geographical reach of the prohibition \n     was extended so as potentially to cover other worksites \n     within normal commuting distance of the worksite where the H-\n     1B is employed. This was to cover the eventuality that an \n     employer might try to evade this prohibition by laying off a \n     U.S. worker, hiring an H-1B worker to do that person's job, \n     but assigning the H-1B worker to a different worksite very \n     close by in order to conceal what was going on.\n       At the same time, however, the final version of this \n     language is significantly narrower than the original language \n     proposed by the House, which sought to prohibit not only one-\n     to-one replacements of laid off U.S. workers with H-1Bs, but \n     the hiring of any H-1B with similar qualifications to those \n     of any recently laid off U.S. worker. As a result, the \n     original definition of ``displace'' in the House did not \n     contain the key phrase ``from a job that is essentially the \n     equivalent of the job for which the [H-1B worker] is being \n     sought.'' That phrase was added to make clear that this \n     provision is not intended to be a generalized prohibition on \n     layoffs by covered employers seeking to bring in covered H-\n     1Bs, but rather a prohibition on a covered employer's \n     replacing a particular laid-off U.S. worker with a particular \n     covered H-1B.\n       It should be noted that the language used here is \n     deliberately different from that used in H.R. 2759, another \n     piece of legislation that we may pass today. That legislation \n     authorizes aliens to come in on temporary visas as nurses \n     under certain circumstances. In order to bring an alien in on \n     such a visa, a facility must attest that it has not laid off \n     another registered nurse within the ninety days preceding or \n     following the filing of the visa petition. That language was \n     chosen there instead of the language used here because in \n     that instance the sponsors of that legislation were \n     interested in doing more than preventing the replacement of a \n     particular U.S. nurse with a nurse holding such a visa. \n     Rather in that instance the desire was to prevent the use of \n     the visas by a facility that had laid off any registered \n     nurses within the relevant time period. Hence the sponsors \n     deliberately rejected the language used here forbidding \n     only one-for-one displacement in favor of broader \n     language.\n       The language in the final version of this bill does allow \n     the Department of Labor to pursue instances where an employer \n     has in fact laid off a U.S. worker and hired an H-1B worker \n     to do the U.S. worker's job, but is attempting to conceal \n     that fact with a slight change in job responsibilities or by \n     placing the H-1B worker at a different worksite. It is not, \n     however, intended to go beyond that. Hence, it does not \n     empower the Department of Labor to find a violation of this \n     clause unless an H-1B worker is being brought in to replace a \n     particular laid-off U.S. worker and do that particular U.S. \n     worker's job. It should also be noted that under new \n     paragraph (E)(i), in order to qualify, the displacement has \n     to have occurred within 90 days before or after filing the H-\n     1B petition. This was viewed as the outer limit for how long \n     an employer might leave open a job previously held by a U.S. \n     worker whom the employer intended to replace with an H-1B \n     worker, or how long the employer might retain the U.S. worker \n     while also hiring the H-1B worker. In most instances, to \n     constitute a genuine instance of replacement, the layoff and \n     hiring would be expected to occur closer in time.\n       Finally, the definition of ``lays off'' set out in new \n     subparagraph (3)(D) of 212(n) (added by section 412(b) of \n     this legislation) hews closely to the language contained in \n     the original Senate version of this legislation, with two \n     minor changes. First, while continuing to exclude the \n     expiration of a temporary employment contract from the \n     definition, the final version clarifies that the expiration \n     of such a contract will be treated as a layoff if an employer \n     enters into such a contract with the specific intent of \n     evading the anti-displacement attestations contained in new \n     paragraphs (E) and (F) of subsection 212(n)(1). Second, the \n     final version notes that its definition of layoff is not \n     intended to supersede the rights employees may have under \n     collective bargaining agreements or other employment \n     contracts. By the same token, of course, the fact that an \n     employee may have protection under a collective bargaining \n     agreement or other employment contract against some of the \n     grounds for termination listed as exceptions to the \n     definition of ``lays off'' in this legislation has no \n     consequence for purposes of determining whether an employer \n     has violated the displacement attestation. Rather, the \n     employee's remedies for breach of the agreement or contract \n     remain as they were under the agreement, contract, and pre-\n     existing law, and are neither expanded nor contracted by \n     212(n)(3)(D). In other words, whether a layoff does or does \n     not violate such an agreement has no bearing on whether it is \n     within or outside the definition set out in 212(n)(3)(D) (and \n     hence has no bearing on whether it is actionable by the \n     Secretary of Labor under her authorities to enforce the ``no \n     displacement'' attestation). Conversely, the fact that a \n     layoff is outside the definition set out in 212(n)(3)(D) has \n     no bearing on whether it violates a collective bargaining \n     agreement or other employment contract and hence on whether \n     it is actionable by the employee using the remedies available \n     under other laws for such violations.\n       In determining whether or not a U.S. worker has been \n     offered a ``similar employment opportunity'' as an \n     alternative to loss of employment, and hence has not been \n     laid off, it is the intent of Congress that the determination \n     of similarity take into account factors such as level of \n     authority and responsibility to the previous job, level \n     within the overall organization, and other similar factors, \n     but that it not include the location of the job opportunity.\n       If an employer asserts that it should not be held liable \n     for a violation of the displacement attestation because a \n     U.S. worker lost\n\n[[Page S12751]]\n\n     his or her employment as the basis for an employee's loss of \n     employment one of the listed exceptions, it is Congress's \n     expectation that if the Secretary disputes that, she would \n     have the burden of disproving the employer's assertion.\n       2. The ``secondary non-displacement'' attestation. Section \n     412(a) next adds a ``secondary non-displacement'' attestation \n     by amending section 212(n)(1) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act to include a new subparagraph (F). This \n     attestation requires a covered employer to pledge to make \n     certain inquiries before placing a covered H-1B worker with \n     any other employer where the H-1B worker would essentially be \n     functioning as an employee of the other employer. The \n     requirement that there be ``indicia of employment'' between \n     the employer with whom the covered employer is placing the \n     covered H-1B worker and the H-1B worker is intended to \n     operate similarly to the provisions in the Internal Revenue \n     Code in determining whether or not an individual is an \n     employee.\n       In particular, the covered employer must promise to inquire \n     whether the other employer will be using the H-1B worker to \n     displace a U.S. worker whom the other employer had laid off \n     or intends to lay off within 90 days of the placement of the \n     H-1B worker. The covered employer must also state that it has \n     no knowledge that the other employer has done so or intends \n     to do so.\n       Making the required inquiries will not insulate a covered \n     employer from liability should the secondary employer with \n     which the covered employer is placing the covered H-1B worker \n     turn out to have displaced a U.S. worker from the job that it \n     has contracted with the covered employer to have the H-1B \n     worker fill. That is why subsection 412(a)(2) of this \n     legislation adds a new requirement to section 212(n)(1) that \n     the application contain a clear statement regarding the scope \n     of a covered employer's liability with respect to a layoff by \n     a secondary employer with whom the covered employer places a \n     covered H-1B worker. If the covered employer does make the \n     required inquiries and obtains no information that would lead \n     it to believe that the secondary employer has used the H-1B \n     worker to displace a U.S. worker, however, that should weigh \n     heavily in favor of the covered employer's not having \n     knowledge or reason to know of the secondary employer's \n     actions for purposes of the penalty provisions associated \n     with this attestation specified in new subparagraph (E) of \n     section 212(n)(2) (added by section 413(c)).\n       This provision uses the same definitions of ``displace,'' \n     ``lays off,'' and other definitions as those used by the \n     primary non-displacement attestation.\n       3. The ``recruitment'' attestation. The last new required \n     statement added by section 412(a) is the ``recruitment'' \n     attestation, to be set out in new subparagraph (G) of section \n     212(n)(1). It requires a covered employer to state that it \n     has taken good faith steps to recruit U.S. workers for the \n     job for which it is seeking the H-1B worker, and has offered \n     the job to any equally or better qualified U.S. worker.\n       This provision allows employers to use normal recruiting \n     practices standard to similar employers in their industry in \n     the United States; it is not meant to require employers to \n     comply with any specific recruiting regimen or practice or to \n     confer any authority on DOL to establish such regimens by \n     regulation or guideline. Further, it is the intent of \n     Congress that this provision not require an employer to set \n     aside its normal standards for selection and recruitment of \n     employees, including, but not limited to, legitimate \n     objective criteria and legitimate subjective criteria such as \n     past job performance, attitude, personal presentation or \n     others, as long as the employer does not intentionally \n     discriminate against any applicant based on that applicant's \n     immigration status, citizenship status, or country of \n     nationality in the course of applying these criteria.\n       This intention is further spelled out in section 412(a)(3) \n     of this legislation. That section adds language at the end of \n     section 212(n)(1) that states explicitly that the recruitment \n     attestation is not to be construed to preclude an employer \n     from using ``legitimate selection criteria relevant to the \n     job that are normal or customary to the type of job \n     involved.'' The purpose of this language is to make clear \n     that an employer may use ordinary selection criteria in \n     evaluating the relative qualifications of an H-1B worker and \n     a U.S. worker. It is intended to emphasize that the \n     obligation to hire a U.S. worker who is ``equally or better \n     qualified'' is not intended to substitute someone else's \n     judgment for the employer's regarding the employer's hiring \n     needs. Rather, the employer remains free to use ordinary \n     hiring criteria, whether subjective or objective, in deciding \n     who in the employer's view is the right person for the job. \n     Moreover, its judgment as to what qualifications are relevant \n     to a particular job is entitled to very significant \n     deference.\n       At the same time, this rule of construction is intended to \n     insure that U.S. workers are given a fair chance at any job, \n     rather than being turned down as a result of prejudice a \n     particular employer may have against U.S. workers. It is not \n     intended to allow an employer to impose spurious hiring \n     criteria with the intent of discriminating against U.S. \n     applicants in favor of H-1Bs and thereby subvert employer \n     obligations to hire an equally or better qualified U.S. \n     worker.\n       The provision is, however, intended to insure that a \n     properly deferential and latitudinous understanding of the \n     notion of relevant qualifications is used in interpreting \n     these provisions. In that regard, it is emphatically not \n     Congress's intention to invite the kind of elaborate scrutiny \n     of selection criteria and the accompanying ``validation'' \n     machinery that has developed under ``disparate impact'' \n     analysis of such criteria under Executive Order 11246 and \n     Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Given the absence \n     of any kind of record that employers use hiring criteria as a \n     covert mechanism for preferring non-U.S. workers, such an \n     analysis would make no sense in this context. That is why the \n     bill deliberately avoids terms like ``job-related,'' \n     ``related to the job'', or the ``use'' of selection criteria \n     to discriminate.\n       Rather, what is intended is a common-sensical approach, \n     under which an employer does not have to prove that ordinary \n     selection criteria such as class rank, a degree from a \n     superior school, people skills, recommendations from former \n     employers, or qualities such as dependability are a \n     legitimate basis on which to prefer one applicant over \n     another. Likewise, the employer need not prove that a \n     particular qualification or skill that it is looking for and \n     that in a common-sense world would obviously be relevant, \n     helpful, or useful to doing a job is necessary or \n     indispensable in order to be able to consider that \n     qualification or skill in its selection decisions. \n     Additionally, business reasons such as the relative salary \n     demands of competing candidates may also legitimately be \n     considered, although only, of course, to the extent \n     consistent with the employer's obligation under section \n     212(n)(1)(A) to pay the higher of prevailing or actual wage. \n     For similar reasons, the intent is not to require employers \n     to retain extensive documentation in order to be able \n     retroactively to justify recruitment and hiring decisions, \n     provided that the employer can give an articulable reason for \n     the decisions that it actually made.\n       4. Employers and H-1B workers covered by the new \n     statements. Section 412(a) of this legislation adds a new \n     subparagraph (E)(ii) to section 212(n)(1) which specifies \n     which employers have to include the new statements on their \n     applications. There are two categories of covered employers: \n     (1) ``H-1B dependent'' employers and (2) employers who, after \n     enactment of the Act, have been found to have committed a \n     willful failure to meet a condition set out in section \n     212(n)(1) or a willful misrepresentation of material fact on \n     a labor condition attestation.\n       The first category, ``H-1B dependent'' employers, is \n     defined in new paragraph (3)(A) of section 212(n), added by \n     section 412(b) of this legislation. Under that definition, an \n     employer is H-1B dependent if it has 51 or more full-time \n     equivalent employees, 15% or more of whom are H-1B workers. \n     Employers with 25 or fewer full-time equivalent employees are \n     H-1B dependent if they have more than 7 H-1B employees, and \n     employers with between 26 and 50 full-time equivalent \n     employees are H-1B dependent if they have more than 12 H-1B \n     employees.\n       The second category of covered employers is those who have \n     been found to have committed a willful failure or a willful \n     misrepresentation under 212(n)(2)(C) or 212(n)(5). These \n     employers must include the new statements on their \n     applications for five years after the finding of violation. \n     Of course, in order to trigger coverage, the finding of \n     willful violation must have been made in a manner consistent \n     with the other procedural requirements in the Act, including \n     the prohibition on the investigation of complaints or other \n     information provided more than 12 months after the alleged \n     violation, see 212(n)(2)(A) and 212(n)(2)(G)(v). Thus, this \n     provision confers no superseding authority for DOL to take \n     action with respect to violations outside that time period.\n       Under new subparagraph (E)(ii) of 212(n)(1), employers \n     required to include the new statements on their applications \n     are excused from doing so on applications that are filed only \n     on behalf of ``exempt'' H-1B nonimmigrants. An ``exempt'' H-\n     1B nonimmigrant is defined in new paragraph (3)(B) of section \n     212(n) (added by section 102(b) of this legislation) as one \n     whose wages, including cash bonuses and other similar \n     compensation, are equal to at least $60,000 or who has a \n     master's or higher degree (or its equivalent). In determining \n     whether an employer is H-1B dependent, under new paragraph \n     (3)(C) (also added by section 412(b) of this legislation), \n     these exempt H-1Bs are excluded from both the numerator and \n     denominator in the calculation of the percentage (or, in the \n     case of employers with 50 or fewer full-time equivalent \n     employees, from the count of both total full-time equivalent \n     employees and the count of H-1Bs) for the first six months \n     after enactment, or until promulgation of final regulations, \n     whichever is longer.\n       Finally, subparagraph (E)(ii) specifies that the \n     requirement to include the new statements on applications \n     applies only to applications filed before October 1, 2001.\n       Subsection 412(c) authorizes employers to post information \n     relating to H-1Bs electronically. This provision is intended \n     to allow employers a choice of methods for informing their \n     employees of the sponsorship of an H-1B nonimmigrant. An \n     employer may either post a physical notice in the traditional \n     manner, or may post or transmit the identical information \n     electronically in the same manner as it posts or transmits \n     other company notices to employees. Therefore, use of \n     electronic posting by employers should not be restricted by \n     regulation.\n       Subsection 412(d) makes the new attestation requirements \n     effective on the date of issuance of final regulations to \n     carry them\n\n[[Page S12752]]\n\n     out, and the associated definitions and the new posting \n     provision effective upon enactment.\n       Subsection 412(e) allows the Secretary of Labor and the \n     Attorney General to reduce the period for public comment on \n     proposed regulations to no less than 30 days.\n\n\n           Section 413. Changes in Enforcement and Penalties\n\n       This section specifies the penalty structure for failures \n     to meet the new labor conditions added by section 412. It \n     also raises penalties for willful failures to meet existing \n     labor conditions, and imposes a special penalty for a willful \n     violation of such a condition in the course of which an \n     employer displaces a U.S. worker. It also clarifies that \n     certain kinds of employer conduct constitute a violation of \n     the prevailing wage attestation, and that other kinds of \n     employer conduct are also prohibited in the context of the H-\n     1B program. Finally, it grants certain new authorities to the \n     Secretary of Labor and establishes a special enforcement \n     mechanism administered by the Attorney General to address \n     alleged violations of the selection portion of the \n     recruitment attestation.\n       Subsection 413(a) sets out a new version of 212(n)(2)(C) of \n     the Immigration and Nationality Act, the provision currently \n     specifying the penalties for certain failures to meet labor \n     conditions. In that subparagraph as amended, clause (i) \n     specifies the penalties for a failure to meet a condition of \n     paragraph (1)(B) (strike or lockout) or a substantial failure \n     to meet a condition of paragraph (1)(C) (posting) or (1)(D) \n     (contents of application), or a misrepresentation of material \n     fact. These remain as they are under current law: \n     administrative remedies including a $1000 fine per violation \n     and a one-year debarment. The clause also specifies that \n     these penalties also apply to a failure to meet a condition \n     of new paragraphs (1)(E) or (1)(F) (the non-displacement \n     attestations) and to a substantial failure to meet a \n     condition of new paragraph (1)(G)(i)(I) (good faith \n     recruitment). The Secretary should consider an employer's \n     compliance with the H-1B program as a whole in determining \n     whether a ``substantial failure'' has occurred.\n       New clause (ii) of section 212(n)(2)(C) sets out the new \n     increased penalties for willful failures to meet any \n     condition in paragraph (1), willful misrepresentations of \n     material fact, or violations of new clause (iv) prohibiting \n     retaliation against whistleblowers. These consist of \n     administrative remedies including a $5000 civil fine per \n     violation and a 2 year debarment.\n       New clause (iii) sets out a further enhanced penalty for \n     willful failures to meet a condition of paragraph (1) or \n     willful misrepresentations of material fact in the course of \n     which failure or misrepresentation the employer displaced a \n     U.S. worker within 90 days before or after the date of the \n     filing of the visa petition for the H-1B worker by whom the \n     U.S. worker was displaced. This penalty consists of \n     administrative remedies including a $35,000 per violation \n     civil fine and a three year debarment.\n       The rationale for this new penalty is that there have been \n     expressions of concern that employers are bringing in H-1B \n     workers to replace more expensive U.S. workers whom they are \n     laying off. Current law, however, requires employers to pay \n     the higher of the prevailing or the actual wage to an H-1B \n     worker. Thus, the only way an employer could profitably be \n     systematically doing what has been being suggested is by \n     willfully violating this obligation. Otherwise, the employer \n     would have no economic reason for preferring an H-1B worker \n     to a U.S. worker as a potential replacement. Thus, the new \n     penalty set out in new clause (iii) is designed to assure \n     that there are adequate sanctions for (and hence adequate \n     deterrence against) any such conduct by imposing a severe \n     penalty on a willful violation of the existing wage-payment \n     requirements in the course of which an employer \n     ``displaces'' a U.S. worker with an H-1B worker.\n       At the same time, Congress chose not to make the layoff \n     itself a violation. The reason for this is that there are \n     many reasons completely unconnected to the hiring of H-1B \n     workers why an employer may decide to lay off U.S. workers: \n     for example, because it decides to discontinue a product line \n     that is losing money, because it is inefficient to maintain \n     an office in a particular location, or because it has decided \n     to refocus on other aspects of its business. Congress did not \n     want to turn these legitimate business decisions into \n     investigable, let alone punishable events. Accordingly, it is \n     important to understand that unlike the new attestation \n     requirements imposed by the amendments to section 212(n)(1), \n     clause (iii) of section 212(n)(2)(C) provides no new \n     independent basis for DOL to investigate an employer's layoff \n     decisions. The only point at which DOL can do so pursuant to \n     clause (iii) is after it has already found that the employer \n     has committed a willful violation of one of the pre-existing \n     labor condition attestations.\n       Thus, just as was the case before enactment of clause \n     (iii), to be actionable by DOL in the first instance, except \n     where an employer has executed one of the new attestations \n     added to section 212(n)(1), an allegation must provide \n     reasonable cause to believe not that an employer has \n     displaced a U.S. worker with an H-1B worker but that an \n     employer has violated one of the pre-existing attestations \n     (and, of course, the other procedural requirements for \n     initiation of an investigation must be satisfied as well). \n     Clause (iii) comes into play only after DOL has found that an \n     employer has committed such a violation, and after it has \n     been found to be willful. At that point, and not before, \n     provided that there is reasonable cause to believe that an \n     employer had also displaced a U.S. worker in the course of \n     committing that violation, it would be proper for DOL to \n     investigate, but only in order to ascertain what penalty \n     should be imposed. The definitions concerning \n     ``displacement'' and the like, set out in new 212(n)(3) and \n     212(n)(4) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, and \n     discussed in the previous portion of this section-by-section \n     analysis dealing with the amendments to that Act made by \n     section 412 of this legislation, apply in this context as \n     well.\n       The ``administrative remedies'' all these clauses refer to \n     (as well as those referred to in new subparagraph \n     212(n)(5)(E) added by subsection 413(b) of this Act) are \n     unchanged from the ``administrative remedies'' the current \n     version of 212(n)(2)(C) makes available. It should be noted \n     that these do not include an order to an employer to hire, \n     reinstate, or give back pay to a U.S. worker as a result of \n     any violation an employer may commit. In current law, the \n     Secretary's authority to issue an order for back pay even \n     with respect to H-1B workers who are not paid the prevailing \n     wage does not come from the ``administrative remedies'' \n     authority granted in 212(n)(2)(C) but from a separate \n     provision, 212(n)(2)(D), specifically authorizing the \n     issuance of ``order[s] . . . for payment of such amounts of \n     back pay as may be required to comply with the requirements \n     of paragraph (1), whether or not a penalty under subparagraph \n     (C) has been imposed.'' That subparagraph would have been \n     worded quite differently if the authority it granted was \n     already included in the ``administrative remedies'' authority \n     granted under subparagraph (C).\n       This construction of the phrase is reinforced by the fact \n     that suggestions from a number of quarters, including the \n     Administration, that the Secretary should be granted the \n     authority to issue orders of this type with respect to U.S. \n     workers, were advanced and ultimately rejected in the final \n     version of this legislation. In the course of negotiations \n     leading to the bill currently before the Senate, the \n     Administration ultimately was forced to accept the reality \n     that authority of this type could not be conferred without \n     radically transforming the way this program operates and \n     indicated that acceptance by withdrawing its demand for this \n     authority in favor of other concessions. The relevant \n     documents from the Administration demonstrating this are \n     submitted for the record following this statement. As can be \n     seen, the initial document contains a point 7 seeking this \n     authority, and that point 7 is crossed out in the later \n     document. The reason suggestions for inclusion of this type \n     of authority were ultimately rejected was the sense that they \n     would end up transforming the traditional enforcement model \n     used for the current program into something more resembling a \n     new font of civil employment litigation.\n       New clause (iv) essentially codifies current Department of \n     Labor regulations concerning whistleblowers. It is included \n     not in order to change current standards concerning when a \n     person has been the victim of retaliation, but because the \n     source of statutory authority for the current regulations is \n     somewhat unclear.\n       New clause (v) is intended to complement clause (iv) by \n     directing the Secretary of Labor and the Attorney General to \n     devise a process to make it easy for someone who has filed a \n     complaint under clause (iv) to seek a new job. It is \n     contemplated that this process would be expeditious and easy \n     to use, so that the employee does not need to wait for a new \n     employer to obtain approval for a new petition in order to \n     change jobs in these circumstances.\n       New clause (vi)(I) prohibits employers from requiring H-1B \n     workers to pay a penalty for leaving an employer's employ \n     before a date agreed to between the employer and the worker. \n     It directs that the Secretary is to decide the question \n     whether a required payment is a prohibited penalty as opposed \n     to a permissible liquidated damages clause under relevant \n     State law (i.e. the State law whose application choice of law \n     principles would dictate). Thus, this section does not itself \n     create a new federal definition of ``penalty'', and it \n     creates no authority for the Secretary to devise any kind of \n     federal law on this issue, whether through regulations or \n     enforcement actions. If the Secretary determines that a \n     required payment is a prohibited penalty under governing \n     State law, however, under this provision, it is also a \n     violation of new clause (vi)(I), and the Secretary may take \n     action under new subclause (vi)(III).\n       New clause (vi)(II) prohibits employers from requiring H-1B \n     workers to reimburse or otherwise compensate employers for \n     the new fee imposed under new section 214(c)(9), or to accept \n     such reimbursement or compensation.\n       New clause (vi)(III) specifies that the penalty for \n     violating subclauses (I) or (II) is a civil monetary penalty \n     of $1,000 per violation and the return to the H-1B worker (or \n     to the Treasury, if the H-1B worker cannot be located) of the \n     required payment made by the worker to the employer.\n       New clause (vii) addresses an issue known colloquially as \n     ``benching.'' This issue involves a practice under which an \n     employer brings over an H-1B worker on the promise that the \n     worker will be paid a certain wage, but then pays the worker \n     only a fraction of that wage because the employer does not \n     have work for the H-1B worker to do. There\n\n[[Page S12753]]\n\n     is a shortage of evidence on the extent to which employers \n     are engaging in this practice. The anecdotal information \n     suggests that to the extent employers are engaging in it, \n     they are likely principally to be contractors who hire out \n     their employees to other employers for particular projects.\n       Subclause (I) clarifies that this practice of ``benching'' \n     is a violation of the employer's obligation to pay the \n     prevailing or actual wage. It is the intent and understanding \n     of Congress that this includes an obligation to provide the \n     full benefits package that the employer would provide to a \n     U.S. worker as required under clause (viii) discussed below.\n       Subclause (II) further clarifies that in the case of an H-\n     1B worker designated as a part-time employee on a visa \n     petition, an employer commits this violation by failing to \n     pay the H-1B worker for the number of hours, if any, the \n     employer has designated on the petition at the rate of pay \n     designated on the petition. Nothing in subclause (II) is \n     intended to preclude H-1B employment on a part-time or as-\n     needed basis, so long as that is the understanding on which \n     the H-1B employee was hired, or to impose or authorize the \n     Secretary of Labor or the Attorney General to impose any new \n     requirement that the employer designate in advance the hours \n     a part-time H-1B employee is expected to work. Additionally, \n     nothing in subclauses (I) or (II) is intended to give the \n     Department of Labor the authority to reclassify an employee \n     designated as part-time as full-time based on the employee's \n     actual workload after the employee begins employment. \n     Finally, of course, nothing in clause (vii) is intended to \n     prohibit an employer from terminating an H-1B worker's \n     employment on account of lack of work or for any other \n     reason.\n       Subclause (III) describes the manner in which the \n     provisions of subclauses (I) and (II) apply to an employee \n     who has not yet entered into employment with an employer. In \n     such cases, the employer's obligation is to pay the H-1B \n     worker the required wage beginning 30 days after the H-1B \n     worker is first admitted, or in the case of a nonimmigrant \n     already in the United States and working for a different \n     employer, 60 days after the date the H-1B worker becomes \n     eligible to work for the new employer. If a change of status \n     or other formalities beyond approval of the petition are \n     required in order for the latter nonimmigrant to be eligible \n     to work for the employer, the 60 days begin to run on the \n     date that the last formality necessary to make the H-1B \n     worker eligible to work for the employer has been completed.\n       Subclause (IV) makes clear that an employer does not commit \n     a violation of the prevailing/actual wage attestation by \n     granting an H-1B worker a period of unpaid leave or reduced \n     pay for reduced hours worked at the request of the H-1B \n     worker. Thus, H-1B employees taking unpaid leave for other \n     reasons, i.e. leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act or \n     other corporate policies, annual plant shutdowns for holidays \n     or retooling, summer recess or semester breaks, or personal \n     days or vacations, should not be considered ``benched.'' It \n     is possible, of course, that the employer might violate some \n     other law, either State or federal, by failing to pay an \n     H-1B worker for leave time, if that law requires employers \n     to pay workers for such leave periods. It is also possible \n     that the employer might violate new clause (viii) of \n     section 212(n)(2)(C), discussed below, if it would \n     ordinarily offer similarly situated U.S. workers paid \n     leave and is singling out the H-1B worker for denial of \n     this benefit. Hence the inclusion of subclause (VI), which \n     makes clear that the fact that a practice is within an \n     exception covered by this subclause does not insulate it \n     from challenge under clause (viii). If the leave is \n     requested by the H-1B worker, however, it does not present \n     a clause (vii) issue.\n       Subclause (V) is intended to make clear that a school or \n     other educational institution that customarily pays employees \n     an annual salary in disbursements over fewer than 12 months \n     may pay an H-1B worker in the same manner without violating \n     clause (vii), provided that the H-1B worker agrees to this \n     payment schedule in advance. Because Congress is not aware of \n     all the possible kinds of legitimate salary arrangements that \n     employers may establish, the situation covered by subclause \n     (V) may be merely illustrative of other kinds of legitimate \n     salary arrangements under which an employee's rate of pay may \n     vary. Accordingly, so long as an H-1B worker is not being \n     singled out by such a salary arrangement, it is not \n     Congress's intent that such a salary arrangement be treated \n     as suspect under or violative of clause (vii) merely because \n     there is no special provision like subclause (V) addressing \n     it. To the contrary, if it is an arrangement that the \n     employer routinely uses with U.S. employees as well as H-1B \n     workers, it should be treated as presumptively not a \n     violation of that clause.\n       Clause (viii) adds an additional clarification concerning \n     an employer's obligations under the attestation set forth in \n     212(n)(1)(A). It states that it is a violation of those \n     obligations for an employer to fail to offer benefits and \n     eligibility for benefits to H-1B workers on the same basis, \n     and in accordance with the same criteria, as the employer \n     offers benefits and eligibility for benefits to U.S. workers. \n     This obligation is only an obligation to make benefits \n     available to an H-1B worker if an employer would make those \n     benefits available to the H-1B worker if he or she were a \n     U.S. worker. Thus, if an employer offers benefits to U.S. \n     workers who hold certain positions, it must offer those same \n     benefits to H-1B workers who hold those positions. \n     Conversely, if an employer does not offer a particular \n     benefit to U.S. workers who hold certain positions, it is not \n     obligated to offer that benefit to an H-1B worker. Similarly, \n     if an employer offers performance-based bonuses to certain \n     categories of U.S. workers, it must give H-1B workers in the \n     same categories the same opportunity to earn such a bonus, \n     although it does not have to give the H-1B worker the actual \n     bonus if the H-1B worker does not earn it. While this clause \n     is not intended to require that H-1B workers be given access \n     to more or better benefits than a U.S. worker who would be \n     hired for the same position, it does not forbid an employer \n     from doing so. For example, an employer might conclude that \n     it will pay foreign relocation expenses for an H-1B worker \n     whereas it will not pay such relocation expenses for a U.S. \n     worker.\n       Clause (viii)'s phrasing of the employer's duty as an \n     obligation to provide ``benefits and eligibility for \n     benefits'', rather than just one or the other, was chosen to \n     protect against two eventualities. On the one hand, it would \n     not be proper for an employer to make an H-1B worker \n     ``eligible'' for benefits on the same basis as its U.S. \n     workers but then proceed to actually provide them to its U.S. \n     workers but never provide them to the H-1B worker. While this \n     construction of an obligation to make a person ``eligible'' \n     for a benefit may seem a little strained, sufficient concerns \n     were expressed about this possibility that it seemed worth \n     eliminating any ambiguity on the point by including the first \n     prong of the obligation. On the other hand, in order actually \n     to receive many kinds of benefits, employees are frequently \n     required to take some kind of action on their end, whether to \n     select a plan, to provide partial payment for the benefits, \n     to work for the employer for a certain period of time, or to \n     perform at a high level. The actual provision of other kinds \n     of benefits may also turn on other contingencies, such as, in \n     the case of some kinds of bonuses and stock options, the \n     company's year-end performance. Accordingly, the core \n     obligation that makes sense with respect to many benefits is \n     an obligation to make H-1B workers ``eligible'' for them. \n     Finally, the obligation is to make the H-1B worker eligible \n     ``on the same basis, and in accordance with the same \n     criteria'' as U.S. workers. Thus, in determining whether an \n     employer is meeting this obligation, care must be taken to \n     find the right U.S. worker to whom to compare the H-1B worker \n     in terms of access to benefits.\n       A few examples are useful in understanding this important \n     principle. If a particular benefit is available only to an \n     employer's professional staff, then it only need be made \n     available to an H-1B filling a professional staff position. \n     If an employer's practice is not to offer benefits to part-\n     time or temporary U.S. workers, then it is not required to \n     offer benefits to part-time H-1B workers or temporary H-1B \n     workers employed for similar periods. If an employer's \n     practice is to have its U.S. workers brought in on temporary \n     assignment from a foreign affiliate of the employer remain on \n     the foreign affiliate's benefits plan, then it must allow its \n     H-1B workers brought in on similar assignments to do the \n     same. Likewise, in that instance, it need not provide the H-\n     1B workers with the benefits package it offers to its U.S. \n     workers based in the U.S. Indeed, even if it does not have \n     any U.S. workers stationed abroad whom it has brought in in \n     this fashion, it should be allowed to keep the H-1B worker on \n     its foreign payroll and have that employee continue to \n     receive the benefits package that other workers stationed at \n     its foreign office receive in order to allow the H-1B worker \n     to maintain continuity of benefits. In that instance, the \n     basis on which the worker is being disqualified from \n     receiving U.S. benefits (that he or she is receiving a \n     different benefits package from a foreign affiliate) is one \n     that, if there were any U.S. workers who were similarly \n     situated, would be applied in the same way to those workers. \n     Hence the H-1B worker is being treated as eligible for \n     benefits on the same basis and according to the same criteria \n     as U.S. workers. It is just that the criterion that \n     disqualifies him or her happens not to disqualify any U.S. \n     workers. Or to put the point a little differently: the H-1B \n     worker is being given different benefits from the U.S. \n     workers not because of the worker's status as an H-1B worker \n     but because of his or her status as a permanent employee of a \n     foreign affiliate with a different benefits package.\n       This provision is not meant to supersede an employer's \n     obligations under other provisions of the law, or its \n     obligations to comply with international agreements governing \n     social security benefits, taxes, retirement plans or other \n     similar benefits. Finally, this provision does not require an \n     employer to offer benefits or any particular category of \n     benefits to its H-1B workers (or anyone else) if its practice \n     is not to offer benefits or the particular category of \n     benefits to its similarly situated U.S. workers.\n       Section 413(b) adds a new paragraph (5) at the end of \n     212(n) that sets out the exclusive remedial mechanism for \n     alleged violations of the selection portion of the \n     recruitment attestation set out in new paragraph \n     212(n)(1)(G)(i)(II) or any alleged misrepresentations \n     relating to that attestation. It also contains a savings \n     clause that states that it should not be construed to affect \n     the Secretary or the Attorney General's authorities with \n     respect to other violations. This was to address the possible \n     case where evidence\n\n[[Page S12754]]\n\n     tending to establish a violation of the selection attestation \n     also tends to establish a violation of some other \n     attestation. This savings clause, however, is not meant to \n     serve as a backdoor way around the exclusivity of the remedy \n     set out in 212(n)(5) for a violation of the selection \n     attestation itself. It should also be noted that by setting \n     up separate mechanisms, one lodged at Labor concerning \n     recruitment and one lodged at Justice concerning selection, \n     this provision contemplates that the two different kinds of \n     violations be handled differently. Thus, it does not \n     contemplate, for example, recharacterizing a ``failure to \n     select'' complaint as a ``failure to recruit in good faith'' \n     and then using the enforcement regime for the latter category \n     of violations to pursue what in fact is a ``failure to \n     select'' complaint. Moreover, it is unlikely that evidence \n     tending to establish a violation of the selection attestation \n     would tend to establish a violation of the recruitment \n     attestation, since such evidence, whatever else it would tend \n     to prove, would tend to prove that the employer had made \n     sufficient efforts to recruit that others applied for the \n     job. Finally, it should be noted that nothing in this section \n     should be construed to give the Attorney General or the \n     Department of Labor any authority to write regulations or \n     guidelines concerning permissible and impermissible selection \n     criteria or mechanisms for determining when such selection \n     criteria are permissible or impermissible.\n       Under the enforcement scheme set up by paragraph (5), any \n     person aggrieved by an alleged violation of \n     212(n)(1)(G)(i)(II) or a related misrepresentation who has \n     applied in a reasonable manner for the job at issue may file \n     a complaint with the Attorney General within 12 months of the \n     date of the violation or misrepresentation. The Attorney \n     General is charged with establishing a mechanism for pre-\n     screening such a complaint to determine whether it provides \n     reasonable cause to believe that such a violation or \n     misrepresentation has occurred. If the Attorney General does \n     find reasonable cause, she is charged with initiating binding \n     arbitration proceedings by requesting the Federal Mediation \n     and Conciliation Service to appoint an arbitrator from the \n     Service's roster.\n       The arbitrator is to be selected in accordance with the \n     procedures and rules of the Service. He or she should have \n     experience with personnel decisions in the industry to which \n     the employer belongs, unless for some reason this is not \n     possible. The fees and expenses for the arbitrator are to be \n     paid by the Attorney General.\n       The arbitrator is charged with deciding whether the alleged \n     violation or misrepresentation occurred and whether, if it \n     occurred, it was willful. The complainant has the burden of \n     establishing such violation or misrepresentation by clear and \n     convincing evidence. If the complainant alleges that the \n     violation or misrepresentation was willful, the complainant \n     also has the burden of establishing that allegation under the \n     same standard. This standard was selected in order to avoid \n     the risk that the arbitrator could otherwise end up simply \n     substituting the arbitrator's judgment for the employer's \n     concerning the relative qualifications of potential \n     employees. The arbitrator's decision should likewise pay \n     careful heed to the rule of construction set forth at the end \n     of section 212(n)(1).\n       The arbitrator's decision is subject to review by the \n     Attorney General only to the same extent as arbitration \n     awards are subject to vacation or modification under 9 U.S.C. \n     10 or 11, and to judicial review only in an appropriate court \n     of appeals on the grounds described in 5 U.S.C. 706(a)(2).\n       The remedies for violations resemble those established for \n     the other violations of the labor condition attestations \n     (administrative remedies including $1,000 fines per violation \n     or $5,000 fines per willful violation and a potential \n     debarment of one year, or two years for a willful violation).\n       The Attorney General is prohibited from delegating the \n     responsibilities assigned her to anyone else unless she \n     submits a plan for such a delegation 60 days before its \n     implementation to the Committees on the Judiciary of each \n     House of Congress. This is in order to assure that Congress \n     has an adequate opportunity to be involved in the decision \n     regarding where at the Department of Justice the Attorney \n     General plans on lodging this function.\n       Section 413(c) adds a new section 212(n)(2)(E) describing \n     the liability of an employer who has executed the ``secondary \n     non-displacement attestation'' for placing a non-exempt H-1B \n     worker with respect to whom it has filed an application \n     containing such an attestation with another employer under \n     the circumstances described in paragraph (1)(F). If the other \n     employer has displaced a U.S. worker (under the definitions \n     used in this legislation) during the 90 days before or after \n     the placement, the attesting employer is liable as if it had \n     violated the attestation. The sanction is a $1,000 civil \n     penalty per violation and a possible debarment. The attesting \n     employer can only receive a debarment, however, if it is \n     found to have known or to have had reason to know of the \n     displacement at the time of the placement with the other \n     employer, or if the attesting employer was previously \n     sanctioned under 212(n)(2)(E) for placing an H-1B \n     nonimmigrant with the same employer. If an employer has \n     conducted the inquiry that it is required to attest that it \n     has conducted before any such placement, and (as that \n     attestation requires) acquired no knowledge of displacement \n     of a U.S. worker in the course of that inquiry, it should \n     ordinarily be presumed not to have known or have reason to \n     know of a displacement unless there is an affirmative showing \n     that it did have such knowledge or reason to know. It should \n     also be noted that an employer can be held liable for such a \n     placement only if it filed an application that contained the \n     ``secondary non-displacement attestation,'' and only with \n     respect to H-1B workers covered by such an application.\n       Subsection 413(d) adds a new section 212(n)(2)(F) granting \n     the Secretary authority to conduct random investigations of \n     employers found after enactment of this act to have \n     committed a willful violation or willful misrepresentation \n     for five years following the finding.\n       Subsection 413(e) grants the Secretary limited additional \n     authority with respect to other employers to investigate \n     certain kinds of allegations of failures to comply with labor \n     condition attestations. The Secretary's authority under \n     current law is limited to investigating complaints concerning \n     such violations that come from aggrieved parties. Under the \n     authority granted by new subparagraph (G) of 212(n)(2), added \n     by paragraph (1) of subsection 413(e) of this Act, under \n     certain circumstances the Secretary will also be authorized \n     to investigate for 30 days allegations of willful failures to \n     meet a condition of paragraph (1)(A), (1)(B), (1)(E), (1)(F), \n     or (1)G)(i)(I), allegations of a pattern or practice by an \n     employer of failures to meet such a condition, or allegations \n     of a substantial failure to meet such a condition that \n     affects multiple employees even if those allegations do not \n     come from an aggrieved party.\n       The rationale for this grant of authority is to make sure \n     that if DOL receives specific, credible information from \n     someone outside the DOL that an employer is doing something \n     seriously wrong but that information comes from someone who \n     is not an aggrieved party, DOL can nevertheless pursue the \n     lead.\n       In order for the Secretary to exercise the authority \n     granted her under new subparagraph (G), the allegations will \n     have to be based on specific credible information from a \n     source who is likely to have knowledge of an employer's \n     practices of employment conditions or an employer's \n     compliance with the employer's labor condition application. \n     Thus, this provision does not authorize ``self-directed'' or \n     ``self-initiated'' investigations by the Secretary. Rather, \n     as specified in clauses (ii) and (iii), an investigation can \n     only be launched on the basis of a communication by a person \n     outside the Department of Labor to the Secretary, or on the \n     basis of information the Secretary acquires lawfully in the \n     course of another investigation within the scope of one of \n     her statutory investigative authorities. The source's \n     identity must also be known to the Secretary. Thus, the \n     Secretary may not rely on anonymous tips in exercising this \n     authority, although she may withhold the source's identity \n     from the employer or others. As clause (iv) states, \n     information received from the employer that the employer is \n     required to file in order to obtain an H-1B visa does not \n     constitute the ``receipt of information'' under this \n     subparagraph. This is meant to be illustrative rather than \n     exclusive. The same principle would prevent other kinds of \n     information filed by the employer in the course of seeking \n     some other benefit from DOL, such as labor certification, for \n     example, to constitute the ``receipt of information'' either.\n       In giving effect to the provisions specifying the kinds of \n     alleged violations that may be investigated under this \n     authority, the purpose of this authority should likewise be \n     taken into account. Thus, for example, a ``substantial \n     failure to meet such a condition that affects multiple \n     employees'' should not be understood to mean an unintentional \n     posting violation even if it affects many employees. Nor \n     should it be understood to mean a more significant violation \n     but one that affects only a handful of people. Rather, it \n     should be understood to be a violation of a magnitude that \n     warrants the unusual step of committing DOL's resources even \n     though there is no aggrieved complaining party.\n       Subparagraph (G) also establishes several procedural \n     safeguards to prevent this authority from being abused. \n     First, under clause (i), there must be a finding of \n     reasonable cause to believe that an employer is committing \n     one of the covered violations. Second, the Secretary (or the \n     Acting Secretary, in the case of the Secretary's absence of \n     disability) must personally certify that this requirement and \n     the other requirements of clause (i) have been met before an \n     investigation may be launched. This authority cannot be \n     delegated to anyone else in the Department. Third, as in \n     current law regarding investigations of complaints, the \n     investigation may only last 30 days. Fourth, rather than \n     being a generalized grant of authority to investigate the \n     employer, the Secretary's authority is limited to \n     investigating only the alleged violation or violations. \n     Fifth, under clause (ii), the information provided by the \n     source must be put in writing, either by the source itself or \n     by a DOL employee on behalf of the source. Sixth, under \n     clause (v), the information may not concern a violation that \n     took place longer ago than 12 months, so investigations may \n     not be launched on the basis of stale information. \n     Additionally, under clause (vi), the Secretary is directed to \n     provide notice to an employer of the information that may \n     lead to the launching of an investigation and an opportunity \n     to respond to that information before an investigation is \n     actually initiated.\n       This last requirement is waivable by the Secretary where \n     the Secretary determines that complying with it will \n     interfere with\n\n[[Page S12755]]\n\n     her efforts to secure compliance by the employer with the H-\n     1B program requirements. That the decision whether to waive \n     it is left to the Secretary's discretion does not mean that \n     it should be made lightly, or that it should be the rule \n     rather than the exception. Rather, it is Congress's \n     expectation that the Secretary will provide the otherwise \n     required notice unless she has a reasonable belief, based on \n     credible evidence, that the employer can be expected to avoid \n     compliance because of the notice. Past, proven willful \n     violations could be such evidence. Congress's belief, \n     however, is that most employers will correct a problem if \n     brought to their attention and it cannot be assumed that \n     simply because allegations have been made that the employer \n     will not do so. The scant number of willful violations that \n     DOL has found in the history of this program suggests that \n     this is likely to be the rule rather than the exception. \n     Thus, in many cases, notice will advance the twin ends of \n     compliance (or a credible explanation demonstrating that the \n     facts do not support the allegations and an investigation is \n     not needed) and the ability to preserve the Secretary's \n     enforcement resources so they can be used on other pressing \n     matters.\n       Finally, clause (vii) makes clear that after completion of \n     the 30-day investigation, if the Secretary finds that a \n     reasonable basis exists to make a finding that a violation of \n     the type described in clause (i) has occurred, the procedure \n     follows the procedure in existing law, under which the \n     employer is entitled to notice of the finding and an \n     opportunity for a hearing within 60 days. After the hearing, \n     the employer is entitled to a finding by the Secretary not \n     more than 60 days later.\n       One last point should be noted in regard to this authority. \n     Both this new grant of authority and existing authority to \n     investigate complaints require that DOL have ``reasonable \n     cause to believe'' that the employer is committing a \n     violation (limited, in the case of the authority granted \n     in new subparagraph (G), to certain kinds of violations). \n     This requirement is meant to track that of the Fourth \n     Amendment. Thus, if an employer believes that DOL does not \n     have the ``reasonable cause'' required, it is free to \n     refuse to give DOL access to the materials DOL is seeking \n     and put DOL to the test on that point. In other words, \n     Congress's view is that an employer does not waive any \n     Fourth Amendment rights by applying for an H-1B visa or by \n     filing any documents required to obtain one, and that DOL \n     has no authority to use the occasion of the employer's \n     filing such materials to compel such a waiver.\n       Paragraph (2) of subsection 413(e) sunsets the new DOL \n     investigative authority granted by paragraph (1) on September \n     30, 2001.\n       Subsection 413(f) clarifies that none of the enforcement \n     authorities granted in subsection 212(n)(2) as amended should \n     be construed to supersede or preempt other enforcement-\n     related authorities the Secretary of Labor or the Attorney \n     General may have under the Immigration and Nationality Act or \n     any other law.\n\n\n     Section 414. Collection and Use of H-1B Nonimmigrant Fees for \n  Scholarships for Low-Income Math, Engineering and Computer Science \n           Students and Job Training of United States Worker\n\n       Subsection 414(a) adds a new paragraph at the end of \n     section 214(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act \n     imposing a $500 fee on employers filing petitions for H-1B \n     nonimmigrants. This fee is to be collected by the Immigration \n     and Naturalization Service. The statute requires that the fee \n     be charged starting on December 1, 1998. INS has informed the \n     Congress that this will give it sufficient time to establish \n     a mechanism for collecting the fee that will not delay the \n     processing of visa petitions. It is the Congress's hope and \n     expectation that INS will establish that system as \n     expeditiously as possible, and will have it in place on \n     December 1. If, however, INS does not have a system up and \n     running for collecting the fee at that time, it is not \n     required or expected to stop accepting, processing, or \n     approving visa petitions. To the contrary, it is expected \n     that it will continue to accept, process, and approve visas \n     without delay while also moving as quickly as possible to put \n     the system for collecting the fee in place.\n       Under this provision, the fee will be paid by the employer \n     in three circumstances: (1) upon initial application for the \n     nonimmigrant to obtain H-1B status (through change from \n     another status or by securing a visa from abroad); (2) the \n     first time an employer files a petition for the purpose of \n     extending the nonimmigrant's H-1B status; and (3) when a new \n     employer is petitioning for an alien who is already in H-1B \n     status whom the new employer wants to hire away from the H-\n     1B's current employer.\n       The fee will apply to any petition filed by the same \n     employer that has the effect of extending the nonimmigrant's \n     status for the first time, whether that is its sole purpose \n     or whether it is a dual-purpose petition that both, for \n     example, advises the Immigration and Naturalization Service \n     of a material change in the terms and/or conditions of the \n     alien's employment and extends the alien's stay.\n       On the other hand, an employer will not have to pay the fee \n     for any extension after a first extension petition filed by \n     that employer. This section is meant to ensure that a single \n     employer not be required to pay the $500 fee more than twice \n     for a single H-1B nonimmigrant. In addition, petitions filed \n     for such purposes as advising the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service of a material change in the terms and/\n     or conditions of the alien's employment (an amended petition) \n     or to advise the INS of a change in the circumstances of the \n     employer (such as notification of a successor-in-interest \n     following a corporate merger, acquisition or sale), or for \n     assigning an H-1B worker to a new area of employment or to a \n     different legal entity within the employer's corporate \n     structure, will not ordinarily require payment of the fee. To \n     repeat, the only circumstance in which an employer will have \n     to pay the fee for a petition of this type is when the \n     petition also has the effect of extending the alien's status \n     and is the first petition that employer has filed to extend \n     that alien's status.\n       In addition, even when a prior employer paid the fee, a new \n     employer would be required to pay the fee when it hires an H-\n     1B nonimmigrant who changes jobs or when an H-1B is hired to \n     engage in concurrent employment.\n       Universities and nonprofit research institutes are exempted \n     from the fee.\n       Subsection 414(b) amends section 286 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act by adding a new subsection (s) requiring the \n     establishment of an account for holding the fees assessed \n     under section 214(c). The new subsection also specifies the \n     distribution of the funds, to be divided among the Workforce \n     Improvement Act (56.3%), a new program established by the Act \n     setting up low-income university scholarships for \n     mathematics, engineering, and computer science administered \n     by the National Science Foundation (28.2%), grants for \n     science and math development for those in kindergarten \n     through 12th grade through existing programs administered by \n     the National Science Foundation (8%), DOL processing and \n     enforcement relating to the H-1B program (6% total), and INS \n     processing of H-1B visas (1.5%).\n       With respect to the funding for DOL, although the funds are \n     not equally divided by law between the processing and \n     enforcement functions during the first fiscal year, the \n     expectation is that they will be split 50-50 unless DOL \n     determines that it needs to spend more funds on processing in \n     order to get into compliance with the 7 day statutory \n     deadline under which it is supposed to be either certifying \n     an application or rejecting it for incompleteness or obvious \n     inaccuracies. After the first fiscal year, the money is \n     equally split by statute, except that none of the money can \n     be spent on enforcement unless the Secretary certifies that \n     the Department was in substantial compliance with the 7-day \n     deadline during the previous calendar year. At present, DOL \n     is routinely violating this obligation, taking up to a month \n     and sometimes up to three months to certify an application, \n     despite the fact that the task is essentially ministerial. It \n     is time for that to end. Moreover, getting into compliance \n     with this obligation should not be accomplished by \n     diverting resources from labor certifications for the \n     permanent employment program. These are presently \n     routinely taking two years, which is far too long.\n       The INS funds are designed to enable INS to establish a \n     mechanism for collecting the new fee, to facilitate its \n     revision of its forms and computer systems so as to better \n     enable it to collect the fee and improve its data collection \n     capacity, and to speed up INS's processing time for \n     petitions, which is presently taking up to 3 months. This \n     function should be able to be performed in no more than a \n     month.\n       Subsection 414(c) uses a portion of the funds deposited in \n     the account established under subsection 104(b) for the \n     Secretary of Labor to provide grants for demonstration \n     projects and programs for technical skills training for both \n     employed and unemployed workers. These projects and programs \n     will be administered through local boards established under \n     section 121 of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 or \n     regional consortia of local boards.\n       Through this provision, the Secretary will be able to award \n     grants to innovative programs to train employees to meet the \n     workforce shortage needs in the high-tech industry. By doing \n     so, this legislation works to address our country's long-term \n     employment needs by training American workers to fill these \n     crucial jobs. In addition, the legislation addresses the \n     issue of underemployment by allowing grants to go to training \n     programs for both employed and unemployed workers. A regional \n     consortium of local boards can also apply for grants that \n     will encourage regions to work together to meet their area's \n     unique employment needs and encourage business and community \n     colleges to work together to train that region's workers. \n     These grants will allow the Secretary to support innovative \n     training programs that can serve as models for other training \n     programs around the country to learn from their best \n     practices.\n       Subsection 414(d) authorizes a low-income scholarship \n     program to be administered by the National Science \n     Foundation. This program would allow the Director of the \n     National Science Foundation to award scholarships to low-\n     income students pursuing an associate, undergraduate or \n     graduate level degree in mathematics, engineering, or \n     computer science. The scholarships will be funded through the \n     account established under subsection 414(b). Like the \n     previous subsection, this provision invests in the American \n     workforce by providing scholarships for students interested \n     in pursuing studies in high-tech fields. By making \n     scholarships available to low-income students, this \n     legislation provides incentive and opportunity for\n\n[[Page S12756]]\n\n     students to enter careers in the growing high-tech industry.\n\n\n              Section 415. Computation of prevailing wage\n\n       Under current law an employer must attest on a Labor \n     Condition Attestation that an individual on an H-1B will be \n     paid the greater of the actual or prevailing wage paid to \n     similarly employed U.S. workers.\n       Subsection 415(a) amends section 212 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act by adding at the end a new subsection (p) \n     that spells out how that wage is to be calculated in the \n     context of both the H-1B program and the permanent employment \n     program in two circumstances. Paragraph 212(p)(1) provides \n     that the prevailing wage level at institutions of higher \n     education and nonprofit research institutes shall take into \n     account only employees at such institutions. The provision \n     separates the prevailing wage calculations between academic \n     and research institutions and other non-profit entities and \n     those for for-profit businesses. Higher education \n     institutions and nonprofit research institutes conduct \n     scientific research projects, for the benefit of the public \n     and frequently with federal funds, and recruit highly-trained \n     researchers with strong academic qualifications to carry out \n     their important missions. The bill establishes in statute \n     that wages for employees at colleges, universities, nonprofit \n     research institutes must be calculated separately from \n     industry. Although this legislation does not explicitly \n     require separate prevailing wage calculations in relation to \n     for-profit and other non-profit entities that are not higher \n     education institutions and nonprofit research institutes this \n     is not meant to preclude the Department of Labor from making \n     these same common-sense distinctions for other nonprofit \n     entities.\n       New paragraph 212(p)(2) spells out the prevailing wage \n     criteria for professional sports. Where there is a collective \n     bargaining agreement (CBA), the minimum wage established \n     therein constitutes the prevailing pay rate. Where no CBA \n     exists, the prevailing wage is the minimum salary mandated by \n     the professional sports league which teams must pay players--\n     foreign nationals as well as U.S. workers. The system \n     currently employed to determine the prevailing wage for minor \n     league professional sports uses a ``mean wage.'' Because \n     salaries for professional athletes vary greatly (up to 20 \n     times difference between lowest and highest paid players), \n     using the mean wage to calculate prevailing wage actually \n     encourages the leagues to pay approximately fifty percent of \n     the U.S. athletes a lower salary than similarly situated \n     foreign national athletes. This current system is a \n     disincentive to increase U.S. workers' salaries.\n       Subsection 415(b) of this legislation makes these rules for \n     prevailing wage calculations retroactive so that they may be \n     applied to any still-open prevailing wage determinations. \n     This will allow DOL to apply only a single set of rules, that \n     set out in subsection 212(p), for making these calculations \n     in these industries, starting on the date of enactment.\n\n\n     Section 416. Improving of Count of H-1B and H-2B Nonimmigrants\n\n       Subsection 416(a) requires the Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service to improve its counting of the number \n     of actual individuals granted or admitted in H-1B status in \n     each fiscal year, rather than counting approved petitions, \n     which may or may not be used by an individual to obtain H-1B \n     status after approval.\n       Subsection 416(b) requires the revision of the petition \n     forms so as to assure that this can be done.\n       Subsection 416(c) requires the Attorney General to submit \n     to the House and Senate Judiciary Committees (1) a quarterly \n     count on the number of individuals issued visas or \n     provided nonimmigrant status; and (2) beginning in FY \n     2000, on an annual basis, information on the countries of \n     origin and occupations of, educational levels attained by, \n     and compensation paid to, aliens issued H-1B visas. The \n     first requirement is intended to provide an early warning \n     system if the cap is coming close to being hit. The second \n     requirement is intended to develop reliable information on \n     how these visas are being used.\n       In collecting additional data regarding H-1B nonimmigrants, \n     the agency should not have to impose additional or new \n     paperwork burdens on employers. In fact, it is Congress's \n     understanding that the data required to be furnished are \n     currently being collected, but that they are not being \n     entered into a database that would allow them to be used. As \n     a result, the only information Congress has had made \n     available to it on the use of the visas has come from DOL's \n     compilation of information on applications, which, on account \n     of multiple filings, does not accurately reflect who is \n     really coming in. Finally, nothing in this provision should \n     be construed to allow INS to delay or withhold approval or \n     adjudication of petitions in order to comply with its \n     obligations under this provision.\n\n\n  Section 417. Report on Older Workers in the Information Technology \n                                 Field\n\n       Subsection 417(a) directs the Director of the National \n     Science Foundation to enter into a contract with the National \n     Academy of Sciences to study the status of older workers in \n     information technology field. This study is to focus on the \n     best available data, rather than on anecdotal information.\n       Subsection 417(b) requires the results of that study to be \n     supplied to the Committees on the Judiciary of each House of \n     Congress no later than October 1, 2000.\n\n\n Section 418. Report on High Technology Labor Market Needs; Reports on \n           Economic Impact of Increase in H-1B Nonimmigrants\n\n       Subsection 418(a) requires a study and report on high tech, \n     U.S., and global issues for the next ten years overseen by \n     the National Science Foundation and done by a panel to be \n     transmitted to the Judiciary Committees of both Houses by \n     October 1, 2000.\n       Subsection 418(b) directs that the Chairman of the Board of \n     Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget, the Chair of the Council of \n     Economic Advisers, the Secretary of the Treasury, the \n     Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Labor, and any other \n     member of the cabinet report to Congress on any reliable \n     study that uses legitimate economic analysis that suggests \n     that the increase in H-1B visas under this bill has had an \n     impact on any national economic indicator, such as the level \n     of inflation or unemployment, that warrants action by \n     Congress.\n     Subtitle B\n       The content of this subtitle was added to S. 1723 on the \n     Senate floor by an amendment offered by Senator Warner \n     incorporating the text of H.R. 429, a bill to grant special \n     immigrant status to certain NATO civilian employees.\n\n\n    Section 421. Special Immigrant Status for Certain NATO Employees\n\n       This section amends Section 101(a)(27) of the Immigration \n     and Nationality Act to add to the class of those eligible for \n     special immigrant status certain NATO employees and their \n     children on the same basis as employees of other qualifying \n     international organizations.\n     Subtitle C\n       This subtitle makes an additional amendment to the \n     Immigration and Nationality Act originally included in S. \n     1723 regarding permissible payments by universities to \n     holders of visitors' visas.\n\n\n                     Section 431. Academic Honoria\n\n       This section amends section 212 of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act by adding at the end a new subsection (q) \n     permitting universities and other nonprofit entities to pay \n     honoraria and incidental expenses for a usual academic \n     activity or activities to an alien admitted under section \n     101(a)(15)(B), so long as the alien has not received such \n     payment or expenses from more than 5 institutions or \n     organizations in the previous 6 month period.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Proposed Administration Revisions to H.R. 3736 (the July 29, 1998 \n                               Version):\n\n       1. Require either a $500 fee for each position for which an \n     application is filed or a $1,000 fee for each nonimmigrant. \n     Fee to fund training provided under JTPA Title IV. In \n     addition, a small portion of these revenues should fund the \n     administration of the H-1B visa program, including the cost \n     of arbitration.\n       2. Define H-1B-dependent employers as:\n       a. For employers with fewer than 51 workers, that at least \n     20% of their workforce is H-1B; and\n       b.

Doris Meissner,\n     Commissioner, Immigration\n     and Naturalization Service,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Commissioner Meissner: As I am sure you know, \n     legislation raising the H-1B cap has been included in the \n     Omnibus Appropriations bill. The final version is the result \n     of hard work by all involved, including all of those who \n     negotiated this compromise on behalf of the Administration.\n       There is one point on which I thought it would be useful to \n     have a clear record of our shared understanding. The \n     legislation creates a new $500 filing fee for most visa \n     petitions, which the Attorney General is tasked with \n     collecting, and which takes effect on December 1 of this \n     year. I believe it is everyone's understanding that INS will \n     be charged with devising the system for collecting this fee.\n       The point I wanted to confirm is that I also believe that \n     it is everyone's understanding that if, as a result of \n     unforeseen circumstances, it does not prove possible to have \n     a system up and running by that time, our shared \n     understanding is that the language in the bill concerning the \n     fee will not result in a cessation of accepting, processing, \n     or approving petitions on that account. Rather, I believe it \n     is everyone's view that petitions should be continued to be \n     accepted, processed, and approved in the interim, while INS \n     continues to move as expeditiously as possible to finalize \n     putting the fee-collection system in place.\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Spencer Abraham.\n                                  ____\n\n         U.S. Department of Justice, Immigration and \n           Naturalization Service,\n                                 Washington, DC, October 29, 1998.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Immigration,\n     Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your October 16 letter \n     concerning the implementation of the H-1B program. The \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) has been working \n     with your staff to identify and to address the management and \n     administrative challenges associated with the proposed H-1B \n     legislation that is now included in the Omnibus \n     Appropriations Bill. These challenges include two sources of \n     additional workload, those emanating from new requirements \n     contained within the legislation, and those related to the \n     increased volume of cases that must be processed.\n       The INS has already initiated efforts to meet the \n     challenges posed for us, and fully expects to be able to \n     implement the new fee provision proposed in the H-1B \n     legislation by December 1. However, let me assure you that \n     the INS will continue adjudicating H-1B applications, even if \n     unforeseen circumstances cause a delay in establishing final \n     procedures for fee collection and deposit.\n       If I can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate \n     to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Doris Meissner,\n                                                     Commissioner.\n\n\n                          district of columbia\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to congratulate the bill \nmanagers for their hard work to reach an agreement on the bill before \nus today. I especially want to thank them for including the District of \nColumbia Adoption Improvement Act of 1998 in the omnibus appropriations \nbill.\n  As chairman of the Senate Oversight Subcommittee on Government \nManagement, Restructuring, and the District of Columbia, improving \nadoption for foster care in the District is one of my highest \npriorities. For the past year, I, along with Senators DeWine, Grassley, \nCraig, and Landrieu, have been looking for ways to make it easier for \nchildren in the Nation's Capital to find an adoptive family.\n  Earlier this year, we hosted an Adoption Fair on Capitol Hill in \nwhich resulted in the adoption of five children to two families. We \nalso held a hearing in the subcommittee to explore a solution that \nwould shorten the time it takes for children in the District to be \nadopted.\n  Gordon Gosselink, age 13, testified before the subcommittee at this \nhearing about how he entered the District's foster care system at the \nage of two. For the next 10 years, he lived in several foster care \nhomes and even endured physical abuse until he was finally adopted at \nthe age of 13 by Robert and Mary Beth Gosselink. He said:\n\n       Last year, I met Rob and Mary Beth Gosselink at a Christmas \n     party. When my social worker told me that two people were \n     hoping to adopt me, I was really excited. I knew that this \n     was the one. I moved [in] with Rob and Mary Beth last year at \n     Easter time, and now I am part of the Gosselink Family. \n     Things are really great now. I like my neighborhood and I am \n     doing well in school. Best of all, I am with a family who \n     loves me forever. My parents now are adopting another boy \n     named Ricardo who is 11 years old. I am looking forward to \n     having a new brother. I know there are a lot of kids who are \n     still waiting for a home. I hope they find homes, too, like \n     me.\n\n  Some children are not as lucky as Gordon. Currently, there are 994 \nchildren in the District with the goal of adoption but only 50 percent \nhave been referred to the District's adoption branch. Even worse, many \nchildren in the District grow up moving from foster care home to foster \ncare home without finding an adoptive family by the age of 18. The most \nrecent statistics indicate that 67 percent of the children who left the \nfoster care system,\n\n[[Page S12758]]\n\nleft because they turned 18 years old. In other words, one of the only \nways out of the system, is to grow-up to adulthood within the system. \nOnce these children turn 18, they are released to the streets without a \nfamily or a home.\n  Allowing just one child to grow up without the love, attention, and \ncommitment of a family is a tragedy. Allowing hundreds to languish in \nfoster care is a disgrace.\n  The District Child and Family Services Agency has been under the \nleadership of Ernestine Jones, the Federal court appointed receiver for \nnearly one year now. I am hopeful that reforming the system will remain \na priority and these discouraging realities will no longer haunt the \nchildren who need the system most.\n  We must also recognize foster care and adoptive parents for their \ncontribution and their example of taking in these children when they \nneed them most. As many of the Senators, who have adopted children, \nknow, we need to make it easier, not more difficult, for parents to \nadopt.\n  I believe this can be done and systemic improvements can be made with \npositive results--as seen in my home state of Kansas. The Kansas reform \nmodel of the Child and Welfare Services Agency has shown some immediate \nsigns of success. Within one year of implementing these reforms, Kansas \nincreased the number of children placed in adoptive homes from 25 \npercent to 50 percent. Prior to these reforms, the average stay for a \nchild in the Kansas foster care system was two years. Now, the average \nstay in 13 months.\n  Using the Kansas model, we drafted the D.C. adoption reform language \nand came to a bipartisan agreement which included the Federal court \nappointed receiver and the Federal court appointed monitor. I am \npleased that this compromise language is included in the omnibus \nappropriations bill. First, the bill would require the D.C. Child and \nFamily Services Agency (CFSA) to maintain an accurate database tracking \nall children found by the Family Division of the District of Columbia \nSuperior Court to be abused or neglected and who is in the custody of \nthe District of Columbia--including any child with the goal of adoption \nor who is legally free for adoption. Unfortunately, this basic step has \nbeen neglected in the past in CFSA. To meet the immediate demand of \nplacing children in adoptive homes, the bill would also require CFSA to \ncontract out some of its adoption functions which may include \nrecruitment, homestudy, and placement services. Like the Kansas model, \nthese contracts would be required to be performance-based contracts. \nContractors would be compensated once specific goals, such as an \nadoption placement or finalization, are achieved. Finally, CFSA and \ncontractors would be required to work together to identify and lift any \nbarriers to timely adoptions.\n  I want to stress that in the end, we are talking about individual \nchildren who are in search of a permanent and secure home. Any \nimprovement in the system translates into bringing each child closer to \nthe fundamental need of having a loving, adoptive family.\n\n\nTHE AMERICAN COMPETITIVENESS AND WORKFORCE IMPROVEMENT ACT INCLUDED IN \n                          DIVISION C, TITLE IV\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I speak today in support of the \nAmerican Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act, which is \nincluded in the Conference Report on H.R. 4328, the Omnibus \nAppropriations Act, under Division C, Title IV. The House passed this \nAct as H.R. 3736 on September 24. The Senate had passed the companion \nbill, S. 1723, on May 18. I cosponsored the Senate bill because I \nbelieve strongly that the U.S. Government's job is to make sure that \nU.S. industry has adequate access to the resources necessary to grow \ntheir business. Right now we have the lowest unemployment rate in 28 \nyears. The high-tech sector, which has been the engine of growth in our \neconomy--creating the most jobs--cannot find enough skilled workers. If \nU.S. industry needs more skilled workers than the U.S. labor force can \nprovide, as the Department of Commerce has documented, then we must \nallow them to hire foreign skilled workers, and, as is more often the \ncase, allow them to hire foreign graduate students educated here in the \nUnited States. These foreign workers create wealth and more jobs in \nthis country. If we block these visas the research will go abroad.\n  The Semiconductor Research Corporation, founded by the U.S. \nsemiconductor industry, supports approximately 800 graduate students \neach year with merit-based scholarships. Some of the students receiving \ngrants are foreigners studying here in the United States. They told me \nthat this year, for the first time, they have been unable to hire all \nof the graduate students whose research they funded, even though the \nstudents wished to remain in the United States, because they cannot get \nH-1B visas.\n  When I cosponsored S. 1723 in May, I believed it was a good bill \nbecause it not only temporarily increased the number of visas available \nfor skilled workers, but it also set up education and training programs \nfor Americans so that more U.S. workers will soon be eligible for these \nhigh-paying jobs in the high-tech sector. I am delighted to say that I \nbelieve the bill that emerged from the long and detailed negotiation \nbetween Senator Abraham and the White House is now even better \nlegislation. The American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act \nincreases the number of visas available for the next three years, \nincludes funding to decrease processing time for visa applications, and \nfunds education and training programs to increase the pool of skilled \nworkers in the United States. For the benefit of workers, it includes \nsubstantial protections for U.S. workers, increases enforcement \nauthority for the Department of Labor to protect workers rights, and \ncreates additional protections for H1-B employees. These new \nprotections will help eliminate real and/or perceived hiring practices \nthat came under criticism and made this such a controversial visa \nprogram. Removing the opportunity for abuse of the program makes its a \nstronger program and broadens its base of support. This act is in the \nbest interests of both U.S. and foreign workers and U.S. business.\n  The funding that is included in this act is vitally important. Too \noften, Congress passes legislation with the result that executive \nbranch agencies or States are expected to provide more services and \nprograms with less money. This act funds each of the programs it \ncreates and the increased duties it requires of government agencies \nwith a fee on each visa. It funds K-12 science programs. It funds \nscholarships in the math, science and engineering fields. And it funds \ntraining in high-tech skills.\n  I would like to speak in particular about the training program \ncontained in the American Competitiveness and Workforce Improvement \nAct, Section 414 (c). As the chief sponsor of this provision, I want in \nthese remarks to particularly address the intent and meaning of the \nprovision. Section 414 (c) directs the Secretary of Labor to establish \ndemonstration projects to provide technical skills training for \nworkers. What makes this program unique is not just that it is targeted \nat technical skills, but that it will be open to both employed and \nunemployed workers.\n  Most Department of Labor training programs are solely for unemployed, \ndisplaced or disadvantaged workers. But in today's market, technology \nchanges so quickly that no longer can people be trained in their \ntwenties and expect to use those same skills throughout their career. \nAmerican workers used to have one job for life. Now the average \nAmerican will have five to ten jobs in a lifetime. Employees need to \nupdate their skills continually to remain competitive. Realistically, \nwe must allow Department of Labor training programs to include workers \nwho have jobs now, and want to upgrade and update their skills so they \ncan qualify for the changing needs of industry, instead of waiting \nuntil they lose their job or become dislocated workers from a declining \nindustry.\n  The United States is in the enviable situation at this time of having \nunder 5% unemployment. The high-tech industry tells us it has as many \nas 190,000 unfilled jobs. This does not necessarily mean that we do not \nhave the people to fill those jobs; it means we don't have the people \nwho have the skills to fill\n\n[[Page S12759]]\n\nthose jobs. Nearly seven out of ten employers say that the high school \ngraduates they see are not yet ready to succeed in the workplace.\n  The jobs in the high-tech sector pay more than other jobs. The \naverage wage in the high-tech sector pays 73% more than the average \nwage in the private sector. The average high-tech manufacturing wage is \n32% higher than the U.S. manufacturing average wage. We need to help \nour citizens get the training they need to get these higher paying \njobs.\n  The reality is that we have a global economy and there is, more and \nmore, a global workforce. If companies cannot find skilled workers in \nthe United States, they will find them in another country. This \ntraining program will help U.S. workers get the skills they need to \nstay competitive.\n  I want to explain my intent for the program established under Section \n414 (c). I intend this program to be used for innovative approaches to \nsolving our labor skills shortage; specifically, consortia and \ncommunity-based programs. I intend the program to be used as a catalyst \nto bring small and medium sized businesses together to set up \ncooperative programs of skills training. I believe the best results can \nbe gained from industry-driven programs. To have industry involved in \nand leading the skills training will ensure that workers are being \ntrained for jobs that actually exist.\n  Ninety-nine percent of the 23 million businesses in the United States \nare small businesses. But, small businesses often do not have the \nresources to operate training programs by themselves. By joining \ntogether in consortia of other small and medium sized businesses with \nsimilar labor needs, with the Local Workforce Investment Boards \nestablished by the Workforce Investment Partnership Act signed into law \nthis year, with community colleges, or labor organizations, or with \nState or local governments, small and medium sized businesses can \nparticipate in training courses that will increase the labor pool of \nskilled workers needed in their region.\n  Companies, however, do not normally cooperate in training workers. \nThat is why the government is needed to provide the catalyst to bring \ncompanies together to cooperate on training. It is expected that the \nfee from the visas will generate approximately $50 million annually for \nthe training program. It is my hope that the Secretary of Labor will \nconsider, as she establishes these programs, requiring matching funds \nfrom the consortia. Nothing in this act precludes such matching funds. \nMatching funds will help ensure that the companies take an active role \nin the training program. The Secretary of Labor has the discretion to \nundertake this implementation approach. Of course, available federal \nfunds are meant only to start the process--federal funding would end \nover time after which the consortia would continue the cooperative \ntraining programs alone.\n  Mr. President, let me give some examples of the type of program I am \ndiscussing. In the last few years, a small number of regional and \nindustry-based training alliances in the United States have emerged, \nusually in partnership with state and local governments and technical \ncolleges, that exemplify the type of program on which this provision in \nthe manager's amendment is modeled. In Rhode Island, with help from the \nstate's Human Resource Investment Council, regional plastics firms \ndeveloped a skills alliance which then worked with a local community \ncollege to create a polymer training laboratory linked to an \napprenticeship program that guarantees jobs for graduates. The \nWisconsin Regional Training Partnership, a consortium of metal-working \nfirms in conjunction with the AFL-CIO, refitted an abandoned mill with \nstate-of-the-art manufacturing equipment to teach workers essential \nmetal-working skills. In Washington, DC, telecommunications firms \ndonated computers and helped set up a program to train public high \nschool students to be computer network administrators. They then hired \ngraduates of the program at entry-level salaries of $25,000-$30,000.\n  Without some kind of support to create alliances, such as created by \nthe new provision in this act, small and medium sized firms just don't \nhave the time or resources to collaborate on training. In fact, almost \nall the existing regional skills alliances report that they would not \nhave been able to get off the ground without an independent staff \nentity, such as a college or labor organization, to operate the \nalliance. Widespread and timely deployment of these kinds of \npartnerships is simply not likely to happen without the incentives \nestablished by a federal initiative, which is created by this act. The \ntraining provision in the American Competitiveness and Workforce \nImprovement Act can help create successful new training models and \ntemplates that others can replicate across the nation.\n  I want to thank Senator Abraham and Lee Liberman Otis and Stuart \nAnderson of his staff who worked tirelessly to ensure that the American \nCompetitiveness and Workforce Improvement Act would pass the 105th \nCongress. I also want to thank Laureen Daly of my staff for all her \ndedicated efforts on this essential legislation.\n  We have accomplished something important for our workforce needs and \nfor training in this legislation.\n\n\n             certification regarding certain imf assistance\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to commend Chairman McConnell for \nthe work he has done on the foreign operations portion of the Omnibus \nAppropriations bill.\n  The fiscal year 1999 foreign operations appropriations package is \nvery different in size and character from the wasteful ones passed just \na few years ago by liberal Congresses. It represents a sea change in \nthe way Congress does business and a major victory for conservative, \ncommonsense principles.\n  The U.S. Federal budget is now balanced--for the first time since \n1969. This is the most positive economic policy development in the \nworld today. There is room within that balanced budget for a limited, \nresponsible program of foreign operations.\n  The chairman's work in this bill advances U.S. leadership and \nprotects our national security, our economic interests, and American \njobs, in a rapidly changing world.\n  For example, the way this bill deals with the International Monetary \nFund is not the same old way of doing business.\n  This bill imposes new, tough standards of accountability and \ntransparency on the IMF. If American taxpayers are going to invest in \nthe IMF, hoping it will produce a more stable world economy, they \nshould be able to see where their money is going.\n  I know that has been an important priority for Chairman McConnell, as \nit has been for me.\n  I want to thank the chairman in particular for his support and \nassistance in making sure the final version of this bill included a \nprovision we have worked on since the beginning of this year.\n  This provision covers autos, textiles and apparel, steel, and \nshipbuilding, as well as semiconductors. It is of extreme importance to \nthe thousands of workers at Micron, an Idaho company that manufactures \ncomputer chips and is a world leader in semiconductor technology. This \nprovision will safeguard many American jobs and is the result of \nbipartisan efforts.\n  This provision directs the Secretary of the Treasury to instruct the \nU.S. Executive Director at the IMF to exert the influence of the United \nStates to oppose further disbursement of funds to the Republic of Korea \nunless the Secretary has given a certification that IMF funds are not \nbeing used to subsidize industries with a history of committing unfair \ntrade practices against American companies and workers.\n  It is my understanding that the use of the term, ``exert the \ninfluence of the United States'' places a very high obligation on our \nSecretary of the Treasury and Executive Director to use all the means \nnecessary to oppose disbursement of funds unless such certification has \nbeen given.\n  This effort needs to be persistent and comprehensive, at all levels, \nin order to achieve the desired result. It includes the use of the \nvoice and vote of the United States at the IMF. This language also \nconstitutes a commitment by the Secretary of the Treasury to the \nCongress to see that the influence of the United States is exerted in \nall respects.\n  I've spoken with the Secretary about this matter. It's characteristic \nof administration agencies and officials to\n\n[[Page S12760]]\n\nprefer having broad latitude and not being given such specific \ndirection in legislation. However, I believe the substance of this \nprovision is consistent with the Secretary's own intentions. The final \nlanguage is the product of negotiation with the Administration.\n  Mr. McConnell. I would concur with the Senator's interpretation of \nthe effect of this provision. This provision creates an ongoing and \noverarching commitment. Accompanying report language should reassure \nthe people of South Korea that our friendship for them remains strong, \nand that we are simply seeking to promote honest, open markets and fair \ncompetition.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, while many parts of this bill concern me, the \npart that I am very proud of is a provision known as the Drug-Free \nWorkplace Act of 1998. It has been my pleasure to have worked with \nSenator Coverdell and I commend him for guiding the drug-free workplace \nbill through the Small Business Committee with a unanimous bipartisan \nvote. I would also like to thank Representatives Portman, Bishop, and \nSouder for their work in passing this important anti-drug legislation \nout of the House.\n  The Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1998 is an excellent example of how \nthe federal government can work to encourage drug-free workplaces \nwithout placing heavy-handed mandates on businesses. It fosters \npartnerships between small businesses and organizations which have at \nleast two years experience in carrying out drug-free workplace \nprograms. It also will educate and encourage small businesses about the \nadvantages of implementing drug-free workplace programs.\n  Small businesses often feel they lack the money or the expertise to \nimplement drug testing programs. That is why the drug-free workplace \nbill performs such a worthwhile function. Many small firms would like \nto start drug testing programs but don't have the ability to overcome \nthe start up costs. This anti-drug measure provides resources to assist \nand educate employers who want the help in implementing drug-free \nworkplace programs.\n  As we all know, the American workforce is the main catalyst behind \nthe tremendous economy that we are enjoying today. It is absolutely \nintegral to a country's economic well being that it have a competent, \nable workforce. Our ability to maintain the high achievements of this \nworkforce hinges largely on our ability to keep drugs out of the \nworkplace.\n  Drug use can take a tremendous toll. For example, 70% of drug users \nare employed. Employees who use drugs: Have greater absenteeism; have \nincreased use of health services and insurance benefits; have increased \nrisk of accidents; and have decreased productivity.\n  The costs of drug use are not only confined to the user, just \nconsider these disturbing statistics: Nearly half of all industrial \naccidents in the United States are related to drugs or alcohol; and \ndrug and alcohol abusers file five times as many workman's compensation \nclaims as non-abusers, and require 300 percent greater medical \nbenefits.\n  Businesses need help dealing with the problem of drug use--especially \nsmall businesses. Thomas Donohue of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \ntestified before the House Subcommittee on Empowerment that a large \nimpediment in the implementation of drug programs is the perceived \ncosts and problems with the actual initiation of the programs.\n  The Drug-Free Workplace Act is fair to everyone. It's fair for the \nworkers who are put at risk by their colleagues' drug abuse. It's fair \nto businesses, because it gives them the tools they need, but only if \nthey want them. it's also fair to society, which ultimately foots the \ncostly bill that drug abuse brings.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would ask my distinguished colleague and \nChairman of the Committee on Finance for his attention with regard to a \nmatter of some concern to the Savings Bank Life Insurance (SBLI) \norganizations in Massachusetts, New York, and Connecticut, as well as \ntheir operations in New Hampshire and Rhode Island.\n  As the Chairman knows, we had hoped this year, after a long \nconsideration of the matter, to act on a proposal that would clarify \nthe tax consequences of a state-mandated consolidation of an SBLI \norganization in which required payments to policyholders are made over \na period of years. Under the current Internal Revenue Service (IRS) \ninterpretation, such payments would be non-deductible redemptions of \nequity. After considerable effort, we believe we have succeeded in \ndemonstrating that such an interpretation is incorrect. Of necessity, \nhowever, it appears that a statutory clarification will be required, \nand, unfortunately, it does not appear possible this year to consider \nthis kind of matter in a tax measure.\n  SBLI entities and policyholders retain unique, long-recognized \ncharacteristics regarding voting rights and rights to surplus which set \nthem apart from other insurance companies and policyholders and which \nform the basis for the needed clarification. The provision we had hoped \nwould be considered this year would clarify that the Internal Revenue \nCode should treat additional policyholder dividends as deductible when \nmandated by state law.\n  While only the Massachusetts SBLI is immediately affected, the sister \nentities in New York and Connecticut could be adversely affected if the \nappropriate clarification is not made. Unfortunately, if we are unable \nto accomplish our objective soon, SBLI and its policyholders throughout \nNew York and the New England region will be subjected to a tax inequity \nwhich will be unnecessarily passed on to the consumer. It is important \nto note that the Treasury Department again this year reiterated that it \ndoes not oppose this clarification.\n  I would observe that several of my colleagues including Senators \nKennedy, Moynihan, D'Amato, Dodd, Lieberman, Gregg, Smith, Chafee, and \nReed have indicated their support in correspondence with our \ndistinguished Finance Committee Chairman.\n  I respectfully ask the Finance Committee to consider this important \nmeasure in the context of comprehensive tax legislation next year.\n  Mr. ROTH. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts. I am well aware of \nyour interest in this amendment, as well as the continued interest of \nthe Senators from New York, New Hampshire, Connecticut and Rhode \nIsland. The Senator raises important issues with regard to the \nuniqueness of such state-mandated payments. Unfortunately, as you know, \nwe were not able to take up such issues during the 105th Congress. It \nwould be my intention, though, to address this and other tax matters at \nthe next available opportunity.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise to commend the leadership and the \nmembers of the Appropriations Committee for their hard work on this \nbill. They had to make hard decisions about scarce resources and have \nlabored to do so fairly. I also appreciate the efforts to make sure the \ntaxpayers hard-earned dollars are spent effectively and efficiently. \nWhile there are several provisions within this bill which I \nwholeheartedly support, I do not agree with every provision of this \nbill.\n  As you all may be aware, section 315 of the Interior portion of the \nOmnibus Consolidated Rescissions and Appropriations Act of 1996 \nauthorized the Recreational Fee Demonstration program. The Recreational \nFee Demonstration Program is currently scheduled to expire on September \n30, 1999. Language from the House Fiscal Year 1999 Interior and Related \nAgencies Appropriations Act to extend this demonstration program an \nadditional two years (to the year 2001) has been included in the FY1999 \nOmnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act. I worked to keep similar \nlanguage out of the Senate Interior appropriations bill and was \ndisappointed to see the House language prevail in the final omnibus \nbill.\n  The issue here is that the House action was premature. I am not \ntotally opposed to a fee demonstration program. In fact, when Congress \nauthorized the Recreation Fee Demonstration Program in 1996, I voted in \nsupport of this legislation and have been a proponent of user-based \nfees. I believe that the program, in concept, has merits. I envisioned \nthis demonstration program as having the potential to improve the \ncondition and recreation services of public lands by making more \nfinancial resources available to areas that are used the most heavily, \nbased on a modest fee allocated to those directly benefitting from the \nenjoyment of those lands. Recreation is important in\n\n[[Page S12761]]\n\nIdaho. Because 63 percent of our state is managed by the federal \ngovernment, a majority of this recreation must take place on the public \nlands. In some of our premier areas the resource is being loved to \ndeath. Appropriated budgets will not see future large increases in \nrecreation programs even though these areas will undoubtedly continue \nto be a popular local, and tourist, attraction.\n  As a member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, \nthe authorizing committee with legislative jurisdiction over the fee \ndemonstration program, as well as the chairman of the subcommittee of \njurisdiction, I am committed to thorough oversight of this program with \nan eye toward consideration of any appropriate legislation to improve, \ncontinue, or terminate it depending on the information we gather and \nthe experiences of the agencies.\n  On June 11, 1998, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee held an \noversight hearing on the program's first full year of implementation. \nValuable information was gathered from the agencies administering the \nprograms and the users of the resource. We will continue to monitor \nthis program during the next two years. A thorough review of the \nprogram, with answers to some serious questions, must be completed \nbefore extending the recreation fee demonstration program. Then we can \naccurately assess the merits and problems and decide how to continue. \nHowever, considering this issue settled at this early date will only \nlessen the authorizing committee's responsibility to evaluate the \nprogram and make any improvements that are warranted. We should act \nafter, not before, this demonstration program has had a chance to \ndemonstrate.\n  While I voted in favor of this bill for continuing necessary \nprograms, some provisions, such as a premature extension of the \nrecreation demonstration program, are not something I agree with or \nsupport. If more time is needed to test the fee demonstration project, \nit would have been more appropriate to extend the program nearer the \nend of three-year period rather than after only the first full year of \nthe program. However, I will continue aggressive oversight of this \nprogram in an effort to improve it and possibly end it in areas where \nit clearly is not working.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, included within this omnibus appropriations \nbill are two important pieces of legislation related to foreign policy. \nThe first, produced on a bipartisan basis in the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, is the ``Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act,'' \nwhich involves the institutional structure of, and funding for, the \nforeign affairs agencies of the U.S. government. The second bill is \nlegislation necessary to implement the Chemical Weapons Convention, a \ntreaty approved by the Senate in April 1997.\n  The Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act is not perfect, and \nunfortunately it differs in one critical respect from the original bill \napproved by the Senate 16 months ago. I say ``unfortunately'' because \nthis bill does not contain a single dime for our UN arrears. Last year, \nChairman Helms and I agreed on a proposal to authorize the payment of \n$926 million in arrears to the United Nations, conditioned on a series \nof reforms in that body. The Senate approved the Helms-Biden \nlegislation twice in 1997, first by a vote of 90-5 in June, then by a \nvoice vote in November.\n  The obstacle to making good on our commitments to the United Nations? \nA small minority of members in the other body, who have insisted that \nour arrears payments to the United Nations should be held hostage to an \nunrelated issue regarding family planning. The specific provision--the \nso-called Mexico City amendment --would require the withholding of \nfunds from foreign, non-governmental organizations which use their own \nfunds to perform abortions or discuss the issue with foreign \ngovernments. The President has indicated on several occasions that he \nwill veto any bill presented to him that contains the Mexico City \nlanguage. Nonetheless, a handful of obstructionists in the other body \nmarch steadily ahead, determined to undermine U.S. foreign policy \ninterests in order to advance their unrelated cause.\n  I deeply regret such irresponsible action by the other body, but it \nis emblematic of the reckless disregard that many in that body have for \nthe important responsibilities the United States has as the world s \nleading superpower.\n  In the past few weeks, the Chairman and I attempted to include a $200 \nmillion down payment on our UN arrears, which would have been linked to \ncertain of the conditions in the Helms-Biden legislation. But even this \nlimited payment of our arrears proved to be too much for the members in \nthe other body who have taken American foreign policy hostage.\n  It is essential that we find a way to repay our arrears next year. \nFor better or for worse, the United Nations is a valuable means to \nadvance our foreign policy and security interests around the world, by \nproviding a forum for improved cooperation with other states and by \nallowing us, in some instances, to share the burdens and costs of world \nleadership.\n  Our status as a deadbeat is unquestionably hurting our interests, not \nonly at the UN but with our leading allies--many of whom are owed money \nby the UN for peacekeeping operations they undertook, but for which we \nhave not yet paid. The cost to our interests cannot be measured with \nprecision, but the resentment against the United States for its failure \nto pay its back dues is having a corrosive effect on our agenda at the \nUN and elsewhere. It is bordering on scandalous that a big nation like \nours, blessed with abundant wealth, has failed to pay its bills on \ntime.\n  Next year, the President is expected to nominate Richard Holbrooke to \nbe our representative to the United Nations. Ambassador Holbrooke's \nnomination offers us a chance for a fresh start in the negotiations on \nUN arrears and reforms. Mr. Holbrooke is one of the most creative \ndiplomats and negotiators of our time, and I am confident he will bring \nfresh insights and endless energy to this important issue. I am also \nhopeful that the Chairman remains committed to trying to move \nlegislation in the next Congress to repay the full amount agreed to \nlast year in our negotiations.\n  Let me turn now to the provisions of the Foreign Affairs Reform and \nRestructuring Act that are contained in the omnibus bill. Much of the \nlegislative history of bill is set forth in the conference report to \nH.R. 1757, which was approved by both houses last spring. But I would \nlike to take a few minutes to summarize the bill and highlight several \nissues.\n  First, the legislation before us establishes a framework for the \nreorganization of the U.S. foreign policy agencies which is consistent \nwith the plan announced by the President in April 1997. After several \nyears of debate, last year the President agreed to the abolishment of \ntwo foreign affairs agencies, and their merger into the State \nDepartment. The first agency to be abolished will be the Arms Control \nand Disarmament Agency (ACDA), which will be merged into the State \nDepartment no later than April 1, 1999; the U.S. Information Agency \n(USIA) will follow no later than October 1, 1999. As with the President \ns plan, the Agency for International Development (AID) will remain a \nseparate agency, but it will be placed under the direct authority of \nthe Secretary of State. And, consistent with the President s proposal \nto seek improved coordination between the regional bureaus in the State \nDepartment and AID, the Secretary of State will have the authority to \nprovide overall coordination of assistance policy.\n  The integration of ACDA and USIA into the State Department is not \nintended to signal the demise of the important functions now performed \nby these agencies. On the contrary, their merger into the Department is \ndesigned to ensure that the arms control and public diplomacy functions \nare key elements of American diplomacy.\n  In that regard, the bill establishes in law two new positions in the \nState Department, an Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and \nInternational Security, and an Under Secretary of State for Public \nDiplomacy. These senior officers will have primary responsibility for \nassisting the Secretary and Deputy Secretary of State in the formation \nand implementation of U.S. policy on these matters.\n  It is expected that the officials who will be named to these \npositions will be submitted to the Senate for advice and consent. The \nconference committee on H.R. 1757 rejected a proposal by the Executive \nBranch to seek authority to\n\n[[Page S12762]]\n\nplace officials who are now in analogous positions in these newly-\ncreated positions.\n  One issue of particular concern regarding ACDA in the reorganization \nis the need to maintain the highest standards of competence and \nobjectivity in the analysis of compliance with arms control and non-\nproliferation agreements. As the Foreign Relations Committee stated in \nits report last year, it is vital ``that the Under Secretary be able to \ncall upon expert personnel in these areas who will not feel obligated \nto downplay verification or compliance issues because of any potential \nimpact of such issues upon overall U.S. relations with another \ncountry.'' Chairman Helms and I have urged the Secretary of State to \nfind a way to make the official for compliance a Senate-confirmed, \nPresidential appointee.\n  The bill puts flesh on the bones of the President's plan with regard \nto international broadcasting. The President's proposal was virtually \nsilent on this question, stating only that the ``distinctiveness and \neditorial integrity of the Voice of America and the broadcasting \nagencies would be preserved.'' The bill upholds and protects that \nprinciple by maintaining the existing government structure established \nby Congress in 1994 in consolidating all U.S. government-sponsored \nbroadcasting--the Voice of America, Radio and TV Marti, Radio Free \nEurope/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia, and Worldnet TV--under the \nsupervision of one oversight board known as the Broadcasting Board of \nGovernors. Importantly, however, the Board and the broadcasters below \nthem will not be merged into the State Department, where their \njournalistic integrity would be greatly at risk. Instead, the \nBroadcasting Board will be an independent federal entity within the \nExecutive Branch. The Secretary of State will have a seat on the board, \njust as the Director of the USIA does now.\n  Second, the bill authorizes important funding for our diplomatic \nreadiness, which has been severely hampered in recent years by deep \nreductions in the foreign affairs budget. This Congress has stopped the \nhemorrhaging in the foreign affairs budget, but I believe that funding \nfor international programs remains inadequate, given our \nresponsibilities as a great power.\n  Although the Cold War has ended, the need for American leadership in \nworld affairs has not. Our diplomats represent the front line of our \nnational defense; with the downsizing of the U.S. military presence \noverseas, the maintenance of a robust and effective diplomatic \ncapability has become all the more important. Despite the reduction in \nour military readiness abroad, the increased importance of diplomatic \nreadiness to our nation s security has not been reflected in the \nfederal budget.\n  Significantly, this omnibus appropriations bill contains the \nemergency funding requested by the Administration for embassy security. \nThe bombings of the U.S. embassies in East Africa in August demonstrate \nthat many of our missions overseas remain highly vulnerable to \nterrorist attack; it is imperative that we provide the State Department \nthe resources necessary to protect our employees serving overseas. We \nshould understand, however, that the urgent funding in this bill is \njust the beginning of a long-term program to enhance security at \nembassies around the globe.\n  I am especially pleased that the Chemical Weapons Convention \nImplementation Act is also incorporated in the omnibus spending bill. \nThe Senate passed this legislation unanimously in May of 1997, and we \nhave waited since then for the leadership of the other body to accept \nthat complying with our international commitments is a requirement, \nrather than a political football. The enactment of this measure will \nenable the United States to file the comprehensive data declarations \nrequired by the Convention, and therefore to demand that other \ncountries' declarations be complete. The United States will now be able \nto accept inspections of private facilities, and therefore to request \nchallenge inspections of suspected illegal facilities in foreign \ncountries. The United States will finally be able also to protect \nconfidential business information, acquired in declarations or on-site \ninspections, from release under the Freedom of Information Act. After \nnearly 17 months of waiting, it is about time.\n  In closing, I want to pay tribute to Chairman Helms for his continued \ngood faith and cooperation throughout the last two years on these and \nother issues. He has been the driving force behind the legislation to \nreorganize the foreign affairs agencies, and I congratulate him for his \nachievement. I also want to thank our colleagues in the other body, \nparticularly the ranking member of the Committee on International \nRelations, Lee Hamilton, who is retiring this year after over three \ndecades of noble service to his district in Indiana and to the American \npeople. We wish him well as he moves on to new challenges.\n  Mr. President, I want to reiterate that we are leaving important \nunfinished business--the payment of our back dues to the United \nNations. It must be at the top of our agenda in the next Congress. I \nlook forward to working with the Chairman and the Secretary of State to \nfind a way to finish the job.\n\n\n                      Alternative Fuel Tax Credits\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I would like to clarify the intent of \nCongress regarding tax incentives for alternative fuels. These \nincentives are important tools for our nation's long-term energy \npolicy.\n  Starting with the energy crisis in the 1970s, Congress has acted on \nnumerous occasions to provide tax credits intended to develop \nalternative fuels. Prior Congresses took these steps in recognition of \nthe need to encourage the development and use of alternative fuels \nwhich promise that we as a nation will never be dependent on others for \nour energy resources. For example, Section 29, which expired earlier \nthis year, and Section 45, which is due to expire next June, were both \nintended to encourage the development of nonconventional fuels.\n  Today, our nation not only needs to continue its efforts to develop \nalternative fuel resources, but given our ever growing energy \nrequirements, we must consider the environmental impact that \nconventional and nonconventional fuels have on our environment, \nparticularly in light of the Clean Air Act.\n  In order to maximize the most efficient use of our nation's \nresources, Congress needs to commit to the development of clean \nalternative fuels. We need also to use our nation's technologies to \ndevelop environmentally clean alternative liquid fuels from coal.\n  In Montana, we have vast coal reserves. There are technologies that \ncan upgrade the coal from these reserves and reduce current \ndifficulties associated with the development of these fields. However, \nthese technologies are not likely to be developed, and therefore these \nvast natural resources are not likely to be used, unless Congress \nprovides incentives to develop clean alternative fuels.\n  I am concerned that we have not been able to fully discuss the merits \nof such incentives in our budget debate this past month. For example, \nan extension of Section 29 was included in the Senate version of the \ntax extenders, but that provision was not included in the final \npackage.\n  I would urge my colleagues to bring this debate to the floor in the \n106th Congress to ensure that the issue of encouraging the development \nof clean alternative fuels is a priority in our nation's energy policy.\n  Mr. LOTT. I agree with my colleague from Montana. As our nation \ncontinues to seek ways to improve environmental quality and to reduce \nthe need for imported energy, several new technologies run the risk of \nnot being developed if Congress does not act to provide incentives to \ndevelop clean alternative fuels.\n  These technologies provide two significant benefits to our nation. \nFirst, the use of alternative fuels reduces our reliance on foreign \nenergy sources. Second, the technologies provide cleaner results for \nour environment.\n  For these reasons, I want to assure my colleague from Montana that I \nwill make a priority of addressing the need for tax incentives to \nproduce clean alternative fuels.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I agree with my colleagues from Montana and Mississippi \nabout this very important issue. The development and use of alternative \nfuels are important to this nation, and\n\n[[Page S12763]]\n\nwe must encourage their use and development.\n  Wind energy has long been recognized as an abundant potential source \nof electric power. A detailed analysis by the Department of Energy's \nPacific Northwest Laboratory in 1991 estimated the energy potential of \nthe U.S. wind resource at 10.8 trillion kilowatt hours annually, or \nmore than three times total current U.S. electricity consumption. Wind \nenergy is a clean resource that produces electricity with virtually no \ncarbon dioxide emissions. There is nothing limited or controversial \nabout this source of energy. Americans need only to make the necessary \ninvestments in order to capture it for power.\n  The Production Tax Credit, section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code \nwas enacted as part of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. This tax credit \nis a sound low-cost investment in an emerging sector of the energy \nindustry. I introduced the first bill that contained this tax credit, \nso you can be sure that I am sincere in my belief in the need to \ndevelop this resource. This tax credit currently provides a 1.5 cent \nper kilowatt hour credit for energy produced from a new facility \nbrought on-line after December 31, 1993 and before July 1, 1999 for the \nfirst ten years of the facility's existence. Last Fall, I introduced a \nbill to extend this tax credit for five years. My legislation, S. 1459, \ncurrently has 22 cosponsors, including half of the Finance Committee. \nThe House companion legislation, introduced by Congressman Thomas, \ncurrently has 90 cosponsors, including over half of the Ways and Means \nCommittee. These numbers are a strong testament to the importance of \nthe section 45, and renewable fuels in general.\n  In addition, I plan to work to expand this tax credit to allow use of \nthe closed-loop biomass portion of this tax credit. Switchgrass from my \nstate and other Midwestern states, eucalyptus from the South, and other \nbiomass, can be grown for the exclusive purpose of producing energy. \nThis is a productive use of our land, and will be an important step in \nour use and development of alternative and renewable fuels.\n  I was very pleased to see that Congress expressed its understanding \nof the importance of alternative and renewable fuels by extending the \nethanol tax credit in this year's T-2 legislation. These tax credits \nare a successful way of promoting alternative sources of energy. These \ntax credits are a cheap investment with high returns for ourselves, our \nchildren, our grandchildren and even their grandchildren. Congress \nneeds to again pass this important legislation to ensure that these \nenergy tax credits are extended into the next century.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I concur with my colleagues. Implementation of the \n1990 Clean Air Act amendments is creating a real need to develop clean \nalternative fuels.\n  For example, of the 64 remaining U.S. coke batteries, 58 are subject \nto closure as a result of the Clean Air Act. The steel industry can \neither use limited capital to build new clean coking facilities or they \ncan choose to import coke from China, which uses 50 year old highly \npollutant technologies. Restoring the Section 29 credit to encourage \ncleaner coker technologies will greatly reduce emissions and will slow \nour increasing dependence on foreign coke, at the same time creating \njobs in the United States in both the steel and coal mining industries.\n  In addition, the United States has rich deposits of lignite and sub-\nbituminous coals. There are new technologies that can upgrade these \ncoals to make them burn efficiently and economically, while at the same \ntime significantly reducing air pollution.\n  This is proven technology, but to make the development of this \ntechnology throughout the nation feasible, the Congress needs to \nprovide tax incentives.\n  Mr. ENZI. The people of Wyoming have always had very strong ties to \nour land. That is why the words ``Livestock, Oil, Grain and Mines'' \nappear on our state seal. Those words clearly reflect the importance of \nour natural resources to the people of my state, and our commitment to \nusing our abundant natural resources wisely and for the benefit of \ncurrent and future generations of Wyomingites and the people of this \ncountry.\n  Congress has determined the need to find newer and cleaner \ntechnologies. Wyoming is blessed with an abundance of clean burning \ncoal reserves. It would seem to be a perfect match. We are eager to \nprovide what is needed for our country's present and future fuel needs. \nBut those reserves aren't likely to be developed unless we provide the \nincentives necessary to make it possible for the coal to be harvested \nin a safe and environmentally friendly manner.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I concur with my colleagues. The development and \nproduction of alternative fuels provides a real opportunity for the \ncountry to improve the environment while ensuring a constant, \nreasonably priced fuel supply. But recent efforts to provide such \nassurances have been hampered. For example, in the Small Business Job \nProtection Act of 1996, Congress extended the placed-in-service date \nfor facilities producing synthetic fuels from coal, and gas from \nbiomass for eighteen months.\n  However, progress in bringing certain facilities up to full \nproduction has been hampered by the Administration's 1997 proposal to \nshorten the placed-in-service date and because, in many cases, the \ntechnology used to produce the fuels is new. Such delays have created \nuncertainty regarding the facilities eligibility under the placed-in-\nservice requirement of Section 29\n  While it is important that the Congress consider again this issue in \nthe 106th Congress, I would also urge the Secretary to consider the \nfacilities I mentioned qualified under Section 29 if they met the \nService's criteria for placed-in-service by June 30, 1998 whether or \nnot such facilities were consistently producing commercial quantities \nof marketable products on a daily basis.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I agree with my colleagues. Through the section 29 tax \ncredit for nonconventional fuels, Congress has supported the \ndevelopment of environmentally friendly fuels from domestic biomass and \ncoal resources. There are lignite resources in my state that could \ncompete in the energy marketplace if we can find a reasonable incentive \nfor the investment in the necessary technology. As soon as possible in \nthe 106th Congress, I hope we will give this crucial subject the \nattention it deserves.\n  Mr. HATCH. I concur with my colleagues. This is a very important tax \ncredit for alternative fuels. It is an issue of fairness, not one of \ncorporate welfare.\n  Earlier this year I, along with 18 of my colleagues, introduced a \nbill that would extend for eight months the placed-in-service date for \ncoal and biomass facilities. The need still exists to extend this date \nand I am very disappointed that this was not included.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to join my colleagues in supporting \ntax incentives for alternative fuels. Our country has assumed a \nleadership role in the reduction of greenhouse gases because of the \nglobal importance of pollution reduction. As my colleagues have also \npointed out, promotion of alternative fuels is not just an \nenvironmental issue, but an issue important to our domestic economy and \nindependence as well. We cannot afford to slip back toward policies \nwhich will leave us dependent upon foreign sources of oil for our \neconomic growth.\n  With the huge reserves of coal and lignite in the United States and \naround the world, as well as the tremendous potential for use of \nbiomass, wind energy, and other alternatives, it is particularly \nimportant to our economy and the world's environment that new, more \nenvironmentally friendly fuels are brought to market here and in \ndeveloping nations.\n  But bringing new technologies to market is financially risky. In \nparticular, finding investors to take a new technology from the \nlaboratory to the market is difficult because so many technical \nproblems need full-scale testing and operations to resolve. Few \ninvestors are prepared to take on the risks associated with bringing a \nfirst-of-a-kind, full-sized alternative energy production facility on-\nline without some level of security provided by a partnership with the \nfederal government.\n  Tax incentives represent our government's willingness to work with \nthe private sector as a partner to bring new, clean energy technologies \nto the market. These incentives demonstrate our country's commitment to \nthe future.\n\n[[Page S12764]]\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. There are two principle reasons I support extension of \nSection 29 and 45. First, in a period where America is continuing to \nincrease its dependence on foreign oil, we need to develop alternative \nfuel technologies to prepare for the day when foreign supply of oil is \nreduced. These tax credits have spurred the production of fuel from \nsources as diverse as biomass, coal, and wind. America will desperately \nneed fuel from these domestic sources when foreign producers reduce \nimports.\n  Second, the alternative fuels that earn these tax credits are clean \nfuels. For example, the capture and reuse of landfill methane prevents \nthe methane from escaping into the atmosphere. I will support my \ncolleagues in an effort next year to extend these provisions.\n  Mr. THURMOND. I join my colleagues in support of extending the tax \ncredit for Fuel Production from Nonconventional Sources. Through this \ncredit, Congress has emphasized the importance of establishing \nalternative energy sources, furthering economic development, and \nprotecting the environment. The alternative fuels credit strikes a \nproper balance between each of these objectives. I support efforts to \nbring this issue to a satisfactory conclusion, early in the next \nCongress.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I strongly agree with my colleagues regarding the \nimportance of the Section 29 tax credit. Wyoming has some of the \nnation's largest coal reserves and this tax credit gives producers an \nincentive to develop new and innovative technologies for the use of \ncoal. I am disappointed that an extension of the Section 29 tax credit \nwas not included in the Omnibus Appropriations package and urge my \ncolleagues to make this matter a top priority during the 106th \nCongress.\n  Mr. ROTH. I understand my colleagues' concerns. For some time now I \nhave been studying how to provide targeted incentives to develop clean \nalternative fuels. It is essential for Congress to develop sound tax \npolicy for alternative energy to help protect our environment. Several \nweeks ago, I introduced legislation to provide such incentives for \nfacilities that produce energy from poultry waste. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on these issues early in the 106th Congress.\n\n\n                       Permanent Research Credit\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I would like to thank the distinguished \nchairman and ranking member of the Committee on Finance for their \ncontinuing work on the research and experimentation tax credit, which \nis extended through June of 1999 by this legislation. In my capacity as \nranking member of the Joint Economic Committee, I have taken a strong \npersonal interest in the research credit and how it can be made into an \neffective permanent incentive. It is potentially the most important \nincentive in our tax code for stimulating long-term economic growth, \nand I believe that we need to make every effort in the upcoming session \nof Congress to establish a permanent credit for research and \ndevelopment.\n  In the course of these efforts, we need to keep in mind the \nsubstantive issues that are intrinsic to the goal, shared by many of my \ncolleagues, of a permanent effective R tax policy. Can we make the \ncredit more equitable, to give all R firms incentives to \nincrease their R? Can it be made more effective for the industries \nthat have historically invested heavily in research and development? \nCan it be made more accessible by small businesses, which are a growing \nsector of our nation's R and promise to be a leading source of high-\nwage job growth? And can it further encourage research partnerships--\ncrossing the institutional boundaries of industry, universities, and \npublic-benefit consortia--that lay the groundwork for our future \ntechnology and medicine through long-term R investments?\n  In the negotiations of the past few weeks, Congress came alarmingly \nclose to not extending the credit at all. I am concerned that until we \naddress the substantive issues outlined above, the R credit is likely \nto continue to teeter along in its current state of uncertainty, and \nthat under its current structure it will perform less and less \neffectively, as an incentive and as an economic stimulus. I am joined \nin these concerns by economists who have studied the credit and by \nsenior leaders of R corporations. As the distinguished \nchairman and ranking member know, I and other Senators have introduced \nlegislation to address these issues in this Congress. Obviously, time \ndoes not permit us to address these issues at this point, but I would \nask them whether they would be willing to have the Committee on Finance \nconsider these issues in the next Congress, in preparation for further \nlegislative action on the credit?\n  Mr. ROTH. I welcome the suggestion made by the Senator from New \nMexico. I believe that the issues that the raises are important ones, \nand that his suggestions for comprehensive improvements are worthy of \nfurther consideration by the Committee. I am aware that several of our \nother colleagues, including Senators Domenici, Hatch, and Baucus, are \nalso keenly interested in the future of the credit, and I look forward \nto working with all of our colleagues who are interested in these \nissues in the next Congress.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I would agree with the chairman of the Committee that \nthe issues raised by the Senator from New Mexico deserve further \nattention next year, and would also welcome the opportunity to work \nwith him and with my other colleagues.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the chairman and ranking member.\n\n\n  degradation of service at williston office national weather service\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would like to inquire of the distinguished Chairman of \nthe Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Subcommittee, Mr. Gregg, as \nto the intent of language in the FY99 conference report on National \nWeather Service operations at Williston, North Dakota.\n  Mr. GREGG. The conference report includes language which directs the \nSecretary of Commerce to ensure continuation of weather service \ncoverage for the communities of Williston, North Dakota; Caribou, \nMaine; Erie, Pennsylvania; and Key West, Florida.\n  Further, the Conference provides full funding to the NWS for \ncontinued, effective operations at Williston and the other Weather \nService offices mentioned.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Subcommittee Chairman for his commitment to \nthis provision in the bill. The Commerce Secretary has agreed that \nclosing the Williston weather station would amount to a degradation of \nweather service. It is critical, therefore, that Congress send a strong \nsignal that the station at Williston be kept fully operational.\n  Mr. GREGG. I will tell the Senator from North Dakota that it is the \nintent of the conferees that the National Weather Service maintain \noperations at Williston and the other sites, and further that the NWS \ntake no actions which would suggest an intent to close these offices. \nAny actions taken towards closure of these offices will signal to the \nCongress that there will be a resulting degradation of service.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Is it correct to say that the fact that specific funds \nare being provided to the National Weather Service to maintain \noperations at the offices which were identified in the 1995 Secretary's \nreport signals that the Congress expects these offices to continue and \nthat the NWS ought not to be taking any actions that would suggest that \nthese offices will be closed?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, that is correct. We believe that with respect to \nthese specific offices, including Williston, North Dakota, the NWS \nmodernization plan has not sufficiently demonstrated that service will \nnot be degraded without these offices. The Congress does not want the \nNWS to close these offices at this time and we are providing specific \nappropriations to ensure their continued operations. I would also add \nthat we expect the NWS to use these additional funds to develop the \nappropriate systems to address the unique weather coverage shortfalls \nthat exist for these specific communities.\n  I realize that the most difficult problem for Williston, North Dakota \nis the absence of local radar coverage at low altitudes. We expect that \nthe NWS will use these funds and work cooperatively with the local \nresidents in Williston to mitigate that concern.\n\n\n                   registration of container chassis\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I would like to explain section 109 of \nDivision C regarding the registration of container chassis. This \nsection addresses the application of registration fees to trailers\n\n[[Page S12765]]\n\nused exclusively for the purpose of transporting ocean shipping \ncontainers, which the Section refers to as ``container chassis.''\n  The section provides that a State, such as California, that requires \nannual registration and apportioned fees for container chassis may not \nlimit the operation, or require the registration in the State, of a \ncontainer chassis registered in another State, if the container chassis \nis operating under a trip permit issued by the non-registration State. \nFurther, the non-registration State may not impose fines or penalties \non the operation of such a container chassis for being operated in the \nnon-registration State without a registration issued by that State. For \nexample, the Attorney General of California or any other person in \nCalifornia, may not seek to impose fines or penalties from companies \noperating container chassis in California, when the container chassis \nare registered in another state such as Maine or Tennessee.\n  Further, under this language, a State that requires annual \nregistration of container chassis and apportionment of fees for such \nregistration may not deny the use of trip permits for the operation in \nthe State of a container chassis that is registered under the laws of \nanother State. A trip permit provides for a daily use fee that is the \nprorated annual registration fees for the vehicle. Under the section, a \ntrip permit is required only on days when the container chassis is \nactually operating on the State's roads and not, for example, when it \nremains at an ocean terminal for the entire day.\n  This section also provides that a State, political subdivision or \nperson may not, with respect to a container chassis registered in \nanother State, impose or collect any fee, penalty, fine, or other form \nof damages which is based in whole or in part on the nonpayment of a \nState's registration related fees attributable to a container chassis \noperated in the State before the date of enactment of this section \nunless it is shown by the State, political subdivision or person that \nthe container chassis was operated in the State without a trip permit \nissued by the State.\n  This provision is intended to prevent the imposition of any liability \non this basis for the current and past practice of many companies in \nthe container shipping industry which register chassis in one State and \noperate them in another State under trip permits issued by the non-\nregistration State. The provision is intended to ensure that past and \ncurrent practices which are consistent with the objectives of this \nsection will not be the basis for the imposition of fees, penalties, \nfines or other forms of damages on this segment of the Nation's \nintermodal transportation system.\n  Using the congressional power to regulate interstate commerce, this \nsection is intended to facilitate movement of containerized cargo in \ninterstate commerce and to remove an unreasonable impediment to \ninterstate commerce. It simplifies and rationalizes registration \nrequirements for this critically important segment of the Nation's \ninterstate intermodal transportation system.\n  It is important to note that extensive discussion and consideration \nwas given to this section. Members from the Senate Commerce Committee, \nAppropriations Committee, and the House Appropriations and the House \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee worked on this language and \ncame to the conclusion that it is necessary. It is clearly the intent \nof both Chambers of Congress that States, such as California and \nothers, which want to limit the operation of chassis that are not \nregistered in their State, are prohibited from doing so. Further, it is \nclearly the intent of both Chambers of Congress that States, such as \nCalifornia and others, are prohibited from collecting fines or \npenalties from companies which register chassis in another State and \noperate under a trip permit issued by the State where the chassis is \noperated.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Yogi Berra, explaining the difficulty of \nplaying in the afternoon sun and shadows of Yankee Stadium's notorious \nleft field is reported to have commented, ``It gets late early.'' We \nhave before the Senate a huge Omnibus Appropriations and Emergency \nSupplemental bill which spends more than $486 billion and legislates \nacross a broad range of issues of great importance. We are faced now \nwith this massive, sweeping legislation because the 105th Congress did \nnot do its work. In the 105th Congress, it got late early.\n  From the very outset of this Congress, the majority leadership set a \nslow pace and avoided fully addressing the major issues before the \nNation. The 105th Congress failed to reform our campaign finance laws, \nfailed even to debate a patient's bill of rights, failed to act on \nlegislation to reduce tobacco use by our young people, failed to even \nto take up serious regulatory reform, and failed to address the \nproblems looming in the future of Social Security. In fact, this \nCongress, failed, this year to even meet its responsibility, under law, \nto pass a budget, the first time this has occurred. And, it failed to \ncomplete work on 8 of the 13 appropriations bills required to run the \ngovernment. Two appropriations bills were never even debated by the \nSenate and a third was never passed. On top of that dozens of \nlegislative proposals were added to this bill which were never debated \nand considered in the Senate.\n  The failure to pass the appropriations bills, as required, prior to \nend of the fiscal year on October 1, led directly to the process that \nconfronts us with this monster Omnibus Appropriations bill today, a \nfour thousand plus page bill which we were unable to even begin reading \nuntil yesterday.\n  The Founders of our Nation envisioned a careful contemplative \nlegislative process which divided power and sought to assure that the \npeople would be well represented. The process which we have recently \nwitnessed was hardly that. It was a closed process, which greatly \nexcluded Democrats in the House and Senate, enhancing the powers of the \nRepublican leaders of the House and Senate and in an extra-\nConstitutional fashion bringing the President into a legislative role. \nWhere the Congress was more fully represented, its representation was \nlimited to the members and leaders of the Appropriations Committees of \nthe House and Senate. This, despite the fact that legislation was \nincluded affecting the jurisdictions of many, if not all, of the \nauthorizing committees. And then, the entire package was lumped \ntogether and dumped here on the Senate floor on a take it or leave it \nbasis. Senators have no opportunity to attempt to amend this product, \nmerely to vote yes or no. Never before in my memory have we been \nconfronted with appropriations bills and legislative provisions on so \nmassive a scale which have never even been considered in either the \nHouse or Senate.\n  The President, and Democrats in the Congress have won some important \nvictories in this bill. However, even as we acknowledge and applaud \nthose victories, we must be mindful of the precedents which we set when \nwe accept this terrible process. Congress should not abdicate its \nresponsibilities. That is why I joined with Senators Byrd and Moynihan \nin fighting the line-item veto in the courts, a battle which was \nsuccessful and that is why I am distressed by the process which creates \nthe bill on the floor today, an ad-hoc process at best and a process \nwhich effectively disenfranchises many Americans by short-changing \ntheir representation, at worst. And that is why, although this \nlegislation contains many provisions of which I approve, and although I \napplaud the work of the Administration and Democrats in Congress in \nwinning important provisions in this bill, I do not support this \nwretched process and cannot in good conscience vote for this bill.\n  Among the most important positive aspects of this legislation is that \nthe bill provides additional funding for education. The President and \nDemocrats in the Congress put forward an education package early this \nyear. This bill finally acts on key elements of that package, providing \na $1.2 billion downpayment on reducing class size by hiring new \nteachers across the country. In addition, the bill includes $698 \nmillion for education technology, the $260 million that the President \nrequested for child literacy, $871 million for summer jobs, a $301 \nmillion increase for title I, $491 million for Goals 2000, and a $313 \nmillion increase for Head Start.\n  Unfortunately, the bill excludes the President's school modernization \ninitiative which would have leveraged nearly $22 billion in bonds to \nbuild and renovate schools. Hopefully, we can revisit this issue in the \nnext Congress.\n\n[[Page S12766]]\n\n  The bill includes $15.6 billion for National Institutes of Health, $2 \nbillion more than FY'98 and $859 million more than the Administration \nrequest, $700 million for Maternal and Child Health Block grant, $9.4 \nmillion more than FY98, $105 million for Healthy Start to reduce infant \nmortality rates, $9.5 million more than FY98, $160 million for breast \nand cervical cancer screening, $16.2 million over FY98, and $2.5 \nbillion for Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services, $341 million \nabove FY98.\n  Also, I am pleased that the bill contains language which is a first \nstep toward restructuring the home health care payment system. I have \nbeen concerned about this problem for some time now. I was an original \nco-sponsor of Senator Collins' Medicare Health Equity Act of 1998 I \nbelieve the provision in the Omnibus bill will create a payment system \nwhich is somewhat more equitable than the current system. Under our \ncurrent system, health care providers in Michigan have too often been \npenalized for prudent efficient use of Medicare resources, and that is \nwrong.\n  In addition to the nearly six billion dollars in the bill for \nemergency assistance to farmers who have been hurt by low prices, \ndrought and natural disasters, it contains important money for Michigan \nagriculture for research on subjects from fireblight to wood \nutilization. There is a provision to make apple growers in West \nMichigan, who suffered fireblight-related tree loss in disastrous \nstorms, eligible for the Tree Assistance Program. The bill provides the \nPresident's request for an enhanced food safety incentive, plus an \nincrease in the National Research Initiative of $7.4 million for \nnutrition, food quality and health. Some of these additional funds \ncould and should be used by the Secretary to help develop safer \nsubstitutes for pesticides that might be discontinued in implementation \nof the Food Quality Protection Act. Also, the agreement includes \n$300,000 for a study of the WIC food package nutritional guidelines \nfinally looking at the benefits of including dried fruit in WIC \ncereals.\n  I am pleased that the bill continues a moratorium on the use of funds \nto increase the CAFE standard for passenger cars and light-duty trucks. \nGiven the low-price of gasoline and the continued high consumer demand \nfor larger, safer vehicles, which are made most efficiently by U.S. \nmanufacturers, increasing CAFE would only harm the U.S. economy and \ndeprive consumers.\n  I am disappointed funding for the National Contaminated Sediments \nTask Force which I requested was not included in the bill. I am \nconcerned that this will mean that the existing uncoordinated Federal \napproach will continue to fail in adequately cleaning up contaminated \nsediments and preventing further contamination.\n  There will be an additional $400,000 above the President's request \nsplit between operations and acquisition at Keweenaw National \nHistorical Park. The bill includes $800,000 for land acquisition at \nSleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, and $2.25 million for the final \nphase for acquisition of lands from the Great Lakes Fishery Trust as \npart of the Consumers Energy Ludington settlement.\n  This agreement provides the budget request for the International \nJoint Commission so that negotiations with the Canadians can begin in \nearnest to prevent the export of Great Lakes water. The bill includes \n$6.825 million for the Great Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory in \nAnn Arbor. Funds ($50,000) for a study of the erosion problems in Grand \nMarais Harbor are also included. Unfortunately, the bill does not \ninclude the Senate's increase of $1 million above the budget request \nfor the Great Lakes Fishery Commission to combat the sea lamprey in St. \nMary's River.\n  Overall, the bill provides the highest level of funding for the \nFederal Highway Administration in history, at $25.5 billion. That is \nrelatively good news, though, unfortunately, the negotiators have \nincluded over $300 million in new highway money to be handed to four \ndifferent states in an apparent effort to bypass the allocation \nformulas in TEA-21 that were the subject of much debate earlier this \nyear.\n  The bill does contain $10 million for new buses and bus facilities \nacross facilities, and $600,000 for the Capital Area Transit Authority \nin Lansing. And, $200,000 for a study of the viability of commuter rail \nin Southeastern Michigan.\n  As a cosponsor of legislation to delay implementation of Section 110 \nof the 1996 Immigration Reform bill, which was scheduled to go into \neffect on September 30, 1998, requiring individuals entering the U.S. \nat the Canadian border to complete a visa card at the point of entry \nand register at the time of exit, I am pleased to note that this bill \ncontains language delaying the provision for 30 months. However, it \nshould be repealed, not just delayed.\n  I am pleased that the bill does not include the House version of \nthe Auto Salvage Title bill since the House dropped the Levin amendment \nwhich I successfully attached to the Senate bill. The House version \nwould have preempted state laws that provide tougher consumer \nprotection.\n\n  I am also pleased that while the bill provides funding to replenish \nthe IMF, it will push recipient countries to liberalize trade \nrestrictions.\n  Mr. President, let me take a moment to comment on the national \nsecurity provisions of the omnibus bill. First, I am pleased that this \nlegislation includes the funding the President requested for United \nStates participation in the NATO-led peacekeeping force in Bosnia.\n  If Congress had not provided this emergency funding, there would have \nbeen disastrous consequences for the readiness and the morale of our \nforces serving in, and in support of, Bosnia. We all regret that the \nimplementation of the civilian aspects of the Dayton Accords has not \ngone as fast as we hoped it would, but Congress has done the right \nthing by providing the necessary funding to ensure the readiness of our \nforces.\n  This legislation provides a needed $1 billion in additional readiness \nfunding that the President requested earlier this month for equipment \nmaintenance, spare parts, and recruiting assistance.\n  This omnibus bill also contains the funds requested by the President \nfor the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization, also known as \nKEDO. This funding is crucial to continuing the Agreed Framework \nbetween the United States and North Korea. That agreement is our best \nhope for denuclearizing North Korea and has provided tangible security \nbenefits to our nation.\n  Previous legislation would have effectively prevented the funding of \nKEDO, and thus given North Korea an excuse for walking away from the \nAgreed Framework. That could have led North Korea to produce plutonium \nfor nuclear weapons, which would cast the Korean Peninsula into an \nunnecessary and dangerous crisis. This outcome is the right one.\n  There are many positive aspects of this legislation for our national \nsecurity, but I am disappointed that so much of the ``emergency'' \nfunding in this bill for national security programs is not for \nreadiness and not for emergencies, but for things the Defense \nDepartment and the administration never asked for, in particular the \naddition of $1 billion for ballistic missile defense. Of course, that \n$1 billion for ballistic missile defense cannot be spent unless the \nPresident submits an emergency request for these funds. I fully expect \nthe Administration will exercise good judgement in deciding whether or \nnot to request these funds as an emergency.\n  Not only is the money added to this bill for missile defense and \nintelligence programs going to fund programs that the administration \ndid not request funding for on an emergency basis, again, these are \nprograms for which the administration did not request funding at all.\n  Furthermore, with regard to missile defense, adding this funding is \nin direct contradiction to the testimony of the Secretary of Defense \nand other senior officials of the Department of Defense who told the \nArmed Services Committee that while there was one instance in which \nadditional funds could accelerate a program, the Navy Upper Tier \nprogram, in general the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization is \nproceeding as fast as it can with all our missile defense programs and \ntheir development is constrained by technology, not funding \navailability.\n  In recent testimony to the Armed Services Committee, senior defense \nand\n\n[[Page S12767]]\n\nmilitary leaders told us that the National Missile Defense (NMD) \nprogram is going as fast as it can, and that adding more money will not \nmake it go faster. Deputy Secretary of Defense John Hamre told the \nCommittee: ``As a practical matter, we are moving as fast as we can to \ndevelop the elements of an NMD system. Even with more money, we \ncouldn't go any faster.'' He later emphasized that ``this is as close \nas we can get in the Department of Defense to a Manhattan Project. We \nare pushing this very fast.''\n  During that same hearing, General Joseph Ralston, the Vice Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Committee that the NMD program \nenjoys a unique and privileged status within the Defense Department. He \nsaid: ``I know of no other program in the Department of Defense that \nhas had as many constraints removed in terms of oversight and reviews \njust so we can deploy it and develop it as quickly as possible.''\n  On October 6th, Secretary of Defense William Cohen testified to the \nArmed Services Committee that the NMD program is being developed as \nfast as possible and additional money will not speed it up: ``I have \ntalked to the head of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization and he \nhas assured me that no amount of money will accelerate that timetable . \n. .'' He went on to say that ``I cannot accelerate it no matter what we \ndo.''\n  So, it is clear that the Defense Department is proceeding as fast as \npossible to develop a National Missile Defense system, and that more \nmoney will not make this go any faster. Furthermore, the Defense \nDepartment has told us that only one program could be accelerated with \nmore money. I would note that Congress added $120 million to the Navy \nUpper Tier program this year to accelerate it, cut funds from other \ntheater missile defense programs and made no attempt in the regular \nlegislative process to add any money for National Missile Defense. So \nthis unrequested missile defense money cannot speed up most of the \nprograms that are now being developed. It is not clear what it would be \nfor, but it is clear that the Defense Department never asked for it.\n  A few weeks ago, the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff were \ncriticized by some of my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee \nduring our hearings with them for not speaking up soon enough or \nforcefully enough about concerns they had with aspects of our defense \nprogram.\n  Mr. President, it seems a little inconsistent to me for the Congress \nto criticize the Pentagon for not speaking up and then after they \nexpress themselves very clearly on the status of the missile defense \nprogram, we ignore their testimony and do the opposite of what they \nsay.\n  I am also disappointed that this legislation perpetuates the practice \nof not fully funding our obligations to the United Nations. It is in \nthe national security interest of the United States to have an \neffective United Nations and strong U.S. leadership within the United \nNations. It is especially regrettable that this legislation moves us in \nthe opposite direction in order to score political points on the \nabortion issue.\n\n  Mr. President, the bill that we are voting on today includes S. 2176, \nthe Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, with several amendments. This \nlegislation clarifies and updates the current Vacancies Act, an 1868 \nlaw meant to encourage the Administration to make timely nominations to \nfill positions in the Executive Branch requiring the Senate's advice \nand consent.\n  First, the Vacancies Act provisions in this bill make it explicit \nthat the Vacancies Act is the sole exclusive statutory authority for \nfilling advice and consent positions on a temporary basis. It can no \nlonger be argued that other general statutory authorities creating or \norganizing agencies supersede the Vacancies Act and authorize temporary \nofficials, who have not been confirmed by the Senate, to serve \nindefinitely.\n  Second, the legislation updates the Vacancies Act in several \nsignificant respects to more accurately reflect the realities of \ntoday's nominations process. The clearance process for nominees \nrequiring Senate confirmation has become much more complex than it was \njust a decade ago. Moreover, increasingly adversarial confirmation \nproceedings have required that background investigations and other \nsteps in the vetting process be more thorough and lengthy. In \nrecognition of this development, the legislation increases the time \nperiod that an individual can serve in an acting position from 120 days \nunder current law to 210 days from the date of the vacancy. If a \nnomination is sent to the Senate during that 210 day period, an \nindividual may serve in an acting capacity until the Senate has \ncompleted action on the nomination. Moreover, the legislation gives a \nnew Administration an additional time period of 90 days to submit its \nnominations in the first year. The legislation allows first assistants, \nother Senate-confirmed officials, and other qualified high-level agency \nemployees to serve as acting officials.\n  Finally, the legislation creates an action-enforcing mechanism to \nencourage our presidents to promptly submit nominations. Specifically, \nthe legislation provides that if no nomination to fill a vacant \nposition is submitted within the 210 day period, the position remains \nvacant and any duties assigned exclusively to the position by statute \ncan be performed only by the agency head. As soon as a nomination is \nsubmitted, however, the legislation provides that an acting official \ncan assume the job until the Senate acts on the nomination.\n  The legislation also includes an amendment I authored to address the \nproblem of lengthy recesses or adjournments. The bill allows a person \nto serve in an acting capacity in a vacant position once a nomination \nis submitted, regardless of whether the nomination is submitted within \nor after the 210 day time period. This is a clarification the \nlegislation makes to current law. However, there was no provision to \nallow a person to serve in an acting capacity after the 210 day time \nperiod if the nomination is made during a recess or adjournment of the \nSenate. My amendment, incorporated into the enacted legislation as \nsection 3349d, provides that during such long recesses, the President's \nsubmission of a written notification that he or she intends to nominate \na designated person promptly when the Senate reconvenes triggers the \nprovision of the bill that allows a person to act in the position \ntemporarily until the Senate acts on the nomination. This allows the \nPresident to fill a vacant position with an acting person during a long \nrecess of the Senate provided the President has identified the person \nwhose nomination will be submitted when the Senate returns.\n  Mr. President, I want to commend my colleagues Senator Byrd and \nSenator Thurmond for their leadership and sponsorship of legislation to \namend the Vacancies Act. They identified a serious problem in the \nfailure of Administrations past and present to comply with their \nresponsibilities under the existing law to promptly nominate persons to \nfill advice and consent positions. They worked diligently to resolve \nthe various conflicts over this legislation, and I am pleased we were \nable to bring this legislation to a responsible and timely conclusion.\n  As we adopt these reforms to the Vacancies Act, we should not forget \nthat as Senators we have a corresponding duty to act promptly and \nresponsibly on nominations once they are submitted by the \nAdministration. We as the Senate rightfully want to protect our \nConstitutional prerogative to provide advice and consent on \nnominations. However, we must by the same token discharge these duties \nin a conscientious and timely manner.\n  Mr. President, I also want to mention one piece of legislation which \nthe Congress failed to address this year and which was not folded into \nthis Omnibus Appropriations bill in the final hours of this Congress. I \nam very disappointed that we were not able to enact legislation to \nimprove the regulatory process this year. Senator Thompson and I \nsponsored S. 981, the Regulatory Improvement Act. We had two hearings \non the bill and marked it up in the Governmental Affairs Committee back \nin March of this year. It was reported to the full Senate for \nconsideration in May. The Administration signaled its support for the \nbill with certain agreed-to changes in July. And, we've been urging \nthat the Majority Leader bring the bill to the floor since that time. \nThe bill now has 17 Republican and 8 Democratic cosponsors.\n  S. 981 is a reasonable approach to improving the regulatory process \nby requiring cost-benefit analysis and risk\n\n[[Page S12768]]\n\nassessment for our most significant regulations. It would bring \nmeaningful reform to the way the federal government adopts its \nregulations, and it would make the rulemaking process far more open and \ninteractive. We lost a great opportunity this year and invested a lot \nof hard work and effort.\n\n\nfurther research on fiber polymer additives in asphalt and concrete in \n         connection with the transportation appropriations act\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a brief colloquy \nwith my colleague, the Honorable Chairman of the Transportation \nAppropriations Subcommittee, Senator Richard Shelby.\n  Included in the Senate Appropriations Committee Report accompanying \nthe Transportation and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for fiscal \nyear 1999, is a provision directing that additional research be \nconducted on a product that I believe could greatly improve highway \npavement quality and maintenance. I am speaking of the use of fiber \npolymer additives--also known as ``binders''--in asphalt and concrete, \nthe use of which appears to yield significant results in pavement \nquality and longevity.\n  While only a limited amount of research has been completed on this \nproduct, the few applications tested under real world circumstances \nhave shown very positive results. If this product is as good as it \nappears to be in initial test results, it would revolutionize the \nindustry and save states and the Federal Government significant \nresources for use on other critical infrastructure needs.\n  Not only does this product appear to add significant longevity to \npavement life, it also serves an environmental benefit. Mr. Chairman, \nas you know, recycling allows us to conserve our natural resources, it \ndiverts additional material from our landfills, and saves energy. A \ncompany in my home state of South Carolina, Martin Color-Fi, Inc., has \nempirical data that shows substantially improved life expectancy for \nhighways constructed with polymer additives in the pavement. Their \nsuccess, and that of others in this area, is encouraging news for \nimproving the quality and longevity of our Nation's highways.\n  I note that the Statement of Manager's language accompanying the \nTransportation title of the Omnibus Appropriations Act, unlike the \nSenate Committee report, does not specify the amount of funds in the \nHighway Research, Development and Technology Program for the Federal \nHighway Administration (FHWA) to conduct additional demonstrations of \nthis technology. It is my understanding that Chairman Shelby shares my \ncommitment to this research. Further, it is my understanding that he \nand other members of the committee would join me in strongly \nencouraging FHWA to work with an academic institution, and give \npriority consideration to applying at least the amount of research \nfunds specified in the Senate-passed Transportation Appropriations \nbill, in order to create an academic and industry-led consortium to \ndemonstrate the application of polymer additives in pavement for civil \nengineering purposes.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to stand shoulder-to-\nshoulder with my colleague from South Carolina, the distinguished \nPresident pro tempore, in this effort to increase funding for research \ninto the use of polymer additives for asphalt and concrete pavement.\n  The Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee directed that $2 \nmillion be committed for further research into polymer additives. \nLimited resources prohibited us from committing additional resources to \nthis effort.\n  The provision the Committee added to the Report was designed to \nrespond to a shortfall in this area by directing federal research \nefforts into further study of the effects of polymer additives on \npavement quality and performance.\n  I greatly appreciate the Senator from South Carolina's interest in \nthis matter, and I look forward to working with him and the FHWA to \nensure this research is completed and reported to the states and other \ninterested parties in a timely fashion.\n  Mr. KERRY. There were legitimate reasons to vote against the omnibus \nappropriations bill. This process was an insult to the Congress. The \nRepublic leadership has put the Congress in an untenable position by \nrefusing to pass many appropriations bills in regular order. I chose to \nvote for this legislation because of the important things it does for \nMassachusetts and the nation, and because I do not believe it is useful \nto cast a protest vote. I am hopeful that in the 106th Congress we can \nengage in a true legislative process.\n  Today, the Senate will give final approval to legislation to preserve \na balanced budget for the first time in more than a generation. A \nbalanced federal budget has been a key objective for me since I came to \nthe Senate in 1985.\n  The Federal government had run a deficit continuously for more than \n30 years until last year. It soared to dangerous levels in the 1980s \nduring the Reagan and Bush Administrations. As a result of these \ndeficits, our national debt multiplied several times, exacting a heavy \ntoll on our economy, increasing interest rates, squeezing federal \nspending and making debt service one of the largest expenditures in the \nFederal budget.\n  In 1993, following President Clinton's election, we began the long \njourney back from crushing deficits and toward fiscal responsibility by \npassing an enormously successful economic plan. The full power of our \neconomy was unleashed: unemployment is at record low; interest rats are \nsubdued; and economic growth continues to be strong. This path \nculminated in last years; agreement to balance the budget and provide \nsubstantial broad-based tax relief for working American families and \nsmall businesses.\n  This year's federal budget is a continuation along the path of fiscal \nresponsibility. At the same time, it begins to address some of our most \npressing problems in education.\n  I am pleased that the omnibus appropriations bill rejects the House \nRepublican approach and expands spending on education. The bill \nincludes funding to begin hiring one hundred thousand new teachers \nwhich will assist local school communities to reduce class size in the \nearly grades to 18 students. One hundred thousand new teachers will \nallow more individual attention for students which will lead to better \nreading and math scores in the future.\n  The final bill also includes $75 million to recruit and prepare \nthousands of teachers to teach in high-poverty areas. It also includes \n$75 million to train new teachers in how to use technology so that they \ncan better assist their students. This funding is focused on assisting \nthe schools and teachers who need the most help.\n  We must do everything possible to increase the reading skills of our \nchildren so that they can compete in the global economy in the 21st \ncentury. This budget includes 260 million for the Child Literacy \nInitiative which will improve teachers' ability to teach reading, \nfamily literacy, and conduct tutor training to help children learn to \nread by the end of the third grade.\n  Five million children are locked into a school day that ends in the \nearly afternoon and dumps them into empty apartments, homes or violent \nstreets despite the fact that we know those post-school hours are when \nteen pregnancies occur, drug use begins, and juvenile crime flourishes. \nThe budget agreement includes $200 million for after-school programs \nthat will help keep 250,000 children of the streets and into learning.\n  We also must develop an educational system which prepares our \nchildren and young people for adulthood. Today, we are failing too many \nof our children with crumbling schools, overcrowded classrooms, and \ninadequately prepared teachers. The federal government provides a small \namount of the total funding for public elementary and secondary \neducation--less than seven percent of total public spending on K-12 \neducation comes from the federal government, down from just under 10 \npercent in 1980. Reading scores show that of 2.6 million graduating \nhigh school students, one-third are below basic reading level, one-\nthird are at basic, only one-third are proficient, and only 100,000 are \nat a world class reading level.\n  Mr. President, I am developing legislation for next year to help \nevery school make a new start on their own. It will be built on \nchallenge grants for schools to pursue comprehensive reform and adopt \nthe proven best practices of any other school, funds to help\n\n[[Page S12769]]\n\nevery school become a charter school within the public school system, \nincentives to make choice and competition a hallmark of our school \nsystems, and the resources to help schools fix their crumbling \ninfrastructure, get serious about crime, restore a sense of community \nto our schools, and send children to school ready to learn.\n  However, increased spending on education is meaningless if there are \nno adequate school facilities to teach our children. I am disappointed \nthat the Democrats' proposed tax credit to build and renovate our \nnation's schools was not included in the final budget agreement. Too \nmany schools now operate in substandard facilities which in some cases \nare dangerous to our children. Any initiatives to support education \nmust also include an investment to modernize our school buildings.\n  America's children especially need support during the formative, \npreschool years in order to thrive and grow to become contributing \nadults. Additionally, adequate child care is not affordable or even \navailable for too many families. That is why I believe we must provide \nmore help to working families to pay for critically needed, quality \nchild care, an early learning fund to assist local communities in \ndeveloping better child care programs, and sufficient funding to double \nthe number of infants and toddlers in Early Head Start. President \nClinton shares this view and included in his 1999 budget proposal my \nrecommendations on this issue. I am pleased that the final budget will \nalso include $182 million to increase the quality and affordability of \nchild care to assist our working families.\n  Transportation funding is also crucial to maintain our aging national \nhighway infrastructure. I am very pleased that the Omnibus \nAppropriations bill contains an additional $100 million in highway \nfunds for Massachusetts as well as approximately $80 million for \nimportant transportation projects around the state.\n  The Commonwealth has reached a critical juncture in its efforts to \nboth complete in Central Artery and Tunnel project and also to maintain \nand upgrade roads and bridges throughout the state. As many of my \ncolleagues are aware, the ISTEA reauthorization bill contained an \nunacceptably low level of highway funding for Massachusetts. In order \nto secure commitment not to delay Senate consideration of the ISTEA \nbill, Majority Leader Lott, Democratic Leader Daschle, Senators Chafee, \nand Baucus committed to me, among other things, that Massachusetts \nwould receive an additional $100 million in highway funds. The \ninclusion of this money in the omnibus bill represents the fulfillment \nof this promise. I wish to express my sincere appreciation to them for \nfollowing through on their commitment. I also wish to thank Senators \nByrd and Lautenberg for their help in securing this funding.\n  As noted above, the omnibus bill also contains $80 million for \ncritical transportation projects around the state. It will provide \nmillions of dollars to assist in completing the revitalization of \nhistoric Union Station in Worcester and Union Station in Springfield. \nIt will also provide millions to support the construction of intermodal \ncenters in Pittsfield and Westfield. Finally, the bill contains funds \nto support work on the North-South Rail Link in downtown Boston. It is \nmy hope that his project will continue to receive the funding that it \nis so sorely deserves.\n  Since 1995, when the conservative Republicans took control of this \nbody and forced upon the Congress the ``Contract-with-America,'' we \ncontinually have had to fight to retain existing environmental \nprotections. This year, we were successful in deleting a number of \nprovisions from the final budget that would have set back efforts to \nprotect our Nation's natural resources--our forests, parklands, \nfisheries and wildlife.\n  The final budget supports our environment and improves the lives of \nthe families around America by increasing funding for the clean water \nstate revolving fund, the safe drinking water state revolving fund, \nprotection of endangered species, preservation of precious lands, and \nthe development of cleaner energy technologies. I also am very pleased \nthat the final budget includes an additional $50 million for the \ncleanup of Boston Harbor to assist the 2.5 million ratepayers in 61 \nBoston area communities who will pay for the bonds which have primarily \nfinanced this project--$3.8 billion for the Boston Harbor sewage \ntreatment project, and $2.8 billion required for combined sewer \noverflows (CSOs) and other water and wastewater infrastructure upgrades \nfor the next 30 years.\n  I am pleased that Congress agreed to provide the full $17.9 billion \nthe administration requested to replenish IMF capital funds. The IMF \ndesperately needs this funding because financial crises in South Korea, \nJapan, and Indonesia greatly have depleted its resources. Without full \nfunding, the IMF would be inhibited from continuing its support of \neconomic recovery in these countries and others.\n  As the strongest political and economic power, the U.S. has a \nresponsibility to step up to the plate and exercise its leadership in \ndealing with this problem. I agree that the IMF needs to make some \nreforms to achieve greater accountability and management of its \nprograms. I believe that implementing the IMF reforms, as required \nunder this bill, will be a strong step in the effort to achieve greater \naccountability and management of IMF programs. We must be assured that \nIMF rescue packages effectively will harness economic stability while \nrelieving social and political tensions. The IMF must be a viable and \ndemonstrable institution that can bring about real change for nations \nsuffering under the strains of economic instability.\n  As ranking member of the Committee on Small Business, I must give the \nomnibus appropriations bill mixed marks with respect to showing \nCongress's support for SBA's small business assistance programs. I am \npleased that the Omnibus Appropriations Act adequately funds SBA's \ndisaster loan program and fully funds the agency's salaries and \nexpenses. To do otherwise would have been irresponsible and detrimental \nto the nation's small businesses and victims of natural disasters. The \nbill takes positive steps with respect to women-owned and veteran-owned \nbusinesses. The funding for SBA's Women's Business Centers is doubled \nto $8 million, consistent with reauthorizing legislation enacted last \nyear, and veteran outreach receives $750,000, the first funding for \nveteran-owned businesses since fiscal year 1995. The bill contains a \nmodest increase for the Small Business Development Centers, which \nprovide valuable business counseling and training to small businesses \nthroughout the country. The SBA's venture capital program received \nsignificant increases in funding, and the cornerstone 7(a) loan \nguarantee program received substantial funding, although less than the \nadministration requested for fiscal year 1999.\n  Unfortunately, although the omnibus appropriations bill contains some \nincreased funding for SBA's successful Microloan program, I am \ndisappointed that it fails to adopt the significant increases to the \nMicroloan program, which the authorizing committees envisioned last \nyear when Congress passed SBA's three-year reauthorization bill. That \nbill, which was reported out of the Committee on Small Business \nunanimously, made the Microloan program a permanent part of SBA's \nfinancial assistance portfolio and substantially increased \nauthorization levels for both loans and technical assistance. Based on \nthose legislative changes, the Administration requested that direct \nmicroloan be funded at the fully authorized level. During the \nappropriations process, Senator Grassley and nine of our colleagues \njoined me in sending two letters to the Subcommittee leadership voicing \nour support for full funding of the Microloan program, including a \nspecific request for increased and adequate technical assistance \nfunding. In those letters we described the relationship between loans \nin the Microloan program and technical assistance. Simply put, adequate \ntechnical assistance funding is prerequisite to successful \nmicrolending. The microloan and technical assistance funding contained \nin this bill will allow only minimal, if any, growth in this program, \nwhich helps the nation's neediest borrowers.\n  I am also disappointed that the Economic Research arm of SBA's Office \nof Advocacy did not receive the $1.4 million, requested by the \nadministration and passed by the Senate. The research performed by that \noffice is highly respected and very valuable to work of\n\n[[Page S12770]]\n\nthe Committees on Small Business in both bodies and to other small \nbusiness policy makers.\n  I support the omnibus appropriations bill because I believe it is an \nacceptable compromise which keeps the federal government on the path of \nfiscal responsibility while beginning to fund critically needed and \nlong overdue initiatives to assist America's children. I look forward \nto building on this budget to address the unfinished business of the \nAmerican people in the 106th Congress.\n\n\n           Extension of the Generalized System of Preferences\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased that Congress has once \nagain extended the Generalized System of Preferences as part of the \nomnibus appropriations bill. The GSP is important for many reasons. For \ninstance, from a foreign relations standpoint it allows the U.S. to \nassist developing countries without the use of direct foreign aid.\n  It is also of great importance to American businesses. Many American \nbusinesses import raw materials or other products. The expiration of \nthe GSP has forced these companies to pay a duty, or a tax, on some of \nthese products. That's what a duty is: an additional tax. By extending \nthe GSP retroactively, these companies will not be required to pay this \ntax. This tax is significant and can cost U.S. businesses hundreds of \nmillions of dollars. So, Mr. President, it is very important that the \nGSP be extended and it is very appropriate that the Senate consider it \nas part of this bill.\n  It is essential to remember, however, that since its inception in the \nTrade Act of 1974, the GSP program has provided for the exemption of \n``articles which the President determines to be import-sensitive.'' \nThis is a very important directive and critical to our most import-\neffected industries. A clear example of an import-sensitive article \nwhich should not be subject to GSP and, thus, not subject to the annual \npetitions of foreign producers that can be filed under this program, is \nceramic tile.\n  It is well documented that the U.S. ceramic tile market repeatedly \nhas been recognized as extremely import-sensitive. During the past \nthirty-years, this U.S. industry has had to defend itself against a \nvariety of unfair and illegal import practices carried out by some of \nour trading partners. Imports already dominate the U.S. ceramic tile \nmarket and have done so for the last decade. They currently provide \napproximately 60 percent of the largest and most important glazed tile \nsector according to 1995 year-end government figures.\n  Moreover, one of the guiding principles of the GSP program has been \nreciprocal market access. Currently, GSP eligible beneficiary countries \nsupply almost one-fourth of the U.S. ceramic tile imports, and they are \nrapidly increasing their sales and market shares. U.S. ceramic tile \nmanufacturers, however, are still denied access to many of these \nforeign markets.\n  Also, previous abuses of the GSP eligible status with regard to some \nceramic tile product lines have been well documented. In 1979, the USTR \nrejected various petitions for duty-free treatment of ceramic tile from \ncertain GSP beneficiary countries. With the acquiescence of the U.S. \nindustry, however, the USTR at that time created a duty-free exception \nfor the then-minuscule category of irregular edged ``specialty'' mosaic \ntile. Immediately thereafter, I am told that foreign manufacturers from \nmajor GSP beneficiary countries either shifted their production to \n``specialty'' mosaic tile or simply identified their existing products \nas ``specialty\" mosaic tile on custom invoices and stopped paying \nduties on these products. These actions flooded the U.S. market with \nduty-free ceramic tiles that apparently had been superficially restyled \nor mislabeled.\n  In light of these factors, the U.S. industry has been recognized by \nsuccessive Congresses and Administrations as ``import-sensitive'' \ndating back to the Dillon and Kennedy Rounds of the General Agreement \non Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Yet during this same period, the American \nceramic tile industry has been forced to defend itself from over a \ndozen petitions filed by various designated GSP-eligible countries \nseeking duty-free treatment for their ceramic tile sent into this \nmarket.\n  The domestic ceramic tile industry has been fortunate, to date, \nbecause both the USTR and the International Trade Commission have \nrecognized the ``import-sensitivity'' of the U.S. market and have \ndenied these repeated petitions. If, however, just one petitioning \nnation ever succeeds in gaining GSP benefits for ceramic tile, then all \nGSP beneficiary countries will be entitled to similar treatment. This \ncould eliminate many American tile jobs and devastate the domestic \nindustry. Therefore it is my strong belief that a proven ``import \nsensitive,'' and already import-dominated product, such as ceramic \ntile, should not continually be subjected to defending against repeated \nduty-free petitions, but should be exempted from the GSP program.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, it is a bittersweet task that brings us back \nto Washington for one last vote before the end of the 105th Congress. \nToday, we will complete our work on the fiscal year 1999 budget.\n  To be sure, there is much that I like about the Conference Report \nbefore us, but there are some provisions that I strongly disagree with. \nOn balance, however, it is a budget that is worthy of support.\n  Like many of my colleagues, I must lament the process that has \nbrought us to this point--20 days after the start of the fiscal year. \nThe Conference Report that we are about to vote on is almost 4,000 \npages long. We have been given only a few hours to examine it. None of \nus knows the complete contents of the legislation, and there has been \nno opportunity to debate or offer amendments.\n  Fortunately, we have avoided a budgetary train-wreck similar to the \none that closed down the government in 1995. But, Mr. President, this \nyear the train is extremely late, and to hear the debate in this \nchamber, nobody wants to take responsibility for driving the engine.\n  We have subverted the regular budgetary process, failing even to pass \na Budget Resolution. The majority could not reconcile its own \ndiscordant priorities to pass this blueprint legislation, which is \nrequired by law.\n  On this side of the aisle, we had a definitive agenda: preserve the \nbudget surplus to save Social Security, invest in education, pass \nhealth care reform legislation, pass campaign finance reform, and pass \nlegislation to prevent the tobacco industry from preying on our \nyoungsters.\n  The President made these goals clear in his State of the Union \nAddress and later with his fiscal year 1999 budget proposal. Claims \nthat the priorities on this side were hidden until the very end are \nfalse. We have been here all along, working toward goals that the \nAmerican people recognize as important, and we have had some success in \nachieving these goals in this legislation. There are a few provisions \nof the Conference Report that I would like to highlight:\n  This legislation preserves the surplus to help save Social Security.\n  It includes $1.2 billion for efforts to reduce class-size, of which \n$5.6 million would be awarded to my home state of Rhode Island. The \nomnibus bill also allocates funding to improve teacher preparation and \nrecruitment, a cause that I was actively involved with during the \ndrafting of the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1998.\n  The budget bill also includes funding for critical reading \nlegislation--$260 million to help address the serious declines in \nliteracy levels that have left 40% of America's fourth graders without \nbasic literacy skills. The newly created GEAR UP program would receive \n$120 million under the bill. This ambitious new initiative will help \nencourage youngsters living in high poverty areas to pursue their \nhigher education goals.\n  Finally, this Conference Report contains $33 million for the \nconstruction of as many as five new Job Corps centers, including one in \nRhode Island, which is one of only four states currently without a \ncenter.\n  On the negative side, $800 million in subsidies for the Tennessee \nValley Authority (TVA) was slipped into this legislation. Neither House \nof Congress included this level of funding in its version of the Energy \nand Water Appropriations bill. The omnibus package also retains a \npoorly constructed rider that prevents the Occupation Safety and Health \nAdministration (OSHA) from conducting inspections on small\n\n[[Page S12771]]\n\nfarms in response to fatal accidents involving minors. I am committed \nto addressing both of these issues next year.\n  This Conference Report is also bad for what it does not contain. In \nparticular, it lacks funding for school construction, which is required \nto help meet the $121 billion need for new and refurbished schools, nor \ndoes it include an important bipartisan initiative authored by Senators \nJeffords and Kennedy to help individuals with disabilities join the \nworkforce while maintaining their essential Medicare and Medicaid \ncoverage.\n  Finally, it fails to adequately fund the Leveraging Educational \nAssistance Partnership (LEAP), a federal-state program that is a major \nsource of higher education grant aid. I worked hard with the other \nauthors of the Higher Education Act Amendments to reauthorize and \nimprove this program, and I believe the failure to sufficiently fund \nLEAP is short-sighted.\n  Mr. President, there is much that could be done to improve this \nConference Report, but we must pass it to keep the government open. It \nis unfortunate that we have been put in the position of having to vote \nup or down on this hefty omnibus package with no opportunity to offer \namendments, no opportunity for a substantive debate, and little chance \nto review the measure itself. Fast-Track budgeting at the end of a \nCongress is no way to make up for time squandered at the beginning. I \nhope that this is the last time we follow this kind of eleventh-hour, \ngerry-rigged process.\n\n\n                 ryan white aids funding under title iv\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would like to engage the Chairman and Ranking \nMember of the Labor-Health and Human Services (HHS) Appropriations \nSubcommittee in a brief colloquy concerning pediatric AIDS \ndemonstrations funded under Title IV of the Ryan White CARE Act.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would be pleased to engage in a colloquy.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I, too, would be pleased to engage in a colloquy with the \nSenator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would first like to commend and thank the Chairman \nand Ranking Member for their work to ensure our Nation's continued \nstrong commitment to our children and families tragically infected with \nHIV by providing support for Title IV of the Ryan White CARE Act. Title \nIV programs are designed to coordinate health care and assure that it \nis focused on families' needs and based in their communities. These \nprograms are the providers of care to the majority of children, youth, \nand families with HIV/AIDS in our country, ensuring these families have \naccess to the comprehensive array of services they need. A portion of \nTitle IV funds may be used to provide peer-based training and technical \nassistance through national organizations that collaborate with \nprojects to ensure development of innovative models of family centered \nand youth centered care; advanced provider training for pediatric, \nadolescent, and family HIV providers; coordination with research \nprograms, and other technical assistance activities.\n  The Senate report stated that the Committee intends for the \nDepartment to continue its Title IV support of the National Pediatric \nand Family HIV Resource Center located within the University of \nMedicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. The Title IV funding needed to \nsupport the Center's work is $1.1 million per year. Is it correct that \nthe managers intend for the Department to continue to support the \nNational Pediatric and Family HIV Resource Center?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Yes, the Senator from New Jersey is correct. The \ncommittee intends that the National Pediatric and Family HIV Resource \nCenter should continue to receive adequate funding.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I concur with the Chairman.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member for their \nsupport, and for their continued work in this very important component \nof our national HIV/AIDS strategy.\n\n\n                      parkinson's disease funding\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, one year ago this body adopted, by a vote \nof 95 to 3, legislation increasing our nation's commitment to finding \nthe cause and cure for a long overlooked, but truly devastating \ndisorder: Parkinson's disease. I was proud to cosponsor and vote for \nthe Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Disease Research Act, signed into law \nas part of the Fiscal 1998 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education \nand Related Agencies Appropriations Act. The Udall Act authorized $100 \nmillion in research focused on Parkinson's disease to be funded through \nthe National Institutes of Health in fiscal year 1998, 1999 and beyond.\n  The passage of the Udall Act was a great accomplishment, particularly \nfor the hundreds and thousands of victims, and their families and \nfriends, who worked so diligently to bring this issue to the Congress \nand make us aware of the need for additional Parkinson's research \nfunding. I would also like to commend the Senior Senator from \nPennsylvania, one of the true champions of medical research, for his \nstrong support of the Udall Act and Parkinson's research.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I appreciate the remarks of my friend from Mississippi. \nHe is correct that Parkinson's disease is a very serious disability, \nbut one for which medical science does hold great promise. In addition, \nI too would like to commend the efforts of the Parkinson's community \nwho have worked tirelessly to achieve passage of the Udall Act and \nincrease funding for Parkinson's research.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am concerned that the National \nInstitutes of Health has implemented neither the letter nor the spirit \nof the Udall Act, and that funding for Parkinson's-focused research has \nnot increased in a fashion consistent with Congressional intent. An \nindependent analysis, conducted by Parkinson's researchers at \ninstitutions all around the country, of the grants NIH defined as its \nParkinson's research portfolio for fiscal year 1997 indicates that a \nmajority of the grants are in fact not focused on Parkinson's disease. \nOnly 34 percent of the funding NIH claims is Parkinson's research is \nactually Parkinson's-focused research, as required by the Udall Act. As \ntroubling as that is, the study also found that 38 percent of the \nfunding has no relation whatsoever to finding a cause or cure for this \nterrible affliction.\n  It is my understanding from published NIH budgetary documents that \n$106 million is expected to be allocated to Parkinson's research in \nfiscal year 1999. My concern is that without more direction from \nCongress, the NIH will undermine the intent of the Udall Act by \ncontinuing to classify, as part of its Parkinson's portfolio, research \nthat is not focused on Parkinson's disease and, in doing so, will allow \nmeritorious and much-needed Parkinson's research projects to go \nunfunded. I propose that a hearing be held early in 1999 to address and \nclarify these matters.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The gentleman has brought up important issues, which \nwarrant further discussion.\n  Mr. CRAIG. As a sponsor of the Udall Act and supporter of Parkinson's \nresearch funding, I appreciate the Chairman's interest in these \nmatters. The NIH claimed to spend more than $89 million on Parkinson's \nresearch in 1997. The Congress set a baseline authorization of $100 \nmillion for Parkinson's research in the fiscal year 1998 bill making \nNIH appropriations and clearly stated in report language that \nCongressional intent was to increase the commitment of NIH resources to \nParkinson's. Close review of NIH's Parkinson's funding practices \nindicates that most of the research funding they define as Parkinson's \nis, in fact, not focused on Parkinson's at all. The NIH claimed to \nspend more than $89 million on Parkinson's research, in FY 1997. In \nreality, we later discovered that less than $31 million--just more than \none third--of that research was truly focused on Parkinson's. Obviously \nthere seems to be some disconnect here. Congress needs to be as clear \nas possible when communicating our intent to NIH, and diligent when \noverseeing their funding practices with regard to Parkinson's. I agree \nwith Senator Cochran that hearings should be held early next year to \naddress these issues, and I look forward to working with him, the \nChairman, and others to see this resolved.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the gentleman from Idaho and look forward to \nfuture discussions on his suggestions. It is a pleasure to recognize \nthe sponsor of the Udall Act, and someone who remains very close to Mo \nand the Udall family, the distinguished Senator from Arizona.\n\n[[Page S12772]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Pennsylvania. The Senator is \ncorrect that this is an issue of personal importance to me, and I \nappreciate his support as we work to defeat this terrible disease. I \nwould also like to acknowledge the tremendous efforts of the \nParkinson's community--courageous individuals in my state and all \nacross the country who have worked so hard to pass the Udall Act and \ncontinue to work to achieve its full funding.\n  There are an estimated one million Americans living with Parkinson's \ndisease, and the nature of its symptoms are such that they impact \nheavily on families and loved ones as well. Add to these staggering \nhuman costs the fiscal burden of health care expenses and lost \nproductivity, and it's easy to see that Parkinson's deserves to be a \nhigher national priority. Parkinson's disease also represents a real \nresearch opportunity, where an investment of funds is likely to yield \nimproved therapies sure to reduce both the personal and financial costs \nto our families and our nation.\n  To realize this opportunity, though, it is up to Congress and the NIH \nto ensure that these funds get allocated to research focused on \nParkinson's. Chairman Specter and others in this body have worked hard \nto ensure that NIH has the overall funding it needs to aggressively \npursue research opportunities like those relating to Parkinson's. I \nhave received a letter dated May 21, 1998 from NIH Director, Dr. Harold \nVarmus, which includes a chart indicating that the NIH will spend over \n$106 million on Parkinson's research in fiscal year 1999. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues and the NIH to see that this \nfunding goes for research principally focused on the cause, \npathogenesis, and/or potential therapies or treatments for Parkinson's \ndisease as mandated by the Udall Act.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the gentleman for his remarks, and look forward \nto continuing to work with him on these matters. Now I would like to \nrecognize the other Senate sponsor of the Udall Act, another Senator \nwith a deep and sincere connection to Parkinson's disease, the \ngentleman from Minnesota, Senator Wellstone.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator, and commend him for his support \non this very important issue. I also wish to thank my friend, Senator \nMcCain, for joining me last year in sponsoring the Udall Act.\n  I believed when we passed the Udall Act last year we had begun to \nchange a sad history of chronic underfunding of Parkinson's by the NIH. \nIt was a very personal victory for me--and for all those who fought so \nhard to see the Udall Act enacted into law.\n  I am here today, along with my colleagues, in an effort to fulfill \nthe promise of the Udall Act and the commitment we in Congress made to \npeople with Parkinson's, their families and those researchers dedicated \nto curing this disease. I find it very disheartening to learn that so \nlittle of the research NIH claims to devote to Parkinson's is actually \nParkinson's-focused as called for by the Utall Act. it was our intent \nand it is our obligation to ensure that at least $100 million in \nresearch specifically focused on Parkinson's is allocated. And if it \ntakes stronger language, more oversight, or congressional hearings to \nguarantee it gets done, then that's what we must do.\n  Members of the Senate have expressed their interest in seeing the \nUdall Act fully funded in fiscal year 1999, and we have taken some \npositive steps this year to accomplish that goal. But our work is not \ndone. The ultimate goal is not legislative accomplishments. It is not \nadding more dollars to this account or that one. The ultimate goal is \nto find a cure for this horrible, debilitating disease so that more \npeople don't have to suffer the way my parents and our family did, or \nthe way Mo Udall and his family does, or the way countless families do \nevery day in this country. By passing the Udall Act we made a promise \nto put the necessary resources into the skilled hands of researchers \ndedicated to finding that cure. I intend, as I know my colleagues and \nthose in the Parkinson's community intend, to do everything I can to \nfulfill that promise.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator from Minnesota and all of my \ncolleagues for their remarks today about Parkinson's research funding \nthrough the NIH. I look forward to working closely to address the \nconcerns expressed here today.\n\n\n             springfield, vt, workforce development center\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to engage my good friend \nand colleague, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and \nHuman Services and Education Appropriations in a colloquy regarding a \nprovision in this legislation that is of great importance to me.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would be pleased to join my good friend and colleague \nin a colloquy.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. The Springfield region of Vermont currently faces a \ncrisis in the machine tool industries. Six major machine tool employers \nin the area indicate that more than 50 percent of their workforce will \nretire within the next five to seven years. This will create the need \nfor highly skilled employees to fill more than 700 positions in machine \ntechnology. In addition, other employers in the areas of information \ntechnology, hospitality and travel, financial services and food \nservices industries indicate that they have an urgent need for a \nresponsive education delivery system designed to meet their growing \ndemand for skilled labor. I understand that the conference report \nincludes funds for the Springfield Workforce Development Center to \nimplement innovative training and vocational education strategies to \nmeet the education, workforce and economic development needs of the \nregion.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Senator is correct. The Appropriations Committee \nrecommendation includes funding for the Springfield Workforce \nDevelopment Center, and this recommendation is retained in the \nconference agreement on the omnibus bill.\n\n\n                  medical university of south carolina\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. May I enjoin the Senator from Pennsylvania in a \ncolloquy?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I would be pleased to hear from the Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I would like to clarify an item contained in the \nstatement of the managers of the omnibus appropriations bill. In the \nhealth facilities section of the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration, reference is made to a project intended for the Medical \nUniversity of South Carolina. Inadvertently, the word ``Medical'' was \nnot included in the statement of the managers; however, that word's \ninclusion was clearly the intent of the managers.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator for his clarifying statement.\n\n\n                          hepatitis c funding\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Will the chairman of the Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will be pleased to yield to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. As the chairman knows, hepatitis C is the most common \nblood-borne infection in the United States. The CDC estimates that \nthere are 4 million Americans--or 2 percent of the population--that are \ninfected. Each year there are 10,000 deaths due to hepatitis C and the \ndeath total will increase to 30,000 a year unless something is done to \nintervene with the progression of this disease in the United States. \nUnfortunately, the vast majority of people infected with hepatitis C \nare not even aware that they are infected because the disease is \n``silent`` without symptoms sometimes for decades. Meanwhile these \ninfected individuals may be passing the disease on, causing new \ninfections to occur each year. We need to break this cycle by helping \nindividuals learn they have hepatitis C and by getting them to seek \ncounseling, testing, and treatment of their infection and begin to \nunderstand the seriousness of this epidemic.\n  Additional funds are needed to support both a targeted look back \neffort to reach the 300,000 Americans who have hepatitis C as a result \nof exposure to blood products prior to 1992, when blood was not \nadequately screened for hepatitis C and a general media campaign to \nalert other Americans infected by hepatitis C. These funds are needed \nto fund cooperative efforts of State and local health departments and \nnational voluntary health agencies such as the American Liver \nFoundation to identify, educate, counsel, test and refer for treatment \nthose infected. The efforts should be bolstered by a toll-free hotline \nto help provide information and\n\n[[Page S12773]]\n\ncounseling. In addition, since not everyone can afford private testing, \nsome of these funds should be made available to public health agencies \nfor clinic testing and other testing options, including FDA-approved \ntelemedicine testing services.\n  The chairman and the committee have some very strong report language \nfocused on this issue and the chairman is well aware of this problem. I \ncompliment him for the guidance he has given to the CDC on this issue. \nI have been informed by the CDC that $48 million is needed and at a \nminimum $16 million is needed just to begin to address this epidemic in \nfiscal year 1999. Can this amount be found within the totals \nrecommended by the conferees?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Senator for her question. I agree that more \nneeds to be done by CDC to address the hepatitis C epidemic. The \nconferees have provided a substantial increase for Infectious Diseases \nat CDC and I will urge the CDC to allocate increased resources to this \nmatter.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the chairman of the Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education Appropriations subcommittee for his response. \nAgain, I compliment him and the ranking member, Tom Harkin, for their \nhard work on the Labor/HHS appropriations bill.\n\n\n         drexel university intelligent infrastructure institute\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to thank the \nchairman of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee for having \nincluded in this legislation funding for the Drexel University \nIntelligent Infrastructure Institute. I have been pleased to have \nworked with Drexel for several years on obtaining funding to establish \nthe institute, which will focus on the link between intelligent \ntransportation systems and transportation infrastructure. Drexel has \nteamed up with the Delaware River Port Authority to study that agency's \ninfrastructure, which includes four major bridges that provide critical \nlinks in the east coast corridor. Congress has previously appropriated \n$750,000 toward this project and authorized establishment of the \ninstitute in the TEA-31 legislation enacted earlier this year.\n  It is my understanding that it is the intent of the managers for the \nTransportation Appropriations bill that the $500,000 provided for the \ninstitute shall be made available pursuant to the provisions of section \n5118 of TEA-21, which specifically authorizes the establishment of the \nInstitute.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I want to thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for his \ncomments and to confirm his understanding with respect to the Drexel \nInstitute. As noted in the Senate committee report, the funds allocated \nwithin the Statement of Managers are to be made available for the \npurposes expressed in section 5118 of TEA-21.\n\n\n      the american competitiveness and work force improvement act\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the compromise H-1B \nvisa legislation included in the omnibus appropriations bill. I am \npleased a compromise was achieved that has now passed the House by a \nvote of more than two to one.\n  With the demand in this country rising for this category of highly \nskilled workers currently in short supply in the U.S., I believe there \nis a need to temporarily increase this visa category. The engine now \ndriving our successful economy is being fueled in large part by growth \nin the information technology industry. I am told these high tech \nindustries account for about one-third of our real economic growth. \nAccording to the Information Technology Industry Data Book, 1998-2008, \nthe domestic revenue from the U.S. information technology industry is \nprojected to be $703 billion for the year 2000.\n  With this sudden surge in industry growth, the United States has \nfound itself unprepared to supply the large numbers of math and \nengineering graduates necessary to support this growth. In fact, \nAmerican schools are producing fewer math and engineering graduates \nthan in the past.\n  We have been forced to address this current imbalance by temporarily \nallowing needed high-tech workers to work in our country. This is \nnecessary until we can develop the expertise we need in the country.\n  This compromise bill will do just that. For the next 3 years, \nadditional workers from foreign countries will be allowed to work here. \nDuring this time, Americans will be educated to fill these jobs through \nscholarships and job training financed by fees collected from employers \npetitioning for the current foreign workers. We must do more to ensure \nour work force meet the demands of a growing, more sophisticated \neconomy--that we have the educated work force we need to continue to \nprosper and provide better jobs for Americans.\n  There are other important issues covered by the bill including \nincreased penalties for violations of law by employers, random \ninvestigations of employers sponsoring H-1B visas by the Department of \nLabor and protection of ``whistleblowing'' employees. I think this \ncompromise is something that will help us now and in the future. I urge \nits passage.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the Omnibus \nConsolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act before us. \nThis was not an easy decision because there are many parts of this \nlegislation I support. But, on balance, I cannot support a bill that is \nin essence sloppy--both in the process by which it was constructed and \nin its content.\n  We are asked today to vote--up or down--on a bill that contains eight \nof thirteen appropriations bills that fund the government and almost \n$500 billion in government spending, nearly 30 percent of our budget. \nWe have one vote, little debate, and no chance of amendment on what has \nbeen described as the largest piece of spending legislation in recent \nhistory. And beyond the spending sections of the bill, it also includes \nvarious pieces of authorizing legislation--seven different drug bills, \nhome health care reform, and Internet tax moratorium, a tax cut that \nwill cost $9.2 billion over the next nine years among other items.\n  This is a huge measure--a measure that the esteemed Senator Byrd has \ncalled a ``monstrosity,'' and he is right. It is a measure that, in its \nentirety, few have seen and no one understands. Yet today, we are asked \nto say ``yes'' or ``no'' to it. How can we say ``yes'' to a budget that \nwe have not read, have not participated in its drafting, have not even \nseen? To do so would be irresponsible and undemocratic.\n  In saying this, I mean no disrespect to those of my colleagues who \nhave worked very hard to try to make this process fair. The negotiators \nwere caught in a bind that all of Congress has a responsibility for \ncreating: We let partisanship and politics get in the way of passing a \nthoughtful budget this year, and so now we are stuck slapping a budget \ntogether at the last minute.\n  I commend the negotiators for doing the best they could. All parties \nwere as responsive as this terrible situation allowed. The Democratic \nleadership in the Senate and Representative Obey were vigilant in \ntrying to protect the interests of Wisconsin during negotiations, and \nthey were successful in doing some good for our State and in avoiding a \ngreat deal of bad.\n  I also do not mean to suggest that there are no items in this \nlegislation that I support. There are many good policies, provisions \nand priorities established here.\n  For the most part, I am pleased with the final form of the Treasury-\nGeneral Government appropriations bill which I worked on as the \nSubcommittee's Ranking Member. Controversial language tampering with \nthe Federal Election Commission's staff was dropped. Important language \nguaranteeing adequate contraceptive coverage to federal employees was \nretained. And many important law enforcement and financial agencies \nwere funded at adequate levels. In addition, that bill allocated money \nfor fighting the war on drugs in my State--an additional $1.5 million \nto expand the Milwaukee High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) \nand additional funds for expanding the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction \nImitative operating now in Milwaukee.\n  The Omnibus bill also makes a strong investment in the education of \nour children, starting from early childhood education and continuing \nthrough higher education. The bill increases funding for the Child Care \nand Development Block Grant to over $1.18 billion,\n\n[[Page S12774]]\n\nan increase of $182 million. This includes a continuation of the $19.1 \nmillion set-aside for resource and referral programs, which help \nparents locate quality, affordable child care in their communities. In \naddition, we increased funding for Head Start by over $300 million, \nincreased funding for Disadvantaged Students (Title I) by over $300 \nmillion, increased Special Education funding by over $500 million, and \nprovided $1.1 billion to local school districts to help reduce class \nsize in the early grades. We also provided over $300 million more for \nStudent Aid, including an increase in the maximum Pell Grant to $3,125.\n  In addition to investing in our children, the bill also ensures that \nwe take care of our nation's elderly. Despite the fact that the House \neliminated funding for LIHEAP, we were able to restore that funding to \nits full amount of $1.1 billion, ensuring that the elderly will not \nhave to choose between food and heat during the cold winter months. We \nalso increased funding for the Administration on Aging, including a $3 \nmillion increase for the Ombudsman program, which serves as an advocate \nfor the elderly in long-term care facilities.\n  This appropriations measure also includes vital funding for highways \nand transit at the historic levels approved by Congress as part of the \nTransportation Equity Act earlier this year and a strong level of \ninvestment in airport improvement. In addition, the transportation \npiece of the omnibus bill funds a number of Wisconsin specific items, \nincluding Wisconsin statewide bus programs that play a crucial role in \nour welfare to work efforts, the renovation of the Milwaukee Train \nStation, crash and congestion prevention technology funding for the \nState, commuter rail planning and grade crossing mitigation funds for \nSoutheastern Wisconsin and funding for the Coast Guard's Great Lakes' \nicebreaker and Seagoing Buoy Tender replacement programs.\n  The transportation piece of the omnibus package includes an important \nauthorization provision affecting Milwaukee, Wisconsin's East West \nCorridor project. In the ISTEA reauthorization debate, the future of \nthis project fell victim to politics and backroom dealing. \nSpecifically, a provision was attached to the reauthorization \nlegislation, the Transportation Equity Act or so-called TEA-21 law, \nwhich sought to undermine the framework of local decision making \ncreated by the original ISTEA in 1991. Worse still, this TEA-21 \nprovision had not been debated as part of either the House or Senate \nreauthorization bills, but was added to the final bill at the eleventh \nhour despite the objections of those Members of Congress most impacted.\n  As a member of the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, I \nattempted to mitigate the damage done by the TEA-21 provision by \nattaching an amendment to the Senate Transportation Appropriations bill \nfor Fiscal Year 1999. My amendment reaffirms the right of local \nofficials to decide what transportation projects best fit the needs of \ntheir community. It simply makes sure that all parties who deserve to \nbe at the decision making table have an equal seat at that table. I am \npleased that a compromise version of my amendment is included in the \nomnibus package. It is my sincere hope that State and local officials \nwill now work together to move ahead expeditiously with the East West \nCorridor improvements. Fairness has won the day, now consensus and \ncooperation must yield progress on a project of vital importance to the \neconomy and quality of life in Southeastern Wisconsin.\n  I also am pleased several provisions I worked for throughout the year \nhave made it into the portion of the bill covering Commerce-Justice-\nState appropriations. Most importantly, the legislation includes more \nthan a threefold increase in crime prevention spending through Title V, \na juvenile crime prevention program I authored six years ago. The \nfunding level was increased from $20 million to $70 million. This \nshould provide WI with around $1 million in prevention spending next \nyear, a big boost from the approximately $340,000 it received last year \nout of the lower funding level.\n  The bill also extends a limited number of important tax provisions in \na fiscally responsible manner--meaning these provisions are paid for, \nbut not at the expense of the social security surplus. In particular, I \nstrongly support the acceleration of the increase in the deduction for \nhealth insurance of the self-employed and the permanent extension of \nincome averaging. Both these measures will go a long way to ease the \ntax burdens of Wisconsin's farmers and small business people. When we \nreturn in the spring, it is my hope that we will approve the reforms \nnecessary to preserve the long term viability of social security, as \nwell as enact more additional targeted, fiscally sound tax relief \nmeasures, such as my Child Care Tax Credit.\n  Finally, I applaud the Administration for recognizing the financial \ncrisis that is sweeping the agricultural sector of the Midwest this \nsummer. The legislation also wisely adds more money for market losses \nand drought in the southern U.S.\n  In addition, this bill does more than recognize the current problems \nin rural America. Although modest, the bill provides more financial \nhelp to maintain the viability of Wisconsin agriculture by \nappropriating $17 million more for agricultural research than last \nyear, allowing the University of Wisconsin to develop the new \ntechnologies that will soon be the new production practices used by \nfarmers. Soil and Water Conservation programs spending will increase by \n$8 million, enhancing programs like the Environmental Quality \nImprovement Program (EQIP). An additional $23 million was added for the \nAdministration's Food Safety Initiative which includes money to \nincrease the surveillance, research and education relating to food-\nborne illnesses. And finally, Congress agreed to pay dairy farmers for \nthe transitioning of the industry to a more market oriented system as \nordered by the last farm bill. Dairy producers will receive an \nestimated $200 million for agreeing to end the price support system in \n1999.\n  However, I still have significant concerns that Congress decided to \npostpone the consolidation of the milk marketing orders required by the \n1996 Farm Bill and to extend the Northeast Dairy Compact. Our outdated, \nunfair pricing system must come to an end. It was wrong to use this \nbill to extend its life--and the life of a controversial regional price \nfixing scheme--both policies that hurt competitive Wisconsin family \nfarmers.\n  Another major problem with this bill is the use of the budget surplus \nto fund over $20 billion ``emergency'' spending. Certainly, some of \nthese funds will go to meet truly unanticipated and urgent needs--like \nmilitary deployments, natural disaster recovery efforts, and a response \nto the farm crisis sweeping the center of the nation. These are one-\ntime, compassionate and necessary expenditures that must be made \nregardless of budget rules.\n  Unfortunately, a significant portion of the so-called ``emergency'' \nmoney is not for true emergencies. For example, $1.3 billion is for \nmilitary readiness--a worthy goal, but one that we ought to budget for \nas part of our annual budget process. I certainly hope it is not news \nto anyone that we expect our military to be ready to defend us. In \naddition, $50 million of that money is for ``morale, welfare, and \nrecreation.'' Again, I agree with the goal of keeping our troops fit \nand content--but doing so should be a priority in every year's budget, \nnot an off-budget item described as an ``unanticipated need.''\n  Many of us have argued that we ought not to use the budget surplus as \nan excuse to abandon fiscal discipline. We still need to save--for the \nSocial Security obligations and health care needs of an aging \npopulation, for the rainy day that world economic instability may bring \nabout, for the trust of the American taxpayer who expect us to use \ntheir tax dollars wisely. We succeeded in balancing the budget; it \nmakes no sense to celebrate by unbalancing it again.\n  I am also concerned about the pork that is the inevitable result of \nthe haphazard and closed process that produced this legislation. I do \nnot know what it is now, but I do know it will show up as we--and the \npublic and the press--pore over the 8000 pages of this legislation over \nthe next few weeks.\n  In the end, as with any vote, the final decision has to be a result \nof weighing the good and the bad. No bill is perfect; most are the \nresult of compromise. But\n\n[[Page S12775]]\n\nin this bill, the balance of good and bad is tipped by the undemocratic \nand irresponsible manner in which it was written. I will vote no this \nmorning, and I urge my colleagues to join me.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, for the better part of the last year, we have \nbeen considering what to do with projected budget surpluses should they \never materialize. Some people suggested setting aside the excess money \nto help save Social Security. Some wanted to use a portion for tax \nrelief, or paying down the national debt. I believe there was merit in \neach of those ideas.\n  It did not take long, however, for all of the good ideas to be swept \naside once the surplus actually materialized. Just three weeks after \nconfirming that the federal government achieved its first budget \nsurplus in a generation, we have a bill before the Senate that proposes \nto use a third of the surplus to increase spending on government \nprograms other than Social Security, tax relief, or repayment of the \nnational debt.\n  I am very disappointed that we find ourselves in this situation. \nPresident Clinton pledged in his State of the Union address to ``save \nevery penny of any surplus'' for Social Security, yet he was the first \nin line with a long list of programs to be funded out of the budget \nsurplus. And Congress appears willing to go along. I, for one, intend \nto vote against this raid on a surplus that should be saved for Social \nSecurity or tax relief.\n  Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Office tells my office that \nit has not yet determined the cost of the omnibus spending bill, and \nmay not be able to do so for some time. However, if you total the \nfigures included in the conference report, it appears that the cost \nwill approach $520 billion--that is, if funding for the International \nMonetary Fund and emergency agriculture money is included. I am looking \nat Division A of the bill--for mandatory and discretionary programs.\n  That compares to $447 billion for the same programs only a year ago. \nIn other words, we are being asked to approve a bill that proposes to \nincrease spending 16 percent in a single year. That does not even take \ninto account the extra spending--another $21 billion--that is to be \nfinanced out of the budget surplus.\n  That is just too much. To put things into perspective, the average \nincrease provided by the FY99 spending bills I supported earlier in the \nyear amounted to just 0.1 percent--a spending freeze, in effect. If we \nare to keep the budget balanced and preserve our options on how to use \nthe budget surplus, we need to follow a more responsible path. This \nbill, with its raid on the budget surplus, represents a dangerous \nreturn to the old ways of budget-busting, bigger government.\n  Mr. President, let me say a few things about the process that spawned \nthis bill. Eight of the regular appropriations bills are wrapped into \nthis package. A so-called emergency spending bill is attached, bringing \nthe total cost of the legislation to over a half-trillion dollars. It \nis massive. It is no way to do the people's business responsibly.\n  I recognize that our leadership had little choice but to make the \nbest of a bad situation, given President Clinton's propensity to shut \nthe government down if he does not get his way. Indeed, one of the \nPresident's representatives admitted as much to the Majority Leader a \nfew weeks ago when he said the White House would shut down the \ngovernment if it was in its political interest to do so. That is \nreprehensible.\n  Still, our leadership did manage to secure some very good things in \nthis bill--things that I would support if they could be separated out \nand considered on their own merits. Important funding for our nation's \ndefense, anti-drug efforts, and increased law enforcement in Indian \ncountry is included. There are resources for 1,000 new Border Patrol \nagents, provisions to alleviate problems in the implementation of new \nborder-security systems, funding for the National Institutes of Health, \nand programs to help victims of domestic violence.\n  However, by failing to prioritize spending, the bill simply throws \nmore money at bad programs as well as good ones. It is easy to please \neveryone by spending more and more money. Yet that is a sure \nprescription for a return to the customary budget deficits we worked so \nhard to eliminate.\n  The fact is, this bill was written by a handful of congressional \nMembers and staff and the White House behind closed doors. Most Members \nof Congress have not had a chance to review it, debate it, or offer \namendments. That means our constituents have been shut out of the \nprocess. This is a risky and dangerous precedent that I believe we will \ncome to regret.\n  Mr. President, while there are a number of good items in this bill--\nitems I support--on balance, I believe it blurs the difference between \ntwo competing philosophies of government and, as I said before, \nrepresents a dangerous return to the old ways of budget-busting, bigger \nGovernment, and less freedom.\n  I will vote no.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I rise in support of this legislation. \nThere are many good things about this bill. It is not perfect--but we \nshouldn't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. In our \nconstitutional process, the Republican majority cannot get everything \nit wants and with a very liberal White House, we are forced to \ncompromise in order to keep the Government functioning.\n  The most important thing the American people need to know is that \nthis year the Congress has balanced the budget for the first time in 30 \nyears. Next year, in 1999, we will balance it again. Because we have \nstopped the growth of the Federal Government, we finally have stopped \nspending more than we collect, and giving the bill to our children and \ngrandchildren to pay in the future.\n  Let me discuss the many positive provisions in this bill. First, we \nhave increased defense spending for an anti-ballistic missile defense. \nThis involves the very core of our national security. And I should \nnote, this is the first Congress to increase defense spending since \n1985.\n  We have included provisions to reduce the spread of obscene material \nover the Internet. Also, we have doubled the number of Customs agents \nto block child pornography coming in from overseas.\n  In an area that I have particularly been interested in, we have \nattached real reforms to the IMF funding, rather than giving funds to \nthe IMF with no strings attached as the President would have liked us \nto.\n  We have provided funding for new teachers, but maintained local \ncontrol over the hiring--and--we have prevented national Federal \ntesting of students.\n  We have included seven major proposals to fight the war on drugs. \nBill Clinton has mocked the seriousness of drug use and it has showed. \nDrug use among teens has been on the rise during the Clinton \nadministration.\n  We are funding increases in health care research, particularly cancer \nresearch and breast cancer research. We kept our commitment from last \nyear to dramatically increase spending in the fight against cancer. The \nbill also contains a requirement that requires insurance companies to \ncover breast reconstructive surgery for women afflicted with breast \ncancer.\n  On the tax side, we have extended the research and development tax \ncredit, which is important to North Carolina.\n  Further, we are changing the tax laws to permit 100% deductibility of \nhealth insurance for self employed individuals.\n  And this is another important point that is often overlooked by the \nmedia. This is the first Congress to cut taxes in 16 years. And in this \nbill, we have again reduced taxes for the self employed.\n  This is in stark contrast to the Clinton tax increase of 1993, the \nlargest in the history of the U.S.\n  For North Carolina specifically, there are a number of positive \nprovisions. We have received money for a program called LEARN North \nCarolina, which will provide important curriculum information to our \nteachers and classrooms over the Internet throughout North Carolina.\n  The Congress again provided funding for the Reading Together program \nwhich has fifth graders tutoring second graders in reading--it is a \ntruly remarkable program that has shown very positive results in \nincreasing the reading skills of elementary students.\n  The bill provides funding for the North Carolina Center for the \nPrevention of School Violence, in order to reduce violence in schools.\n\n[[Page S12776]]\n\n  We have provided money to save a national landmark, the Cape Hatteras \nLighthouse.\n  The bill will provide additional funding for the North Carolina \nCriminal Justice Information Network, which will help our state \ntroopers identify criminal suspects on the spot during traffic steps. \nIt will save the lives of our police officers.\n  In order to stop crime before it happens, we have provided funding \nfor gang resistance in troubled parts of North Carolina.\n  For transportation, we have secured $10 million for light rail in the \nTriangle. In Charlotte, we have $3 million for the planning of light \nrail in that booming area of the state.\n  For our farmers, unlike the White House proposal, we have made sure \nthat North Carolina farmers can receive aid if they are hit by low \nprices. Also, in order to keep our farmers competitive in the global \nmarketplace, we have provided millions in agriculture research for \nNorth Carolina.\n  These are just a few of the items that have been secured for our \nstate.\n  As I said, Mr. President, this is not a perfect bill.\n  We are spending too much money under the guise of ``emergency'' \nspending. Under the banner of ``emergency'' spending, we have funds for \nthe Bosnian mission, the Year 2000 compliance, farm aid and embassy \nsecurity funds. While we can't desert our troops in Bosnia now, we can \nfind other spending cuts to pay for this mission, if it continues. We \nneed funds to fix the Year 2000 problem, but we can find other cuts to \noffset this spending. And, we need funds to make our foreign missions \nmore secure. I am willing to vote for these new funds now, but I can \nvow that I will seek spending reductions in the next year to offset \nthem.\n  For this reason, I am also introducing legislation today that would \nrequire the President to submit a budget next year identifying spending \ncuts so that we can pay for the twenty billion in ``emergency'' \nspending that we have spent in this bill. We must preserve the surplus \nfor Social Security, and emergency or no emergency, we have to find \ncuts in government so that we do not fritter away the surplus.\n  In conclusion, this bill, on balance, is a bill for a better national \ndefense, better schools and better health care. For that reason, I plan \nto support it.\n\n\n           Olympic and Amateur Sports Act Amendments of 1998\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this legislation includes the Olympic and \nAmateur Sports Act Amendments of 1998, a bill that Senator Campbell \njoined me in cosponsoring to update the federal charter of the U.S. \nOlympic Committee and the frame-work for Olympic and amateur sports in \nthe United States.\n  This framework is known as the ``Amateur Sports Act,'' because most \nof its provisions were added by the Amateur Sports Act of 1978 (P.L. \n95-606). The Act gives the U.S. Olympic Committee certain trademark \nprotections to raise money--and does not provide recurring \nappropriations--so therefore does not come up for routine \nreauthorization.\n  The Amateur Sports Act has not been amended since the comprehensive \nrevision of 1978--a revision which provided the foundation for the \nmodern Olympic movement in the United States. The bill we will soon \npass does not fundamentally change the Act because our review showed us \nthat is still fundamentally sound. We believe the modest changes we \nwill make will ensure that the Act serves the United States well in the \n21st Century.\n  The significant changes which have occurred in the world of Olympic \nand amateur sports since 1978 warrant some fine-tuning of the Act. Some \nof the developments of the past 20 years include: (1) that the schedule \nfor the Olympics and Winter Olympics has been alternated so that games \nare held every two years, instead of every four--significantly \nincreasing the workload of the U.S. Olympic Committee; (2) that sports \nhave begun to allow professional athletes to compete in some Olympic \nevents; (3) that even sports still considered ``amateur'' have athletes \nwho with greater financial opportunities and professional \nresponsibilities than we ever considered in 1978; and (4) that the \nParalympics--the Olympics for disabled amateur athletes--have grown \nsignificantly in size and prestige.\n  These and other changes led me to call for a comprehensive review of \nthe Amateur Sports Act in 1994. The Commerce Committee has held three \nhearings since then. At the first and second--on August 11, 1994 and \nOctober 18, 1995--witnesses identified where the Amateur Sports Act was \nshowing signs of strain. We postponed our work until after the 1996 \nSummer Olympics in Atlanta, but on April 21, 1997, held a third hearing \nat the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs to discuss solutions \nto the problems which had been identified.\n  By January, 1998, we'd refined the proposals into possible amendments \nto the Amateur Sports Act, which we discussed at length at an informal \nworking session on January 26, 1998 in the Commerce Committee hearing \nroom. The bill that Senator Campbell and I introduced in May reflected \nthe comments received in January, and excluded proposals for which \nconsensus appeared unachievable. With the help of the U.S. Olympic \nCommittee, the Athletes Advisory Council, the National Governing \nBodies' Council, numerous disabled sports organizations, and many \nothers, we continued to fine tune the bill until it was approved by the \nCommerce Committee in July.\n  I will include a longer summary of the bill for the Record, but will \nbriefly explain its primary components: (1) the bill would change the \ntitle of the underlying law to the ``Olympic and Amateur Sports Act'' \nto reflect that more than strictly amateurs are involved now, but \nwithout lessening the amateur and grass roots focus reflected in the \ntitle of the 1978 Act; (2) the bill would add a number of measures to \nstrengthen the provisions which protect athletes' rights to compete; \n(3) it would add measures to improve the ability of the USOC to resolve \ndisputes--particularly close the Olympics, Paralympics, or Pan-American \nGames--and reduce the legal costs and administrative burdens of the \nUSOC; (4) it would add measures to fully incorporate the Paralympics \ninto the Amateur Sports Act, and update the existing provisions \naffecting disabled athletes; (5) it would improve the notification \nrequirements when an NGB has been put on probation or is being \nchallenged; (6) it would increase the reporting requirements of the \nUSOC and NGB with respect to sports opportunities for women, \nminorities, and disabled individuals; and (7) it would require the USOC \nto report back to Congress in five years with any additional changes \nthat may be needed to the Act.\n  Mr. President, I am the only Senator from President Ford's Commission \non Amateur Sports who is still serving. It has therefore been very \nhelpful to have Senator Campbell--an Olympian himself in 1964--involved \nin this process. Over my objection he has included an amendment the \npackage to name the Act after me. There are many others who deserve \nrecognition for their work to bring about the 1978 Act, and since he \nhas prevailed, I will accept this honor on their behalf. I ask \nunanimous consent that my summary of the major components of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Summary of Major Provisions of Section 142, the Olympic and Amateur \n                     Sports Act Amendments of 1998\n\n       Section 142 of the omnibus bill is based on S. 2119, the \n     Olympic and Amateur Sports Act Amendments of 1998, a bill \n     introduced by Senators Stevens and Campbell on May 22, 1998 \n     and approved by the Senate Commerce Committee in July of \n     1998. Summary of major provisions:\n       Olympic and Amateur Sports Act--The federal charter of the \n     U.S. Olympic Committee (USOC) and framework for Olympic and \n     amateur sports in the United States is commonly known as the \n     ``Amateur Sports Act'' because most of its provisions were \n     enacted as part of the Amateur Sports Act of 1978 (P.L. 95-\n     606). Section 142 would officially rename the underlying Act \n     as the ``Olympic and Amateur Sports Act.'' An amendment by \n     Senator Campbell changed section 142 to rename the underlying \n     Act as the ``Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act.''\n       Paralympics--Section 142 incorporates the Paralympics into \n     the Olympic and Amateur Sports Act, so that the Act clearly \n     reflects the equal status between able-bodied and disabled \n     athletes. It continues the original focus of the Act to \n     integrate disabled sports with able-bodied National Governing \n     Bodies (NGB's), but allows the USOC to recognize paralympic \n     sports organizations if integration does not serve the best \n     interest of a\n\n[[Page S12777]]\n\n     sport or if the NGB for the sport objects to integration. The \n     USOC is officially recognized as the national Paralympic \n     committee.\n       Athletes--The amendments require the creation of an \n     Athletes' Advisory Council and National Governing Bodies' \n     Council to advise the USOC. The amendments also require that \n     at least 20 percent of the USOC Board be comprised of active \n     athletes. The USOC already carries out these provisions but \n     is not required to do us under existing law. The amendments \n     require the USOC to hire an ombudsman for athletes nominated \n     by the Athletes' Advisory Council who will provide advice to \n     athletes about the Olympic and Amateur Sports Act, the \n     relevant constitution and bylaws of the USOC and NGBs, and \n     the rules of international sports federations and the \n     International Olympic Committee (IOC) and International \n     Paralympic Committee (IPC), and who will assist in mediating \n     certain disputes involving the opportunity of amateur \n     athletes to compete. The amendments also require the NGBs to \n     disseminate and distribute to athletes, coaches, trainers, \n     and others, all applicable rules and any changes to the rules \n     of the NGB, USOC, international sports federation, IOC, IPC, \n     and Pan-American Sports Organization. Section 142 clarifies \n     that NGBs must agree to submit to binding arbitration with \n     respect to opportunity-to-compete issues at the request of \n     the affected athlete under the Commercial Rules of the \n     American Arbitration Association, but gives USOC authority to \n     alter the Commercial Rules with the concurrence of the \n     Athletes' Advisory Council and National Governing Bodies \n     Council, or by a two-thirds vote of the USOC Board of \n     Directors;\n       USOC Administrative/Cost Saving--The amendments allow the \n     USOC to remove certain lawsuits against it to federal court. \n     The amendments require the USOC to keep an agent for service \n     of process only in the State of Colorado, rather than all 50 \n     States. Under the amendments, the USOC is required to report \n     to Congress only every four years, instead of annually. The \n     report, however, is required to include data on the \n     participation of women, disabled individuals, and minorities. \n     Section 142 protects the USOC against court injunction in \n     selecting athletes to serve on the Olympic, Paralympic, or \n     Pan-American teams within 21 days of those games if the \n     USOC's constitution and bylaws cannot provide a resolution \n     before the games are to begin.\n       National Governing Bodies--The amendments in section 142 \n     allow the USOC/NGBs not to send to the Olympics, Pan-American \n     Games, or Paralympics athletes who haven't met the \n     eligibility criteria of the USOC and appropriate NGB, even if \n     not sending those athletes will result in an incomplete team. \n     The amendments allow NGBs to establish criteria on a sport-\n     by-sport basis for the ``active athletes'' that must comprise \n     at least 20 percent of their boards of directors and other \n     governing boards. Under the amendments, the USOC, AAC, and \n     NGB Council will set guidelines, but an NGB will be able to \n     seek exceptions to the guidelines from the USOC. Section 142 \n     includes improved notification and hearing requirements by \n     the USOC when an NGB is being challenged to be replaced or \n     being put on probation.\n       Trademark--The amendment gives USOC trademark protection \n     for the Pan-American Games, Paralympics, and symbols \n     associated with each. As passed, it does not grandfather \n     entities which have previously used these words or symbols. \n     However, the USOC is directed not to pursue any actions \n     against entities which already used such words or symbols on \n     the date of the enactment of section 142 until Congress has \n     the opportunity to legislatively address this matter. Section \n     142 also includes a provision to minimize the effects of the \n     trademark protections in the Olympic and Amateur Sports Act \n     on certain businesses in Washington State.\n       Special Report--The amendments in section 142 require the \n     USOC to submit a report to Congress at the end of five years \n     on the implementation of the provisions of section 142 and \n     any additional changes the USOC believes are needed to the \n     Olympic and Amateur Sports Act.\n\n\n                       The American Fisheries Act\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, we've reached agreement to include the \nAmerican Fisheries Act in the legislation being passed today (as title \nII of division C of the bill). This Act will not only complete the \nprocess begun in 1976 to give U.S. interests a priority in the harvest \nof U.S. fishery resources, but will also significantly decapitalize the \nBering Sea pollock fishery.\n  The Bering Sea pollock fishery is the nation's largest, and its \npresent state of overcapacity is the result of mistakes in, and \nmisinterpretations of, the 1987 Commercial Fishing Industry Vessel \nAnti-Reflagging Act (the ``Anti-Reflagging Act''). In 1986, as the last \nof the foreign-flag fishing vessels in U.S. fisheries were being \nreplaced by U.S.-flag vessels, we discovered that federal law did not \nprevent U.S. flag vessels from being entirely owned by foreign \ninterests. We also discovered that federal law did not require U.S. \nfishing vessels to carry U.S. crew members, and that U.S. fishing \nvessels could essentially be built in foreign shipyards under the \nexisting regulatory definition of ``rebuild.'' The goals of the 1987 \nAnti-Reflagging Act therefore were to: (1) require the U.S.-control of \nfishing vessels that fly the U.S. flag; (2) stop the foreign \nconstruction of U.S. flag vessels under the ``rebuild'' loophole; and \n(3) require U.S.-flag fishing vessels to carry U.S. crews.\n  Of these three goals, only the U.S. crew requirement was achieved. \nThe Anti-Reflagging Act did not stop foreign interests from owning and \ncontrolling U.S. flag fishing vessels. In fact, about 30,000 of the \n33,000 existing U.S.-flag fishing vessels are not subject to any U.S. \ncontrolling interest requirement. The Anti-Reflagging Act also failed \nto stop the massive foreign shipbuilding programs between 1987 and 1990 \nthat brought almost 20 of the largest fishing vessels ever built into \nour fisheries as ``rebuilds.'' Today, half of the nation's largest \nfishery--Bering Sea pollock--continues to be harvested by foreign \ninterests on foreign-built vessels that are not subject to any U.S.-\ncontrolling interest standard.\n  On September 25, 1997, I introduced the American Fisheries Act (S. \n1221) to fix these mistakes. Senators from almost every fishing region \nof the country joined me in support of this effort, including Senator \nBreaux, Senator Hollings, Senator Gregg, Senator Wyden, and Senator \nMurkowski. As introduced, the bill had three primary objectives: (1) \nrequire the owners of all U.S.-flag fishing vessels to comply with a 75 \npercent U.S.-controlling interest standard (similar to the standard for \nother commercial U.S.-flag vessels that operate in U.S. waters); (2) \nremove from U.S. fisheries at least half of the foreign-built factory \ntrawlers that entered the fisheries through the Anti-Reflagging Act \nforeign rebuild grandfather loophole and that continued to be foreign-\nowned on September 25, 1997; and (3) prohibit the entry of any new \nfishing vessels above 165 feet, 750 tons, or with engines that produce \ngreater than 3,000 horsepower.\n  I am pleased to report that the package we are approving today \naccomplishes all three of the main objectives of S. 1221 as introduced.\n  I wish to thank Senator Gorton for his tremendous effort in this. For \nalmost a decade now, he and I have had various disagreements about the \nBering Sea pollock fishery and issues relating to the Anti-Reflagging \nAct. At the Commerce Committee hearing in March, and later, at an \nAppropriations Committee markup in July, Senator Gorton plainly \nexpressed his concerns with S. 1221. In August, however, he spent \nconsiderable time with representatives from the Bering Sea pollock \nfishery and by sheer will managed to develop a framework upon which we \ncould both agree. After he presented the framework to me, we convened \nmeetings in September that went around the clock for five days. Those \nmeetings included Bering Sea pollock fishery industry representatives, \nindustry representatives from other North Pacific fisheries, the State \nof Alaska, North Pacific Council members, the National Marine \nFisheries, the Coast Guard, the Maritime Administration, environmental \nrepresentatives, and staff for various members of Congress and the \nSenate and House committees of jurisdiction.\n  At the end of those meetings, a consensus had been achieved among \nBering Sea fishing representatives on an agreement to reduce capacity \nin the Bering Sea pollock fishery. For the next three weeks, we drafted \nthe legislation to give effect to the agreement, and spent considerable \ntime with the fishing industry from other fisheries who were concerned \nabout the possible impacts of the changes in the Bering Sea pollock \nfishery. The legislation we are passing today includes many safeguards \nfor other fisheries and the participants in those fisheries. By \ndelaying implementation of some measures until January 1, 2000, it also \nprovides the North Pacific Council and Secretary with sufficient time \nto develop safeguards for other fisheries.\n  This legislation is unprecedented in the 23 years since the enactment \nof the Magnuson-Stevens Act. With the council system, Congressional \naction of this type is not needed in the federal fisheries anymore. \nHowever, the mistakes in the Anti-Reflagging Act and the way it was \ninterpreted created unique problems in the Bering Sea pollock fishery \nthat only Congress can fix. The North Pacific Council simply does not \nhave the authority to turn back the clock\n\n[[Page S12778]]\n\nby removing fishery endorsements, to provide the funds required under \nthe Federal Credit Reform Act to allow for the $75 million loan to \nremove capacity, to strengthen the U.S.-control requirements for \nfishing vessels, to restrict federal loans on large fishing vessels, or \nto do many other things in this legislation.\n  While S.1221 as introduced was more modest in scope, I believe the \nmeasures in this agreement are fully justified as a one-time corrective \nmeasure for the negative effects of Anti-Reflagging Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the section-by-section analysis I have \nprepared be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Section-by-Section Summary\n\n\n                               Division A\n\n     Section 120.--Appropriation\n       Section 120 appropriates a total of $30 million for the \n     American Fisheries Act and other purposes. Specifically, it \n     provides: (1) $20 million for the federal contribution to the \n     reduction of capacity in the Bering Sea/Aleutian Islands \n     (BSAI) pollock fishery; (2) $750,000 for the cost under the \n     Federal Credit Reform Act of providing a $75 million loan to \n     the fishing industry for the reduction of capacity in the \n     BSAI pollock fishery; (3) $250,000 for the cost under the \n     Federal Credit Reform Act of providing loans totaling $25 \n     million to communities that participate in the western Alaska \n     community development quota program to enable those \n     communities to increase their participation in BSAI and other \n     North Pacific fisheries; (4) $1,000,000 for the cost under \n     the Federal Credit Reform Act of providing a loan of up to \n     $100 million to the BSAI crab industry if a fishing capacity \n     reduction program is implemented in that fishery under \n     section 312(b) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act; (5) $6 million to \n     the Secretary of Commerce for the costs of implementing \n     subtitle II of the American Fisheries Act; and (6) $2 million \n     to the Secretary of Transportation, primarily to the Maritime \n     Administration for the costs of implementing subtitle I.\n\n\n                          Division C--Title II\n\n                    Subtitle I--Fishery Endorsements\n\n     Section 201.--Short Title\n       This section establishes the title of the legislation as \n     the ``American Fisheries Act.'' The provisions of title II of \n     division C draw substantially from S. 1221 (also called the \n     American Fisheries Act), which was introduced on September \n     25, 1997, and cosponsored by Senators Breaux, Murkowski, \n     Hollings, Wyden, and Gregg. A hearing to review S. 1221 was \n     held by the Senate Commerce Committee on March 26, 1998, and \n     a related hearing was held by the House Resources Committee \n     on June 4, 1998.\n     Section 202.--Standard for Fishery Endorsements\n       Subsection (a) of section 202 amends section 12102(c) of \n     title 46, United States Code to require at least 75 percent \n     of the interest in entities that own U.S.-flag vessels in the \n     fishing industry (including fishing vessels, fish tender \n     vessels and floating processors) to be owned and controlled \n     by citizens of the United States. U.S.-flag vessels in the \n     fishing industry that are owned by individuals must be owned \n     by a citizen of the United States under the requirement of \n     section 12102(a)(1) of title 46, which allows only an \n     individual who is a citizen of the United States to own a \n     vessel that is eligible for documentation. Section 12102(c) \n     of title 46, as amended by subsection (a), would require \n     section 2(c) of the Shipping Act, 1916 to be applied in \n     determining whether an entity meets the 75 percent \n     requirement. Section 2(c) of the Shipping Act, 1916 states \n     the following:\n       ``Seventy-five per centum of the interest in a corporation \n     shall not be deemed to be owned by citizens of the United \n     States (a) if the title to 75 per centum of its stock is not \n     vested in such citizens free from any trust or fiduciary \n     obligation in favor of any person not a citizen of the United \n     States; or (b) if 75 per centum of the voting power in such \n     corporation is not vested in citizens of the United States; \n     or (c) if, through any contract or understanding, it is so \n     arranged that more than 25 per centum of the voting power in \n     such corporation may be exercised, directly or indirectly, in \n     behalf of any person who is not a citizen of the United \n     States; or (d) if by any other means whatsoever [emphasis \n     added] control of any interest in the corporation in excess \n     of 25 per centum is confered upon or permitted to be \n     exercised by any person who is not a citizen of the United \n     States.''\n       The application of section 2(c) is intended to ensure that \n     vessels with a fishery endorsement are truly controlled by \n     citizens of the United States. The amendments made by \n     subsection (a) make clear that the term `corporation' as used \n     in section 2(c) of the Shipping Act, 1916 means a \n     corporation, partnership, association, trust, joint venture, \n     limited liability company, limited liability partnership, or \n     any other entity for the purposes of applying section 2(c) to \n     section 12102(c) of title 46, United States Code.\n       Subsection (a) also amends section 12102(c) (by adding a \n     new paragraph (2)) to statutorily prohibit some of the types \n     of control which are impermissible under the standard. A new \n     paragraph (3) would prohibit vessels with a fishery \n     endorsement from being leased to a non-citizen of the United \n     States for use as a fishing vessel (to harvest fish) even if \n     the control requirements are satisfied. A new paragraph (4) \n     would allow a person not eligible to own a vessel with a \n     fishery endorsement to nevertheless have an interest greater \n     than 25 percent in the vessel, if the interest is secured by \n     a mortgage to a trustee who is eligible to own a vessel with \n     a fishery endorsement and who complies with specific \n     requirements in the law and other requirements prescribed by \n     the Secretary, and if the arrangement does not violate the 75 \n     percent control requirements.\n       Subsection (a) amends section 12102(c) with a new paragraph \n     (paragraph (5)) that would exempt the following vessels from \n     the 75 percent standard, provided the owners of the vessels \n     continue to comply with the fishery endorsement law in effect \n     on October 1, 1998: (1) vessels engaged in fisheries under \n     the authority of the Western Pacific Fishery Management \n     Council; and (2) purse seine vessels engaged in tuna fishing \n     in the Pacific Ocean outside the exclusive economic zone or \n     pursuant to the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Treaty. \n     Fishery endorsements issued by the Secretary for these \n     vessels would be valid only in those specific fisheries and \n     the vessels would not be eligible to receive a fishery \n     endorsement to participate in other fisheries unless the \n     owner complied with the 75 percent standard.\n       Paragraph (6) of section 12102(c), as amended by subsection \n     (a), would prevent new large fishing vessels from entering \n     U.S. fisheries, including former U.S.-flag fishing vessels \n     that have reflagged in recent years to fish in waters outside \n     the U.S. exclusive economic zone. Specifically, it would \n     prohibit the issuance of fishery endorsements to vessels \n     greater than 165 feet in registered length, of more than 750 \n     gross registered tons, or that have an engine or engines \n     capable of producing a total of more than 3,000 shaft \n     horsepower unless: (1) the vessel had a valid fishery \n     endorsement on September 25, 1997 (the day that S. 1221 \n     was introduced), is not placed under foreign registry \n     after the date of the enactment of the American Fisheries \n     Act, and, if the vessel's fishery endorsement is allowed \n     to lapse or is invalidated after the date of the enactment \n     of the American Fisheries Act, an application for a new \n     fishery endorsement is submitted to the Secretary within \n     15 business days; or (2) the owner of the vessel \n     demonstrates to the Secretary that a regional fishery \n     management council has recommended and the Secretary of \n     Commerce has approved specific measures after the date of \n     the enactment of the American Fisheries Act to allow the \n     vessel to be used in fisheries under that council's \n     authority. The regional councils have the authority and \n     are encouraged to submit for approval to the Secretary of \n     Commerce measures to prohibit vessels that receive a \n     fishery endorsement under section 12102(c)(6) from \n     receiving any permit that would allow the vessel to \n     participate in fisheries under their authority, so that a \n     vessel cannot receive a fishery endorsement through \n     measures recommended by one council, then enter the \n     fisheries under the authority of another Council.\n       Subsection (b) amends section 31322(a) of title 46, United \n     States Code, to require that a preferred mortgage with \n     respect to a vessel with a fishery endorsement have as a \n     mortgagee only: (1) a person that meets the 75 percent U.S.-\n     controlling interest requirement; (2) a state- or federally-\n     chartered financial institution that meets a majority (more \n     than 50 percent) U.S.-controlling interest requirement; or \n     (3) a person using a trustee under the authority of, and in \n     compliance with, section 12102(c)(4) of title 46, as amended \n     by this Act.\n     Section 203--Enforcement of Standard\n       Subsection (a) of section 203 specifies that amendments in \n     section 202 take effect on October 1, 2001, roughly three \n     years from the date of the expected enactment of the American \n     Fisheries Act. As introduced, S. 1221 would have required \n     compliance with the new standard 18 months after enactment. \n     The extended implementation period is intended to provide \n     additional time for the fishing industry to prepare for the \n     new requirements, as well as time for the Secretary of \n     Transportation to prepare to carry out the requirements.\n       Subsection (b) requires final regulations to implement \n     subtitle I to be published in the Federal Register by April \n     1, 2000, 18 months before the new requirements go into \n     effect, and requires that the regulations specifically \n     identify: (1) impermissible transfers of ownership or \n     control; (2) transactions that will require prior agency \n     approval; and (3) transactions that will not require prior \n     agency approval. Subsection (b) prohibits the Secretary of \n     Transportation from issuing any letter rulings before \n     publishing the final regulations. It is the intent of \n     Congress that there be a full opportunity for the public to \n     comment on the regulations implementing the new requirements \n     before any decisions are made with respect to specific \n     vessels or vessel owners. During the implementation of the \n     1987 Anti-Reflagging Act, numerous letter rulings were issued \n     by the Coast Guard prior to the publication of final \n     regulations to implement the U.S.-control requirements, which \n     limited the Coast Guard's ability to address valid concerns \n     about the regulations. The implementation process set out in \n     subsection (b) will provide an 18 month period for the \n     Secretary of Transportation to promulgate regulations and \n     fully review public\n\n[[Page S12779]]\n\n     comments, followed by an 18 month period in which the fishing \n     industry can obtain letter rulings before the new \n     requirements take effect to avoid disruptions where possible. \n     This framework allows time for the Secretary of \n     Transportation to consult with Congress if the Secretary has \n     concerns about Congressional intent or identifies any \n     technical or other amendments needed to give full effect to \n     the American Fisheries Act.\n       Subsection (c) requires the Maritime Administration \n     (MarAd), rather than the Coast Guard, to administer the new \n     U.S.-ownership and control requirements for vessels 100 feet \n     in registered length and greater. MarAd will use a more \n     thorough process than has been used in the past to ensure \n     compliance with the new requirements. The process will be \n     based on the process for federal loan guarantees and \n     subsidies. The owners of vessels 100 feet and greater will be \n     required to file an annual statement to demonstrate \n     compliance with section 12102(c), based on an existing \n     citizenship affidavit required to be filed under certain \n     MarAd regulations. Paragraph (2) of subsection (c) directs \n     MarAd to rigorously scrutinize transfers of ownership and \n     control of vessels, and identifies specific areas in which \n     MarAd should pay particular attention.\n       Subsection (d) directs the Secretary of Transportation to \n     establish the requirements for the owners of vessels less \n     than 100 feet to demonstrate compliance with the new \n     requirements, and allows the Secretary to decide whether the \n     Coast Guard or MarAd should be the implementing agency. \n     Subsection (d) further directs the Secretary to minimize the \n     administrative burden on individuals who own and operate \n     vessels that measure less than 100 feet.\n       Subsection (e) directs the Secretary of Transportation to \n     revoke the fishery endorsement of any vessel subject to \n     section 12102(c) of title 46 whose owner does not meet the \n     75-percent ownership and control requirement or otherwise \n     fails to comply with that section.\n       Subsection (f) increases the penalties for fishery \n     endorsement violations. Specifically, it would make the owner \n     of a vessel with a fishery endorsement liable for a civil \n     penalty of up to $100,000 for each day the vessel is engaged \n     in fishing if the owner has knowingly falsified or concealed \n     a material fact or knowingly made a false statement or \n     representation when applying for or renewing a fishery \n     endorsement. This increased penalty is intended to discourage \n     willful noncompliance with the new requirements.\n       Subsection (g) provides limited exemptions from the new \n     U.S.-control and ownership requirements in section 12102(c) \n     of title 46 for the owners of five vessels (the EXCELLENCE, \n     GOLDEN ALASKA, OCEAN PHOENIX, NORTHERN TRAVELER, and NORTHERN \n     VOYAGER) under certain conditions. It exempts the owners \n     after October 1, 2001 only until more than 50 percent of the \n     interest owned and controlled in the entity that owns the \n     vessel changes. The exemption applies only to the present \n     owners, and the subsection not only requires all subsequent \n     owners to comply the 75 percent standard, but requires even \n     the present owners to comply if more than 50 percent of the \n     interest owned and controlled in that owner changes after \n     October 1, 2001. The exemption also automatically terminates \n     with respect to the NORTHERN TRAVELER or NORTHERN VOYAGER if \n     the vessel is used in a fishery other than under the \n     jurisdiction of the New England or Mid-Atlantic fishery \n     management councils, and automatically terminates with \n     respect to the EXCELLENCE, GOLDEN ALASKA, or OCEAN PHOENIX if \n     the vessel is used to harvest fish.\n     Section 204--Repeal of Ownership Savings Clause\n       Section 204 would repeal the U.S.-ownership and control \n     grandfather provision of the 1987 Anti-Reflagging Act, which \n     was interpreted by the Coast Guard (and later upheld by the \n     U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, see 298 U.S. App. \n     D.C. 331) to ``run with the vessel,'' thereby exempting about \n     90 percent of the U.S.-flag fishing industry vessels in \n     existence today from any U.S.-ownership and control \n     requirements. The American Fisheries Act and provisions of \n     section 204 require that the owners of all vessels comply \n     with the new U.S.-ownership and control requirements when \n     those requirements take effect on October 1, 2001 (except as \n     provided in section 12102(c)(5) of title 46, as amended by \n     the American Fisheries Act (Hawaii exemption), and in section \n     203(g) of the American Fisheries Act (five specific \n     vessels)).\n\n\n                Subtitle II--Bering Sea Pollock Fishery\n\n     Section 205--Definitions\n       Section 205 provides definitions for the following terms \n     used in subtitle II: (1) Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands \n     Management Area; (2) catcher/processor; (3) catcher vessel; \n     (4) directed pollock fishery; (5) harvest; (6) inshore \n     component; (7) Magnuson-Stevens Act; (8) mothership; (9) \n     North Pacific Council; (10) offshore component; (11) \n     Secretary; and (12) shoreside processor.\n     Section 206--Allocations\n       Section 206 establishes new allocations in the pollock \n     fishery in the BSAI beginning in 1999. Subsection (a) \n     requires 10 percent of the total allowable catch of pollock \n     to be allocated as a directed fishing allowance to the \n     western Alaska community development quota program. \n     Subsection (b) requires an additional amount from the total \n     allowable catch to be allocated for the incidental catch of \n     pollock in other groundfish fisheries (including the portion \n     of those fisheries harvested under the western Alaska CDQ \n     program). Of the remainder, subsection (b) requires 50 \n     percent to be allocated as a directed fishing allowance for \n     catcher vessels that deliver to shoreside processors, 40 \n     percent to be allocated as a directed fishing allowance for \n     catcher/processors and catcher vessels that deliver to \n     catcher/processors, and 10 percent to be allocated as a \n     directed fishing allowance for catcher vessels that deliver \n     to motherships. Section 206 clarifies that the 10 percent of \n     pollock allocated to the western Alaska CDQ program is \n     allocated as a target species, consistent with the present \n     method of allocation and with Congressional intent with the \n     respect to the target species allocations required under \n     section 305(i) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act for the western \n     Alaska CDQ program. The section is intended to ensure the \n     continuation of the present system under which the bycatch in \n     the pollock CDQ fishery and the bycatch in the non-pollock \n     groundfish CDQ fisheries are not counted against the CDQ \n     allocations.\n     Section 207--Buyout\n       Subsection (a) directs the Secretary of Commerce, using \n     special authority added in 1996 to the title XI loan program, \n     to provide a loan of $75 million to the shoreside processors \n     and catcher vessels that deliver to the shoreside processors \n     to remove fishing capacity from the BSAI pollock fishery. \n     Subsection (b) sets out the terms for the repayment of the \n     loan, requiring the shoreside processors and catcher vessels \n     that deliver to those processors to pay on an equal basis \n     six-tenths (0.6) of one cent per pound of pollock beginning \n     in the year 2000 and continuing until the loan is fully \n     repaid (probably for around 25 years). Subsection (c) \n     authorizes appropriations of an additional $20 million for \n     the removal of fishing capacity from the BSAI pollock \n     fishery, for a total of $95 million.\n       Subsection (d) establishes the payment formula for the \n     removal of fishing capacity. Paragraph (1) of subsection (d) \n     requires $90 million to be paid by the Secretary to the \n     owners of the nine catcher/processors (also called factory \n     trawlers) listed in section 209, subject to the conditions \n     that one of the vessels (the AMERICAN EMPRESS) not be used \n     outside of the U.S. exclusive economic zone (EEZ) to harvest \n     stocks that occur within the U.S. EEZ, and that eight of the \n     vessels be scrapped by December 31, 2000. Paragraph (2) of \n     subsection (d) requires the payment of $5 million to either \n     the owners of certain catcher/processors listed in section \n     208(e), or to owners of catcher vessels eligible under \n     section 208(b) and the 20 catcher/processors eligible under \n     section 208(e), depending on whether or not a contract to \n     implement a fishery cooperative has been filed by December \n     31, 1998. These payments totaling $95 million are for the \n     removal of fishing capacity only, and are in no way intended \n     as compensation for any allocation adjustments, nor should \n     they be construed to create any right of compensation for any \n     allocation adjustments or any right, title, or interest in or \n     to any fish in any fishery. Subsection (d) authorizes the \n     Secretary of Commerce to reduce the payments by any amount \n     owed to the federal government which has not been satisfied \n     by the owners of the vessels.\n       Subsection (e) allows the Secretary to suspend any or all \n     of the federal fishing permits held by the owners who receive \n     payments under subsection (d) if the vessel identified in \n     paragraph (1) of section 209 is used outside of the U.S. \n     exclusive economic zone (EEZ) to harvest stocks that occur \n     within the U.S. EEZ, or if the other eight catcher/processors \n     identified in section 209 are not scrapped by December 31, \n     2000.\n       Subsection (f) allows the repayment period for the $75 \n     million loan to the shoreside processors and catcher vessels \n     that deliver to the shoreside processors to be paid back over \n     as many as 30 years. The general authority for fishing \n     capacity reduction loans under the title XI program allows a \n     repayment period of only up to 20 years.\n       Subsection (g) directs the Secretary of Commerce to publish \n     proposed regulations to implement the fishing capacity \n     reduction program under title XI and under the Magnuson-\n     Stevens Act by October 15, 1998. This program was enacted on \n     October 11, 1996 as part of the Sustainable Fisheries Act \n     (P.L. 104-297), yet the proposed regulations to implement the \n     program have not yet been published for review. Subsection \n     (g) is intended to bring about the expeditious publication of \n     the proposed regulations.\n     Section 208--Eligible Vessels and Processors\n       Subsection (a) of section 208 establishes the criteria for \n     the catcher vessels that, beginning on January 1, 2000, will \n     be eligible to harvest the pollock allocated under section \n     206(b)(1) for processing by the inshore component. To be \n     eligible a vessel must: (1) have delivered at least 250 \n     metric tons of pollock in the BSAI directed pollock fishery \n     (or at least 40 metric tons if the vessel is less than 60 \n     feet in length overall) to the inshore component in one of \n     1996 or 1997, or before September 1, 1998; (2) be eligible \n     for a license under the license limitation program; and (3) \n     not be eligible under subsection (b) to deliver pollock to \n     catcher/processors. Any vessel which cannot meet these \n     criteria will be ineligible as of January 1, 2000 to harvest \n     the pollock allocated for processing by the inshore \n     component.\n       Subsection (b) lists the particular catcher vessels and \n     establishes criteria for other\n\n[[Page S12780]]\n\n     catcher vessels that, beginning on January 1, 1999, will be \n     eligible to harvest pollock allocated under section 206(b)(2) \n     for processing by catcher/processors. In addition to the \n     seven listed vessels, any catcher vessel which (1) delivered \n     at least 250 metric tons and at least 75 percent of the \n     pollock it harvested in the BSAI directed pollock fishery to \n     catcher processors in 1997, and (2) is eligible for a license \n     under the license limitation program, will also be eligible \n     as of January 1, 1999 to harvest pollock allocated for \n     processing by catcher/processors. Any vessel which is not \n     listed or cannot meet these criteria will be ineligible as of \n     January 1, 1999 to harvest the pollock allocated for \n     processing by catcher/processors.\n       Subsection (c) lists the particular catcher vessels and \n     establishes criteria for other catcher vessels that, \n     beginning on January 1, 2000, will be eligible to harvest \n     pollock allocated under section 206(b)(3) for processing by \n     motherships. In addition to the twenty listed vessels, any \n     catcher vessel which (1) delivered at least 250 metric tons \n     of pollock from the BSAI directed pollock fishery to \n     motherships in one of 1996 or 1997, or before September 1, \n     1998, (2) is eligible for a license under the license \n     limitation program, and (3) is not eligible under subsection \n     (b) to deliver pollock to catcher/processors, will also be \n     eligible as of January 1, 2000 to harvest pollock allocated \n     for processing by motherships. Any vessel which is not listed \n     or cannot meet these criteria will be ineligible as of \n     January 1, 2000 to harvest the pollock allocated for \n     processing by motherships.\n       Subsection (d) lists the three motherships that will be \n     eligible beginning on January 1, 2000 to process the pollock \n     allocated under section 206(b)(3). Any vessel which is not \n     listed will be ineligible as of January 1, 2000 to process \n     the pollock allocated for processing by motherships in the \n     BSAI directed pollock fishery.\n       Subsection (e) lists the particular catcher/processors \n     that, beginning on January 1, 2000, will be eligible to \n     harvest pollock allocated under section 206(b)(2) for \n     processing by catcher/processors. In addition to the twenty \n     vessels listed, under paragraph (21) of subsection (e), any \n     catcher/processor which harvested more than 2,000 metric tons \n     of pollock in the BSAI directed pollock fishery in 1997, and \n     is eligible for a license under the license limitation \n     program, will be eligible to harvest a small portion of the \n     pollock allocated under section 206(b)(2). The vessel or \n     vessels eligible under paragraph (21) are prohibited from \n     harvesting more than one-half percent in the aggregate of the \n     pollock allocated under subsection 206(b)(2). This provision \n     is intended to allow a small number of catcher/processors \n     (perhaps as few as one) to continue to harvest the relatively \n     small amount of pollock they harvested in the past while \n     relying primarily on other fisheries. The last sentence of \n     subsection (e) would allow the catcher/processors listed in \n     paragraphs (1) through (20) to continue to be eligible for a \n     fishery endorsement even if it is ultimately determined that \n     the vessel did not satisfy the foreign rebuild grandfather \n     provisions of the 1987 Anti-Reflagging Act--provided that the \n     owner of the vessel complies with all other requirements for \n     a fishery endorsement. The removal of nine catcher/processors \n     in section 209 is intended to address the overcapacity \n     concerns that resulted from the entry under the Anti-\n     Reflagging Act of foreign built vessels contrary to \n     Congressional intent.\n       Subsection (f) establishes the criteria for shoreside \n     processors to which the catcher vessels eligible under \n     section 208(a) may deliver pollock from the BSAI directed \n     pollock fishery beginning on January 1, 2000. To be eligible, \n     a shoreside processor (which may include moored vessels) must \n     have processed more than 2,000 metric tons of pollock in the \n     inshore component of the BSAI directed pollock fishery during \n     each of 1996 and 1997. Any shoreside processor that processed \n     pollock in the inshore component in 1996 or 1997, but \n     processed less than 2,000 metric tons, would be allowed under \n     paragraph (1)(B) to continue processing up to 2,000 metric \n     tons per year after January 1, 2000. Paragraph (2) of \n     subsection (f) would allow the North Pacific Council to \n     recommend (and the Secretary to approve) the entry of \n     additional shoreside processors to process the allocation \n     under section 206(b)(1) if the total allowable catch for \n     pollock increases by more than 10 percent above the 1997 \n     total allowable catch, or if any of the shoreside processors \n     eligible to process more than 2,000 metric tons is lost.\n       Subsection (g) establishes requirements for the replacement \n     of any of the vessels eligible to harvest pollock under \n     section 208 if the vessel is lost by an event other than the \n     willful misconduct of the owner or agent of the owner.\n       Subsection (h) allows vessels and shoreside processors for \n     which an application for eligibility under section 208 has \n     been filed to be allowed to participate in the BSAI directed \n     pollock fishery until the Secretary of Commerce can make a \n     final determination about the eligible of the vessel or \n     shoreside processor. This subsection is intended to minimize \n     disruptions in the event the Secretary is unable to complete \n     determinations for all vessels and processors prior to the \n     effective dates of the eligible criteria.\n       Subsection (i) clarifies that eligibility under section 208 \n     does not confer any right of compensation if the eligibility \n     is subsequently revoked or limited, does not create any right \n     to any fish in any fishery, and does not waive any provision \n     of law otherwise applicable to an eligible vessel or \n     shoreside processor. Section 208 simply prevents the \n     participation of vessels and shoreside processors not listed \n     or that do not meet the eligibility criteria, and ineligible \n     vessels and shoreside processors similarly have no right of \n     compensation or right to any fish of any kind.\n     Section 209--List of Ineligible Vessels\n       Section 209 identifies nine catcher/processors that, \n     effective December 31, 1998, are permanently ineligible for \n     fishery endorsements. Section 209 also extinguishes all \n     claims associated with the vessels that could qualify the \n     owners of the vessels for any limited access system \n     permit.\n     Section 210--Fishery Cooperative Limitations\n       Subsection (a) of section 210 requires all contracts \n     implementing a fishery cooperative in the BSAI directed \n     pollock fishery and all material modifications to those \n     contracts to be filed with the North Pacific Council and \n     Secretary of Commerce, and requires information about the \n     contracts to be made available to the public. With the \n     limitations in section 208 on further entry into the BSAI \n     directed pollock fishery, the American Fisheries Act \n     increases the likelihood that fishery cooperatives will be \n     formed under the 1934 Act (15 U.S.C. 521 et seq.) that allows \n     fishermen to ``act together . . . in collectively catching, \n     producing, preparing for market, processing, handling, and \n     marketing'' fish and fish products without being subject to \n     federal anti-trust laws. The 1934 Act does not require the \n     public disclosure of the details from contracts implementing \n     fishery cooperatives, nor does it include many of the other \n     restrictions and limitations in section 210 that would apply \n     to fishery cooperatives in the BSAI directed pollock fishery. \n     Subsection (a) will require at a minimum the public \n     disclosure of the parties to the contract, the vessels \n     involved, the amount of fish each vessel is expected to \n     harvest, and, after the fishing season, the amount of fish \n     (including bycatch) each vessel actually harvested. In \n     addition, the North Pacific Council and Secretary may require \n     other information that they deem appropriate from \n     participants in a fishery cooperative for public disclosure.\n       Subsection (b) allows the catcher vessels that deliver \n     pollock to shoreside processors to form fishery cooperatives \n     with fewer than the whole class of vessels eligible under \n     section 208(a) so that they will be able to compete in the \n     event that fishery cooperatives are formed in the other BSAI \n     directed pollock fishery sectors which have fewer vessels. \n     Paragraph (1) requires the Secretary to establish a separate \n     allocation within the allocation under section 206(b)(1) if \n     at least 80 percent of the catcher vessels that delivered \n     most of their pollock in the previous year to a shoreside \n     processor decide to form a fishery cooperative to deliver \n     pollock to that shoreside processor and that processor has \n     agreed to process the pollock. The allocation for those \n     vessels would be equal to the average percentage those \n     vessels caught in the aggregate in 1995, 1996, and 1997. If a \n     fishery cooperative is formed, other catcher vessels that \n     delivered most of the their catch to that shoreside processor \n     would be required to be allowed to join the fishery \n     cooperative under the same terms and conditions as other \n     participants at any time before the calendar year in which \n     fishing under the cooperative will begin. Vessels which \n     participate in a fishery cooperative will not be allowed to \n     harvest any of the pollock that remains in the ``open \n     access'' portion of the allocation under section 206(b)(1). \n     The ``open access'' portion will be equal to the average \n     percentage that the vessels which do not elect to participate \n     in fishery cooperatives caught in the aggregate in 1995, \n     1996, and 1997. The vessels eligible to harvest pollock \n     allocated for processing by shoreside processors would \n     continue to have the authority to form a fishery cooperative \n     on a class-wide basis as well.\n       Subsection (c) requires at least 8.5 percent of the pollock \n     allocated under section 206(b)(2) for processing by catcher/\n     processors to be available for harvesting by the catcher \n     vessels eligible under section 208(b). This requirement will \n     help ensure that the traditional harvest of those catcher \n     vessels will not be reduced. The catcher vessels may \n     participate in a fishery cooperative with the 20 catcher/\n     processors eligible under section 208(e), but may participate \n     during 1999 only if the contract implementing the fishery \n     cooperative includes penalties to prevent the catcher vessels \n     from exceeding their traditional harvest levels in other \n     fisheries. Under a fishery cooperative, vessel owners have \n     more control over the time during which they will fish, and \n     without these provisions in 1999, the catcher vessels could \n     target other fisheries during the time they would \n     traditionally be participating in the BSAI directed pollock \n     fishery. By the year 2000, the North Pacific Council will \n     have been able to recommend (and the Secretary to approve) \n     any measures needed to protect other fisheries.\n       Subsection (d) extends the 1934 fishery cooperative \n     authority to motherships for purposes of processing pollock \n     if 80 percent of the catcher vessels eligible to harvest the \n     pollock allocated for processing by motherships decide to \n     form a fishery cooperative. The possible extension of this \n     authority would not begin until January 1, 2000, and would \n     remain in effect only for the duration of the contract \n     implementing the fishery cooperative. If a fishery \n     cooperative is formed, other catcher vessels eligible to \n     harvest the pollock allocated for processing by\n\n[[Page S12781]]\n\n     motherships would be required to be allowed to join the \n     fishery cooperative under the same terms and conditions as \n     other participants at any time before the calendar year in \n     which fishing under the cooperative will begin.\n       Subsection (e) prohibits any individual or any single \n     entity from harvesting more than 17.5 percent of the pollock \n     in the BSAI directed pollock fishery to ensure competion. \n     Presently in that fishery, a single entity in that fishery \n     harvests close to 30 percent of the pollock in the BSAI \n     directed pollock fishery. In addition, paragraph (2) of \n     subsection (e) directs the North Pacific Council to establish \n     an excessive share cap for the processing of pollock in the \n     BSAI directed pollock fishery. Paragraph (3) requires any \n     individual or entity believed by the North Pacific Council or \n     Secretary to have exceeded the harvesting or processing caps \n     to submit information to MarAd, and requires MarAd make a \n     determination as soon as possible. If an individual or entity \n     owns 10 percent or more of another entity, they will be \n     considered to be the same entity as that other entity for the \n     purposes of the harvesting and processing caps.\n       Subsection (f) requires contracts that implement fishery \n     cooperatives in the BSAI directed pollock fishery to include \n     clauses under which the participants will pay landing taxes \n     established under Alaska law for pollock that is not landed \n     in the State of Alaska. The failure to include the clause or \n     to pay the landing taxes results in the permanent revocation \n     of the authority to form fishery cooperatives under the 1934 \n     Act for the parties to the contract implement the fishery \n     cooperative and the vessels involved in the fishery \n     cooperative.\n       Subsection (g) specifies that the violation of any of the \n     provisions of section 210 (fishery cooperative limitations) \n     or section 211 (protections for other fisheries and \n     conservation measures) constitutes a violation of the \n     prohibited acts section of the Magnuson-Stevens Act and is \n     subject to the civil penalties and permit sanctions under \n     section 308 of the Magnuson-Stevens Act. In addition, \n     subsection (g) specifies that any person found to have \n     violated either of section 210 or 211 is subject to the \n     forfeiture of any fish harvested or processed during the \n     commission of the violation.\n     Section 211--Protections for Other Fisheries; Conservation \n         Measures\n       Subsection (a) of section 211 directs the North Pacific \n     Council to submit measures for the consideration and approval \n     of the Secretary of Commerce to protect other fisheries under \n     its authority and the participants in those fisheries from \n     adverse impacts caused by the subtitle II of the American \n     Fisheries Act or by fishery cooperatives in the BSAI directed \n     pollock fishery. The Congress intends for the North Pacific \n     Council to consider particularly any potential adverse \n     effects on fishermen in other fisheries resulting from \n     increased competition in those fisheries from vessels \n     eligible to fish in the BSAI directed pollock fishery or in \n     fisheries resulting from any decreased competition among \n     processors.\n       Subsection (b) includes specific measures to restrict the \n     participation in other fisheries of the catcher/processors \n     eligible to participate in the BSAI directed pollock fishery \n     (other than the vessel or vessels eligible under paragraph \n     (21) of section 208(e)). While these types of limitations are \n     appropriately for the North Pacific Council to develop, the \n     catcher/processors eligible under section 208(e) may form a \n     fishery cooperative for 1999 before the North Pacific Council \n     can recommend (and the Secretary approve) necessary \n     limitations. The restrictions in subsection (b) would \n     therefore take effect on January 1, 1999 and remain in effect \n     thereafter unless the North Pacific Council recommends and \n     the Secretary approves measures that supercede the \n     restrictions. Subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (2) \n     prohibit the catcher/processors eligible to participate in \n     the BSAI directed pollock fishery from exceeding the \n     aggregate amounts of targeted species and bycatch in other \n     fisheries that catcher/processors from the BSAI directed \n     pollock fishery caught on average in 1995, 1996, and 1997. \n     Subparagraph (C) prohibits those catcher/processors from \n     fishing for Atka mackerel in the eastern area of the BSAI or \n     from exceeding specific percentages in the central area or \n     western area. The limitations in subparagraphs (A), (B), and \n     (C) do not ensure that the BSAI pollock-eligible catcher/\n     processors will be able to harvest any amount of fish, they \n     simply establish additional caps after which those catcher/\n     processors, as a class, will be prohibited from further \n     fishing.\n       Paragraph (3) of section 211(b) prohibits the catcher/\n     processors eligible to participate in the BSAI directed \n     pollock fishery from processing any of the pollock allocated \n     for processing by motherships or shoreside processors in the \n     BSAI directed pollock fishery and from processing any species \n     of crab harvested in the BSAI. Paragraph (4) prohibits the \n     BSAI pollock-eligible catcher/processors from harvesting any \n     fish in the Gulf of Alaska, from processing any groundfish \n     harvested in area 630 of the Gulf of Alaska, from processing \n     any pollock in the Gulf of Alaska other than as bycatch, and \n     from processing in the aggregate a total of more than 10 \n     percent of the cod harvested in areas 610, 620, and 640 of \n     the Gulf of Alaska. Paragraph (5) prohibits BSAI-eligible \n     catcher/processors and motherships from harvesting or \n     processing fish in any fishery under the authority of another \n     regional fishery management council unless the council \n     authorizes their participation, with the exception of the \n     Pacific whiting fishery under the Pacific Council's \n     authority, where the catcher/processors and motherships are \n     already participating.\n       Paragraph (6) of section 211(b) requires the BSAI pollock \n     eligible catcher/processors to carry two observers on board \n     and to install scales on board and weigh all fish harvested \n     by the vessel while participating in pollock and other \n     groundfish fisheries under the North Pacific Council's \n     authority. The requirements of paragraph (6) take effect in \n     1999 for catcher/processors that will harvest pollock \n     allocated to the western Alaska community development quota \n     program, and in 2000 for the other BSAI pollock-eligible \n     catcher/processors.\n       Subsection (c) of section 211 requires the North Pacific \n     Council to submit measures by July 1, 1999 to prevent the \n     expanded participation of BSAI pollock-eligible catcher \n     vessels in other fisheries as a result of BSAI pollock \n     fishery cooperatives and to protect processors in other \n     fisheries from any adverse effects caused by subtitle II of \n     the American Fisheries or by BSAI pollock fishery \n     cooperatives. Paragraph (1) of subsection (c) allows the \n     Secretary to restrict or change the BSAI pollock fishery \n     cooperative authority for catcher vessels delivering to \n     shoreside processors (including by allowing those vessels to \n     deliver to shoreside processors other than those which are \n     BSAI pollock-eligible) if the North Pacific Council does not \n     recommend measures by July 1, 1999 or if the Secretary \n     determines that those measures are not adequate.\n       Paragraph (2)(A) prohibits the BSAI pollock-eligible \n     motherships and shoreside processors from processing in the \n     aggregate more crab in fisheries under the North Pacific \n     Council's authority than the percentage of crab those \n     motherships and shoreside processed in the fishery in the \n     aggregate and on average in 1995, 1996, and 1997. The intent \n     of paragraph (2) is to protect processors that are not BSAI \n     pollock-eligible from increased competition from the \n     shoreside processors who may have a financial advantage as a \n     result of the increased pollock allocation under the American \n     Fisheries Act or by receiving pollock under a fishery \n     cooperative. Paragraph (2)(B) directs the North Pacific \n     Council to establish excessive share harvesting and \n     processing caps in the BSAI crab and non-pollock groundfish \n     fisheries for similar purposes.\n       Paragraph (3) of subsection (c) directs the Pacific Council \n     to submit any measures that may be necessary to protect \n     fisheries under its authority by July 1, 2000 and allows the \n     Secretary of Commerce to implement measures if the Pacific \n     Council does not submit measures or if the measures submitted \n     are determined by the Secretary to be inadequate.\n       Subsection (d) give the North Pacific Council the authority \n     with approval of the Secretary to publically disclose \n     information on a vessel-by-vessel basis from any of the \n     groundfish fisheries under the Council's authority that may \n     be useful in carrying out the requirements of the Magnuson-\n     Stevens Act which require the avoidance of bycatch. The North \n     Pacific Council is directed to use this new authority to the \n     maximum extent necessary to fully implement the bycatch \n     measures added to the Magnuson-Stevens Act by the 1996 \n     Sustainable Fisheries Act.\n       Subsection (e) creates a special federal loan program \n     within the existing title XI loan program to allow \n     communities eligible to participate in the western Alaska \n     community development quota program to increase their \n     participation in the Bering Sea pollock fishery by purchasing \n     all or part of an ownership interest in vessels and shoreside \n     processors.\n     Section 212--Restriction on Federal Loans\n       Section 212 amends the title XI loan program to prohibit \n     federal loans for the construction or rebuilding of vessels \n     that will be used to harvest fish and that are greater than \n     165 feet, of more than 750 tons, or that have an engine or \n     engines capable of producing a total of more than 3,000 shaft \n     horsepower. The prohibition does not apply to vessels to be \n     used only in the menhaden fishery or a tuna purse seine \n     fishery outside the U.S. EEZ or in the area of the South \n     Pacific Regional Fisheries Treaty.\n     Section 213--Duration\n       Subsection (a) of section 213 explains that the provisions \n     of the American Fisheries Act take effect upon its enactment, \n     except where other effective dates are specified. The \n     allocations in section 206, BSAI pollock eligibility \n     criteria/lists of vessels in section 208, and fishery \n     cooperative limitations in section 210 remain in effect only \n     until December 31, 2004, and are repealed on that date except \n     to the extent the North Pacific Council has recommended, and \n     the Secretary has approved measures to give effect to those \n     sections thereafter.\n       Subsection (b) clarifies that except as specifically \n     provided, none of the provisions in subtitle II of the \n     American Fisheries Act limit the authority of the North \n     Pacific Council or the Secretary of Commerce under the \n     Magnuson-Stevens Act. Subsection (c) sets out specific \n     circumstances under which the North Pacific Council may \n     submit measures to supersede provisions of subtitle II. The \n     Council may submit measures to supersede any of the \n     provisions of subtitle II, with the exception of the \n     provisions of section 206 (BSAI pollock allocations) and \n     section 208 (eligibility criteria/vessels), for conservation\n\n[[Page S12782]]\n\n     purposes, to mitigate adverse effects in other fisheries or \n     in the BSAI pollock fishery, or to mitigate adverse effects \n     on the participants in the BSAI directed pollock fishery that \n     only own only one or two vessels. If the Council does submit \n     such measures, the measures must take into account all \n     factors affecting the fisheries and be imposed fairly and \n     equitably to the extent practicable among and within the \n     sectors in the BSAI directed pollock fishery. With respect to \n     the allocations in section 206, the Council may submit \n     measures to increase the allocation to the western Alaska \n     community development quota program for the year 2002 and \n     thereafter if the Council determines that the program has \n     been adversely affected by any provision of subtitle II of \n     the American Fisheries Act. To the extent of its authority \n     under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the Council has general \n     authority to submit measures that affect or supersede the \n     fishery cooperative limitations in section 210. Paragraph (3) \n     of section 213(c) identifies the specific authority of the \n     Council to submit different catch-year criteria for the \n     calculation of the allocations for catcher vessels that \n     deliver to shoreside processors and that form fishery \n     cooperatives.\n       Subsection (d) requires the North Pacific Council to report \n     to the Secretary of Commerce and to the Congress by October \n     1, 2000 on the implementation and effects of subtitle II of \n     the American Fisheries Act.\n       Subsection (e) requires the General Accounting Office to \n     submit a report to the North Pacific Council and the \n     Secretary of Commerce by June 1, 2000 on whether subtitle II \n     of the American Fisheries Act has negatively affected the \n     market for fillet or fillet blocks, and requires the North \n     Pacific Council to submit for Secretarial approval any \n     measures it determines appropriate to mitigate any negative \n     effects that have occurred.\n       Section (f) specifies that if any of the provisions of the \n     American Fisheries Act are held to be unconstitutional, the \n     remainder of the Act shall not be affected.\n       Section (g) specifies that in the event the new U.S. \n     ownership and control requirements or preferred mortgage \n     requirements of subtitle I of the American Fisheries Act are \n     deemed to be inconsistent with an existing international \n     agreement relating to foreign investment with respect to a \n     specific owner or mortgagee on October 1, 2001 of a vessel \n     with a fishery endorsement, that the provision shall not \n     apply to that specific owner or mortgagee with respect to \n     that particular vessel to the extent of the inconsistency. \n     Section (g) does not exempt any subsequent owner or mortgagee \n     of the vessel, and is therefore not an exemption that ``runs \n     with the vessel.'' In addition, the exemption in section (g) \n     ceases to apply even to the owner on October 1, 2001 of the \n     vessel if any ownership interest in that owner is acquired by \n     a foreign individual or entity after October 1, 2001.\n       Customary international law and the United Nations \n     Conference on the Law of the Sea (article 62) clearly protect \n     the right of a coastal nation to harvest the living resources \n     of its exclusive economic zone. Many of the bilateral \n     treaties to which the United States is a party that might \n     otherwise involve U.S. fisheries or investments in U.S. \n     fisheries include specific exemptions for fishing vessels and \n     for measures to protect the fishery resources. For example, \n     the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Consular Rights \n     between the United States and the Kingdom of Norway (1932) \n     provides that ``[n]othing in this Treaty shall be construed \n     to restrict the right of either [the United States or Norway] \n     to impose, on such terms as it may see fit, prohibitions or \n     restrictions designed to protect human, animal, or plant \n     health or life'' (emphasis added). The Treaty and Protocol \n     between the United States and Japan Regarding Friendship, \n     Commerce, and Navigation (1953) provides that \n     ``Notwithstanding any other provision of the present Treaty, \n     each Party may reserve exclusive rights and privileges to its \n     own vessels with respect to the coasting trade, national \n     fisheries, and inland navigation'' (Article XIX(6); emphasis \n     added). Similarly, the Agreement between the United States \n     and the Republic of Korea Regarding Friendship, Commerce, and \n     Navigation (1957) provides that ``each Party may reserve \n     exclusive rights and privileges to its own vessels with \n     respect to the coasting trade, inland navigation, and \n     national fisheries'' (Article XIX(3); emphasis added).\n       While Congress does not believe that any of the \n     requirements of the American Fisheries Act violate any \n     international agreements relating to foreign investment to \n     which the United States is a party, subsection (g) is \n     included as a precaution. If the citizenship or preferred \n     mortgage requirements in subtitle I are deemed to be \n     inconsistent with such an international agreement, only the \n     current owner on October 1, 2001 to which the international \n     agreement applies will be grandfathered, and to the extent \n     that any interest in that owner/entity is sold, the interest \n     must be sold to citizens of the United States until the \n     owner/entity comes into compliance with the 75 standard.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the legislation that is pending provides \nfunding for nearly all domestic discretionary programs for the upcoming \nyear. As we know, it combines 8 of the 13 regular spending bills, as \nwell as a large number of other unrelated legislative provisions.\n  It truly is a legislative behemoth, and is one which I have very \nmixed feelings about. One part I don't have any mixed feelings about is \nthe process, particularly for the unrelated nonappropriation measures. \nIt is the worst that I have witnessed in my years in Congress. Here we \nhave a 40-pound, nearly 4,000-page bill which not only includes over \nhalf of the year's appropriations bills, but countless other unrelated \nmeasures, many of which were never debated and never brought to the \nfloor of the Senate. Then we are given less than a day--just a matter \nof hours--to look it over.\n  That certainly is not any way to do the people's business. In fact, I \nsay that the Republican leadership in the Senate and the House has \nshown a tremendous disrespect for the taxpayers' dollars.\n  This is really a cavalier treatment of taxpayers dollars when you \nthink about the way this bill was put together. Nobody knows how much \nis in there. Billions of dollars are being spent, and a lot of it was \nnever debated or shown the light of day in either the House or the \nSenate. The taxpayers deserve a little bit better treatment for their \ntax dollars than that.\n  Before I get into my other concerns, I want to speak about what I see \nas one of the true bright spots, which will lead me to vote in favor of \nthe overall measure, even with all my misgivings about it, and that is \nthe progress it makes toward improving the quality and affordability of \neducation, health care and job training for American families.\n  As the ranking member on the Appropriations Subcommittee on the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services and Education, I want to focus \nmy comments initially on that section of the bill.\n  First, I want to thank Senator Specter for his outstanding leadership \non the legislation. He has worked tirelessly to put together a strong, \nbipartisan bill. I want to publicly thank Bettilou Taylor, Jim \nSourwine, Jack Chow, Mary Deitrich, Mark Laisch and Jennifer Stiefel. I \nalso thank those on my staff, on the minority side--Marsha Simon and \nEllen Murray--for their long and hard work in taking care of all of the \nimportant details of the legislation. They literally have been here \naround the clock for the last several weeks putting the bill and report \ntogether.\n  I also extend my sincere appreciation to our colleagues in the \nHouse--Chairman Porter and ranking member Obey. There were many \nsignificant differences between our two bills and it required much work \nto bridge the gulf. I appreciate their willingness to work with us to \ncraft a strong Labor-HHS-Education bill to send to the President.\n  The Labor-HHS-Education component of this bill is notable in a number \nof areas. It makes many vital investments in the human infrastructure \nof our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased that the bill before us provides the \nbiggest funding increase in history in our search for medical \nbreakthroughs. Almost every day, the paper has a new story about one \nadvance or another in medical research. New therapies, more effective \nintervention and treatment strategies--we are making great progress. We \naren't suffering from a shortfall of ideas, but a shortfall of \nresources.\n  At the present time, the National Institutes of Health is able to \nfund only one-fourth of their peer-reviewed grant proposals. As a \nresult, too many worthy projects never get off the ground. The tragedy \nis that the 3 of 4 unfunded grants could have led to a cure for breast \ncancer, or a more effective treatment for Parkinson's disease, or a way \nto reverse spinal chord injury.\n  This must change, and the pending legislation provides a generous 15 \npercent increase for the NIH and is the first step toward doubling the \nbudget for biomedical research.\n  Another important victory for improved health is the inclusion of a \nproposal I authored to substantially improve research on complementary \nand alternative medicine. Consumers need and deserve reliable \ninformation about these promising therapies. And, if appropriately \nimplemented, the new National Center for Complementary and Alternative \nMedicine at NIH will provide just that.\n  Mr. President, one of the great disappointments of the 105th Congress \nwas the defeat by the Republican leadership of comprehensive \nlegislation to protect\n\n[[Page S12783]]\n\nchildren from tobacco. Their action is costly: Every day, more than \n3,000 young people will start smoking, and one-third will die \nprematurely from tobacco-related diseases.\n  I am pleased, however, that the bill before us makes at least a very \nmodest downpayment on fighting tobacco. It provides $46 million to fund \nantitobacco activities--the largest increase for preventing and \ntreating the addiction, disease, and death caused by tobacco use. The \nCDC will receive additional funding to help communities keep tobacco \nproducts out of the hands of children, help smokers kick the habit, and \ncombat the tobacco industry's daily multimillion dollar misinformation \ncampaigns.\n  I want to be clear, however, that this is by no means a replacement \nfor comprehensive reform. We should make reform of the tobacco scourge \na major agenda item for the next Congress.\n  Another important drug problem--and tobacco is a drug problem--facing \nus in this Nation is the scourge of methamphetamine. It is ravaging my \nState and other States in the Midwest. So I am pleased that the bill \nbefore us includes my proposal to expand support for prevention and \ntreatment of meth addiction. It also contains a significant increase to \nboost our law enforcement efforts to combat this problem. But I am \nextremely disappointed that the leadership blocked inclusion of my \nComprehensive Methamphetamine Control Act. Their action, I think, is \nextremely shortsighted and is a defeat for our efforts to get tougher \non methamphetamine.\n  The bill before us includes the important initiative to combat fraud, \nwaste and abuse in Medicare. It would expand nationwide a program I \nstarted 2 years ago to train retired nurses, doctors, accountants, \ninsurance writers, and other professionals to be expert resources in \ntheir local communities to help fellow seniors identify and report \nsuspect cases of abuse. The Senior Waste Patrol, as it is known, has \nbeen a great success in Iowa and the 11 other States in which it now \nexists on a pilot program basis. This bill, as I said, will extend the \nSenior Waste Patrol to every State in the Nation. I believe it will be \none of the keys that we will have in really cutting down on the waste, \nfraud and abuse that is so rampant in Medicare.\n  Mr. President, for the last several years, I have worked to eradicate \nabusive child labor around the world, and I am pleased that the \nlegislation provides resources to help end this exploitative practice \nhere at home and around the world.\n  The bill signals a strong commitment by the United States to ending \nthis unconscionable practice of child labor by providing a $27 million \nincrease, from $3 million to $30 million, to the International \nProgramme for the Elimination of Child Labor, otherwise known as IPEC. \nIn the past, IPEC initiatives have been instrumental in reaching \nagreements in Bangladesh for child garment workers, and in Pakistan for \nthe children making soccer balls. As a result, thousands of these \nchildren in both countries have been moved from factories to schools. \nThis increase for IPEC will ensure that we can do in those countries \nand in other countries to get child laborers out of factories and into \nschools.\n  However, if we intend to lead the world in ending this terrible \npractice of child labor, we must here lead by example. I am deeply \nconcerned about the rising incidence of child labor in our own country. \nAlthough no official estimate exists, studies place the number of \nillegally employed children in the U.S. at between 300,000 a 800,000. \nTo respond to the problem, this legislation has fully funded the \nPresident's child labor initiative by providing $15 million for migrant \neducation and $5 million for at-risk youth in agriculture. \nAdditionally, $4 million was added for 36 new investigators to enforce \nchild labor laws. We must make eradication of child labor a top \npriority, and these resources will make that possible.\n  I do want to publicly thank and compliment Secretary of Labor Herman \nfor her leadership in this area and for her focus and determination to \ncrack down on the use of child labor in our country. She has taken \ngreat leadership on this. The additional funding we put in this bill \nwill enable her to do her job even more effectively.\n  Mr. President, this legislation makes some significant investments in \neducation, which are critical to the future of our country. The bill \nprovides an additional $2.1 billion--that's $2.1 billion more than last \nyear--to improve our Nation's schools and help them meet the needs of \nour schoolchildren.\n  There are many problems facing our nation's schools. 14 million \nstudents attend classes in schools that are literally crumbling around \nthem; too many students are in classes that are too big; and too many \nchildren do not have a safe place to be in the hours after school. We \ncan and must address these important matters.\n  The pending legislation provides us with a good foundation. The bill \nprovides additional resources through the Title I program to reduce \nclass size and it fully funds the President's after-school initiative.\n  However, I was disappointed that we could not hold on to the funds \nprovided in the Senate bill to help modernize and repair our nation's \ncrumbling schools.\n  I might add that I just came back, like so many Senators, last night \nfrom my home State to discover that in my State of Iowa over one-\nthird--36 percent--of the elementary and secondary schools in Iowa \ndon't even meet the fire and safety codes. I know that our State is \nvery good. If it is that bad in Iowa, it has to be bad in other States, \ntoo.\n  That is why the money is needed so desperately from the Federal \nGovernment--to help rebuild the infrastructure of our schools, not just \nin meeting the fire and safety codes but to make sure that they are \nwired, that they get the technology that they need to hookup to the \nInternet, and to get the technology to our kids in elementary and \nsecondary schools.\n  The legislation also makes other important investments in education. \nThe bill provides a $500 million increase for special education and \nadditional funds for Head Start to make sure that students are ready to \nstart school.\n  Education must be our Nation's top priority and while I am pleased \nwith the investments made in this legislation, we must recognize that \nthis is just the first step forward. Our future depends on us to do \neven more next year and the year after.\n  The bill provides new funding to higher and train up to 100,000 new \nteachers, increases the maximum Pell grant to its highest level ever, \n$3,125, and provides additional resources for child care and eliminates \ncuts to worker protection programs.\n  Mr. President, I am also pleased that the final bill restored the \nmassive cuts contained in the House bill for the Summer Jobs Program \nand the Low-Income Heat and Energy Assistance Program. These cuts in \nthe House bill--not in the Senate bill--unfairly targeted some of our \nNation's most needy citizens, and had to be reversed. I am glad it was \nreversed.\n  As has been the case in recent years, the appropriations committees \nwas confronted with a number of legislative riders. This is a source of \ncontinuing frustration for our committee because we continue to believe \nthere should be no authorizing legislation on appropriations bills.\n  The House bill included an amendment to the Individuals With \nDisabilities Education Act, or IDEA, that would have given school \nofficials expanded authorities to remove children with disabilities \nfrom school. I vigorously opposed that amendment, because it would have \nremoved critical civil rights protections for children with \ndisabilities--this on the heels of just a little over a year ago, after \nyears of negotiation, when Congress enacted the 1997 amendments to \nIDEA. These amendments made a number of important changes to the law, \nincluding provisions governing the discipline of children with \ndisabilities. The '97 amendments give schools new tools for addressing \nthe behavior of children with disabilities, including more flexible \nauthorities for removing children with disabilities engaged in \nmisconduct involving weapons, drugs, or behavior substantially likely \nto result in injury. More information is needed on the implementation \nof these amendments before any additional changes to the law are \nconsidered by the Congress.\n  For example, I keep hearing from some people that if a child with a \ndisability brings a gun to school there is nothing they can do with \nthem, but if\n\n[[Page S12784]]\n\na nondisabled kid brought a gun to school they could expel them. \nNothing could be further from the truth. If any child, such as a child \nwith disabilities, under IDEA brings a gun, a weapon, a drug to school, \nthey can be immediately dismissed, expelled, for up to 10 days, and \nthen placed in an alternative setting for 45 more days. Again, people \ncan expel a child right away who brings a gun or a dangerous weapon to \nschool.\n  I just say that as a way of pointing out that there is a lot of \nmisinformation out there about the law, because the law was changed \nlast year, and the rules and regulations have not yet been promulgated \nby the Department of Education. Hopefully, that will be done prior to \nthe end of this year.\n  Again, I would like to close these remarks on this section of the \nbill by thanking Chairman Specter for his outstanding leadership \nthroughout the process of putting this part of the bill together.\n  I therefore support the recommendation of the conferees for a GAO \nstudy on the discipline of children with disabilities in lieu of making \nany changes to the authorizing legislation itself. The conference \nagreement charges GAO with obtaining information on how the '97 \namendments have affected the ability of schools to maintain safe school \nenvironments conducive to learning. In order to enable the Congress to \ndifferentiate between the need for amendments as opposed to better \nimplementation of the law, it is critical that GAO look at the extent \nto which school personnel understand the provisions in the IDEA and \nmake use of the options available under the law.\n  For example, in the past, there has been considerable confusion and \nmisunderstanding regarding the options available to school districts in \ndisciplining children with disabilities. The GAO should determine \nwhether schools are using the authorities currently available for \nremoving children. These include: removing a child for up to 10 school \ndays per incident; placing the child in an interim alternative \neducational setting; extending a child's placement in an interim \nalternative educational setting; suspending and expelling a child for \nbehavior that is not a manifestation of the child's disability; seeking \nremoval of the child through injunctive relief; and proposing a change \nin the child's placement.\n  In addition, the law now explicitly requires schools to consider the \nneed for behavioral strategies for children with behavior problems. I \ncontinue to believes that the incidence of misconduct by children with \ndisabilities is closely related to how well these children are served, \nincluding whether they have appropriate individualized education plans, \nwith behavioral interventions where necessary. Again, to enable the \nCongress to interpret information on the effect of the IDEA on dealing \nwith misconduct, this GAO report should provide information on the \nextent to which the schools are appropriately addressing the needs of \nstudents engaged in this misconduct. I would be opposed to giving \nschool officials expanded authority for removing children who engage in \nmisconduct, if such misconduct could be ameliorated by giving these \nchildren the services to which they are entitled. We need information \non the effect of appropriate implementation of the IDEA on the ability \nof schools to provide for safe and orderly environments, and that is \nwhat the GAO study should evaluate.\n  Finally on this matter, I want to emphasize that the provisions in \nthe IDEA for removing children are only needed in those cases in which \nparents and school officials disagree about a proposed disciplinary \naction. Therefore, it is important that the GAO study also provides us \ninformation on the extent to which parents are requesting due process \nhearings on discipline-related matters and the outcomes of three \nhearings.\n  Turning to another important component of this bill, Mr. President, \nI'd like to talk for a few minutes about agriculture. Since early \nsummer, I have been working, along with a number of my colleagues, to \ninform this body about the very serious economic crisis gripping our \nnation's agriculture sector and to develop an emergency assistance \npackage. Farm families and rural communities are not currently sharing \nin the prosperity of our broader economy. With farm income down over 20 \npercent from just two years ago, our farm economy is suffering its \nworst downturn in over a decade.\n  There are ominous signs that unless we turn this situation around, we \nare on the path to a full-blown agricultural depression on a scale of \nthe 1980s farm crisis. My State of Iowa simply cannot stand to go down \nthat road again, nor can our nation.\n  So I am pleased that through our concerted efforts, this bill \nincludes a substantial package of emergency assistance for America's \nfarmers. President Clinton vetoed the first Agriculture appropriations \nbill. He was right to do so. It was woefully inadequate. So we brought \nit back. And that veto by the President set the stage for the extensive \nimprovements that we now have in this bill.\n\n  This bill increases funding by about 85 percent above the amount that \nwas in the vetoed bill for assistance to replace income lost because of \nlow commodity prices--an 85-percent increase over the bill that was \nvetoed. This is a victory but a partial victory. While this bill will \nprovide a good deal of assistance in the form of a one-time payment, it \nfalls far short of what is needed for the future.\n  This bill really has been a ``missed opportunity'' in which we could \nhave put underneath the so-called Freedom to Farm bill a farm income \nsafety net, but did not. When the so-called Freedom to Farm bill was \npassed in 1996, commodity prices were high and the safety net was \nthrown out the window. But prices go down as well as go up.\n  Since 1996 farm commodity prices have plummeted across our country. \nNow it is clear that the 1996 farm bill has failed, and has failed \ndrastically, in protecting against disastrous losses in farm income. \nThe bill that is before us just plows more money right into the Freedom \nto Farm payment system, which has already proven itself incapable of \nresponding to low commodity prices.\n  We proposed a better way. We proposed to focus assistance more \ncarefully on farmers who really need it because of low prices. We \nproposed to direct the benefits towards actual farmers instead of \ntoward landlords. We proposed to restore a farm income safety net \nresponsive to commodity prices. And we proposed to link assistance to \nactual production to avoid windfalls for those choosing not to plant \nthe supported crop. Lastly, we supported a measure of fiscal \nresponsibility so that rising commodity prices would limit USDA farm \nprogram spending.\n  Despite all of these advantages, the Republican majority rejected any \nalternative to the Freedom to Farm payment scheme. So what is going to \nhappen is farmers will get a payment this fall. Even farmers who chose \nnot to plant a crop will get a payment for it. They will get a payment \nhaving no relationship to the market price--just a flat payment across \nthe board--fairly generous for those commodities with relatively better \nprices, much too little for commodities suffering the worst price \nlosses. Also, a good number of farmers who will not be farming next \nyear will get payments this fall, and somehow that will all have to be \nsorted out.\n  With fixed cash payments, landlords are in a great position to put \nthe pressure on and claim a lot of that money in the form of rent for \nnext year. Again, farmers fortunate enough to produce a good crop and \nwhose commodities already have high prices and who are not suffering \nwill still get a payment. This scheme makes no sense whatsoever. And \nyet it is strictly the triumph of ideology over practicality. The \nRepublican ideology is not to have any farm income safety net and if \nthere is a crisis to throw money at it.\n  So what we have done for the farm crisis is we have just thrown a lot \nof money at it. Well, that will help for this year, but it still won't \nbe as good as what we proposed. Equally important, this bill does \nnothing toward restoring a farm income safety net for the longer term. \nWhat we proposed would have provided more income support for farmers \nand done so in a way that helps farmers deal with the practical reality \nof commodity markets. But, no, the Republican majority's ideology said \nwe are going to stick with Freedom to Farm no matter what. And yet we \nknow that a majority of farmers, a majority, a huge majority of the \nfarmers wanted to take the caps off of marketing loan rates and they \nwanted to have some storage payments. Why?\n\n[[Page S12785]]\n\n So they could take the bumper crop we are having this year, store it, \nwait for the grain prices to go up and market it later on.\n  Well, this bill gives them nothing in this regard. Oh, they will get \na payment this fall. But it will not be as much income protection as \nwhat we would have provided by taking the caps off of the marketing \nloan rates. Will it help? Sure, it will help. But it is a wasteful and \nfundamentally unsound way of helping our farmers.\n  Well, as I said, Republicans just decided to throw money at the \nproblem--a triumph of ideology over practicality.\n  One last point. One of my biggest concerns about this bill is the $9 \nbillion add-on to the Pentagon budget--$9 billion thrown in at the last \nminute. Despite the rhetoric from the Republican side, precious little \nof this fiscally irresponsible add-on is targeted at troop readiness \nand other emergencies in the military.\n  Congressional leadership talks a lot about shortages of spare parts \nand about troop pay problems. So where are the proposals to fix the \nPentagon's antiquated supply system? Where are the proposals to \nincrease pay for the troops? Not in this bill. But there is $1 billion \nfor star wars. There are billions more in pork barrel projects not \nrequested by the Pentagon. And at the same time that this bill piles on \nthe Pentagon pork, it is shortchanging reform. The General Accounting \nOffice and the Pentagon's own inspector general constantly report \nrampant waste and mismanagement in the military's purchasing and supply \nsystem, yet this bill lets the waste and mismangement continue \nunchecked, and throws in a few more gold-plated weapons systems to \nboot.\n  What a boondoggle. What a boondoggle. We talk about troop readiness, \nso where does this bill put the money? It puts it into star wars. It \nputs it into pork projects that the Pentagon doesn't want, some more \ngold-plated weapons systems, but precious little in fact, for troop \nreadiness.\n  I have mixed feelings about this 40-pound, 4,000-page whopper that we \nhave before us. It has some important provisions that we worked \ntogether on in a bipartisan fashion--to improve medical research, for \nexample, and to improve education. A number of the components of this \nbill truly will improve the lives of hard-working American families, \nbut the bill also has a number of awful provisions, add-ons, fiscally \nirresponsible giveaways.\n  In the end, I will vote for it because I believe the good does \noutweigh the bad, but I want to be clear that if this bill were in the \nmany separate pieces of legislation as it should have been, a lot of \nthem I would have voted against, and I don't think a lot of them would \never have gotten through this body.\n  As I have said earlier, and as many of my colleagues have said, this \nprocess which we just went through is bad for Americans. This is no way \nto do the Nation's business. The Republican leadership, as I said \nearlier, has treated our taxpayer dollars cavalierly. This is no way to \nflagrantly throw around the hard-earned tax dollars of the taxpayers of \nthis country, to throw it away on boondoggles, to throw it away on \nitems that were never debated or saw the light of day in the Senate or \nthe House.\n  I can only hope that the next Congress will not go through this \nexercise again. I hope the leadership of the next Congress will get the \nappropriations bills through on time, will debate these matters openly \nso that we can have the opportunity to discuss them openly, so we will \nknow what is in the bills before we vote on them. I think Senator \nRobert Byrd of West Virginia said it best--as I read in the newspaper. \nHe said, ``Only God knows what's in this bill.''\n  Well, I don't know, Mr. President, I don't know if we will ever know \nwhat all is in this bill, but I am certain, certain as I am standing \nhere, we are going to see inquiring reporters, investigative \njournalists who will begin looking at this bill. They will begin \nlooking at all of those hidden items, and I bet you piece by piece, bit \nby bit, it is going to come out, maybe next month, maybe in January, \nmaybe in March, all of the little hidden things that were in there. And \nI say, shame on this Congress, shame on the leadership for treating the \nAmerican taxpayers this way. We have got to do better in the way we do \nthe Nation's business.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n             opposition to deletion of the agjobs amendment\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, as we take up the Omnibus \nappropriations bill, I would like to take this opportunity to express \nmy extreme disappointment that the Agricultural Job Opportunity \nBenefits and Security Act amendment, known as AgJOBS, was eliminated \nfrom the Omnibus bill.\n  The bipartisan AgJOBS amendment received a veto proof majority vote \nof 68-31 when it was added to the Commerce, Justice, State \nAppropriations bill earlier this year. We had a golden opportunity to \nreform the current bureaucratic H-2A immigrant visa program that has \nmade fugitives out of farmworkers and felons out of farmers. The \namendment would have created a workable system for recruiting farm \nworkers domestically and preventing our American crops from rotting in \nthe fields.\n  Unfortuantely, the Clinton Administration was content with the status \nquo and threatened to veto the Omnibus bill if the balanced AgJOBS \namendment was included.\n  Mr. President, I find the Administration's veto threat quite \ntroubling since the Omnibus appropriations bill contains a multi-\nbillion dollar disaster relief package for traditional program-crop \nagriculture to help deal with losses sustained as a result of the world \nfinancial crisis.\n  The disaster relief goes to producers who already have a long history \nof reliance on federal assistance, yet the farm disaster bill does \nnothing to help producers of labor intensive commodities--fruits, \nvegetables, and horticultural specialties--who are not supported by the \ngovernment and who are facing a crisis of nationwide labor shortages \ncreated by our own government. This crisis has been exacerbated by our \ncurrent unworkable legal foreign worker program.\n  A farmworker shortage ultimately affects America's ability to compete \nin the world agriculture market. According to the United States \nDepartment of Agriculture data, about three off-farm jobs are sustained \nby each on-farm production job. Therefore, nearly three times as many \nU.S. workers will lose their U.S. jobs as the number of foreign \nfarmworkers kept out of the United States increases.\n  Mr. President, I also cannot understand the inconsistency of the \nAdministration enacting the H-1B high-tech worker bill and not enacting \nH-2A reform as embodied in our AgJOBS bill.\n  Our AgJOBS bill contains worker benefits far in excess of those \nprovided by the H-1B high-tech worker bill. Our bill guarantees above-\nprevailing wages for lower wage occupations, free housing to both U.S. \nand foreign workers recruited from outside the local area, \nreimbursement of inbound and return transportation costs to both U.S. \nand foreign workers recruited from outside the local area, and \npenalties that include lifetime program debarment for violations. The \nH-1B requires only the prevailing wage without any housing or \ntransportation benefits and provides a maximum penalty of a 3-year \ndebarment.\n  Mr. President, we cannot continue to allow our farmers and \nfarmworkers to be trapped in a system that rewards illegal labor \npractices and punishes the most vulnerable.\n  As we address reform of the H-2A immigrant visa program early next \nyear, I hope my colleagues will work with me to finally safeguard basic \nhuman rights, provide a reliable documented work force for farmers, and \nreward legal conduct to both farmers and farmworkers.\n\n\n                    QUINCY LIBRARY GROUP LEGISLATION\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Quincy \nLibrary Group bill has been included in the omnibus appropriations \nbill. This legislation embodies the consensus proposal of the Quincy \nLibrary Group, a coalition of environmentalists, timber industry \nrepresentatives, and local elected officials in Northern California, \nwho came together to resolve their long-standing conflicts over timber \nmanagement on the national forest lands in their area.\n  The Quincy Library Group legislation is a real victory for local \nconsensus decision making. It proves that even some of the most \nintractable environmental issues can be resolved if\n\n[[Page S12786]]\n\npeople work together toward a common goal.\n  I first met the Quincy Library Group back in 1992 when I was running \nfor the Senate, and was then very impressed with what they were trying \nto do.\n  The members of the Quincy Library Group had seen first hand the \nconflict between timber harvesting and jobs, environmental laws and \nprotection of their communities and forests, and the devastation of \nmassive forest fires. Their overriding concern was that a catastrophic \nfire could destroy both the natural environment and the potential for \njobs and economic stability in their community. They were also \nconcerned the ongoing stalemate over forest management was ultimately \nharming both the environment and their local economy.\n  The group got together and talked things out. They decided to meet in \na quiet, non-confrontational environment--the main room of the Quincy \nPublic Library. They began their dialogue in the recognition that they \nshared the common goal of fostering forest health, keeping ecological \nintegrity, assuring an adequate timber supply for area mills, and \nproviding economic stability for their community.\n  One of the best articles I have read about the Quincy Library Group \nprocess recently appeared in the Washington Post. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record at the end \nof my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, after dozens of meetings and a year \nand a half of negotiation, the Quincy Library Group developed an \nalternative management plan for the Lassen National Forest, Plumas \nNational Forest, and the Sierraville Ranger District of the Tahoe \nNational Forest.\n  In the last 5 years, the group has tried to persuade the U.S. Forest \nService to administratively implement the plan they developed. While \nthe Forest Service was interested in the plan developed, they were \nunwilling to fully implement it. Negotiations and discussions began in \nCongress. This legislation is the result.\n\n\n                  the quincy library group legislation\n\n  Specifically, the legislation directs the Secretary of Agriculture to \nimplement the Quincy Library Group's forest management proposal on \ndesignated lands in the Plumas, Lassen and Tahoe National Forests for \nfive years as a demonstration of community-based consensus forest \nmanagement. I would like to thank Senators Murkowski, Bumpers, and \nCraig, Representatives Herger and Miller, as well as the Clinton \nAdministration, for the thoughts they contributed to the development of \nthe final bill.\n  The legislation establishes significant new environmental protections \nin the Quincy Library Group project area. It protects hundreds of \nthousands of acres of environmentally sensitive lands, including all \nCalifornia spotted owl habitat, as well as roadless areas. Placing \nthese areas off limits to logging and road construction protects many \nareas that currently are not protected, including areas identified as \nold-growth and sensitive watersheds in the Sierra Nevada Ecosystem \nProject report.\n  However, in the event that any sensitive old growth is not already \nincluded in the legislation's off base areas, the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee provided report language when the \nlegislation was reported last year, as I requested, directing the \nForest Service to avoid conducting timber harvest activities or road \nconstruction in these late successful old-growth areas. The legislation \nalso requires a program of riparian management, including wide \nprotection zones and streamside restoration projects.\n  The bottom line is that the Quincy Library Group legislation will \nprovide strong protections for the environment while preserving the job \nbase in the Northern Sierra--not just in one single company, but across \n35 area businesses, many of them small and family-owned.\n  The Quincy Library Group legislation is strongly supported by local \nenvironmentalists, labor unions, elected officials, the timber \nindustry, and 27 California counties. The House approved the Quincy \nLibrary Group legislation by a vote of 429 to one last year. The Senate \nEnergy Committee reported the legislation last October. The legislation \nhas been the subject of Congressional hearings and the focus of \nnationwide public discussion.\n  I thank my colleagues for ensuring that this worthy pilot project has \na chance.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 11, 1998]\n\n                    Grass-Roots Seeds of Compromise\n\n                (By Charles C. Mann and Mark L. Plummer)\n\n       Every month since 1993, about 30 environmentalists, \n     loggers, biologists, union representatives and local \n     government officials have met the library of Quincy--a timber \n     town in northern California that has been the site of a nasty \n     15-year battle over logging.\n       Out of these monthly meetings has emerged a plan to manage \n     2.4 million acres of the surrounding national forests. \n     Instead of leaving the forests' ecological fate solely to \n     Washington-based agencies and national interest groups, the \n     once-bitter adversaries have tried to forge a compromise \n     solution on the ground--a green version of Jeffersonian \n     democracy. When the House of Representatives, notorious for \n     its discord on environmental legislation, approved the plan \n     429-1 in July 1997, the Quincy Library Group became the \n     symbol for a promising new means of resolving America's \n     intractable environmental disputes.\n       The Quincy Library Group is one of scores of citizens' \n     associations that in the past decade have brought together \n     people who previously met only in court. Sometimes called \n     ``community-based conservation'' groups, they include the \n     Friends of the Cheat River, a West Virginia coalition working \n     to restore a waterway damaged by mining runoff; the Applegate \n     Partnership, which hopes to restore a watershed in \n     southwestern Oregon while keeping timber jobs alive, and \n     Envision Utah, which tries to foster consensus about how to \n     manage growth in and around Salt Lake City.\n       Like many similar organizations, the Quincy Library Group \n     was born of frustration. In the 1980s, Quincy-based \n     environmental advocates, led by local attorney Michael B. \n     Jackson, attempted with varying success to block more than a \n     dozen U.S. Forest Service timber sales in the surrounding \n     Plumas, Lassen and Tahoe national forests. The constant \n     battles tied the federal agency in knots and almost shut down \n     Sierra Pacific Industries, the biggest timber company there, \n     imperiling many jobs. The atmosphere was ``openly hostile, \n     with agitators on both sides,'' says Linda Blum, a local \n     activist who joined forces with Jackson in 1990 and aroused \n     so much opprobrium that Quincy radio hosts denounced her on \n     the air for taking food from the mouths of the town's \n     children.\n       Worn down and dismayed by the hostility in his community, \n     Jackson was ready to try something different. He got a chance \n     to do so late in 1992, when Bill Coates, a Plumas County \n     supervisor, invited the factions to talk to each other, face \n     to face. Coates suggested that the group work from forest-\n     management plans proposed by several local environmental \n     organizations in the mid-1980s. By early 1993, they were \n     meeting at the library and soon put together a new proposal. \n     (The Forest Service eventually had to drop out because the \n     Federal Advisory Committee Act, which places cumbersome \n     requirements on groups who meet with federal agencies.) Under \n     this proposal, timber companies could continue thinning and \n     selectively logging in up to 70,000 acres per year, about the \n     same area being logged in 1993 but drastically lower than the \n     1990 level. Riverbanks and roadless areas, almost half the \n     area covered by the plan, would be off-limits.\n       The Quincy group asked the Forest Service to incorporate \n     its proposal into the official plans for the three national \n     forests, but never got a definite answer. Convinced that the \n     agency was too dysfunctional to respond, in 1996 the group \n     took its plan to their congressman, Wally Herger, a \n     conservative Republican. Herger introduced the Quincy \n     proposal in the House, hoping to instruct the agency to heed \n     the wishes of local communities. It passed overwhelmingly--\n     perhaps the only time that Reps. Helen Chenoweth (R-Idaho), a \n     vehement property-rights advocate, and George Miller (D-\n     Calif.) one of the greenest legislators on Capitol Hill, have \n     agreed on an environmental law. Then the bill went to the \n     Senate--and slammed into resistance from big environmental \n     lobbies.\n       From the start, the Quincy group had kept in touch with the \n     Wilderness Society, the Natural Resources Defense Council and \n     the Sierra Club. The three organizations offered comments, \n     and the Quincy group incorporated some. Still, the national \n     groups continued to balk, instead submitting detailed \n     criteria necessary to ``merit'' their support. When the \n     Quincy plan became proposed legislation, the national groups \n     stepped up their attacks. The Quincy approach, said Sierra \n     Club legal director Debbie Sease, had a ``basic underlying \n     flaw'' using a cooperative, local decision-making process to \n     manage national assets. Jay Watson, regional director of the \n     Wilderness Society, said: ``Just because a group of local \n     people can come to agreement doesn't mean that it is good \n     public policy.'' And because such parochial efforts are \n     inevitably ill-informed and always risk domination by rich, \n     sophisticated industry representatives, the Audubon Society \n     warned, they are ``not necessarily equipped\n\n[[Page S12787]]\n\n     to view the bigger picture.'' Considering this bigger \n     picture, it continued, ``is the job of Congress, and of \n     watchdog groups like the National Audubon Society.''\n       Many local groups regard national organizations as more \n     interested in protecting their turf than in achieving \n     solutions that advance conservation. ``It's interesting to me \n     that it has to be top-down,'' said Jack Shipley, a member of \n     the Applegate Partnership. ``It's a power issue, a control \n     issue.'' The big groups' insistence on veto power over local \n     decision-making ``sounds like the old rhetoric--either their \n     way or no way,'' Shipley says. ``No way'' may be the fate of \n     the Quincy bill. Pressured by environmental lobbies, Sen. \n     Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) placed a hold on it in the Senate.\n       Despite the group's setback, community-based conservation \n     efforts like Quincy provide a glimpse of the future. Under \n     the traditional approach to environmental management, \n     decisions have been delegated to impartial bureaucracies--the \n     Forest Service, for example, for national forests. Based on \n     the scientific evaluations of ecologists and economists, the \n     agencies then formulate the ``right'' policies, preventing \n     what James Madison called ``the mischief of faction.''\n       But today, according to Mark Sagoff of the University of \n     Maryland Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy, it is \n     the bureaucrats who are beset by factions; big business and \n     environmental lobbies. For these special-interest groups, he \n     argues, ``deliberating with others to resolve problems \n     undermines the group's mission, which is to press its purpose \n     or concern as far as it can in a zero-sum game with its \n     political adversaries.'' The system ``benefits the lawyers, \n     lobbyists and expert witnesses who serve in various causes as \n     mercenaries,'' he says, ``but it produces no policy worth a \n     damn.''\n       In contrast, community-based conservation depends on all \n     sides acknowledging the legitimacy of each other's values. \n     Participants are not guaranteed to get exactly what they \n     want; no one has the power to stand by and judge the \n     ``merit'' of the results. Although ecology and economics play \n     central roles, ecologists and economists have no special \n     place. Like everyone else, they must sit at the table as \n     citizens, striving to make their community and its \n     environment a better place to live.\n       In short, Quincy's efforts and those like it represent a \n     new type of environmentalism: republican environmentalism, \n     with a small ``r.'' This new approach cannot address global \n     problems like climate change. Nor should it be routinely \n     accepted if a local group decides on irrevocable changes in \n     areas of paramount national interest--filling in the Grand \n     Canyon, say. But even if some small town would be foolish \n     enough to decide to do something destructive, there's a whole \n     framework of national environment laws that would prevent it \n     from happening. And, despite the resistance of the national \n     organizations, the environmental movement should not reject \n     this new approach out of hand. Efforts to protect the \n     environment over the past 25 years have produced substantial \n     gains, but have lately degenerated into a morass of \n     litigation and lobbying. Community-based conservation has the \n     potential to change things on the ground, where it matters \n     most.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. It is agreed that certain language added to the Quincy \nLibrary Group Forest Recovery and Economic Stability Act after the bill \nwas proposed by Congressman Wally Herger related to grazing within the \npilot project areas may have introduced ambiguities that could lead to \nadverse effects. Is there any intent for the Quincy Library Group \nlegislation to negatively impact grazing in general?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. No, neither the authors of the bill, nor the Quincy \nLibrary Group ever intended to negatively impact grazing generally.\n  Mr. CRAIG. What does ``specific location'' as referred to in \nsubsection (c)(2)(C) of the legislation mean? Can the riparian \nmanagement or SAT guidelines referred to by this legislation be applied \nto the entire pilot project area?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The only location where these guidelines would apply \nto grazing is where cattle are actually in the work area and at the \nsame time a QLG activity is taking place. The QLG resource management \nactivities include building defensible profile zones, single or group \ntree selection thinning, and riparian management projects.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the SAT riparian management guidelines referred to in \nthis measure apply to riparian management projects outside of the pilot \nproject area or to grazing activities within the pilot project area \nwhere no riparian management activities are taking place?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Under the terms of this bill the SAT guidelines \naffecting grazing will apply only to the specific work area location \nand only at the specific time that projects are conducted within the \npilot project area. The applicability of these guidelines outside of \nthe pilot project area is not addressed by this legislation.\n\n\n                       Children's Online Privacy\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, the Children's Online Privacy Act was \nreported out of Committee by voice vote. Because of time constraints at \nthe end of the session, we have been unable to file a Committee Report \nbefore offering it as an amendment on the Senate floor. Accordingly, I \nwish to take this opportunity to explain the purpose and some of the \nimportant features of the amendment.\n  In a matter of only a few months since Chairman McCain and I \nintroduced this bill last summer, we have been able to achieve a \nremarkable consensus. This is due in large part to the recognition by a \nwide range of constituencies that the issue is an important one that \nrequires prompt attention by Congress. It is also due to revisions to \nour original bill that were worked out carefully with the participation \nof the marketing and online industries, the Federal Trade Commission, \nprivacy groups, and First Amendment organizations.\n  The goals of this legislation are: (1) to enhance parental \ninvolvement in a child's online activities in order to protect the \nprivacy of children in the online environment; (2) to enhance parental \ninvolvement to help protect the safety of children in online fora such \nas chatrooms, home pages, and pen-pal services in which children may \nmake public postings of identifying information; (3) to maintain the \nsecurity of personally identifiable information of children collected \nonline; and (4) to protect children's privacy by limiting the \ncollection of personal information from children without parental \nconsent. The legislation accomplishes these goals in a manner that \npreserves the interactivity of children's experience on the Internet \nand preserves children's access to information in this rich and \nvaluable medium.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill's provisions be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n     Sec. 1301. Short Title\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Children's Online Privacy \n     Protection Act of 1998.''\n     Sec. 1302. Definitions\n       (1) Child: The amendment applies to information collected \n     from children under the age of 13.\n       (2) Operator: The amendment applies to ``operators.'' This \n     term is defined as the person or entity who both operates an \n     Internet website or online service and collects information \n     on that site either directly or through a subcontractor. This \n     definition is intended to hold responsible the entity that \n     collects the information, as well as the entity on whose \n     behalf the information is collected. This definition, \n     however, would not apply to an online service to the extent \n     that it does not collect or use the information.\n       The amendment exempts nonprofit entities that would not be \n     subject to the FTC Act. The exception for a non-profit entity \n     set forth in Section 202(2)(B) applies only to a true not-\n     for-profit and would not apply to an entity that operates for \n     its own profit or that operates in substantial part to \n     provide profits to or enhance the profitability of its \n     members.\n       (7) Parent: The term ``parent'' includes ``legal \n     guardian.''\n       (8) Personal Information: This is an online children's \n     privacy bill, and its reach is limited to information \n     collected online from a child.\n       The amendment applies to individually identifying \n     information collected online from a child. The definition \n     covers the online collection of a first and last name, \n     address including both street and city/town (unless the \n     street address alone is provided in a forum, such as a city-\n     specific site, from which the city or town is obvious), e-\n     mail address or other online contact information, phone \n     number, Social Security number, and other information that \n     the website collects online from a child and combines with \n     one of these identifiers that the website has also collected \n     online. Thus, for example, the information ``Andy from Las \n     Vegas'' would not fall within the amendment's definition of \n     personal information. In addition, the amendment authorizes \n     the FTC to determine through rulemaking whether this \n     definition should include any other identifier that permits \n     the physical or online contacting of a specific individual.\n       It is my understanding that ``contact'' of an individual \n     online is not limited to e-mail, but also includes any other \n     attempts to communicate directly with a specific, \n     identifiable individual. Anonymous, aggregate information--\n     information that cannot be linked by the operator to a \n     specific individual--is not covered by this definition.\n       (9) Verifiable Parental Consent: The amendment establishes \n     a general rule that ``verifiable parental consent'' is \n     required before a\n\n[[Page S12788]]\n\n     web site or online service may collect information online \n     from children, or use or disclose information that it has \n     collected online from children. The amendment makes clear \n     that parental consent need not be obtained for each instance \n     of information collection, but may, with proper notice, be \n     obtained by the operator for future information collection, \n     use and disclosure. Where parental consent is required under \n     the amendment, it means any reasonable effort, taking into \n     consideration available technology, to provide the parent of \n     a child with notice of the website's information practices \n     and to ensure that the parent authorizes collection, use and \n     disclosure, as applicable, of the personal information \n     collected from that child.\n       The FTC will specify through rulemaking what is required \n     for the notice and consent to be considered adequate in light \n     of available technology. The term should be interpreted \n     flexibly, encompassing ``reasonable effort'' and ``taking \n     into consideration available technology.'' Obtaining written \n     parental consent is only one type of reasonable effort \n     authorized by this legislation. ``Available technology'' can \n     encompass other online and electronic methods of obtaining \n     parental consent. Reasonable efforts other than obtaining \n     written parental consent can satisfy the standard. For \n     example, digital signatures hold significant promise for \n     securing consent in the future, as does the World Wide Web \n     Consortium's Platform for Privacy Preferences. In addition, I \n     understand that the FTC will consider how schools, libraries \n     and other public institutions that provide Internet access to \n     children may accomplish the goals of this Act.\n       As the term ``reasonable efforts'' indicates, this is not a \n     strict liability standard and looks to the reasonableness of \n     the efforts made by the operator to contact the parent.\n       (10) Website Directed to Children: This definition \n     encompasses a site, or that portion of a site or service, \n     which is targeted to children under age 13. The subject \n     matter, visual content, age of models, language, or other \n     characteristics of the site or service, as well as off-line \n     advertising promoting the website, are all relevant to this \n     determination. For example, an online general interest \n     bookstore or compact disc store will not be considered to be \n     directed to children, even though children visit the site. \n     However, if the operator knows that a particular visitor from \n     whom it is collecting information is a child, then it must \n     comply with the provisions of this amendment. In addition, if \n     that site has a special area for children, then that portion \n     of the site will be considered to be directed to children.\n       The amendment provides that sites or services that are not \n     otherwise directed to children should not be considered \n     directed to children solely because they refer or link users \n     to different sites that are directed to children. Thus a site \n     that is directed to a general audience, but that includes \n     hyperlinks to different sites that are directed to children, \n     would not be included in this definition but the child \n     oriented linked sites would be. By contrast, a site that is a \n     child-oriented directory would be considered directed to \n     children under this standard. However, it would be \n     responsible for its own information practices, not those of \n     the sites or services to which it offers hyperlinks or \n     references.\n       (12) Online Contact Information: This term means an e-mail \n     address and other substantially similar identifiers enabling \n     direct online contact with a person.\n     Sec. 1303. Regulation of Unfair and Deceptive Acts and \n         Practices\n       This subsection directs the FTC to promulgate regulations \n     within one year of the date of enactment prohibiting website \n     or online service operators or any person acting on their \n     behalf from violating the prohibitions of subsection (b). The \n     regulations shall apply to any operator of a website or \n     online service that collects personal information from \n     children and is directed to children, or to any operator \n     where that operator has actual knowledge that it is \n     collecting personal information from a child.\n       The regulations shall require that these operators adhere \n     to the statutory requirements set forth in Section 203(b)(1):\n       1. Notice.--Operators must provide notice on their sites of \n     what personal information they are collecting online from \n     children, how they are using that information, and their \n     disclosure practices with regard to that information. Such \n     notice should be clear, prominent and understandable. \n     However, providing notice on the site alone is not sufficient \n     to comply with the other provisions of Section 202 that \n     require the operator to make reasonable efforts to provide \n     notice in obtaining verifiable parental consent, or the \n     provisions of Section 203 that require reasonable efforts to \n     give parents notice and an opportunity to refuse further use \n     or maintenance of the personal information collected from \n     their child. These provisions require that the operator make \n     reasonable efforts to ensure that a parent receives notice, \n     taking into consideration available technology.\n       2. Prior Parental Consent.--As a general rule, operators \n     must obtain verifiable parental consent for the collection, \n     use or disclosure of personal information collected online \n     from a child.\n       3. Disclosure and Opt Out for a Parent Who Has Provided \n     Consent.--Subsection 203(b)(1)(B) creates a mechanism for a \n     parent, upon supplying proper identification, to obtain: (1) \n     disclosure of the specific types of personal information \n     collected from the child by the operator; and (2) disclosure \n     through a ``means that is reasonable under the \n     circumstances'' of the actual personal information the \n     operator has collected from that child. It would be \n     inappropriate for operators to be liable under another source \n     of law for disclosures made in a good faith effort to fulfill \n     the disclosure obligation under this subsection. Accordingly, \n     subsection 203(a)(2) provides that operators are immune from \n     liability under either federal or state law for any \n     disclosure made in good faith and following procedures that \n     are reasonable. If the FTC has not issued regulations, I \n     expect that such procedures would be judged by a court based \n     upon their reasonableness.\n       Subsection 203(b)(1)(B) also gives that parent the ability \n     to opt out of the operator's further use or maintenance in \n     retrievable form, or future online collection of information \n     from that child. The opt out of future collection operates as \n     a revocation of consent that the parent has previously given. \n     It does not prohibit the child from seeking to provide \n     information to the operator in the future, nor the operator \n     from responding to such a request by seeking (and obtaining) \n     parental consent. In addition, the opt out requirement \n     relates only to the online site or sites for which the \n     information was collected and maintained, and does not apply \n     to different sites which the operator separately maintains.\n       Subsection 203(b)(3) provides that if a parent opts out of \n     use or maintenance in retrievable form, or future online \n     collection of personal information, the operator of the site \n     or service in question may terminate the service provided to \n     that child.\n       4. Curbing Inducements to Disclose Personal Information.--\n     Subsection 203(b)(1)(C) prohibits operators from inducing a \n     child to disclose more personal information than reasonably \n     necessary in order to participate in a game, win a prize, or \n     engage in another activity.\n       5. Security Procedures.--Subsection 203(b)(1)(D) requires \n     that an operator establish and maintain reasonable procedures \n     to protect the confidentiality, security, and integrity of \n     personal information collected online from children by that \n     operator.\n       Exceptions to Parental Consent: Subsection 203(b)(2) is \n     intended to ensure that children can obtain information they \n     specifically request on the Internet but only if the operator \n     follows certain specified steps to protect the child's \n     privacy. This subsection permits an operator to collect \n     online contact information from a child without prior \n     parental consent in the following circumstances: (A) \n     collecting a child's online contact information to respond on \n     a one-time basis to a specific request of the child; (B) \n     collecting a parent's or child's name and online contact \n     information to seek parental consent or to provide parental \n     notice; (C) collecting online contact information to respond \n     directly more than once to a specific request of the child \n     (e.g., subscription to an online magazine), when such \n     information is not used to contact the child beyond the scope \n     of that request; (D) the name and online contact information \n     of the child to the extent reasonably necessary to protect \n     the safety of a child participant in the site; and (E) \n     collection, use, or dissemination of such information as \n     necessary to protect the security or integrity of the site or \n     service, to take precautions against liability, to respond to \n     judicial process, or, to the extent permitted under other \n     provisions of law, to provide information to law enforcement \n     agencies or for an investigation related to public safety.\n       For each of these exceptions the amendment provides \n     additional protections to ensure the privacy of the child. \n     For a one-time contact, the online contact information \n     collected may be used only to respond to the child and then \n     must not be maintained in retrievable form. In cases where \n     the site has collected the parents' online contact \n     information in order to obtain parental consent, it must not \n     maintain that information in retrievable form if the parent \n     does not respond in a reasonable period of time. Finally, if \n     the child's online contact information will be used, at the \n     child's request, to contact the child more than once, the \n     site must use reasonable means to notify parents and give \n     them the opportunity to opt out.\n       In addition, subsection (C)(ii) also allows the FTC the \n     flexibility to permit the site to recontact the child without \n     notice to the parents, but only after the FTC takes into \n     consideration the benefits to the child of access to online \n     information and services and the risks to the security and \n     privacy of the child associated with such access.\n       Paragraph (D) clarifies that websites and online services \n     offering interactive services directed to children, such as \n     monitored chatrooms and bulletin boards, that require \n     registration but do not allow the child to post personally \n     identifiable information, may request and retain the names \n     and online contact information of children participating in \n     such activities to the extent necessary to protect the safety \n     of the child. However, the company may not use such \n     information except in circumstances where the company \n     believes that the safety of a child participating on that \n     site is threatened, and the company must provide direct \n     parental notification with the opportunity for the parent to \n     opt out of retention of the information. For example, there \n     have been instances in which children have threatened suicide \n     or discussed family abuse in such fora. Under these \n     circumstances, an operator may use the name and online \n     contact information of the child in order to be able to get \n     help for the child.\n\n[[Page S12789]]\n\n       Throughout this section, the amendment uses the term ``not \n     maintained in retrievable form.'' It is my intent in using \n     this language that information that is ``not maintained in \n     retrievable form'' be deleted from the operator's database. \n     This language simply recognizes the technical reality that \n     some information that is ``deleted'' from a database may \n     linger there in non-retrievable form.\n       Enforcement.--Subsection 203(c) provides that violations of \n     the FTC's regulations issued under this amendment shall be \n     treated as unfair or deceptive trade practices under the FTC \n     Act. As discussed below, State Attorneys General may enforce \n     violations of the FTC's rules. Under subsection 203(d), state \n     and local governments may not, however, impose liability for \n     activities or actions covered by the amendment if such \n     requirements would be inconsistent with the requirements \n     under this amendment or Commission regulations implementing \n     this amendment.\n     Sec. 1304. Safe harbors\n       This section requires the FTC to provide incentives for \n     industry self-regulation to implement the requirements of \n     Section 203(b). Among these incentives is a safe harbor \n     through which operators may satisfy the requirements of \n     Section 203 by complying with self-regulatory guidelines that \n     are approved by the Commission under this section.\n       This section requires the Commission to make a \n     determination as to whether self-regulatory guidelines \n     submitted to it for approval meet the requirements of \n     Commission regulations issued under Section 203. The \n     Commission will issue, through rulemaking, regulations \n     setting forth procedures for the submission of self-\n     regulatory guidelines for Commission approval. The \n     regulations will require that such guidelines provide the \n     privacy protections set forth in Section 203. The Commission \n     will assess all elements of proposed self-regulatory \n     guidelines, including enforcement mechanisms, in light of the \n     circumstances attendant to the industry or sector that the \n     guidelines are intended to govern.\n       The amendment provides that, once guidelines are approved \n     by the Commission, compliance with such guidelines shall be \n     deemed compliance with Section 203 and the regulations issued \n     thereunder.\n       The amendment requires the Commission to act upon requests \n     for approval of guidelines for safe harbor treatment within \n     180 days of the filing of such requests, including a period \n     for public notice and comment, and to set forth its \n     conclusions in writing. If the Commission denies a request \n     for safe harbor treatment or fails to act on a request within \n     180 days, the amendment provides that the party that sought \n     Commission approval may appeal to a United States district \n     court as provided for in the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 706.\n     Sec. 1305. Actions by States.\n       State Attorneys General may file suit on behalf of the \n     citizens of their state in any U.S. district court of \n     jurisdiction with regard to a practice that violates the \n     FTC's regulations regarding online children's privacy \n     practices. Relief may include enjoining the practice, \n     enforcing compliance, obtaining compensation on behalf of \n     residents of the state, and other relief that the court \n     considers appropriate.\n       Before filing such an action, an attorney general must \n     provide the FTC with written notice of the action and a copy \n     of the complaint. However, if the attorney general determines \n     that prior notice is not feasible, it shall provide notice \n     and a copy of the complaint simultaneous to filing the \n     action. In these actions, state attorneys general may \n     exercise their power under state law to conduct \n     investigations, take evidence, and compel the production of \n     evidence or the appearance of witnesses.\n       After receiving notice, the FTC may intervene in the \n     action, in which case it has the right to be heard and to \n     file an appeal. Industry associations whose guidelines are \n     relied upon as a defense by any defendant to the action may \n     file as amicus curiae in proceedings under this section.\n       If the FTC has filed a pending action for violation of a \n     regulation prescribed under Section 3, no state attorney \n     general may file an action.\n     Sec. 1306. Administration and applicability\n       FTC Enforcement: Except as otherwise provided in the \n     amendment, the FTC shall conduct enforcement proceedings. The \n     FTC shall have the same jurisdiction and enforcement \n     authority with respect to its rules under this amendment as \n     in the case of a violation of the Federal Trade Commission \n     Act, and the amendment shall not be construed to limit the \n     authority of the Commission under any other provisions of \n     law.\n       Enforcement by Other Agencies: In the case of certain \n     categories of banks, enforcement shall be carried out by the \n     Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; the Federal \n     Reserve Board; the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit \n     Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union \n     Administration Board, and the Farm Credit Administration. The \n     Secretary of Transportation shall have enforcement authority \n     with regard to any domestic or foreign air carrier, and the \n     Secretary of Agriculture where certain aspects of the Packers \n     and Stockyards Act apply.\n     Sec. 1307. Review.\n       Within 5 years of the effective date for this amendment, \n     the Commission shall conduct a review of the implementation \n     of this amendment, and shall report to Congress.\n     Sec. 1308. Effective date\n       The enforcement provisions of this amendment shall take \n     effect 18 months after the date of enactment, or the date on \n     which the FTC rules on the first safe harbor application \n     under section 204 if the FTC does not rule on the first such \n     application filed within one year after the date of \n     enactment, whichever is later. However, in no case shall the \n     effective date be later than 30 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n\n                              Section 110\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I am pleased that this Omnibus \nAppropriations Bill will include a delay of the implementation of \nSection 110 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996.\n  The 1996 immigration law mandated the implementation of an exit-entry \nsystem at all U.S. borders by September 30, 1998. If implemented, the \nimpact of this provision would be devastating, causing insufferable \ndelays at the U.S.-Canadian border, particularly in my own state of New \nYork. Trade, tourism and international relations would all suffer.\n  Last year, I joined with Senator Spencer Abraham and other colleagues \nto introduce the Border Improvement and Immigration Act of 1997 (S. \n1360) which would maintain current cross-border traffic along the \nnorthern border and I testified at a Senate Subcommittee hearing on the \nrepercussions of implementing Section 110 on New York. On April 23, \n1998, the Senate Judiciary Committee considered and marked up the bill. \nThe bill approved by the Committee allows land border and seaports to \nbe exempt from the new system. The full Senate passed S. 1360 in July \n1998 and also voted in support of a full repeal of Section 110.\n  However, as the date of implementation grew closer, Congress enacted \na two and a half year delay, which is included in the Omnibus \nConsolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriation Act for Fiscal \nYear 1999. While we have some ``breathing room'', rest assured that I \nwill continue to press for a full repeal of Section 110. I thank my \ncolleagues for working with Senator Abraham and I on this important \nprovision.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I have decided to vote for the omnibus \nappropriations bill because it contains many things which are very \nbeneficial to the people and the economy of my state of California, and \nit includes two of my top priorities--afterschool programs and the \nSalton Sea Restoration Act.\n  I want to make it clear, however, that the process that brought us \nthis bill is severely flawed. While the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, on which I sit, did its work and reported each \nappropriations bill to the full Senate, the leaders of this Congress \nfailed to do the appropriations work. This omnibus bill is not the \nright way to legislate.\n  I also want to say that I strongly object to the environmental riders \nin the bill, including legislation that will double the timber cut in \nseveral national forests in California. I realize that some of the \nriders were dropped from the final legislation and others were \nnegotiated to have less impact, but the presence of any riders that \nharm our environment is unacceptable to me.\n  First, let me say what I like about the omnibus legislation:\n\n\n                               education\n\n  The most significant achievement of the bill is its emphasis on \nfunding for public education, including:\n  $129 million to recruit, hire and train 3,500 teachers for California \nschools in order to reduce class size in the primary grades.\n  $20 million to expand afterschool programs for 25,000 children in \nCalifornia. This is a $16 million increase for California. I am \nparticularly gratified by the outcome here because I believe it \nreflects my bill, the ``Afterschool Education and Safety Act'', and the \namendment I successfully attached to the Senate Budget Resolution \ncalling for more afterschool funding.\n  $77 million, a $12 million increase, for technology in schools \nprograms, to help train teachers, and ensure computer literacy and \naccess to Internet for California students.\n  $875 million to California schools, a $35 million increase over last \nyear, for disadvantaged students under the Title I program. Senator \nFeinstein and I worked very hard for this increase.\n\n[[Page S12790]]\n\n  $550 million for California Head Start programs, to serve 3,280 more \nCalifornia children than last year for a total of more than 80,000.\n  $58 million, an increase of $3.6 million, through the Goals 2000 \nprogram to promote higher academic standards, increase student \nachievement, and help 12000 California schools implement school \nreforms.\n  $26 million for California through the ``America Reads'' program, to \nhelp children in grades K-3 improving reading skills--all new funds.\n  The largest Pell Grant ever to California: $920 million, an increase \nof $43 million over last year, to increase the maximum grant to college \nstudents to $3,125, 36% higher than maximum award last year.\n\n\n                                 health\n\n  The bill provides funding for several federal programs that are very \nimportant in my state, and the omnibus funding levels will result in \ngreat benefits to California:\n  $2.3 billion, a $300 million increase, for medical research grants to \nCalifornia universities and research institutions through the National \nInstitutes of Health (est.)\n  $238 million , a $43 million increase, for the Ryan White Care Act \nfor health care services to Californians with HIV and AIDS.\n  At least $13 million for HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment for \nminority communities.\n  An increase of between $11 and 21 million in funding for Housing \nOpportunities for Persons With Aids (HOPWA) who have limited financial \nresources.\n  In addition, the bill accelerates the implementation of the health \ninsurance premium tax deduction for the self-employed. By 2003, the \ndeduction will be 100 percent.\n  The omnibus legislation also requires federal health plans to provide \ncoverage for contraceptive drugs and devices.\n  Finally, the bill increases funding for the Centers for Disease \nControl by $226 million over last year--even more than the president's \nrequest--and specifies funds for important priorities such as childhood \nimmunization ($421 million), breast and cervical cancer screening ($159 \nmillion), and chronic and environmental disease ($294 million).\n\n\n                                economy\n\n  The legislation extends provisions of current law that help \nCalifornia's economy, including:\n  The Research and Experimentation Tax Credit, which is of great \nimportance to California's high tech and bio tech companies.\n  The Work Opportunity Tax Credit, which encourages businesses to hire \ndisadvantaged workers.\n  The Trade Adjustment Assistance program, which helps workers and \nbusinesses adversely affected by free trade agreements.\n  The Generalized System of Preferences authority of the President, \nwhich allows him to extend duty-free treatment on imports from certain \ndevelopment countries.\n  There are a number of other funding provisions that are beneficial to \nmy state's businesses and industries, and our economy, including:\n  $204 million for the Advanced Technology Program, an increase of $11 \nmillion over last year, to develop cutting edge technologies. \nCalifornia receives more than any other state.\n  $100 million for ``Next Generation Internet'', a federal program to \nconnect universities to the Internet and to one another. Many \nCalifornia universities are part of this program: UCLA, Stanford, \nBerkeley, UC-Davis, UC-Irvine, UC-San Diego, Calif. Tech, and Cal \nState, and others.\n  A 3-year moratorium on new taxes on Internet activities.\n  Full funding for the international Monetary Fund.\n  About double the number of visas available to foreign high tech, high \nskilled workers under the H-1B program. The bill raises the annual cap \nfrom 65,000 to 115,000 for next 2 years.\n  An increase in the Federal Housing Administration's loan limit from \n$86,000 to $109,000, which will give more housing ownership \nopportunities to Californians.\n  $283 million nationally for 50,000 Welfare to Work Housing Vouchers \nfor families trying to make transition to jobs. This new program will \nhelp them get housing closer to jobs.\n\n\n                              Agriculture\n\n  The bill includes a number of important funding and legislative \nprovisions for California farm interests:\n  Extension of time for California citrus growers to conduct scientific \nreview of whether Argentine citrus should be permitted into the U.S.\n  Continued affordability for California farmers for crop insurance.\n  $500,000 for pest control research that affects citrus fruit trees.\n  $90 million for the Market Access Program, which benefits California \ncompanies that sell product overseas.\n  In addition, the bill provides an increase of $75 million--to $633 \nmillion--for the Food Safety Initiative, to help implement improvements \nin surveillance of food borne illnesses, education about proper food \nhandling, research, and inspection of imported and domestic foods.\n\n\n                              environment\n\n  The omnibus bill includes some good things for California, including:\n  Salton Sea legislation to require a Department of Interior study on \noptions for restoring the Sea. The bill also provides $14.4 million to \nfund research and restoration activities.\n  $10,000 for an appraisal of the Bolsa Chica mesa.\n  $2 million for land acquisition in the Santa Monica Mountains \nNational Recreation Area.\n  $273,000 for operations at the Manzanar National Historic Site\n  Continuation for the moratorium on new Outer Continental Shelf oil/\nmineral leases and drilling.\n  $1 million for land acquisition in the San Bernardino National \nForest.\n  More generally, the bill provides a substantial increase for global \nclimate change programs to more than $1 billion, a 25.6 percent \nincrease over 1998. It also funds the President's Clean Water Action \nPlan at $1.7 billion--a 16.1 percent increase over 1998. This 5-year \nprogram helps communities and farmers clean up waterways which are \ncurrently deemed unswimmable and unfishable.\n\n\n                             infrastructure\n\n  The bill provides a total of $293 million for California \ntransportation projects, including $70 million for Los Angeles \nMetropolitan Transportation Authority Red Line, $40 million for the \nBART-to-San Francisco Airport line, and $17 million for the Santa \nMonica Bus Transitway for a dedicated highway express lane for buses.\n  Other major California projects that are funded include $50 million \nfor Los Angeles River flood control, $52 million for Port of Los \nAngeles expansion, $6 million for Port of Long Beach expansion, and \n$1.5 million for Marina Del Rey dredging (Boxer request)\n\n\n                   community development and services\n\n  Allows LA City and County to use up to 25 percent of Los Angeles \nCommunity Development Block Grant for public services, such as job \ntraining, child care, crime and drug abuse prevention--federal cap \nnormally is 15 percent. This gives LA more flexibility in deciding how \nto spend the CDBG funds.\n  Funds the Low Income Home Energy Assistance program at $1.1 billion \nnationally. Last year, the program benefited 300,000 low income \nfamilies in California.\n  Summer Youth Employment program is funded at $871 million, same as \nlast year, nationwide. Last year, California received $140.1 million, \ncreating 70,510 jobs for economically disadvantaged youth.\n\n\n                                 crime\n\n  The omnibus appropriations bill funds the COPS program with an \nadditional $1.4 billion nationwide. This will allow the hiring of an \nadditional 1,700 new police in California. The bill also includes $2 \nmillion for the ``Tools for Tolerance'' program, a new grant under the \nByrne Grant program for the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles. \nThis program helps police officers learn how they can reduce prejudice \nin their communities.\n\n\n                    immigration assistance to states\n\n  The legislation includes about $585 million to states as \nreimbursement for the cost of incarcerating illegal immigrants. \nCalifornia receives about half the national total. The bill also \nincludes roughly $150 million to reduce backlog at INS in processing \nrequests by legal immigrants to become U.S. citizens. Forty percent of \nthe current backlog is in California.\n  These are all good provisions that will be of benefit to my state. \nHowever, I am very disappointed that the omnibus bill contains a number \nof harmful provisions, as well, including:\n\n[[Page S12791]]\n\n  Legislation to allow doubling the cut of timber in 2\\1/2\\ national \nforests in California.\n  An 8-month delay of implementation of new oil valuation royalty \nrules, which deprives California schools of funds they are entitled to.\n  Zero funding for the U.N. Fund for Population Activities--\ninternational family planning assistance.\n  Continuation of the prohibition, except in cases of life \nendangerment, rape or incest, on the use of any federal funds for \nabortion services.\n  Continuaiton of the ban on federal employee health benefit plans for \ncovering abortion services except in cases of life endangerment, rape \nor incest.\n  The bill provides about $8 million in ``emergency'' fiscal year 1999 \nspending for defense and national security. The Joint Chiefs of Staff \nhave said there are billions in the defense budget for items not \nrequested by them. I believe they are right and that some of the \nunrequested items could have been cut to offset needed additional \ndefense funds included in the omnibus bill.\n  Mr. President, for the good that is in the bill, I will vote for it. \nHowever, it is my strong feeling that this ``omnibus, consolidated, \nemergency, supplemental'' bill is not a good way to put together the \nbudget of the United States. Too many decisions--important decisions \nthat affect millions of Americans--were left to the end of the year and \nmade by just a handful of people, rather than being considered \ncarefully and thoroughly over a period of months, in open committee and \nfloor debates. I hope that this process will not be repeated in future \nyears.\n  Overall, I remain strongly and deeply committed to a budget and \nlegislative agenda that puts top priority on education for all American \nchildren, health research that will make life better for all Americans, \ntechnology development to keep America's economy the strongest in the \nworld, and infrastructure that promotes safety, economic activity, and \nhigher quality of life for all our people.\n\n\n                        INTERNET MORATORIUM ACT\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Internet Moratorium \nAct is included in the 1998 omnibus appropriations bill. Present \nfederal law neither authorizes, nor imposes, nor ratifies any excise, \nsales, or domain registration tax on Internet use for electronic \ninterstate commerce, and only one fee for the Intellectual \nInfrastructure Fund. This temporary moratorium will prevent federal and \nstate governments from implementing or enforcing taxes imposed on \nInternet commerce over the next three years. We would also like to \nclarify that this Congress has not ratified or authorized any federal \ntaxes on Internet domain name registrations. The U.S. Federal Court has \nstated that Section 8003 ratifies what was previously declared to be an \nunconstitutional tax. However, it was never intended to ratify a tax on \nthe Internet; it only speaks to a fee for the Intellectual \nInfrastructure Fund. Because the fee constitutes an unconstitutional \ntax, it was not ratified by section 8003. I am confident that this \nmoratorium will enable Congress to develop a coherent national strategy \nof appropriate taxation of business transactions conducted over the \nInternet without hindering business opportunities and would also like \nto reiterate that this Congress has never ratified an unconstitutional \ntax on the Internet.\n\n\n             INCLUSION OF NORTH DAKOTA IN THE MIDWEST HIDTA\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the conferees who \nworked on the fiscal year 1999 omnibus appropriations bill for \nretention of my amendment calling for inclusion of North Dakota in the \nMidwest High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, or HIDTA.\n  As North Dakota Attorney General Heidi Heitkamp and US Attorney John \nSchneider have pointed out, North Dakota--like other Midwestern \nstates--has been inundated by a relentlessly rising tide of \nmethamphetamine trafficking, production, and abuse. Unless action is \ntaken swiftly, the Attorney General and US Attorney warn that North \nDakota is at high risk to attract a meth manufacturing industry.\n  This is because my state's sparse population, great size, and \nabandoned buildings offer excellent locations for meth laboratories. \nCounter-drug operations in the southwestern US are also forcing this \neasily-relocated industry to find alternative production locations.\n  The numbers speak for themselves. There were no meth purchases by \nundercover agents in North Dakota in 1993. By 1997, there were 181 \nmeth-related cases reported by state and federal law enforcement. In \n1993, meth-related cases represented only 6 percent of the drug-related \nworkload of the Office of the US Attorney. In five short years this \nnumber has skyrocketed to 75 percent. It is undeniable that increased \nproduction of meth in North Dakota along with associated trafficking \nhas contributed to a spike of violent crime.\n  This unacceptable increase in meth-driven crime in North Dakota is \nplacing a growing burden on North Dakota law enforcement, and \nrepresents a growing danger to the people of my state. It demands an \nimmediate--and coordinated--federal response. Similar problems in the \nstates of South Dakota, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri, and Kansas were \ncountered with the formation of the Midwest HIDTA.\n  North Dakota meets all the statutory criteria for inclusion in the \nMidwest HIDTA. In the words of Heitkamp and Schneider, joining the \nHIDTA will allow federal, state, and local law enforcement to ``work \ntogether to disrupt, dismantle, and destroy street and mid-level \nelements of methamphetamine organizations and/or groups operating in \nNorth Dakota, the Midwest, and Canada.''\n  During floor consideration of the Treasury-Postal appropriations \nbill, I was pleased to work on this matter with the distinguished \nleadership of the Treasury-Postal Appropriations Subcommittee, Senators \nCampbell and Kohl. I greatly appreciate their good work in conference \nto retain my amendment. I am also pleased that the conference report \nincludes additional funding for the new HIDTAs designated in this \nlegislation, and I urge the Administration to consider favorably North \nDakota's request for $1.97 million in fiscal year 1999 funding for \nintegration of my state into the Midwest HIDTA.\n  Mr. President, passage of the omnibus bill is an important step in \ngetting tough on methamphetamine in my state. It is simply imperative \nthat there be coordinated federal, state, and local law enforcement \nresponse to North Dakota's drug crisis, and I again thank Senators \nCampbell and Kohl for their assistance in making this a reality.\n\n\n                  District of Columbia Appropriations\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise to bring to the Senate's attention to \na matter of concern to the government of the District of Columbia and \nto commuters in the capital area.\n  Each workday, about one thousand people a day use an informal carpool \nsystem to get in and out of the nation's capital. These commuters \ngather in ``slug lines'' at unofficial pick up points to catch rides \nwith others driving into the District. At the end of the day, these \n``slugs'' catch rides home.\n  Nearly everyone benefits from this system. The drivers get to work \nmore quickly because they get to use the carpool lane. The ``slugs'' \nget a free ride. Other drivers benefit from reduce traffic. And all of \nus benefit from less pollution due to increased carpooling.\n  Not everyone is happy with the slugs however. The District of \nColumbia police have raised concerns that drivers picking up slugs will \nslow traffic or create a safety hazard. As reported in recent articles \nin the Washington Post, city police officers have ticketed these \ndrivers and considered forcing the commuters to find a new pick up \npoint. Fortunately, District Police Chief Ramsey has decided against \nhis approach. Instead, he will study the traffic situation along 14th \nStreet to see how we can improve the flow of traffic.\n  I welcome this approach. We may be able to address the District's \nconcerns about safety and traffic congestion while preserving the slug \nlines. I've asked the managers of the legislation to consider this \nproblem during conference, and if possible, to include language \ndirecting the Department of the Interior and the District of Columbia \nDepartment of Public Works to study the feasibility of providing \ncommuter pick-up lanes to serve commuters in the busy 14th Street \nCorridor south of Constitution Avenue. The Interior Department and the \nDistrict would report to the Appropriations Committees of the Senate \nand House of Representatives on their joint recommendations\n\n[[Page S12792]]\n\nto address this matter. Even if conference report language could not be \nincluded, I believe the idea of the study, with recommendations would \nbe helpful.\n  I would like to emphasize that many of these commuters are Federal \nemployees, and so I think it's appropriate to get the federal \ngovernment involved. I am certainly willing to work with the District \nGovernment to seek federal funds or easements to create commuter pick \nup lanes, and I hope the District will look closely at this option. I \nthink it could be a triple play--a win with respect to the District's \nsafety concerns, a win for drivers on our congested highways, and of \ncourse, a win for the slugs.\n  Mr. President, I would appreciate hearing the comments of the joint \nmanagers on this issue, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I think the Senator has a workable plan to move this \ntoward a solution, and I urge the Department of the Interior and the \nDistrict Government to study the matter and report back to us early \nnext year.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator from Virginia for raising this issue. \nThe commuter lane proposal sounds like an excellent compromise, and I \nhope Interior and the District will begin looking at this option \nimmediately.\n  As the ranking Democrat of the D.C. I would like to thank Senator \nFaircloth for his efforts as Chairman of the D.C. Appropriations \nSubcommittee. He has worked hard to address the District's financial \nills, and I am pleased that we have begun to make some progress for the \nDistrict to resolve its serious financial problems.\n  In fact, the fiscal well being of the District has improved \ndramatically. The District ended fiscal year 1997 with a budget surplus \nof almost $186 million. The June, 1998 projections suggest that the \nDistrict may have a surplus of $302 million for fiscal year 1998.\n  The fiscal year 1999 D.C. Appropriations includes $494.59 million in \nFederal Funds. This amount represents an increase of $8.39 million \nabove the President's Budget request for the District of Columbia. It \nis $38.4 million below the FY 1998 level.\n  With regard to the District of Columbia Funds, the legislation \nlargely reflects the consensus budget formulated by the Mayor, the City \nCouncil, and the Control Board.\n  It is important to note that because of abuses of taxpayer funds, \nthere is no appropriation to the Advisory Neighborhood Commissions \n(ANCs) as provided for in the consensus budget. However, this deletion \nof funds does not preclude the District from including funds for the \ncommissions in future budgets so long as there are sufficient \nsafeguards to protect taxpayers' interests.\n  Mr. President, with respect to specific provisions of this bill, \nthere are some good things, but there are also some bad provisions.\n  On the plus side, this bill includes a $25 million federal payment \nfor management reform. Within these funds, special attention will be \ngiven to fire and emergency medical services, the reopening of the \nChief Medical Officer's laboratory, and implementation of a high-speed \ncity-owned fiber network for voice and data services.\n  The bill provides funds for the repair and maintenance of public \nsafety facilities in the District. The Federal highway funds made \navailable to the District include $98 million for local streets.\n  The bill includes a $25 million federal contribution to the \nWashington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority for improvements to the \nMetrorail station at the site of the proposed Washington Convention \nCenter project.\n  I am pleased that the bill sets aside $5 million to address the \nchronic need for additional community-based housing facilities for \nseriously and chronically mentally ill individuals in the District.\n  The bill also provides an appropriation to the Children's National \nMedical Center for the Community Pediatric Health Initiative. This \nreestablishes an important public-private partnership to provide \npediatric services to high risk children in medically under-served \nareas.\n  The bill requires the Control Board to report to Congress on the \nstatus of any agreements between the District and all non-profit \norganizations that provide medical and social services to the \nDistrict's residents. This will ensure that the District re-evaluates \nthe decisions to terminate support and where possible renew support for \nthese critical programs, including those of Children's Hospital.\n  I am especially pleased that funding for homeless programs in the \nDistrict will remain level for fiscal year 1999. In previous years, \nthese programs were threatened with funding cuts and I am happy that \nthese cuts are no longer being proposed.\n  Finally, I am pleased that this legislation does not divert any funds \nfrom the District of Columbia Public School system for private school \nvouchers as was included in the D.C. Appropriations bill passed by the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  Mr. President, unfortunately this legislation includes a number of \nobjectionable provision which violate the principle of home rule and \ninfringe on the rights of District residents.\n  Again this year, the bill includes a ban on the use of local funds \nfor abortions, and a ban on the use of local funds to expand health \ncare benefits to unmarried couples. I continue in my strong opposition \nto these provisions.\n  I also have serious concerns about the provision to cap the funds \navailable to reimburse attorneys who represent children who obtain \nspecial education placements in hearing sunder the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act. This provision will seriously inhibit the \nability of children with special needs to obtain their legal right to \nan education.\n  I am disappointed by the inclusion of a provision that prohibits the \nDistrict from using funds to provide assistance to any civil action to \nrequire Congress to provide the District of Columbia with voting \nrepresentation.\n  The bill also includes a repeal of a recently enacted residency \nrequirement, a matter of some controversy.\n  I know that the Administration strongly objects to several provisions \nin the bill, including a ban on funds to organizations that participate \nin needle exchange programs.\n  All of these provisions are unnecessary and inappropriate intrusions \ninto the District's own priorities and the rights of its citizens.\n  Overall, I support the proposed allocation of funds for the District \nof Columbia, but I am disappointed by the many inappropriate riders in \nthis legislation. Without these provisions, this would have been a much \nbetter bill.\n  Again, I would like to recognize Chairman Faircloth, and to \nacknowledge the hard work of the staff for this bill: Mary Beth \nNethercutt of the Majority Staff, Minority Deputy Staff Director, Terry \nSauvain; Liz Blevins and Neyla Arnas of the Committee staff; and \nDanielle Drissel of my legislative staff.\n  I would especially like to express my appreciation to Senator Byrd, \nthe Ranking Democrat of the Committee on Appropriations, for assigning \nhis Deputy Staff Director, Terry Sauvain, to serve as Minority Clerk of \nthe D.C. Appropriations Subcommittee. Terry is a long time \nappropriations staff member who is a consummate professional and a \npleasure to work with, and I have really enjoyed and counted on his \nadvice and council.\n\n\n       Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve Commercial Fishing\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the omnibus package, H.R. 4328, includes \na measure involving commercial fishing in Glacier Bay and Upper Dundas \nBay within Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve. While working on \nthis in the past weeks, a fisherman commented to my office that the \nchoices presented are like choosing whether to cut off your finger, \nhand, or arm. In short, because the Department of the Interior has \ntaken the position that commercial fishing in Glacier Bay and Dundas \nBay should end, there simply has been no solution that Alaskans can \nfully support. In the omnibus bill we have chosen the lesser of evils.\n  Without Congressional action, the National Park Service would have \ngone forward with regulations to phase out fishing in the Bay over 15 \nyears and eventually ban it altogether. The National Park Service would \nalso have blocked Dungeness crab fishermen who fish in Upper Dundas Bay \nand the Beardslee Islands, the so-called wilderness waters, from \ncontinuing a fishery that has existed for nearly 20 years\n\n[[Page S12793]]\n\nwith no evidence of environmental damage. Whether the Service would \nhave ever agreed to a fair plan to compensate these crabbers is \ndoubtful. Discussions have been ongoing for three years without the \nPark Service putting a compensation plan on the table.\n  Without Congressional action, the Service might have proceeded with \nplans to shut down the scallop fishery, stop flounder fishing, close \nout crabbing, and block fisheries outside Glacier Bay itself, again \nrelying on what it believes are its inherent powers to stop commercial \nactivities in parks, the spirit and letter of the Alaska National Lands \nConservation Act to the contrary. In my opinion and the opinion of the \nState of Alaska, the Service has no such authority because regulation \nof fisheries is a state prerogative in Alaska as well as the rest of \nthe nation. Furthermore, the Alaska Department of Law maintains that \nthe submerged land within Glacier Bay and, as a result, the water \ncolumn above it, both fall under the jurisdiction of the State of \nAlaska under the Submerged Lands Act and the Alaska Statehood Act.\n  When this issue was brought before this Congress, I supported Senator \nMurkowski's amendment to the Interior Appropriations bill to block the \nPark Service's planned regulations to give us more time to work out a \nsolution. I also cosponsored Senator Murkowski's bill to resolve this \nproblem once and for all. Unfortunately, because of Administration \nopposition, the bill did not pass Congress, leaving us with the \nprovision for a moratorium on regulations in the Interior bill.\n  As we approached the end of the fiscal year, the Administration \nbecame more vocally opposed to allowing traditional fisheries in \nGlacier Bay to continue even though there is no scientific evidence \nthat either the fisheries or other resources which depend on them are \nin trouble. For example, whale counts are actually up in Glacier Bay, \nan indication that there is an abundance of fish upon which to feed. \nSecretary Babbitt threatened to recommend a veto of the bill if the \nprovision blocking the Park Service's fishing ban was included in the \nspending bills.\n  At the same time, the Congressional leadership stepped up efforts to \ndevelop an omnibus spending package the President would sign. As much \nas they supported the Delegation's efforts in Glacier Bay, the \nCongressional leadership were not willing to give the President any \nexcuse to veto bills and shut down the government to divert attention \nfrom other matters. I was asked to try to work out a solution that the \nPresident would accept. We worked for nearly a week to develop a plan; \nand after consultation with fishermen, crabbers, and the other members \nof the Delegation, I reluctantly concluded that this proposal was \nbetter than taking no action at all.\n  The plan we developed allows the fishermen who have historically \noperated in Glacier Bay to continue to fish for the rest of their \nlives. We had sought the right to allow fishermen to pass on their \npermits to their children or assignees, but that was rejected by the \nInterior Department. Had the regulations gone forward in their current \nform, all fishermen would have been banned from the Bay in 15 years.\n  The proposal also offers a compensation package to the five or six \ncrabbers who will be forced out of designated wilderness areas in \nGlacier Bay and Upper Dundas Bay. It will compensate them for their \npermit and lost income for six years or $400,000, which ever is \ngreater. In addition, if a fisherman chooses to be compensated for his \nor her permit and lost income, he or she may also sell to the Secretary \nhis or her boat and gear for additional compensation. Each crabber will \nobviously have the option of keeping their boat and gear and fishing \nelsewhere. Lost income is net after expenses which should be calculated \nby taking gross receipts and subtracting the cost of insurance, crew, \nfuel, and bait. Paper losses such as depreciation used for Internal \nRevenue purposes only, should not be subtracted in calculating net \nincome.\n  The crabbers will have until February 1st to file a claim and the \nInterior Department will then have six months to act on those claims. \nThere will be an appeals process with a right to go to court if no \nagreement is reached on an acceptable compensation plan. The office of \nthe Assistant Secretary for Parks and Wildlife has pledged to me to \nexpedite this process so the Dungeness crabbers will be compensated as \nquickly as possible.\n  The compromise that was reached also maintains the State of Alaska's \nprerogatives with respect to state management of the state's fisheries. \nThere will be a cooperative management plan developed jointly by the \nInterior Department and the State of Alaska. As that plan is developed, \nI have been assured by the Secretary's office that the Glacier Bay \nWorking Group representing the fishing industry will be consulted. \nThere will be a full public process including hearings, testimony, and \nan opportunity to comment on any proposed plan.\n  In addition, the legislation includes a savings clause to clarify \nthat nothing in the Act undermines the power and authority of the State \nof Alaska to manage fisheries in the State. Finally, I want to make \nclear that unless explicitly provided in the Act, the legislation is \nnot intended to amend the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation \nAct which generally and specifically governs management of Glacier Bay \nNational Park and Preserve as well as subsistence and commercial \nfishing.\n  With respect to subsistence fishing, while the Interior Department \nwould not agree to explicitly allow subsistence activities, I was \nassured by the Secretary's office that personal use fisheries could \ncontinue, most notably for the people of Hoonah who have had a long \nrunning dispute with the Park Service on this issue. I was advised that \nthe Park Service is authorized under National Park Service Organic Act \nto recognize a state-run personal use fishery.\n  Of critical importance is the status of the outer waters of Glacier \nBay. The original proposal made by the Interior Department offered no \nassurance that commercial fishing could continue outside the Bay \nitself. Language was specifically included to address this shortcoming, \nmaking it clear that commercial fishing is authorized under law and \nwill continue to be permitted in the outer waters. Although the \nSecretary, acting jointly in consort with the State of Alaska, through \nthe cooperative management plan, may retain the right to protect park \nresources, that goal must be achieved through reasonable regulation. \nFor example, an area around a seal rookery may be closed to salmon \nfishing to protect that specific location, but the rest of the outside \nwaters must remain open to salmon fishing.\n  I view this compromise as an insurance policy, a safety net that \noffers better protection to Glacier Bay's fishermen than was offered by \nthe draft Park Service regulations. But I do not view it as the end of \nthe story. There are provisions I do not like.\n  Senator Murkowski has already indicated his intention to introduce \nlegislation on this issue and hold hearings in the Senate Energy \nCommittee which he chairs. I also have indications that Congressman \nYoung, the Chairman of the House Resources Committee, has similar \nplans. The Secretary of the Interior agreed to extend the comment \nperiod on the pending agency regulations until January 15, 1999.\n  One issue that has not been addressed in this legislative compromise \nare the losses of local communities and fish processing companies. The \nInterior Department acknowledges that this is a shortcoming and has \npledged to work with me and the rest of the Delegation to address this \nissue. I pledge to work with local communities and processors in the \nmonths ahead.\n\n\n                       Internet Speech Regulation\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week's Washington Post proclaimed in \none headline, ``High Tech is King of the Hill,'' citing the passage of \nseveral bills which I actively supported, including restricting \nInternet taxes, enhancing protection for copyrighted works online, and \nencouraging companies to share information to avoid Year 2000 computer \nfailures. Yet, anyone familiar with the Internet proposals buried in \nthe Omnibus Appropriations measure would be writing a different \nheadline this week.\n  Certain provisions in this huge spending bill repeat the mistakes \nabout regulating speech on the Internet that the last Congress made \nwhen it passed the Communications Decency Act, the\n\n[[Page S12794]]\n\n ``CDA-I.'' I opposed the CDA from the start as fatally flawed and \nflagrantly unconstitutional. I predicted that the CDA would not pass \nconstitutional muster and, along with Senator Feingold, sought to \nrepeal the CDA so that we would not have to wait for the Supreme Court \nto fix our mistake.\n  We did not fix the mistake and so, as I predicted, the Supreme Court \neventually did our work for us. All nine Justices agreed that the CDA \nwas, at least in part, unconstitutional. Justice Stevens, writing for \nseven members of the Court, called the CDA ``patently invalid'' and \nwarned that it cast a ``dark shadow over free speech'' and \n``threaten[ed] to torch a large segment of the Internet community.'' \nReno v. ACLU, 117 S.Ct. 2329, 2350 (1997). The Court's decision came as \nno surprise to me, and should have come as no surprise to the 84 \nmembers of the Senate who supported the legislation.\n  We had been warned by constitutional scholars and Internet experts \nthat the approach we were taking in the CDA would not stand up in court \nand did not make sense for the Internet. In the end, three district \ncourt panels and the Supreme Court all ultimately agreed in striking \ndown the CDA-I as an unconstitutional restriction on free expression.\n  Congress is about to make the same mistake again by including in the \nOmnibus Appropriations bill the ``Child Online Protection Act,'' or \n``CDA-II.'' I have spoken before, on July 21, 1998, about my opposition \nto a version of this legislation that was included, without debate, on \nthe annual funding bill for the Commerce, State and Justice \nDepartments.\n  My opposition to these efforts to regulate Internet speech should not \nbe misunderstood. I join with the sponsors of these measures in wanting \nto protect children from harm. I prosecuted child abusers as State's \nAttorney in Vermont, and have worked my entire professional life to \nprotect children from those who would prey on them. In fact, earlier \nthis month, the Congress passed the Hatch-Leahy-DeWine version of the \n``Protection of Children from Sexual Predator Act,'' H.R. 3494, to \nenhance our Federal laws outlawing child pornography. We should act \nwhenever possible to protect our children, but we have a duty to ensure \nthat the means we use to protect our children do not do more harm than \ngood. As the Supreme Court made clear when it struck down CDA-I, laws \nthat prohibit protected speech do not become constitutional merely \nbecause they were enacted for the important purpose of protecting \nchildren.\n  CDA-II makes a valiant effort to address many of the Supreme Court's \ntechnical objections to the CDA. Nevertheless, while narrower than its \nCDA-I predecessor, this legislation continues to suffer from \nsubstantial constitutional and practical defects. The core holding of \nthe CDA-I case was that ``the vast democratic fora of the Internet'' \ndeserves the highest level of protection from government intrusion--the \nhighest level of First Amendment scrutiny. Courts will assess the \nconstitutionality of laws that regulate speech over the Internet by the \nsame demanding standards that have traditionally applied to laws \naffecting the press.\n  The CDA-II provisions included in the Omnibus Appropriations bill do \nnot meet those standards.\n  CDA-II would penalize the posting ``for commercial purposes'' on the \nWorld Wide Web of any material that is ``harmful to minors.'' Penalties \ninclude fines of up to $50,000 per day of violation, up to 6 months' \nimprisonment and, under a separate section of the bill, forfeiture of \neligibility for the Internet tax moratorium. Like the old CDA-I, this \nnew provision creates an affirmative defense for those who restrict \naccess by requiring use of a credit card, debit account, adult access \ncode, adult personal identification number, a digital certificate \nverifying age, or other reasonable measures. This new criminal \nprohibition raises a number of constitutional and practical issues that \nhave been entirely ignored by this Congress.\n  First, the scope of CDA-II is unclear. The prohibition applies to \nanyone ``engaged in the business'' of making any communication for \ncommercial purposes by means of the World Wide Web. Vendors selling \npornographic material from Web sites are clearly covered, but also many \nother unsuspecting persons and businesses operating Web sites will \nlikely fall under this prohibition. Under new section 231(e)(2)(B) of \ntitle 47, U.S.C., ``it is not necessary that the person make a profit'' \nor that the Web site ``be the person's sole or principal business or \nsource of income.'' Does CDA-II cover companies that offer free Web \nsites, but charge for their off-line services? If CDA-II does not apply \nin that circumstance, would the measure have the unintended effect of \nencouraging the posting of ``harmful'' materials on the Web for free? \nDoes CDA-II apply to a business that merely advertises on the Web? Does \nCDA-II apply to public service postings sponsored by businesses on the \nWeb?\n  In the face of this uncertainty, entrepreneurs, small businesses and \nother companies who maintain a Web site as a way to enhance their \nbusiness may face criminal liability if they post material--for free, \nfor advertising, or for a fee--which some community in this country may \nperceive to be ``harmful to minors.''\n  Second, CDA-II adopts a ``harmful to minors'' standard that will \nlikely be found unconstitutional. CDA-II defines ``material that is \nharmful to minors'' as what the ``average person, applying contemporary \ncommunity standards,'' would find, taken as a whole and with respect to \nminors, is designed to appeal to the prurient interest, depicts in a \nmanner patently offensive to minors actual or simulated sexual acts or \ncontact, and lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific \nvalue. The provision further defines a ``minor'' to be ``any person \nunder 17 years of age.''\n  The ``17 year old'' age cutoff in CDA-II makes this measure \nsignificantly more restrictive than the ``harmful to minors'' statutes \nadopted in most states, including in my home state of Vermont. Most \nstate ``harmful to minors'' statutes restrict materials that would be \nharmful to minors under the age of 18. These statutes are interpreted \nto prohibit only that material which would be harmful for the oldest \nminor. Thus, by setting the age at ``under 17,'' CDA-II would prohibit \nmaterial on the Web that is inappropriate or harmful for 16 year olds. \nConsequently, CDA-II would impose more restrictions on the material \nthat can be freely accessible on the World Wide Web than most states \nimpose on materials available for sale in bookstores, news stands, and \nmovie theaters within their borders.\n  Yet, unlike books, magazines, movies or even broadcasts, where the \nvendor can control the physical places to which the material is \ndistributed, a person posting material on a Web site cannot restrict \naccess to only Internet users from certain geographic regions. Indeed, \nWeb site operators often cannot determine the region of the country, or \nthe world, from which users are initiating their access.\n  As a consequence, Web site operators will have to tailor the material \naccessible on their sites to content that would pass muster in the most \nconservative community in the country for children 16 years old and \nyounger. The standards of every other community would be discounted. \nThus, the bill's core effect will be to set--for the first time--a \nsingle, national harmful to minors standard for material on the World \nWide Web. Moreover, this standard will be more restrictive than those \nalready in place in most states.\n  This result runs counter to existing ``harmful to minors'' law as \narticulated by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has never approved \nof a single, national obscenity standard, nor has it approved a \n``harmful to minors'' statute based on a national, as opposed to local, \nstandard. On the contrary, the Supreme Court in Miller v. California, \n413 U.S. 15, 30-32 (1973), stated that:\n\n       our Nation is simply too big and too diverse . . . to \n     reasonably expect that such standards could be articulated \n     for all 50 States in a single formulation. . . . It is \n     neither realistic nor constitutionally sound to read the \n     First Amendment as requiring that the people of Maine or \n     Mississippi accept public depiction of conduct found \n     tolerable in Las Vegas, or New York City.\n\n  Reducing the material available on the Web to that which only the \nmost conservative community in the country deems to be appropriate for \n16-year-olds, could very well remove material that is both \nconstitutionally protected and socially valuable. The online \npublication of the Starr report, in whole or in part, Robert \nMappelthorpe's pictures, or PG, PG-13, and certainly R-\n\n[[Page S12795]]\n\nrated movies or TV shows would be suspect.\n  CDA-II provides an affirmative defense for online publishers of such \nmaterial that demand credit card numbers or other adult identification. \nA similar defense did not save CDA-I, however, and remains insufficient \nto reduce the significant burden on protected speech that the new \nprohibition imposes. The Supreme Court noted in analyzing this defense \nin CDA-I, that such a requirement would ```completely bar adults who do \nnot have a credit card and lack the resources to obtain one from \naccessing any blocked material.''' 117 S.Ct at 2337.\n  In addition to burdening the speech rights of adults, the Supreme \nCourt questioned the effectiveness of this defense in CDA-I to protect \nchildren, stating:\n\n     . . . it is not economically feasible for most noncommercial \n     speakers to employ such verification . . . Even with respect \n     to commercial pornographers that would be protected by the \n     defense, the Government failed to adduce any evidence that \n     these verification techniques actually preclude minors from \n     posing as adults. Given that the risk of criminal sanctions \n     `hovers over each content provider, like the proverbial sword \n     of Damocles,' the District Court correctly refused to rely on \n     unproven future technology to save the statute.'' 117 S.Ct. \n     at 2349-50.\n\n  The technology required to exercise the affirmative defense remains \npractically difficult and prohibitively expensive for many Web sites. \nAs a result, just as the Supreme Court found with CDA-I, CDA-II would \neffectively chill the publication of a large amount of valuable, \nconstitutionally-protected speech on popular commercial web sites such \nas CNN.com, amazon.com, or the New York Times online. As the Court \nrestated in its decision on CDA-I, ```[t]he level of discourse reaching \na mailbox simply cannot be limited to that which would be suitable for \na sandbox.''' 117 S.Ct. at 2346.\n\n  Third, CDA-II will be ineffective at protecting children. In \nevaluating whether the burdens that CDA-II will place on Web publishers \nare justified, we must take a realistic look at how well these new \nrestrictions will work to protect children from harmful online \nmaterials. As the Supreme Court noted, adult identification or \nverification techniques can be falsely used by children to gain access \nto forbidden material.\n  In addition, CDA-II is limited to activity on the Web, presumably to \ncapture the material that the Supreme Court believed was susceptible to \nuse of verified credit cards. Those of us who use the Internet \nrecognize that the Web is merely one of several Internet protocols, \nalthough the one most amenable to pictorial or graphic displays. \nLimiting the reach of this measure to the Web excludes newsgroups, FTP \nsites, e-mail, chat rooms, private electronic bulletin board systems \n(BBS), and gopher sites, where children may continue to access harmful \nmaterials. Indeed, I am concerned that the unintended consequence of \napplying CDA-II's ill-considered speech restrictions on the Web will \nsimply force Internet content providers and users to use or develop \nother protocols with which they would be able to exercise their First \nAmendment rights unfettered by the threat of criminal prosecution.\n  Those of us who use the Internet and the World Wide Web also \nrecognize that this is a global medium, not just a network under United \nStates control. Indeed, a large percentage of content on the Internet \noriginates outside the United States, and is as accessible over the Web \nas material posted next door. Objectionable material is likely to come \nfrom outside the United States and be unreachable by American laws.\n  The Justice Department, in a letter dated October 5, 1998, on CDA-II \nthat I would ask to be included in the record, stated, ``the practical \nor legal difficulty in addressing these considerable alternative \nsources from which children can obtain pornography raises questions \nabout the efficacy of the [CDA-II] and the advisability of expending \nscarce resources on its enforcement.''\n  The warning by the Justice Department that this measure will detract \nfrom current efforts to stop the distribution of illegal child \npornography has apparently gone unheeded by Congress. The Justice \nDepartment has made clear that CDA-II would ``divert the resources that \nare used for important initiatives such as Innocent Images,'' a \nsuccessful online undercover program to stop child predators and \npornographers. The work that the Justice Department has done in going \nafter the worst offenders, highlighted by the recent international \ncrack down on child-pornography, should not be diluted by broadening \ntheir enforcement load to embrace an unconstitutional standard.\n  Fourth, Congress simply has not done its homework to consider \nalternative effective means to protect children from harmful online \nmaterials. The Senate is considering CDA-II, including its creation of \na new Federal crime, as part of an omnibus spending measure. Until \nrecently the Senate had rules and precedent against this kind of \nlegislating on an appropriations bill. Under Republican leadership, \nthat discipline has been lost and we are left to consider significant \nlegislative proposals as part of annual appropriations. These matters \nare far-reaching. They deserve full debate and Senate consideration \nbefore good intentions lead the Senate to take another misstep in \nhaste.\n  The Congress has not held hearings on the CDA-II provisions before \nus. The Senate Commerce Committee hearing in February, 1998, elicited \nonly the testimony of this measure's primary sponsor about a prior \nversion of the bill, and no other testimony about its \nconstitutionality. The Congress has made only the most minimal efforts \nto determine whether technical tools or this measure would be the least \nrestrictive means of protecting children. There has been no study, no \ndiscussion, and no comparison of the effectiveness of various \napproaches, their likely impact on speech, and their appropriateness \nfor the Internet.\n  Ironically, CDA-II puts the proverbial cart-before-the-horse by \nenacting new speech restrictions at the same time the bill establishes \na ``Commission on Online Child Protection'' to study the technical \nmeans available to protect children from harmful material. While the \nselection of the members of this Commission is left solely to \nRepublican congressional leadership, we should at least hear from the \nCommission before legislating. As the letter from the Department of \nJustice advises, ``Congress should wait until the Commission has \ncompleted its study and made its legislative recommendations before \ndetermining whether a criminal enactment would be necessary, and if so, \nhow such a statute should be crafted.'' This approach would allow \nCongress to create a record on the most effective means to solve the \nproblem instead of passing an ineffective law.\n  In striking the CDA-I as unconstitutional, the Supreme Court \nspecifically cited ``the absence of any detailed findings by the \nCongress, or even hearings addressing the special problems of the CDA'' \nas grounds for its finding ``that the CDA is not narrowly tailored if \nthat requirement has any meaning at all.'' 117 S.Ct. at 2348. The \nCongress is repeating this mistake here, since it has again not \nestablished a record showing that the extraordinary restrictions on \nInternet expression proposed in the CDA-II are the least restrictive \nway to achieve our goal of protecting children online. Congress is \nrequired to establish such a record if it seeks to impose these sorts \nof burdens of the speech of our citizens.\n  Experts have told us that there are better ways to protect children \nthat have less of an impact on constitutionally protected speech, \nincluding the use of blocking and filtering tools that give parents the \nability to control access to harmful content both within and outside of \nthe United States. Harvard Law School Professor Larry Lessig, who is an \nexpert on both constitutional law and Internet law, has described at \nleast one less restrictive alternative--the use of voluntary ``kid \ncertificates'' online--that would have the same effect Congress is \ntrying to achieve while placing far less of a burden on free speech. I \nask that his letter be made part of the Record.\n  It is precisely because these less restrictive means exist, and \nbecause Congress has not shown otherwise, that the CDA-II is most \nlikely to fail in the courts.\n  Finally, there are constructive steps that Congress can and should \ntake. Although CDA-II would not solve the problems facing parents and \neducators on how to protect their children from\n\n[[Page S12796]]\n\nharmful and inappropriate online material, there are several steps that \nCongress could take which would prove more effective.\n  We should hear from the Commission on Online Child Protection that is \nauthorized in this bill to study the technical means available to \nprotect children from harmful material.\n  We should do more to protect children's privacy. The Omnibus \nappropriations bill contains a provision authorizing the FTC to require \nparental consent from children to give out personal information to Web \nsites aimed at children or where the age of child has been collected. \nThese privacy provisions have broad support and could be a way for \nCongress effectively and constitutionally to protect children online \nwithout detracting from the current mission of law enforcement.\n  We should not rush to legislate when non-legislative solutions may be \nmore effective and consistent with our constitutional principles. \nInstead of trying to create a national harmful to minors standard, \nCongress should encourage companies and non-profit organizations who \nhave responded to this problem with wide-ranging efforts to create \nchild-friendly content collections, teach children about appropriate \nonline behavior, and develop voluntary, user-controlled, technology \ntools that offer parents the ability to protect their own children from \ninappropriate material. Unlike legislative approaches, these bottom-up \nsolutions are voluntary. They protect children and assist parents and \ncare-takers regardless of whether the material to be avoided is on an \nAmerican or foreign Web site. They respond to local and family \nconcerns, and they avoid government decisions about content.\n  We can and must do better than CDA-II. This measure will do almost \nnothing to protect children from harmful material online, but will \ndivert Federal enforcement resources, restrict constitutionally-\nprotected free speech online and set a dangerous precedent for Federal \nregulation of the Internet. Perhaps worst of all, it will create the \nillusion of a solution. This Congress should not be in the business of \nlulling parents into a false sense of security while in fact doing \nnothing to protect children online.\n  Many members who have supported CDA-II are no doubt motivated by the \nsame thing that motivates me in this area: a desire to protect children \nonline. I am afraid, however, that we have not taken the time to craft \na legislative solution that will actually help solve this problem. The \nCongress has been put on notice that our approach will not work, and \nwill probably end up in court for yet another battle. We should not run \nanother ambiguous speech regulation up the flagpole and expect the \ncourts to salute. We owe it to the millions of Americans who use the \nWeb not to make the same mistake a second time.\n  Now, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Acting \nAttorney General Anthony Sutin from the Department of Justice and a \nletter from Harvard University Professor Lawrence Lessig in opposition \nto the Child Online Protection Act be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 5, 1998.\n     Hon. Thomas Bliley,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       This letter sets forth the views of the Department of \n     Justice on H.R. 3783, the ``Child Online Protection Act'' \n     (``the COPA''), as ordered reported. We share the Committee's \n     goal of empowering parents and teachers to protect minors \n     from harmful material that is distributed commercially over \n     the World Wide Web. However, we would like to bring to your \n     attention certain serious concerns we have about the bill.\n       The principal provision of the COPA would establish a new \n     federal crime under section 231 of Title 47 of the United \n     States Code. Subsection 231(a)(1) would provide that:\n       ``Whoever, in interstate or foreign commerce, by means of \n     the World Wide Web, knowingly makes any communication for \n     commercial purposes that includes any material that is \n     harmful to minors without restricting access to such material \n     by minors pursuant to subsection (c) shall be fined not more \n     than $50,000, imprisoned not more than 6 months, or both.''\n       Subsection 231(a)(2), in turn, would provide for additional \n     criminal fines of $50,000 for ``each day'' that someone \n     ``intentionally violates'' Sec. 231(a)(1); and Sec. 231(a)(3) \n     would provide for additional civil fines of $50,000 for \n     ``each day'' that a person violated Sec. 231(a)(1). \n     Subsection 231(b) would exempt certain telecommunications \n     carriers and other service providers from the operation of \n     Sec. 231(a)(1). Subsection 231(c)(1) would establish what is \n     denominated an ``affirmative defense'':\n       ``(1) Defense.--It is an affirmative defense to prosecution \n     under this section that the defendant, in good faith, has \n     restricted access by minors to material that is harmful to \n     minors--\n       ``(A) by requiring use of a credit card, debit account, \n     adult access code, or adult personal identification number; \n     or\n       ``(B) by any other reasonable measures that are feasible \n     under available technology.''\n       Subsection 231(e) would define, inter alia, the following \n     terms in the criminal prohibition: (i) ``by means of the \n     World Wide Web''; (ii) ``commercial purposes''; (iii) \n     ``material that is harmful to minors,'' and ``minor.'' See \n     proposed Sec. 231(e) (1), (2), (6) & (7). In particular, \n     ``material that is harmful to minors'' would be defined as:\n       ``. . . any communication, picture, image, graphic image \n     file, article, recording, writing, or other matter of any \n     kind that--\n       ``(A) the average person, applying contemporary community \n     standards, would find, taking the material as a whole and \n     with respect to minors, that such material is designed to \n     appeal to or panders to the prurient interest;\n       ``(B) depicts, describes, or represents, in a patently \n     offensive way with respect to minors, an actual or simulated \n     sexual act or sexual contact, actual or simulated normal or \n     perverted sexual acts, or a lewd exhibition of the genitals \n     or female breast; and\n       ``(C) taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, \n     political, or scientific value for minors.''\n       The Department's enforcement of a new criminal prohibition \n     such as that proposed in the COPA could require an \n     undesirable diversion of critical investigative and \n     prosecutorial resources that the Department currently invests \n     in combating traffickers in hard-core child pornography, in \n     thwarting child predators, and in prosecuting large-scale and \n     multidistrict commercial distributors of obscene materials. \n     For example, presently the Department devotes a significant \n     percentage of our resources in this area to the highly \n     successful Innocent Images online undercover operations, \n     begun in 1995 by the FBI. Through this initiative, FBI agents \n     and task force officers go on-line, in an undercover \n     capacity, to identify and investigate those individuals who \n     are victimizing children through the Internet and on-line \n     service providers. Fifty-five FBI field offices and a number \n     of legal attaches are assisting and conducting investigations \n     in direct support of the Innocent Images initiative. To \n     ensure that the initiative remains viable and productive, the \n     Bureau's efforts include the use of new technology and \n     sophisticated investigative techniques, and the coordination \n     of this national investigative effort with other federal \n     agencies that have statutory investigative authority. We also \n     have allocated significant resources for the training of \n     state and local law enforcement agents who must become \n     involved in our effort. To date, the Innocent Images national \n     initiative has resulted in 196 indictments, 75 informations, \n     207 convictions, and 202 arrests. In addition, 456 \n     evidentiary searches have been conducted.\n       We do not believe that it would be wise to divert the \n     resources that are used for important initiatives such as \n     Innocent Images to prosecutions of the kind contemplated \n     under the COPA. Such a diversion would be particularly ill-\n     advised in light of the uncertainty concerning whether the \n     COPA would have a material effect in limiting minors' access \n     to harmful materials. There are thousands of newsgroups and \n     Internet relay chat channels on which anyone can access \n     pornography; and children would still be able to obtain ready \n     access to pornography from a myriad of overseas web sites. \n     The COPA apparently would not attempt to address those \n     sources of Internet pornography, and admittedly it would be \n     difficult to do so because restrictions on newsgroups and \n     chat channels could pose constitutional questions, and \n     because any attempt to regulate overseas web sites would \n     raise difficult questions regarding extraterritorial \n     enforcement. The practical or legal difficulty in addressing \n     these considerable alternative sources from which children \n     can obtain pornography raises questions about the efficacy of \n     the COPA and the advisability of expending scarce resources \n     on its enforcement.\n       Second, such a provision would likely be challenged on \n     constitutional grounds, since it would be a content-based \n     restriction applicable to ``the vast democratic fora of the \n     Internet,'' a ``new marketplace of ideas'' that has enjoyed a \n     ``dramatic expansion'' in the absence of significant content-\n     based regulation. Reno v. ACLU, 117 S. Ct. 2329, 2343, 2351 \n     (1997). As the Court in ACLU suggested, id. at 2341 \n     (discussing Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629 (1968)), it \n     may be that Congress could, consistent with the First \n     Amendment, enact an Internet version of a ``variable \n     obscenity,'' harmful-to-minors prohibition, analogous to \n     state-law statutes prohibiting bookstores from displaying to \n     minors certain materials that are obscene as to such minors. \n     See, e.g., American Booksellers v. Webb, 919 F.2d 1493 (11th \n     Cir. 1990), cert denied, 500 U.S. 942 (1991); American \n     Booksellers Ass'n v. Virginia, 882 F.2d 125 (4th Cir. 1989), \n     cert denied, 494 U.S. 1056 (1990), Davis-Kidd Booksellers, \n     Inc. v. McWherter, 866 S.W.2d 520\n\n[[Page S12797]]\n\n     (Tenn. 1993). However, it is not certain how the \n     constitutional analysis might be affected by adaptation of \n     such a scheme from the bookstore context in which it \n     previously has been employed to the unique media of the \n     Internet. Because it may be more difficult for Internet \n     content providers to segregate minors from adults than it is \n     for bookstore operators to do the same, and because the \n     Internet is, in the Court's words, a ``dynamic, multifaceted \n     category of communication'' that permits ``any person with a \n     phone line'' to become ``a town crier with a voice that \n     resonates farther than it could from any soapbox,'' ACLU, 117 \n     S. Ct. at 2344, the Court is likely to examine very carefully \n     any content-based restrictions on the Internet.\n       The decision in ACLU suggests that the constitutionality of \n     an Internet-based ``harmful-to-minors'' statute likely would \n     depend, principally, on how difficult and expensive it would \n     be for persons to comply with the statute without sacrificing \n     their ability to convey protected expression to adults and to \n     minors. And the answer to that question might depend largely \n     on the ever-changing state of technology, the continuing \n     progress that the private sector makes in empowering parents \n     and teachers to protect minors from harmful material, and the \n     scope and detail of the record before Congress. In this \n     regard, it is notable that the COPA also would establish a \n     Commission (see Sec. 6) to study the ways in which the \n     problem could most effectively be addressed in a time of \n     rapidly evolving technologies. In light of the difficult \n     constitutional issues, we believe that Congress should wait \n     until the Commission has completed its study and made its \n     legislative recommendations before determining whether a \n     criminal enactment would be necessary, and if so, how such a \n     statute should be crafted.\n       Finally, the COPA as drafted contains numerous ambiguities \n     concerning the scope of its coverage. Such ambiguities not \n     only might complicate and hinder effective prosecution; they \n     also might ``render [the legislation] problematic for \n     purposes of the First Amendment,'' by ``undermin[ing] the \n     likelihood that the [bill] has been carefully tailored to the \n     congressional goal of protecting minors from potentially \n     harmful materials.'' ACLU, 117 S. Ct. 2344. Among the more \n     confusing or troubling ambiguities are the following:\n       ``(a) While the COPA mentions that minors' access to \n     materials on the Internet `can frustrate parental supervision \n     or control' over their children, Sec. 2(1), the only \n     `compelling interest' that the COPA would invoke as a \n     justification for its prohibition is `the protection of the \n     physical and psychological well-being of minors by shielding \n     them from materials that are harmful to them,' id. Sec. 2(2). \n     The constitutionality of the bill would be enhanced if \n     Congress were to identify as the principal compelling \n     interest the facilitation of parents' control over their \n     children's upbringing, in addition to the government's \n     independent interest in keeping certain materials from minors \n     regardless of their parents' views. See, e.g., ACLU, 117 S. \n     Ct. at 2341 (noting that the statute in Ginsberg presented \n     fewer constitutional problems than the Communications Decency \n     Act because in the former, but not the latter, parents' \n     consent to, or participation in, the communication would \n     avoid application of the statute).\n       ``(b) While the bill would not appear to apply to material \n     posted to the Web from outside the United States, that \n     question is not clear; and the extraterritoriality of the \n     prohibition might affect the efficacy and constitutionality \n     of the statute. See ACLU, 117 S. Ct. at 2347 n. 45.\n       ``(c) It is unclear what difference is intended in \n     separately prohibiting `knowing' violations (proposed \n     Sec. 231(a)(1)) and `intentional' violations \n     (proposed ``Sec. 231(a)(2)); and there is no indication \n     why the two distinct penalty provisions are necessary or \n     desirable. Moreover, it is not clear, in subsection \n     (a)(1), which elements are modified by the ``knowingly'' \n     requirement. For example, must the government prove that \n     the defendant knew that the communication contained the \n     harmful-to-minors material? That the defendant knew the \n     materials were, in fact, harmful to minors? Nor is it \n     clear what it would mean, in the context of distribution \n     of the targeted materials over the World Wide Web, to \n     violate subsection (a)(1) ``intentionally.''\n       ``(d) Proposed Sec. 231(a)(3) would provide for civil \n     penalties; but that section does not indicate how such \n     penalties are to be imposed and enforced--e.g., who would be \n     responsible for bringing civil actions. In this regard, we \n     should note that if Congress were to eliminate criminal \n     penalties altogether, in favor of civil penalties, that would \n     improve the likelihood that the statute eventually would be \n     found constitutional. See, e.g., ACLU, 117 S. Ct. at 2342 \n     (distinguishing the civil penalties upheld in the \n     ``indecency'' statute at issue in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, \n     438 U.S. 726 (1978), from the criminal penalties in the CDA).\n       ``(e) The titles of Sec. 3 of the bill, and of proposed \n     Sec. 231 of Title 47, refer to materials ``sold by means of \n     the World Wide Web''; and yet the prohibition itself does not \n     appear to prohibit merely the ``sale'' of harmful material, \n     although it is limited to communications ``for commercial \n     purposes.''\n       ``(f) One of the elements of the basic prohibition in \n     proposed Sec. 231(a)(1) would be that the defendant made the \n     communication ``without restricting access to such material \n     by minors pursuant to subsection (c).'' Yet subsection (c) \n     itself would provide that such a restriction of access is an \n     affirmative defense. This dual status of the ``restricting \n     access' factor appears to create a redundancy; at the very \n     least, it leaves unclear important questions regarding \n     burdens of proof with respect to whether a defendant \n     adequately restricted access.\n       ``(g) The COPA definition of ``materials that is harmful to \n     minors'' would be similar to the ``variable obscenity'' \n     state-law definitions that courts have upheld in cases (cited \n     above) involving restrictions on the display of certain \n     material to minors in bookstores. Those state statutes have, \n     in effect, adopted the ``obscenity as to minors'' criteria \n     approved in Ginsberg as modified in accordance with the \n     Supreme court's more recent obscenity standards announced in \n     Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 14 (19873). But the COPA's \n     definition would, in several respects, be different from the \n     definitions typically used in those state statutes, and the \n     reasons for such divergence are not clear. Is the definition \n     intended to be coterminous with, broader, or narrower than, \n     the standards approved in the cases involving state-law \n     display statutes? The breadth and clarity of the coverage of \n     the COPA's ``harmful to minors'' standards could have a \n     significant impact on the statute's constitutionality.\n       ``(h) Particular ambiguity infects the first of the three \n     criteria for ``material that is harmful to minors,'' proposed \n     Sec. 231(e)(6)(A).

(ii) It is unclear whether ``is designed \n     to'' is supposed to modify ``panders to,'' and, if not, \n     whether the ``panders to'' standard is supposed to reflect \n     the intended or the actual effect of the expression ``with \n     respect to minors.'' (iii) Which ``contemporary community \n     standards'' would be dispositive? Those of the judicial \n     district (or some other geographical ``community'') in which \n     the expression is ``posted''? Of the district or local \n     community in which the jury sits? Of some ``community'' in \n     cyberspace? Some other ``community''? Resolution of this \n     question might well affect the statute's constitutionality. \n     See ACLU, 117 S. Ct. at 2345 n.39.\n       ``(i) Must the material, taken as a whole, ``lack serious \n     literary, artistic, political, or scientific value'' for all \n     minors, for some minors, or for the ``average'' or \n     ``reasonable'' 16-year-old minor? See, e.g., American \n     booksellers, 919 F2d at 1504-05 (under a variable obscenity \n     statute, ``if any reasonable minor, including a seventeen-\n     year-old, would find serious value, the material is not \n     `harmful to minors' ''); Davis-Kidd Booksellers, 866 S.W. 2d \n     at 528 (same); American Booksellers Ass'n, 882 F.2d at 127 \n     (sustaining constitutionality of a state variable obscenity \n     statute after state court had concluded that a book does not \n     satisfy the third prong of the statute if it is ``found to \n     have a serious literary, artistic, political or scientific \n     value for a legitimate minority of normal, older \n     adolescents'').\n       ``(j) In the definition of ``engaged in the business'' \n     (proposed Sec. 231(e)(2)(B)), it is not clear what is \n     intended by the reference to ``offering to make such \n     communications.''

Must the person know that the material is posted \n     on the Web? That the material is harmful to minors? That he \n     or she ``cause[d]'' the material to be posted?''\n       In addition, we have concerns with certain facets of the \n     proposed Commission on Online Child Protection, which would \n     be established under Sec. 6 of the bill. The Commission would \n     be composed of fourteen private persons engaged in \n     business, appointed in equal measures by the Speaker of \n     the House and the Majority Leader of the Senate, as well \n     as three ``ex officio'' federal officials (or their \n     designees): the Assistant Secretary of Commerce, the \n     Attorney General and the Chairman of the Federal Trade \n     Commission. The principal duty of the Commission, see \n     Sec. 6(c)(1), would be:\n     ``. . . to conduct a study . . . to identify the \n     technological or other methods to help reduce success by \n     minors to material that is harmful to minors on the Internet, \n     [and] which methods, if any--\n       ``(A) that the Commission determines meet the requirements \n     for use as affirmative defenses for purposes of section \n     231(a) . . . ; or\n       ``(B) may be used in any other manner to help reduce such \n     access.''\n       If subsection (A) of this provision were construed to \n     permit or to require the Commission to ``determine,'' as a \n     matter of law, which methods would satisfy the affirmative \n     defense established in Sec. 23(c), it would violate the \n     constitutional separation of powers because most of the \n     Commission members would be appointed by congressional \n     officials and would not be appointed in conformity with the \n     Appointments Clause of the Constitution, article II, section \n     2, clause 2. Accordingly, we would urge deletion of the \n     portion of Sec. 6(c)(1) that follows the word ``Internet.'' \n     For similar reasons, we urge deletion of Sec. 6(d)(4), which \n     would require the Commission, as part of the report it \n     submits to Congress, to describe ``the technologies or \n     methods identified by the study that may be used as \n     affirmative defenses for purposes of section 231(c) . . .'' \n     (Even if such a delegation of responsibility to the proposed \n     Commission\n\n[[Page S12798]]\n\n     were otherwise permissible, it would be unwise, in our view, \n     as a matter of policy to permit the Commission--in essence--\n     to make such determination about a criminal offense.)\n       Thank you for the opportunity to present our views on this \n     matter. The Office of Management and Budget has advised that \n     there is no objection from the standpoint of the \n     Administration's program to the presentation of this report.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 L. Anthony Sutin,\n     Acting Assistant Attorney General.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           Harvard Law School,\n\n                                  Cambridge, MA, October 10, 1998.\n     Re H.R. 3783.\n\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I note that the Senate passed a version \n     of Congressman Oxley's H.R. 3783 earlier this year. On \n     September 11, I testified before the Subcommittee on \n     Telecommunications, Trade, and Consumer Protection, of the \n     House Committee on Commerce, at a hearing devoted to various \n     proposals for regulating access to material deemed ``harmful \n     to minors.'' Subsequent developments have convinced me that \n     the approach presently being considered is unconstitutional.\n       My view at that time, with respect to H.R. 3783, was that \n     while the idea of require adult IDs could in principle be \n     constitutional, the existing ID technologies would be \n     constitutionally too burdensome. Given other adult ID \n     technologies, the requirement (predominate in the statute) \n     that adult turn credit numbers over to pornographers in order \n     to get access to constitutionally protected speech struck me \n     as too great a burden.\n       Since my testimony, an argument by Professor Mark Lemley of \n     The University of Texas Law School, has strengthened my view \n     that there are serious constitutional problems with this \n     approach. Lemley proposes that rather than requiring adult \n     IDs, a less restrictive alternative would be a statute that \n     facilitated the development of kid IDs--digital certificates \n     that would be bound to a user's browser, but that would \n     simply identify the user as a minor. A law could then require \n     that servers with material deemed ``harmful to minors'' block \n     access by users with such certificates. Such certificates, \n     again, would reveal no information except that a user was a \n     minor.\n       Such a proposal, in my view, would be seen by a court to be \n     a clearly less restrictive alternative under First Amendment \n     jurisprudence. If so, the proposal would then render the \n     means proposed in H.R. 3783 unconstitutional.\n       While there are important details to be worked out in the \n     ``kid IDs'' alternative, I will note one other feature that \n     might be of interest. If kid IDs were generally available, \n     then Congress could more easily require commercial sites not \n     to gather data from kids. As it is, any rule that commercial \n     sites not gather data from kids would be hard to enforce. But \n     if such IDs became common, these other regulatory purposes \n     would be more easily achieved.\n       If there is more information that I can provide, please let \n     me know.\n           With kind regards,\n                                                  Lawrence Lessig.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suppose that it is appropriate that we \nare passing this bill just a week before Halloween. It seems as though \nwe have spent the better part of five days trying to unmask its \nprovisions. And, some of the sections have been like ghosts--first you \nsee them, now you don't.\n  I confess that I share the frustration voiced by many of my \ncolleagues yesterday from both sides of the aisle about this extremely \nunorthodox process. I suppose it is somewhat reassuring that Senators \non both sides of the aisle are similarly put off by the process because \nperhaps then we will not inflict it on ourselves or the American people \nnext year.\n  Let me start with the fact that, at least technically, it is out of \norder to authorize on an appropriations bill. We have from time to time \nbent that rule--sometimes quite liberally. But, today, we not only bent \nit, we smashed it to smithereens. I admit to having tried to amend \nappropriations bills with authorizations during my tenure in the \nSenate, but I am quickly coming around to the notion that we must get \nback to a stricter adherence to that particular rule of the Senate.\n  One of the reasons for this rule, in addition to being able to \ncontrol the appropriations process, is to ensure that the authorizing \ncommittees are not circumvented. The authorizing committees of the \nSenate have developed expertise on the various policy issues we must \nconsider and act upon, and I believe that we do not fully carry out our \nduty to citizens and taxpayers when we fail to vet thoroughly these \nproposed changes in law.\n  I am not talking only about the Judiciary Committee, although I do \nfeel strongly that we could have provided constructive input. The \nauthorizing committees play an important role in policy development.\n  And, I think it is essential that we assert right here and now that \nnational policy is not just about money. While the appropriations \naspects of Congress' job is certainly of utmost importance, the \nauthorizing process shapes the programs and establishes the rules for \nthe expenditure of federal funds. One function is as important as the \nother. I do hope that this major bypass of the authorizing committees \nwill not become habit-forming.\n  Second, we should all be concerned about the perception that this \nbackwards procedure--one in which we are considering conference reports \non bills that have not even passed the Senate yet--will set a precedent \nfor the future.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will \njoin me in a sweeping denunciation of this as anything other than a \none-time event. We cannot consider this omnibus, catch-all, 11th hour \napproach to be a model for how to extract ourselves from the dangerous \nprospect of an imminent government shutdown.\n  And, by the term``we,'' I also include the President of the United \nStates. I would like to send a message to President Clinton right now. \nDon't try playing this game of legislative chicken again. I may resolve \nmuch differently.\n  Third, while I appreciate the effort of Senators Lott and Stevens and \nothers to ensure that this bill does not make permanent changes in the \nbudget rules or lift the budget caps we so painstakingly negotiated in \nthe Balanced Budget Act, the bill before us takes the unheard of step \nof designating tax breaks as ``emergencies.''\n  While I strongly support the idea of tax relief--indeed, I have \nstrongly supported each one of the items in this tax package for \nfarmers--I am not so sure that we should be starting down the steep and \nslippery slope of using the emergency designation in this way. I hope \nthat we will all look at this as one-of-a-kind occurrence and not as a \nnew procedural loophole that we continue to use in the future.\n  Fourth, Mr. President, I am also disappointed by the fact that we are \nusing a portion of the surplus to pay for additional spending. I \nsupported the pledge of saving the surplus for Social Security and \nthought that we should move toward that goal. This bill, however, \nbreaks that promise.\n  Last January, one of the President's most memorable lines from his \nState of the Union speech was ``Save Social Security first.'' In \nreality, however, he has supported, practically insisted, on using that \nsame surplus for more government spending. I applaud Senator Lott and \nSpeaker Gingrich for keeping this encroachment on the surplus and \nSocial Security to a minimum.\n  I hope that during the next Congress, we can resurrect that \nbipartisan spirit of fiscal integrity and responsibility we shared to \nget the budget balanced in order to keep the budget balanced. If we \ncontinue to feed the voracious appetite of big government at the trough \nof the so-called surplus, we will not have that surplus for long.\n  If there is one thing that we should all be united in, it is \nmaintaining a balanced budget. This is perhaps the most important thing \nthat any Congress can do. It is critical for the future growth of the \nU.S. economy, increases in the standard of living for our workers, and, \nindeed, the very future of the country.\n  Mr. President, the unorthodox process is certainly one issue, but it \nis not the only or even the principal issue. There are substantive \nproblems with this bill as well.\n  Let me begin with a provision that is under the jurisdiction of the \nJudiciary Committee. I must speak out against inclusion of Title One of \nthe euphemistically entitled ``Citizens Protection Act.'' This ill-\nadvised provision passed the House as an amendment to the House \nCommerce, State, Justice Appropriations bill but it never passed the \nSenate. Indeed, it has been opposed by a bipartisan majority of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. Under the guise of setting ethical \nstandards for federal prosecutors and other attorneys for the \ngovernment, it will severely hamper the ability of the Department of \nJustice to enforce federal law and cede authority to regulate the \npractice of law by federal prosecutors in our federal courts to more \nthan fifty state bar associations. Indeed, this provision alone\n\n[[Page S12799]]\n\ncaused me to consider voting against this conference report.\n\n  The sponsor of this measure is Representative Joe McDade, a man who, \nby all accounts, was wrongly prosecuted by zealous federal prosecutors \nand who has been vindicated. I have great respect for Representative \nMcDade and sympathy for the objectives he seeks to protect.\n  Many in Congress and citizens around the country have been, at one \ntime or another, the subject of unfounded ethical or legal charges. No \none wants more than I to ensure that all federal prosecutors are held \nto the highest ethical standards. That is why the Judiciary Committee \nstaff met with Congressman McDade and his staff. That is why we \nproposed a more narrow, workable version of his ethics amendment. That \nis why I proposed that we establish a Commission to investigate alleged \ncases of wrongdoing by federal prosecutors and to make recommendations \nto Congress.\n  Unfortunately, the House Leadership and others did not accept my \nproposal. Instead, I fear that, in a understandable desire to redeem \nthose who have been wronged by zealous prosecutors, we have included a \nprovision which is far too broad.\n  In its most relevant part, the so-called McDade provision states that \nan ``attorney for the government shall be subject to State laws and \nrules . . . governing attorneys in each state where such attorney \nengages in that attorney's duties, to the same extent and in the same \nmanner as other attorneys in that state.'' This may sound innocuous, \nuntil one realizes why state laws and rules governing the conduct of \nattorneys exist in the first place--to protect the integrity of the \ncivil and criminal legal systems in the state and govern the practice \nof law in the courts of that state. It is this very purpose which makes \ninappropriate the blanket application to federal attorneys in federal \ncourt of all state bar rules.\n  The federal government has a responsibility and the legitimate lead \nrole in the investigation and prosecution of complex multistate \nterrorism, drug, fraud or organized crime conspiracies, or in rooting \nout and punishing fraud against federally funded programs such as \nMedicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. It is in these very cases that \nthe McDade provision will have its most pernicious effect.\n  Federal attorneys investigating and prosecuting these cases, which \nfrequently encompass three, four, or five states, will be subject to \nthe differing state and local rules of each of those states, plus the \nDistrict of Columbia, if they are based here. Their decisions will be \nsubject to review by the bar and ethics review boards in each of these \nstates at the whim of defense counsel, even if the federal attorney is \nnot licensed in that state. Practices concerning contact with \nunrepresented persons or the conduct of matters before a grand jury, \nperfectly legal and acceptable in federal courts, will be subject to \nstate bar review and, as a result, could put an end to some undercover, \nfederal investigations. And the very integrity and success of sensitive \ninvestigations could be compromised by the release of information \nduring the course of these reviews. This provision is also an open \ninvitation to clever defense attorneys to stymie federal criminal or \ncivil investigations by bringing frivolous state bar claims.\n  Mr. President, the McDade provision is opposed by Attorney General \nReno and by the Administration. It is opposed by a bipartisan group of \nsix former Attorneys General of the United States from the Nixon, \nCarter, Reagan and Bush administrations. It is opposed by the Director \nof the FBI, the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, \nand the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. It is \nopposed by law enforcement organizations such as the Fraternal Order of \nPolice, the National Sheriffs Association, the National District \nAttorneys Association and the Federal Criminal Investigators \nAssociation. The National Victims Center opposes it on behalf of the \nvictims of crime. And this provision is vigorously opposed by an \noverwhelming bipartisan majority of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the \ncommittee with jurisdiction over this matter. The Committee's Ranking \nMember Senator Leahy has opposed this provision. Former Committee \nChairmen Senators Kennedy and Thurmond, and Committee members Senators \nSessions, Kohl, DeWine, Durbin, Abraham, Feingold, Thompson, and \nFeinstein have also written in opposition.\n  I would note, however, that in response to our concerns, the \nLeadership has inserted a provision which will delay the implementation \nof this provision for six months. At the very least, this will give the \nDepartment of Justice and others the opportunity to educate the \nCongress as to the serious effect this blanket provision will have on \nlaw enforcement. It is my hope and expectation that, during the next \nsix months, we will be able to develop a more workable and effective \nsolution.\n  In addition, the so-called 100,000 Teachers program so trumpeted by \nPresident Clinton will do virtually nothing for Utah. As if the concept \nof this teacher hiring program would be any more effective than the \n100,000 cops program, we are appropriating $1.2 billion at the \ninsistence of President Clinton and under threat of government \nshutdown.\n  Well, Mr. President, Utah is continually disadvantaged by the use of \nthe Title I funding formula, which is how this money will be \npredominantly allocated among the states. Under this formula, we are \nyear after year punished for our demographics. We will be lucky to eke \nenough out of this grant to hire a handful of teachers per district. \nAnd, the irony is that Utah ranks among those states with the highest \naverage class sizes. This program claims reduction of class size to be \nits raison d'etre. I think not.\n  Furthermore, Mr. President, the President had an opportunity to \nreward states that were taxing themselves heavily for education and \nthat were addressing the needs of poorer and rural school districts \nwith state funds. Did he support an appropriation for the effort and \nequity component of the Title I formula? No, he did not.\n  And, what happened to ed-flex, one of the more innovative, albeit \ncommon sense, educational reforms we have seen in recent years? We are \ntold the President would have vetoed the bill with the ed-flex \nprovisions in it. I find myself resentful that I am in the position of \nbeing grateful for the limited flexibility that has been incorporated \ninto the Teacher program.\n\n  I do not mean to cast any aspersions on my colleagues, who I know \nworked very hard to keep some local control in this program and who \nsupport educational flexibility as much as I do.\n  But, I ask President Clinton: What is your problem with giving states \nand local school districts some authority to make decisions about \nresource allocation? Are you afraid that the state or the locally \nelected boards of education may have a different priority than you do?\n  I am most annoyed at this lost opportunity to give states and local \nschool districts some unrestricted federal assistance. There is no \nquestion in my mind that Utah could stretch the impact of federal help \nmuch further if given the freedom to make these determinations and to \npool resources more effectively.\n  In view of all of this, some have suggested that I vote against this \nbill. I will say that on the basis of a few of these provisions, I was \ntempted to do so.\n  But, there are also some very worthy provisions in the bill which \nmitigate its poorer aspects.\n  For example, I am pleased that the tax extenders package is included \nin this bill. Despite my dislike for the idea of inserting a tax bill \nin an appropriations bill, I am glad we are getting this done. These \ntax provisions should not be allowed to expire; in fact, we ought to be \nmaking them permanent so we would not have to face this annual \nexpiration crisis.\n  I am particularly pleased that the bill accelerates the deduction for \nhealth insurance premiums for self-employed people. It is about time we \ngave entrepreneurs a break on this.\n  I support the funding of the empowerment zones. This program is a \npowerful tool for revitalizing our urban areas; and I appreciate the \nfact that much of it is private sector driven.\n  Of course, the Interior Department appropriation, which is contained \nin the Omnibus bill, is critical to Utah. It contains funds for \nWashington County's desert tortoise habitat conservation program; the \nBonneville Shoreline\n\n[[Page S12800]]\n\nTrail; program development and facility construction at the Grand \nStaircase-Escalante National Monument; and a prohibition on funds to \nstudy draining Lake Powell or decommissioning the Glen Canyon dam.\n  While I am critical of the Administration's educational priorities, I \nsupport the additional funds for IDEA and Impact Aid. Utah, because of \nour heavy concentration of federal installations, will benefit from \nthis sizable boost in Impact Aid.\n  I am sincerely grateful to my colleagues on the Appropriations \nCommittee and in the leadership for their attention to the pressing \ntransportation needs in Utah as well as to the planning that is \nunderway for security at the 2002 Winter Olympic Games.\n  Staging this event is going to require a state-of-the-art \ntransportation system, including intermodel centers, light rail, an \nadequate fleet of buses, and intelligent transportation systems. This \nappropriation will give Utah the ability to move ahead in these areas.\n  Additonally, I am extremely worried about our defense. We have \nalarming reports that entire air squadrons are grounded for lack of \nspare parts to keep planes in the air. We are told that junior officers \nand experienced non-commissioned officers are packing up and leaving \nthe service, creating manpower and staffing problems in every branch of \nthe military.\n  Military readiness backs up diplomacy. The latter cannot succeed \nwithout the former. We simply must stop using the defense budget like a \nbank we can go to for spending offsets when we want them. We are \nrisking our nation's strength and ability to influence outcomes \nthroughout the world. And, what is more, if we do not properly maintain \nequipment, if we do not invest in new technologies, if we do not \nprovide adequate housing and medical care, we do not honor our men and \nwomen in uniform.\n  This bill begins the process of recognizing the importance of \nreinvesting in defense. I support the supplemental spending in this \nbill for defense, particularly the emphasis on readiness and personnel.\n  Some defense funds are also directed toward drug interdiction \nefforts. This is one of several positive actions taken in this bill to \nfight the war on drugs. Drugs are poisoning our society, particularly \nour children. Drugs contribute to a variety of other crimes, including \nmurders and robberies. We must not give up trying to eradicate this \ncancer from our communities, and I applaud the addition of these anti-\ndrug measures to this bill.\n  I remember when, more than a year ago, Speaker Gingrich, Congressman \nHastert, and I met to discuss how we might force this Administration to \nfocus on the worsening drug problem. We decided that we needed to \nundertake a comprehensive, bicameral effort. And so we did. We met with \nthe Administration, held numerous hearings, and worked in a cooperative \nmanner, extending our hands across the Capitol in a united effort to do \nwhat's best for our children.\n  I am pleased to say that our efforts have led to some success. A \nnumber of these important provisions were produced and considered by \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee. I want to express my pleasure with the \ndecision to include my proposal to reauthorize the Office of National \nDrug Control Policy. As well, I am pleased that we were able to include \nthe Drug Demand Reduction Act, a measure sponsored by Congressman \nPortman in the House. I was pleased to work with Congressman Portman on \ngetting this measure considered and put in a form which would pass the \nSenate. In fact, I recently introduced the Senate companion measure. \nFor all of those involved in the effort to include this important, \ncomprehensive anti-drug package in the bill--Speaker Gingrich; Senators \nCoverdell, Grassley, and DeWine; and Congressmen Hastert, McCollum, \nPortman and others--I want to express my congratulations and thanks.\n\n  Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that although there are some \nvery ligitimate things to complain about regarding the bill--and \nprocess is one of them--we must recognize as well as the bill is a \ncompromise. And, a compromise by definition means that neither side \ngets everything it wants.\n  If I were king, would I have put forward this bill? Certainly not. \nBut, I am not king, and neither is Senator Lott nor Senator Stevens. \nNeither is President Clinton nor Representative Gephardt.\n  The stakes in this negotiation were particularly high. We were in a \nsituation in which we were faced with an imminent shutdown of the \nfederal government and all of the confusion, disruption, and \ndislocation that entails. So, when asked by pundits why the Republicans \ndid not hold firm on a key issue like redirecting $1.2 billion in \neducational assistance to states and local schools with fewer strings \nattached, the answer is not difficult. Because in our system of checks \nand balances, the President has the veto pen.\n  Had we engaged in a war of wills, we could have held out for a \nperfect version of this educational component--a more perfect version \nof the entire appropriation--but the result would not necessarily be \ngood for the country. Maybe some day, the American people will reward \nRepublicans for being better statesmen than they are politicians.\n  Instead we negotiated a bill that is, indeed, a compromise. There are \nbeneficial elements to it. It is not all bad. I would like to commend \nthe Majority Leader, Senator Lott, and Speaker Gingrich for their \nefforts on this bill. Faced with a situation in which we could not act \non the regular appropriations bills individually, as we would all have \npreferred, he steered us through this negotiation in the best manner he \ncould. He deserves great credit, and he deserves our support.\n  How we ended up in this situation has already been addressed by \nseveral members on this side of aisle. Suffice it to say that it should \nnot be necessary to file cloture petitions on appropriations bill; it \nshould not be necessary to debate nongermane amendments ad infinitem. \nBut, regardless of how we ended up here, we have made the best of it, \nand, I believe, have finally delivered a reasonable appropriations \npackage.\n  It is always easier to criticize a compromise than it is to carve one \nout of disparate views and agendas. I have had some experience in this. \nI have often been criticized for a result that was not viewed as \nperfect or politically advantageous, even if it was fair or worthwhile.\n  This omnibus appropriation is not perfect. I dare say the Majority \nLeader would not say it is perfect. But, it is fair, and it is \nworthwhile. It is worthwhile because of the components I believe merit \nsupport, some of which I have advocated for years. It is also \nworthwhile because it will relieve the American taxpayers of the dread \nand uncertainty that the government will shutdown and of their anger \nand frustration that their government still doesn't get it.\n  It is worthwhile, I believe, because it is time to put the country \nfirst--ahead of the ``wag the dog'' diversionary strategy and ahead of \nseeking partisan advantage on election day.\n  Therefore, I will vote for this omnibus appropriations bill.\n\n\n             washington state's use of the word ``olympic''\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, a small but important element of the \nOmnibus appropriations measure is the Olympic and Amateur Sports Act \nAmendments of 1998, and more specifically, a provision within this Act \nthat recognizes that Washington state's claim to the name ``Olympic'' \nis both first in time, and first in right over the claim of the United \nStates Olympic Committee.\n  Vital geographic features that dominate and define the State of \nWashington, Mount Olympus in the Olympic Mountain range, within the \nOlympic National Forest on the massive Olympic Peninsula, were named \nlong before Congress chartered the USOC and permitted it to use the \nword ``Olympic'' to raise money to support the Olympic games and \nencourage the USOC's activities. In an opinion interpreting the current \nstatute, the United States Supreme Court noted that it was fair for \nCongress to allow the USOC to receive the benefit of its efforts to \npromote and distinguish the word ``Olympic.'' In the same vein, \nhowever, where the use of the word ``Olympic'' has geographical \nsignificance that pre-dates and is independent of the USOC, it is only \nfair that the USOC not be able to interfere with this use.\n  Although there are relatively few instances in which the USOC, crying\n\n[[Page S12801]]\n\n``mine, mine, mine,'' has gone after any of the thousands of businesses \nin Washington state that use the word ``Olympic,'' the attitude that \nthe USOC has displayed in these few instances demands correction. I \nwould like to thank State Representative Jim Buck for bringing them to \nmy attention. I am as much a sports enthusiast as the next person, and \nit has never been my intent to undermine the USOC's ability to raise \nmoney through licensing. The USOC remains a creature of Congress, \nhowever, and it is incumbent on us to prescribe reasonable limits--to \nremind the Committee that its privilege to the use of the word \n``Olympic'' is not absolute, and is secondary, for example, to the \nrights of geographic reference on the part of Washington state \nbusinesses. The provision that I have included in the Amateur Sports \nAct serves as a statutory admonition that the USOC must share the word \n``Olympic''.\n  The need for a reasonable restriction on the USOC, which I believe \nthis bill contains, is widely recognized in Washington state. On \nSeptember 25, The News Tribune wrote that we have ``produced a \nreasonable and narrow compromise that will protect Washington \nbusinesses and protect the USOC's legitimate concerns.'' The Seattle \nTimes concurred when it urged the Olympic Committee members to ``get \nover their Olympic-sized egos and support this modest and sensible \ntweaking of the law.''\n  Having just chastised the USOC for its past abuses, let me say that I \nam heartened by the assurances and commitments the Committee made \nduring discussion of my amendment, assurances that the past abuses were \nanomalous and inconsistent with USOC policy, and commitments that the \nUSOC will not abuse its privileges with respect to the use of the word \n``Olympic.'' I trust the Committee will live up to its promise to rein \nin its organizing committees and other affiliated entities' overzealous \npursuit of businesses using the name ``Olympic,'' even when there is no \nlikelihood that such use will be confused with the Olympic games or \nactivities of the USOC.\n  The language in the omnibus bill is narrower than what I had included \nin the bill that passed the Commerce Committee. The ``safe harbor'' \ncreated for Washington as a subterfuge to obtain immunity from USOC \naction, then quickly extend their business, goods, or services to other \nlocations, such as Salt Lake City, the site of the next Winter \nOlympics, with the intent of capitalizing on the games.\n  To allay the USOC's concerns, the final language creates a clear safe \nharbor for businesses using the word ``Olympic'' when they operate and \nconduct most of their sales and marketing west of the Cascades. This \nsafe harbor will remove the threat that hangs over the thousands of \nbusinesses in Western Washington--the threat that the USOC will deprive \nthem of the ability to continue to use the word ``Olympic.''\n  Henceforth, Olympic Cleaners in Kirkland, Olympic Auto Sales in Kent, \nOlympic Golf Repair in Port Angeles, Olympic Ambulance in Sequim, as \nwell as thousands of other businesses in Washington, can rest assured \nthat a creature of the Federal government, the USOC, won't come \nknocking to collect, not only their taxes, but their name.\n  Finally, I point out that the language is silent about what happens \nif the business using the word ``Olympic'' substantially extends its \noperations, sales, and marketing beyond Western Washington. It \ncertainly is not the intent of Congress to place Washington businesses \nusing the word ``Olympic,'' in a geographical cage that constrains \ntheir growth so long as the operations of these Washington businesses \ndo not wrongfully capitalize on the work of the USOC by confusing \npeople into making an association with the Olympic games, and not the \nOlympic Mountain range, Olympic Peninsula, or other geographic \nfeatures. No court should infer that, in creating the safe harbor for \nbusinesses in Western Washington, Congress intended in any way to \naffect the current law with respect to businesses operating outside of \nthis area. We did not.\n\n\n                   The North Pacific Pollock Fishery\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, after threatening to filibuster an \nappropriations measure over provisions relating to S. 1221, the \nAmerican Fisheries Act, I now want to emphasize my support of the \nsubstitute version of the American Fisheries Act that has been included \nin this mammoth bill.\n  It has been an unexpected privilege and a pleasure to work with, as \nopposed to against, the Senior Senator from Alaska and his staff on \nlegislation affecting the allocation and management of pollock in the \nNorth Pacific. Together, we have crafted a substitute measure designed \nto achieve the goals of his original legislation, which aimed to \nAmericanize and decapitalize the North Pacific pollock fishery. Not \nonly is this substitute, in my view, fundamentally more fair than the \noriginal S. 1221, it is considerably better in that it allows for new \nmethods of managing the largest fishery in the United States, methods \nthat promise to end the race for fish and to ensure that the \ndecapitalization is permanent.\n  Americanization, decapitalization, and rationalization. These were \nthe three things most participants in the pollock fishery said that \nthey wanted from legislation when I convened an industry meeting in \nSeattle during the August recess. To these goals, I added my own: no \nsummary elimination of foreign-controlled vessels without compensation, \nand the protection of independent pollock harvesters and processors.\n  Due largely to the perseverance of Senator Stevens, the consensus \nthat eluded the pollock industry in August was reached a month later. \nThe basic elements of the September accord called for increasing the \nU.S. ownership and control requirements for all fishing vessels; \narranging for the buy out by the onshore sector of a significant \nportion of the pollock catch and of nine Norwegian-controlled vessels; \nlimiting the amount of fish that any one company can harvest and \nprocess; and laying the groundwork for a new management scheme to \neliminate the race for fish by limiting participants in the pollock \nfishery and permitting these participants to decide in advance how to \ndivide the resource.\n  Translating the agreement-in-concept into legislation in the few \nweeks that remained in this Congress was a tremendous challenge. A \nmyriad of questions arose, and we attempted to answer them as best we \ncould with input from the participants in the pollock and other \nfisheries, state officials, North Pacific Fishery Management Council \nmembers, the National Marine Fisheries Service, the U.S. Coast Guard, \nthe Maritime Administration, Community Development Quota \nrepresentatives, and others.\n  As we progressed through various drafts of the legislation, we tried \nto anticipate and address issues like how to require and enforce \ngreater U.S. ownership and control of fishing vessels without \ndisrupting existing and future financing arrangements; the effects of \nthe transfer of fish from the offshore sector on the product mix; \nensuring that catcher vessels have sufficient input into the formation \nand conduct of fishery cooperatives; preventing the vessels being \nremoved from the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone from contributing to \novercapacity in other fisheries; and many, many others.\n  One of the most difficult issues is how to protect participants in \nother fisheries from possible adverse effects of ending the race for \npollock. Crabbers and other groundfish fishers are concerned that \npollock fishers who participate in cooperatives will spend more time \nand effort in other, already overcapitalized, fisheries. After \nconsidering various legislative proposals to limit effort in other \nfisheries, I believe we made the right choice to leave this task to the \nregional councils. Because the measures to end the race for fish in the \nonshore and mothership sectors will not go into effect until 2000, we \ndelegated to the North Pacific and the Pacific Fishery Management \nCouncils the responsibility of ensuring that the new cooperative \nmanagement regime provided for in this legislation does not \ndecapitalize and rationalize the pollock fishery at the cost of further \novercapitalizing other fisheries. For the offshore sector, which we \nanticipate will form cooperatives and stop racing for fish in 1999, \nbefore the regional management councils have an opportunity to impose \nrestrictions on these vessels, we prescribed limits on participation in \nother fisheries.\n  One of the questions for which we could not get a definitive answer \nis whether we have appropriated enough\n\n[[Page S12802]]\n\nmoney to cover the cost of the loan that will be used for the vessel \nbuy out. A critical element of this bill is the purchase of nine \npollock catcher processor vessels and their pollock fishing history. In \nexchange for being allocated significantly more fish, and permanently \neliminating these nine vessels from all U.S. fisheries, the onshore \npollock sector has agreed to pay $75 million to the vessel owners. This \n$75 million will be advanced as a loan by the federal government, and \nrepaid to the federal government by the onshore sector over a long \nperiod of time. This $75 million payment from the onshore sector to the \noffshore sector is supplemented in this bill by a $20 million federal \nappropriation, so that the total payment to the offshore catcher \nprocessors is $95 million. Of this amount, $90 million is to be paid to \nthe owners of the nine catcher processors being excluded. The \nadditional $5 million is to be paid to the catcher processors whose \nallocation is reduced even though their vessels are not removed.\n  Because the nine vessels are to be excluded and the allocation to \ncatcher processors to be reduced on January 1, 1999, we have provided \nthat the buy out payments to the owners and the catcher processors be \nmade before the end of 1998. To do this, we have appropriated the $20 \nmillion federal share of the buy out, and an additional $750,000 for \nthe cost of the direct loan of $75 million. The $750,000 is one percent \nof the loan amount, and is the amount that both NMFS and the Office of \nManagement and Budget believe is enough to cover the cost of the $75 \nmillion loan. Because this type loan is unprecedented, however, OMB has \nbeen unable to say with absolute certainty that $750,000 is the correct \namount.\n  If OMB determines that $750,000 is insufficient to cover the cost of \nthe $75 million loan, we expect OMB and NMFS to inform us of this \nimmediately, and to immediately secure sufficient funds to cover the \ncost of a direct loan of $75 million so that $90 million can be paid to \nthe owners of the nine excluded vessels before the end of this year. \nThese funds can be secured by reprogramming part of the $6 million \nprovided to NMFS to carry out the provisions of this Act.\n  Another question that has arisen recently involves the interpertation \nof the section that allows offshore catcher vessels to catch 8.5 \npercent of the pollock allocation reserved for these catcher boats and \nspecified catcher processors. We included this section to ensure that \nthe catcher boats delivering to catcher processors were not squeezed \nout of the sector. We anticipated that the fish caught by these catcher \nvessels would be delivered for processing only to the twenty catcher \nprocessors named in the bill as eligible to participate in the offshore \npollock fishery and eligible to participate in a cooperative, and we \ndid not intend for these catcher vessels to be able to increase the \npollock processing capacity by delivering their catch to catcher \nprocessors other than the 20 listed vessels.\n  But just as we did not have a definitive answer to the question of \nthe cost of the loan guarantee, we did not have answers to many of the \nquestions that arose from this proposal that so dramatically changes \nthe operation of the largest fishery in the United States: we will rely \nheavily on the expertise of the North Pacific Fishery Management \nCouncil and of NMFS, to flesh out many of the details of this truly \nrevolutionary legislation. Even without all of the answers, however, I \nbelieve that we made the right decision to seize a unique opportunity \nto Americanize, decapitalize, and rationalize this fishery, and, at \nlong last, bring peace to an industry whose internecine battles over \nthe years have led to the inefficient operation of the pollock fishery \nand caused a rift between Washington and Alaska.\n\n\n         The Montana Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1998\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of Title X of \nthe FY 1999 Omnibus Appropriations bill. I drafted this provision as a \nsubstitute amendment to S. 1913, the Montana Fish and Wildlife \nConservation Act of 1998, a bill that I sponsored and Senator Burns \nfrom Montana co-sponsored. I am pleased that this provision has been \nincluded in the Omnibus Appropriations bill.\n  As amended, the Montana Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1998 \n(now Title X) creates an exciting opportunity to exchange lands at \nCanyon Ferry Reservoir for other lands in Montana to conserve fish and \nwildlife, enhance public hunting, fishing, and recreational \nopportunities, and improve public access to public lands.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to thank my good friends \nand colleagues from Montana--Senator Burns and Congressman Hill. \nTogether, we have worked long hours on this project. We certainly would \nnot be where we are today if not for this team effort. I would also \nlike to take a moment to thank their staffs as well--especially Leo \nGiacometto, Ric Molen and Ryan Thomas from Senator Burns' office and \nMark Baker and Kiel Weaver from Congressman Hill's office. These staff \nmembers have logged long hours on this project and this accomplishment \nbelongs as much to them as to anyone.\n\n\n                          Legislative History\n\n  So that there will be no question as to the origins of this \nprovision, let me provide a brief history of this legislation. On April \n2, 1998, I introduced S. 1913, the Montana Fish and Wildlife \nConservation Act of 1998. Senator Burns joined me as a co-sponsor of \nthis legislation. This bill, like Title X of the Omnibus Appropriations \nbill, proposed to exchange 265 cabin sites at Canyon Ferry Reservoir \nfor public lands elsewhere in the state. Like the adopted provision, S. \n1913 proposed to accomplish this exchange through the use of a \npermanent trust that would hold the proceeds of the cabin site sale \npending acquisition of other lands.\n  While S. 1913 actually created two trust funds (one for local land \nacquisitions and one for land acquisitions elsewhere in Montana), Title \nX to the Omnibus bill simplifies this arrangement by creating one land \nacquisition trust, but then specifying that no more than 50% of the \nproceeds from this trust can be used outside of the local area in any \ngiven year. This trust arrangement is set forth in Section 1007 of \nTitle X.\n  On May 3, 1998, I held an Environment and Public Works Committee \nfield hearing on S. 1913 in Helena, Montana. That hearing was attended \nby over 200 cabin owners and sportsmen--all of whom overwhelmingly \nsupported the Montana Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act of 1998.\n  On May 22, 1998, Congressman Hill from Montana introduced a related \npiece of legislation in the House. Like S. 1913, H.R. 3963 established \na mechanism for the sale of the 265 cabin sites. Unlike S. 1913, H.R. \n3963 made no provision for the use of the proceeds from this sale.\n  Between May and August of 1998, these two bills received substantial \nattention in Montana. In early August, the Montana delegation sat down \nto craft a consensus bill. By mid-August, we had reached agreement in \nprinciple on a substitute amendment for S. 1913.\n  Under our agreement, we would use the land trust idea encompassed in \nS. 1913, but would add two provisions to provide additional benefits to \nBroadwater County, Montana. These provisions (sections 1005 and 1008 of \nTitle X) are designed to improve recreational opportunities in \nBroadwater County, without diverting any of the cabin site revenues \naway from the land acquisition trust.\n  After drafting legislative language to encompass this agreement in \nprinciple, I then sat down with Administration officials to gain their \nsupport for this legislation. In response to concerns voiced by \nDepartment of Interior officials and others in the Administration, I \nmade a number of substantive changes to this bill. One of these changes \nwas to add section 1009 of Title X to clarify the Bureau of \nReclamation's authority to improve public recreation and to conserve \nwildlife at Canyon Ferry Reservoir.\n  On October 10, 1998 after I revised the legislation to respond to the \nconcerns of the Administration, Jack Lew, Director of the White House \nOffice of Management and Budget, wrote to express the Administration's \nsupport for this new bill. Mr. Lew wrote: ``as amended, S. 1913 creates \na unique opportunity to exchange lands at Canyon Ferry Reservoir for \nother lands in the state to conserve fish and wildlife, enhance public \nhunting, fishing, and recreational opportunities, and improve public \naccess to public lands.'' Mr. President, I ask that the entire text of\n\n[[Page S12803]]\n\nthe OMB letter of support be printed in the Congressional Record \nfollowing this statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered,\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Soon after reaching an agreement with the Administration \non final bill language for a substitute to S. 1913, the House and \nSenate Appropriations Committees agreed to include this Act as Title X \nof the FY1999 Omnibus Appropriations bill.\n\n\n                         Provisions of Title X\n\n  Title X grew out of a decision made by the Bureau of Reclamation in \nthe late 1950s, soon after Canyon Ferry dam was completed near Helena, \nMontana. It was at that time that the Bureau decided to lease 265 cabin \nsites on the north end of Canyon Ferry Reservoir to local families. As \nconditions of their leases, the Bureau required the families to build \nand maintain cabins on these sites. In the intervening forty years, \nmany of these cabins have been expanded into full fledged houses, with \nyards, driveways and carports.\n  Mr. President, there are many things that the federal government does \nwell. I'm not sure that being a landlord is one of them. This intensive \nconcentration of cabin sites has led to on-going conflicts between the \nBureau and the cabin owners. Most recently, these conflicts escalated \nwhen the Bureau moved to raise rental rates for these cabin sites by as \nmuch as 300 percent. From the cabin owner's perspectives, this is an \ninequitable situation. They have invested time and money in these sites \nand yet live with the constant worry that their leases will be \nterminated and their cabin sites taken away.\n\n  To resolve these conflicts, Title X directs the Secretary of Interior \nto sell the 265 cabin sites at Canyon Ferry Reservoir in Montana in one \ntransaction to the highest bidder. The minimum bid for this transaction \nis set at the fair market value of all 265 sites, appraised \nindividually using standard federal appraisal procedures.\n  I would like to note that, while the appraisal process for rental \nrates has been a point of contention between the cabin owners and the \nBureau of Reclamation in the past, recently these two parties reached \nan accord for completing a joint appraisal for the purposes of setting \nrental rates. I applaud this cooperation and expect that the Bureau \nwill continue this agreement and this cooperation in appraising these \nsites for the purposes of this bill.\n  Title X contains protections to ensure that each cabin owner has an \noption to purchase their site from the highest bidder and to protect \nthe existing lease rights of each cabin owner. At the same time, Title \nX contains ample protections to ensure that the public gets a fair deal \ntoo.\n  Mr. President, the Bureau of Reclamation, the U.S. Forest Service, \nand other federal agencies lease cabin sites across the West. I would \nnot want to suggest that the solution contained in Title X is \nappropriate in each case where cabin owners have conflicts with the \nfederal government. To the contrary, I believe that the Canyon Ferry \nsituation is unique in a number of respects.\n  First, these are not isolated cabin sites around which the public and \nwildlife can move freely. At Canyon Ferry Reservoir, there are 265 \ncabin sites arranged in tight clusters. This is one of the largest \nconcentrations of residences on public lands in the West. This tight \npattern of development dramatically lowers the value of these sites to \nthe general public and largely precludes the use of the area by \nwildlife.\n  Second, in this case, the lessees were required to make improvements \nto their property and, in many cases, have gone so far as to build \nhouses on these sites. Many of these houses have now become primary \nresidences for local families. Though the federal government leases \ncabin sites across the West, few are occupied by families living year-\nround in their homes.\n  Even under circumstances such as these, however, I do not believe \nthat the federal government should support the sale of cabin sites. Mr. \nPresident, as a matter of principle, I am opposed to the sale of public \nlands. I believe that the sale of public lands threatens to establish a \ndangerous precedent that, over time, could erode our public lands \nheritage.\n  Let me be clear though--I am not opposed to trading lands with low \nvalue to the general public for lands that are important for fish and \nwildlife conservation or that are more accessible to the public.\n  Across the West, the federal government has recognized that land \nexchanges can be useful tools to allow the government to trade out of \nlands that have low values for the general public in order to acquire \nlands that are more accessible to the public or that are more important \nfor fish and wildlife. Just this year, Congress approved S.1719 to \ncomplete the Gallatin Land Exchange near Bozeman. I was the primary \nsponsor of that bill in the Senate and can say first hand that \nlegislation produced enormous benefits for the public.\n  I modeled the Montana Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act after this \nand other land exchanges to ensure that our public land heritage is not \neroded and to try to improve our public lands holdings.\n  Because public lands are important to Montanans and, indeed, to all \nAmericans. We take our children fishing on these lands. They're where \nwe hunt, hike, and recreate. We take our families out for picnics at \nthe local Forest Service campground and we ride our horses in the high \nalpine meadows. These lands serve as the backdrop for our homes and our \ncommunities. Mr. President, you might say that I'm a big fan of public \nlands, and that's why this bill is so important to me.\n  Title X directs the Secretary of Interior to sell 265 cabin sites at \nCanyon Ferry Reservoir in Montana. The proceeds from this sale are then \nplaced into a new trust called ``The Montana Fish and Wildlife \nConservation Trust.''\n  Title X very explicitly specifies the appropriate uses of the \nproceeds from this trust. The Act states that the trust is to ``provide \na permanent source of funding to acquire publicly accessible land and \ninterests in land, including easements and conservation easements, in \nthe State from willing sellers at fair market value to: a) restore and \nconserve fisheries habitat, including riparian habitat; b) restore and \nconserve wildlife habitat; c) enhance public hunting, fishing, and \nrecreational opportunities; and d) improve public access to public \nlands.''\n  Mr. President, these provisions are very important. First, this trust \nis dedicated to acquisition of land and interests in land in Montana. \nThe land-for-land concept is a critical component of this Act. To \nreiterate, this bill has been modeled after other land exchanges. By \nusing the intermediary step of a trust, however, we have created a new \nbreed of land exchange known as a ``bifurcated'' or ``land-trust'' \nexchange. It is my belief that this tool, by functioning as a permanent \nsource of funding, and by allowing for more targeted acquisitions over \ntime, may have benefits not found in the traditional land exchange \nprocess.\n  In commenting on an early debate over this provision, the Helena \nIndependent Record noted on July 9, 1998:\n\n       The problem here is the ideological question of public \n     land, of which they aren't making any more. While some feel \n     that almost any public land would be more productive in \n     private hands, backers of Baucus' bill believe that a public \n     land value should be sold off only in return for an equal \n     land value--not marinas or roads or other things that can, \n     after all, be funded in other ways.\n\n      Just as it is perfectly all right for the Forest Service to \n     trade off checkerboard landholdings, as long as the public \n     receives equal value, so selling the Canyon Ferry lease \n     sites is acceptable--so long as equal value land values \n     are received in return. . . . That's why it is the Senate \n     version that should be enacted into law.\n\n  Mr. President, I agree with this statement and endorse very strongly \nthe land-for-land concept embodied in this bill.\n  Second, it is important to note that the bill language makes clear \nthat this land trust is dedicated to the conservation and public \nenjoyment of Montana's fish and wildlife resources. The title of S.1913 \nand the purposes of Title X emphasize that this trust is established to \npromote fish and wildlife conservation. Similarly, the title of the \ntrust itself and the requirement in section 1007(c)(3)(B) that the \nmembers of the citizen advisory board have a dedicated commitment to \nfish and wildlife conservation should leave no question of the goals \nthat we are trying to achieve with this legislation.\n\n[[Page S12804]]\n\n  While the trust may be used to acquire land and interests in land to \nimprove recreation and access to public lands, it is the intent of this \nbill that the recreation and access provisions should be complimentary \nto, not contradictory with, the purposes of fish and wildlife \nconservation. Toward that end, it is my expectation that the members of \nthe citizen advisory board will recommend, and members of the federal-\nstate agency board will request, expenditures from this trust that meet \nboth the letter and spirit of this important bill. It is also the \nintent of this legislation that, under section 1007(e), lands acquired \nunder this substitute amendment will be managed in a manner that \npromotes fish and wildlife conservation.\n  Because the land-for-land and conservation principles are so \ncritical, this bill establishes a management framework for this trust \ndesigned to ensure that the trust is as effective as possible. The \npermanent trust is to be managed by a trust manager who is responsible \nfor investing the corpus of the trust and for ensuring that the \nproceeds from the trust are dispersed only in accordance with the terms \nof the bill.\n  Requests for dispersal must be submitted by a five-member board \nconsisting of representatives of the U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of \nLand Management, Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, \nand the Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks. The federal-\nstate agency board is directed to ensure that any requests for \ndispersal will meet the purposes of the trust. The bill intends that \nthe federal-state agency board will base its decisions regarding \nexpenditures from this trust on the trust plan compiled by a four-\nmember citizen advisory board.\n  The citizen advisory board contains a representative from a Montana \norganization representing agricultural landowners, a Montana \norganization representing hunters, a Montana organization representing \nfishermen, and a Montana nonprofit land trust or environmental \norganization. Each of these members is to have a demonstrated \ncommitment to improving public access to public lands and to fish and \nwildlife conservation.\n  Mr. President, this citizen advisory board is integral to the proper \nfunctioning of this legislation. It is my intent that this group of \ncitizens should play a very active role in identifying critical \nproperties for acquisition and in setting the priorities of this trust.\n  Because this trust is intended to supplement, not supplant, regular \nLand and Water Conservation Fund expenditures, I do not expect that the \nfederal agencies' priority list for LWCF expenditures will govern the \nexpenditures from this trust.\n  Rather, it is the intent of this legislation that the citizen \nadvisory board will take an independent look at land acquisition needs \nin Montana as they craft and update the trust plan. The legislation \nintends that the federal-state agency board will rely heavily on \ndirection set by the citizen group and the trust plan and contemplates \nthat the two boards will work hand-in-hand together. The legislation \nalso requires the trust manager to consult with the citizen advisory \nboard to ensure that expenditures from the trust are strictly limited \nto those authorized by this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to take a moment to comment on a \nnumber of additional provisions in this substitute amendment. First, \nsection 1004(b)(3)(C) provides that restrictive covenants will be \nplaced on deeds to the cabin sites at the time of transfer to ensure \nthe maintenance of both existing and adequate public access to and \nalong the shoreline of Canyon Ferry Reservoir and to restrict future \nuses of these properties to the ``type and intensity of uses in \nexistence on the date of enactment of this Act, as limited by the \nprohibitions contained in the annual operating plan of the Bureau of \nReclamation for the Reservoir in effect on October 1, 1998.''\n  These provisions were very important to the Administration to ensure \nthat the privatization of these sites does not diminish the values of \nadjacent public lands. It is important that lands acquired in an \nexchange have public values at least equal to those traded away. It is \nequally important to ensure that the lands that are traded out of the \nfederal estate do not compromise the values of adjacent public or \nprivate lands. I would also like to note the distinction between \nprotecting ``existing'' and ensuring ``adequate'' access. These \nprovisions were added to ensure that the public continues to have \naccess to and along the shore of Canyon Ferry Reservoir and, where \naccess is not currently adequate, to ensure that such access is \nimproved.\n  I want to note, however, that the historical use restriction is not \nintended to require cabin owners to remove or modify structures that \nwere in existence on the date of this Act. As noted in the letter from \nOMB that I mentioned earlier, this provision ensures that subsequent \nowners of these properties will ``preserve the existing character of \nthis area.'' Quite simply, it is the intent of this bill that this area \nshould not be turned into another Lake Tahoe Resort. However, it is \nalso the intent of this bill that the historical use provision should \nnot unduly burden the cabin owners by requiring new limitations on the \ntype and intensity of uses that are allowed on these sites.\n  Second, section 1004(d)(2)(A) specifies that, if the Canyon Ferry \nRecreation Association (``CFRA'') submits the highest bid for these \ncabin sites, the Secretary will sell a cabin site to a lessee, if he \nreceives a purchase request from that lessee. Section 1004(d)(2)(D) \nprovides that CFRA and the lessees must purchase at least 75 percent of \nthe properties by August 1 of the year following the first sale of a \ncabin site. Section 1004(d)(2)(E) provides that the Secretary shall \ncontinue to lease the cabin sites to those lessees who have not \npurchased their sites by that time.\n  While this is a complex arrangement, the intent should be clear. It \nis the intent of this bill that every cabin owner have an opportunity \nto purchase their lot so long as they are leasing from the Bureau of \nReclamation. This bill requires that, if CFRA submits the highest bid \nfor these sites, CFRA will purchase at least 75% of the lots by August \n1 of the year following the first sale of a cabin site. CFRA's \nobligation to purchase 75% of the lots is, of course, offset by sites \nthat have been purchased by individual cabin owners by that time.\n  It is further the intent of this bill that the Bureau should continue \nto lease to remaining cabin owners who have not purchased by that time, \nand that the Bureau should continue to provide each lessee with the \noption of purchasing their site so long as they continue to lease their \nsite from the Bureau. It is important to note that, once CFRA submits \nthe highest bid, section 1004(d)(2)(g) requires that all rental revenue \nfrom the cabin sites will be distributed to the Fish and Wildlife \nConservation Trust and to reduce the Pick-Sloan debt as set forth in \nsection 1006 of the bill.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Mr. President, this bill is the result of exhaustive negotiations \nbetween local citizens, wildlife groups, county commissioners, the \ncabin owners, the Montana delegation and, most recently, the \nAdministration. I am pleased that we have been able to reach a broad \nconsensus on this matter and I support its inclusion as Title X of the \nOmnibus Appropriations bill.\n  Again, in closing, I would like to thank Senator Burns and \nCongressman Hill for their work on this important effort--I look \nforward to working together on many more such collaborative efforts.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of Management \n           and Budget,\n                                 Washington, DC, October 10, 1998.\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Baucus: I am writing to express the \n     Administration's support for your substitute amendment to S. \n     1913, the Montana Fish and Wildlife Conservation Act. As \n     amended, S. 1913 creates a unique opportunity to exchange \n     lands at Canyon Ferry Reservoir for other lands in the state \n     to conserve fish and wildlife, enhance public hunting, \n     fishing, and recreational opportunities, and improve public \n     access to public lands.\n       We would like to commend you for your leadership in \n     vigorously pursuing legislation that promotes conservation \n     and for the cooperation shown by you and your staff in \n     working with us to address our concerns.\n       As you know, S. 1913 directs the Secretary of the Interior \n     to sell the affected Federal properties around Canyon Ferry \n     Reservoir as a single block. Although, as a general rule, we \n     believe the Secretary of the Interior\n\n[[Page S12805]]\n\n     should have administrative discretion as to how such a \n     transaction should occur, we believe that the procedures \n     contained in the Baucus substitute amendment are acceptable \n     given the unique situation of this property.\n       The substitute also includes a number of provisions that we \n     feel are necessary for the Administration's support of this \n     bill. First, it is our understanding that you have made the \n     changes that we have requested to the bill's land appraisal \n     procedures to ensure a fair and accurate appraisal of market \n     value of the properties to be sold and to avoid creating \n     opportunities for needless litigation. Second, the bill \n     ensures that subsequent owners of these properties will \n     maintain public access to Canyon Ferry Reservoir and preserve \n     the existing character of this area. And, third, this \n     substitute amendment preserves the ability of the Secretary \n     to manage Canyon Ferry Reservoir for its Congressionally \n     authorized purposes.\n       We believe that this legislation, with the changes noted \n     above, will enhance public recreation and fish and wildlife \n     opportunities for this area while protecting Federal \n     interests in the operation and management of the Canyon Ferry \n     Project.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Jacob J. Lew,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to state my opposition to the \nomnibus appropriations bill, and outline some of my concerns with both \nthe content of that measure, and with the process in which it was \ncrafted.\n  First and foremost, Mr. President, this omnibus appropriations bill \nshreds the tough spending limits established by last year's bipartisan \nbudget agreement. It does so through the expedient of declaring nearly \n21 billion dollars in spending as a budget emergency, thus exempting \nthat spending from the spending caps and budget discipline that was so \ncentral to last year's budget agreement.\n  Mr. President, as I have noted on the floor previously, the emergency \nexception to our budget rules was intended to allow Congress to act \nquickly to provide funding to assist victims of natural disasters or to \nhelp ensure an adequate and timely response to an international crisis. \nSadly, that exception has now become the rule, and we now see emergency \ndeclarations attached to appropriations provisions not because those \nprovisions were unexpected or urgent, but because doing so permitted \nCongress to duck its budget responsibilities.\n  That is a gross abuse of the emergency provisions incorporated in our \nbudget rules, and it must stop.\n  Mr. President, of particular concern is the use of the emergency \nexception to add funds to an already bloated defense budget.\n  Mr. President, the only emergency in our defense readiness is the \nsorry state of posturing by Congress for more defense spending. Some \nMembers insist Congress must throw more money into the Department of \nDefense, even when our military leaders say they don't need it.\n  But, Mr. President, the Pentagon does not need more money. The money \ngoing to the Pentagon needs to be spent more wisely. Unfortunately, too \noften Congress does everything in its power to make sure that does not \nhappen.\n  Congress continues to spend billions of dollars on pork-barrel \nprojects that the Pentagon does not need and does not want. Congress \nbars the closing of unnecessary bases, and refuses to address \naccounting fraud so destructive that Senator Grassley recently stated \nthat, ``If we put adequate controls on the money we have, there should \nbe no need for more defense spending.''\n  Last week, Mr. President, the Washington Post reported there were at \nleast 30 items that appeared for the first time in the fine print of \nthe $250 billion defense spending bill. These included: $250,000 to \nstudy the potential uses of a caffeinated gum, reportedly slipped into \nthe defense spending bill by a Member of the other body on behalf of \nthe firm in his Illinois district that makes this gum; $2.4 million for \na device called the American Underpressure System, reportedly another \nlate addition to the defense spending bill pushed by the San Diego \nbusinessman who holds the patent on the device; and, $5 million to fund \nthe purchase of electronic locks manufactured by a Kentucky firm, \nreportedly added by a member of that State's delegation to the defense \nspending bill during conference deliberations. The Washington Post \nstory reported the Kentucky lockmaker was able to obtain still another \nearmark in the Energy Department spending bill for $2 million.\n  Mr. President, this practice is an outrage, but one many in both \nchambers choose to ignore, or, worse, perpetuate. If we cut the pork \nand allowed the Pentagon to close inefficient bases, we would not even \nneed to discuss so-called emergency spending for defense.\n  Among the most abusive uses of the emergency exception in the defense \nbudget is the proposed $1.9 billion in funding for U.S. troops in \nBosnia.\n  Mr. President, I have always had serious questions about U.S. \ninvolvement in this mission. I was the only Democrat to vote against \nthe deployment of U.S. troops back in 1995, in large part because I did \nnot believe that the United States would be able to complete the \nmission in the time projected and for the price tag that was originally \nestimated. Unfortunately, I have been proven right, and I take no \npleasure in it.\n  U.S. forces have now been in Bosnia for almost three years, much \nlonger than the original one-year mandate, and I do not think anyone \nhas a good idea how many more years we will be there. More \nsignificantly, the cost of our involvement in Bosnia has increased \ndramatically--easily more than quadrupling the original $2 billion \nestimate to more than $8 billion, not including the $1.9 billion now \nproposed to be added by the omnibus appropriations measure.\n  But beyond the strict policy concerns of our mission in Bosnia, Mr. \nPresident, is the troubling budget maneuvering that has been done to \nadd still more funding to this questionable mission.\n  Mr. President, the funding for the Bosnia mission will not be forced \nto comply with our budget caps. The additional $1.9 billion provided in \nthis bill is designated as emergency funding.\n  Mr. President, our Bosnia mission can hardly be characterized as an \nunexpected event, something deserving of emergency funding. Far from \nit. Our mission in Bosnia is a substantial, long-term commitment. It is \nsomething the United States has, for better or worse, decided to do for \nthe long-term.\n  Webster's New Collegiate Dictionary defines the word ``emergency'' as \nfollows: ``an unforeseen combination of circumstances or the resulting \nstate that calls for immediate action.''\n  This definition clearly does not apply to the Bosnia mission. The \nBosnia mission is an emergency only in the strange language of \nappropriations bills. The Bosnia ``emergency'' is a legislative \nfiction.\n  U.S. troops have been on the ground in Bosnia for nearly three years. \nIn December of 1997 the President announced that he would forego \nimposing a deadline altogether, and opt instead for a policy of \nbenchmarks whose definitions remain open to interpretation.\n  Given that policy, Mr. President, how can Congress and the President \npossibly argue to the American people that the additional costs for the \nBosnia mission constitute an emergency? On the contrary, it has been \nclear for quite a while now that the cost of this mission would again \nrise substantially. Some would say it has been clear from the start.\n  Ironically, Congressional appropriators and our military leaders have \nplanned for many months on obtaining these so-called emergency funds.\n  Mr. President, the mission in Bosnia does not represent an emergency \nthat legitimately calls for us to depart from our established, vital \nbudget rules.\n  Mr. President, as I noted, the Bosnia funding is only one example. \nWhat compounds this dangerous trend away from budget discipline is the \nreported evolution of much of the emergency spending. In particular, it \nhas been reported that the negotiations surrounding the omnibus \nappropriations bill at one point centered on the insistence of some \nthat for every emergency dollar added for one group of programs, \nanother had to be added for a different set of programs. Essentially, \nthe budget negotiation became a bidding contest in which deficit-\nfinanced spending was the currency.\n\n  This brings me to my second serious objection to the measure before \nus, namely the process by which it was crafted.\n  Mr. President, continuing resolutions and omnibus appropriations are \nfast becoming the standard process in Congress. Deliberate, careful, \nand open\n\n[[Page S12806]]\n\nconsideration of agency budgets, with the full participation of \neveryone's elected representatives in a public forum has been shunted \naside, and instead we have a process of back room deals by a powerful \nfew.\n  Mr. President, that is not democracy in action, and it rewards those \nwell-funded, well-connected special interests that already distort the \npolicy agenda of the Federal government.\n  We should not be surprised, then, when dozens of special interest \nearmarks and policy riders find their way into the omnibus measure with \nlittle or no public debate.\n  The normal appropriations process is already tainted to a great \nextent with this kind of influence. The closed door dealings in which \nthis legislation was developed only make that problem worse.\n  A telling example of the policy that can result from this flawed \nprocess is the language delaying implementation of the most modest of \nreforms in our nation's dairy policy.\n  Language included in this omnibus measure extends USDA's rulemaking \nperiod on Federal Milk Marketing Order reform for six months. This \nextension will delay implementation of the new federal milk pricing \nsystem to October of 1999, instead of the original date of April, 1999 \nset in the Farm Bill. Mr. President, officials at USDA have assured me \nthat they did not request this extension nor do they need it.\n  Mr. President, this dairy provision was included solely to intimidate \nand bully USDA and Secretary Glickman into an anti-Wisconsin dairy \npricing reform. Instead of allowing USDA to do its job, some Members of \nCongress want to do it for them, and do it to benefit their own \nproducers at the expense of dairy farmers in the Upper Midwest.\n  It is ridiculous that today, in times of advanced technologies, \nWisconsin producers receive a Class I differential of $1.20 per \nhundredweight, while producers in Kansas City, Missouri receive $1.92, \nand our friends in Miami get $4.18. Dairy farmers in Miami make nearly \n$3.00 more per hundredweight than farmers in the Upper Midwest for the \nsame product. The current system just does not make sense in today's \nworld.\n  The extension of USDA's rulemaking had another intent as well. \nExtending the rulemaking period automatically extends the life of the \nNortheast Interstate Dairy Compact. The 1996 Farm Bill requires a \nsunset of the Compact when the new federal pricing system is \nimplemented. At the rate Congress is going, tacking this issue onto \nappropriations bills, there is no telling when implementation will now \noccur.\n  The effects of the Compact on consumers within the region and \nproducers outside of it are indisputable. Dairy compacts are harmful, \nunnecessary and a burden to this country's taxpayers.\n  The worst part of this entire sixty-five-year dairy fiasco is its \neffect on the producers in the Upper Midwest. The six-month extension \nputs an additional 900 Wisconsin producers at risk. Wisconsin loses \napproximately three dairy farmers a day. Producers cannot stand six \nmore days of the current program, let alone six more months.\n  Mr. President, not only is legislating dairy policy on this bill \ninappropriate, it is bad precedent, it circumvents the appropriate \ncommittees, the Agriculture and Judiciary Committees, and circumvents \nUSDA's authority. We ought to give USDA the opportunity to do the right \nthing for today's national dairy industry and put an end to the unfair \nEau Claire system now, not six months from now.\n  Mr. President, once again I urge my colleagues to take a second look \nat this antiquated and harmful policy. Stand up for equity, fairness, \nand for what is best for America's dairy industry, our consumers and \nour taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, the omnibus measure is also the vehicle for a number \nof anti-environment riders. Here again, by burying these provisions in \nthis mammoth appropriations bill, those promoting these anti-\nenvironmental provisions are able to avoid full and open debate of \ntheir proposals. They succeed in avoiding a separate vote on matters \nthat are quite controversial.\n  That is the nature of this kind of bill and this kind of process, Mr. \nPresident. An unamendable, ``must pass'' bill inevitably will be a \nmagnet for proposals that cannot stand up to the scrutiny of open \ndebate.\n  Mr. President, some may blame the nature of the annual budget process \nfor putting Congress in the position of having to pass an omnibus \nappropriations bill. Some might suggest the inability to pass all the \nappropriations bills in a timely manner is inherent in the annual \nbudget process, and in this regard I am certainly willing to give the \nbiennial budget process a try. I was pleased to cosponsor the measure \noffered by the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Domenici) to move to a \nbiennial process.\n  But the annual budget process is not the central problem. The central \nproblem is the corrupting influences that permeate the entire \npolicymaking environment, from our system of campaign finance, to the \nproblems of revolving door hiring practices, to the inadequate lobbying \nand gift restrictions on Members.\n  And the incentives in such a corrupting environment all encourage \njust this kind of process--back room negotiations, among only a few \npowerful people, with little or no outside input or public scrutiny.\n  Mr. President, as this bill so graphically demonstrates, until the \nSenate and the other body do something to address that underlying \nproblem, Congress cannot be trusted even to abide by the spending \nlimits to which it agreed only a year ago.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support this legislation because it \nwill help millions of families across the country. One of the most \nimportant provisions offers urgently needed aid to communities to \nimprove their public schools. Democrats worked effectively to provide \nfunds for more teachers and smaller classes, and these efforts were \nsuccessful. The result is that assistance is on the way for this \nimportant aspect of school reform.\n  The bill provides $1.2 billion on the current fiscal year for this \nvital initiative to reduce class sizes in the nation's public schools. \nThis is the first installment in an ongoing effort to help schools \nthroughout the nation hire 100,000 more teachers, so that all students \nwill get the attention they need in school to succeed in life.\n  The bill also contains a major literacy initiative that will provide \n$260 million to help children learn to read well by the end of the \nthird grade. It's a strong response to President Clinton's America \nReads Challenge, and it makes a significant additional victory for \neducation reform.\n  In addition, the legislation includes $871 million for summer jobs \nfor disadvantaged youth. For many of these youth, summer jobs are their \nfirst opportunity to work and their first step in learning the work \nethic.\n  This legislation also fully funds the Youth Opportunity grants \nestablished by the Workforce Investment Act signed into law in August. \nThis innovative new program will offer education and career \nopportunities for teenagers most at risk and living in the poorest \ncommunities.\n  The bill also contains the level of funding recommended by President \nClinton for Head Start and after-school programs. These programs are \nvital to children across the country, and these funds are urgently \nneeded.\n  Another key part of this bill provides much needed assistance for \nhome health care for senior citizens and persons with disabilities \nunder Medicare. In 1997 in Massachusetts, approximately 150 home health \nagencies cared for 125,000 Medicare beneficiaries. But the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997 contained provisions that led to an unintended 15 \npercent reduction in reimbursement for the state's home health \nproviders. That reduction translated into a $110 million cut this year \nfor providers across the state. Ten home health agencies in \nMassachusetts have closed their doors since January 1--in part due to \nthe unanticipated consequences of the 1997 Act.\n  Last February, Congressman Jim McGovern of Massachusetts and I \nintroduced legislation to remedy this problem, and I am pleased that \nthis bill achieves our goal. No senior citizens or persons with \ndisabilities who depend on Medicare for home health services should \nhave to worry that health care won't be available when they need it \nmost.\n  By delaying a forthcoming reduction in payments and by improving the \nformula for reimbursements, this bill enables home health agencies to \nprovide\n\n[[Page S12807]]\n\nthe medical care needed for patients to stay in their own homes and \ncommunities, and out of hospitals and nursing homes. All of us who are \nconcerned about this issue welcome the progress we have made, and we \nwill continue to do all we can to see that home health care is widely \navailable to those who need it in our states.\n  The legislation also makes important changes in the immigration laws. \nIt temporarily increases the number of visas available to skilled \nforeign workers to meet the demands of colleges, and the high-tech \nindustry. It also contains a substantial investment to improve job \ntraining and educational opportunities for U.S. workers and students.\n  In addition, the bill ensures that the 49,000 Haitians who came to \nthis country fleeing persecution will have the opportunity to apply for \nasylum to remain in the United States permanently. The bill also \nprovides $171 million for naturalization activities. Without this \nsupport, the processing of naturalization applications would fall even \nfarther behind.\n  The legislation also takes a major step toward more effective \nenforcement of the civil rights laws. For the first time in many years, \nthe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission will receive the level of \nfunds needed to fulfill its important mission.\n  In many other respects, this legislation also deserves support. I \ncommend the bipartisan support it has received, and I urge the Senate \nto approve it.\n  However, in passing this important bill, this Congress leaves behind \na number of key initiatives of great importance to working families. I \nknow that my Democratic colleagues join me in pledging to renew our \nefforts early next year on behalf of the unfinished business of the \ncurrent Congress.\n  First, we must act on the Patient's Bill of Rights, which will end \nthe abuses of HMOs and guarantee the 161 million Americans who use HMOs \nthat medical decisions affecting their families will be made by doctors \nand patients, not insurance company accountants.\n  Democrats will also give high priority to campaign finance reform \nnext year. The greatest gift that Congress can give the American people \nis clean elections. This reform is important for our democracy, and it \ndeserves to be enacted at the beginning of 1999, so that it will \nclearly apply to elections in the year 2000.\n  Our nations school buildings are crumbling, and many areas of the \ncountry do not have enough classrooms. The 105th Congress did not act \non our proposal to give localities tax breaks for bond initiatives to \npay for school construction. And we will pursue this proposal again \nnext year.\n  We must also act in 1999 to reduce youth smoking and save millions of \nchildren from a lifetime of addiction and early death. Three thousand \nmore children a day start smoking, and a thousand of them will die \nprematurely from tobacco-induced disease.\n  We need strong legislation to prevent tobacco companies from \ntargeting young Americans. It is the only effective way to stop this \ntragedy.\n  Another top priority should be action on the minimum wage. At this \ntime of extraordinary national prosperity, millions of minimum wage \nearners are working full time but still living in poverty. We proposed \na modest increase of $1.00 an hour over two years to give a much-needed \nraise to 12 million Americans. The fight for this proposal--so \nimportant to working families across America--must be and will be \nrenewed next year.\n  We had landmark, bi-partisan legislation to assist Americans with \ndisabilities to obtain skills and go to work, rather than sit a home on \npublic assistance. Disabled Americans want the dignity of work. But \nthis bill, too, was not considered by this Congress.\n  The tragic deaths of James Byrd, an African American killed because \nof his race, and Matthew Shepard, a gay University of Wyoming student \nkilled because of his sexual orientation, brought the issue of hate \ncrimes to the forefront this year. Their deaths and other senseless \nacts of hate resulting in death or serious injury should be a catalyst \nfor passage of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act. This bill ranks high \namong the unfinished business of the 105th Congress, and we will pursue \nit again next year.\n  All of us regret that this massive legislation is being considered \nunder end-of-session restrictions that make sensible debate impossible. \nBut overall, I believe the bill deserves to pass, and I look forward to \nrenewing the debate next year about the nation's basic priorities.\n\n\n                  medicare home health care provision\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I wish to comment on the Medicare home \nhealth care provisions in the omnibus bill the Senate passed today over \nmy dissenting vote. Along with a bipartisan group of my colleagues, \nI've worked since early this year to persuade the Senate to revisit \nhome care. Now that we've done so, I have mixed feelings about the \nproduct. First, let me tell you what is good about it.\n  It is good that we listened to our constituents and took action on \nthis issue. The Aging Committee held a hearing on this issue in March, \nand it was clear then that we had a major problem on our hands. From \nthen to now, believe me, every step has been a struggle. As late as \nlast Thursday, this issue was declared dead here in the Senate. But \nlast minute calls from a number of us to the leadership led to the \nissue being taken up, and that's a good thing.\n  It is good that the bill delays the 15-percent across-the-board cut \nin home health payments that was slated to occur in October 1999 if \nHCFA missed the deadline for the new Prospective Payment System (PPS). \nIt's HCFA's fault, not that of home health providers, that PPS won't be \nready in time, so the cut would have been unfair. The bill delays the \ncut until October 2000, and PPS should be ready by then, meaning that \nthe across-the-board cut will never occur. We will all need to monitor \nthe development of PPS closely, but this delay buys us some important \ntime.\n  The final good thing I can say about the bill is that it does provide \nmodest relief to low-cost agencies, such as most Iowa providers. It \nmoves them about one-third of the way up to the national median. That's \nall.\n  So what's wrong with it? In short, its increase in payment to low-\ncost agencies is far too small. The negotiators accepted the House view \nthat all high-cost agencies should be held harmless. This tied up money \nwhich should have been used to provide more equity to low-cost \nagencies, the ``good guys'' who provide home care without unnecessarily \nburdening Medicare.\n  Because the bill provides so little relief to low-cost agencies, \nthose agencies are still at risk of closure. If an agency can't stay in \nbusiness for at least another year, the delay of the 15-percent cut \nscheduled for October 1999 will not help it. For me, saving those \nagencies--in order to preserve access to home care for those they \nserve--was the foremost reason to act this year. We did not do what we \nneeded to do.\n  In a sense, the new law makes that bad situation even worse. If \nexisting agencies must close their doors, especially in lightly \npopulated rural areas, we could hope that new agencies would open to \ntake on their patients. But the Senate receded to a House provision \nputting such new agencies at a marked payment disadvantage, making it \nunlikely that any will open. This should be a matter of grave concern \nto all of us.\n  The bill that I drafted with Senators Breaux, Baucus, and \nRockefeller, S. 2323, was a hard-fought compromise among differently \nsituated States. As evidence that it was a good compromise, it garnered \na majority of Finance Committee members as cosponsors, including those \nfrom States with relatively high- and low-cost agencies. It also \ngreatly simplified the Interim Payment System, providing for more \nuniform payment for agencies, and eliminating the distinction between \nold and new agencies. If anything, the provision in the omnibus bill \nmakes our earlier bill look even more attractive, because today's bill \nfurther complicates home health payment, and makes payment even less \nuniform.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I cannot resist pointing out the flaws in the \nprocess by which this provision was developed. The process was \nprofoundly undemocratic. After many months' discussion, a strong \nmajority of the Finance Committee agreed on an approach to this issue. \nWe were then told that, out of the whole Senate, only a single Senator \nfrom a State with a tremendous number of agencies, many\n\n[[Page S12808]]\n\nwith very high costs, would object to this consensus approach. Unlike \nother Senators from similar States, who recognized the need for some \nhigh-cost agencies to accept some reductions as part of a compromise, \nthis Senator had not cosponsored any of the reasonable reform bills or \notherwise contributed to the discussions during the course of the year. \nWhile that Senator cited fiscal responsibility as the reason for his \nobjection, it was no secret that his constituents included so many of \nthe highest-cost home health agencies--the defense of which would seem \nto be the antithesis of fiscal responsibility.\n  Precious days passed while no action was taken, and no explanation \nwas offered. We Finance Committee members were essentially strung \nalong, learning to our dismay each day that the bill had not been \nbrought to the floor, where the objecting Senator would have to defend \nhis position, if he dared. In the end, a deal was cut in a rushed, \nsecret negotiation at the eleventh hour. Members who had labored for \nmonths to find a workable compromise were not invited to participate, \nwhile the alleged objector was. That Senator's State's high-cost \nagencies were thus given virtual veto power. It should be no wonder \nthat we ended up with what we did.\n  Here in Congress, a good process does not guarantee a good result, \nbut a bad process almost certainly guarantees a bad result. It pains me \nthat the seniors and disabled who rely on the Medicare home health \nbenefit will have to bear the consequences of the Senate's bad process.\n  While noting the errors of the Senate on this issue, I would be \nremiss not to note the responsibility of the home health industry and \nthe Clinton Administration. The industry spent months pursuing \nunrealistic approaches and failing to unite behind reasonable reform. \nWe'll never know how differently this debate might have turned out if \nthey had been willing to make some hard choices earlier in the process, \nrather than do the impossible by attempting to please all their \nconstituents. Similarly, we will never know how the issue would have \nplayed out if the Administration had participated as full partners. \nThroughout the year, they were willing only to provide technical \nassistance, never offering reform ideas of their own, no matter how \nmuch Members of Congress from both parties pleaded. I will never \nunderstand why they decided that home health care was Congress' problem \nand not theirs. I hope that the industry, the Administration, and \nCongress will all approach this issue differently next year.\n  The prospect of dealing with this issue again in 1999 is not one that \nmany of us relish. But I'm afraid that we will have to do it. In fact, \nwhat I really fear is that our best, most efficient home health \nproviders will not be around when we return to this issue. We simply \ndid not do enough for them this year. Let's not kid ourselves that we \ndid.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, the budget agreement reached on Thursday \nevening was celebrated by both parties in competing press conferences, \nand there may well be much to commend in the Omnibus Consolidated and \nEmergency Supplemental Appropriations Act. The trouble is, how would \nanyone know?\n  According to a wire service report on Friday, the bill was ``expected \nto be more than one foot thick.'' In fact, it is closer to two feet \nthick, and contains some 4,000 pages. Will any Senator or \nRepresentative know what's in that monster bill when it is passed \nshortly--as is now inevitable?\n  Of course not. Yet in recent years we are given to feel that even to \nask such a question is to reveal an embarrassing naivete.\n  Last year, as Ranking Member of the Committee on Finance, I was Floor \nManager during Senate consideration of an 820-page bill somewhat \nunconvincingly entitled the ``Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.'' While it \nwas pending before the Senate, the only copy of the bill present on the \nSenate floor was on the Democratic Manager's desk, having been obtained \nby our resourceful and learned Minority Chief Tax Counsel, Mr. Nick \nGiordano. A second copy provided to the majority Manager, Chairman \nRoth, had been lent to the Budget Committee so that it could be \ninspected for violations of assorted rules.\n  During that debate, many Senators, having no other way to find out, \ncame round to ask if I could ascertain whether this or that provision \nwas in the bill. Sensing my opportunity, I would reply, ``I could, but \nwhat will you pay me?''\n  This year's legislation is no different; we continue to discover \nitems that mysteriously found their way into--or out of--the text long \nafter the agreement was announced. And so as we reflect on the \nsuccesses and failures of the 105th Congress now ending, I rise simply \nto sound a note of caution, if not alarm. Having served here for 22 \nyears now--I looked up at the beginning of this Congress to find myself \n9th in seniority among Senate Democrats, and 14th in the Senate \noverall--I am troubled that of late we are getting ominously careless \nwith our procedures. This growing neglect of our rules is becoming \nincreasingly hurtful to the institution of the United States Congress. \nSurely it is not how business ought to be conducted in the national \nlegislature of the United States of America.\n  In an article yesterday headlined ``Spending Deal Represents Failure, \nNot Success,'' the distinguished Vice President and columnist for the \nAssociated Press, Walter Mears, recalls that\n\n       A decade ago, President Reagan confronted Congress with the \n     ``43 pounds of paper'' it passed in 1987 to finance the \n     government in one catchall bill after failing to enact \n     separate appropriations. Reagan told the Democratic Congress \n     not to pass any more ``behemoths'' like that, and said he \n     wouldn't sign one again.\n       ``The budget process has broken down,'' said Reagan, ``It \n     needs a drastic overhaul.''\n\n  I do not assert that in some earlier, happier time, every Member of \nCongress read every word of every bill. That has never been possible. \nBut only quite recently have the negotiations over, and contents of, \nour mammoth annual budget measures been kept secret from nearly \neveryone save the two Republican Leaders and the White House Chief of \nStaff. We are beginning to resemble a kind of bastard parliamentary \nsystem. Members loudly debate issues on the floor, but the real \ndecisions are made in a closed room by three or four people.\n  This deterioration in the process has taken place over about the last \nhalf decade, or so I would reason. Such things would never have been \nattempted, or tolerated, when I arrived here. That was a time when the \nrules and prerogatives of this institution were still revered. One \nshudders to think how the current state of affairs would be viewed by \nmen of the House such as Thomas P. O'Neill or Dan Rostenkowski, or by \ngiants of the Senate like Howard H. Baker or Russell B. Long.\n  But the reality is that in recent years, a growing lack of respect \nfor the institution of the Congress has begun to manifest itself in any \nnumber of damaging ways. To cite just a few other examples:\n  The budget process has broken down. This year, for the first time in \n24 years, Congress failed to pass a budget resolution. And we have had \ngreat difficulty passing reconciliation bills. In fact, the last \nproper, complete reconciliation bill we were able to enact was the \nOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. Since Thursday night we have \nbeen busily congratulating ourselves over completion of the latest \nbudget--as if the simple act of keeping the government open is a unique \nachievement.\n  Committees of Conference have been reduced to formalities. Meetings \nof conference committees are now rarely convened, and when they are, it \nis frequently done only to announce an outcome that has been \npredetermined--generally without participation by the minority. The \nappointment of conferees has sometimes been corrupted, with conference \nmembership or party ratios within conferences subject to manipulation \nfor partisan advantage.\n  Even the ``scope of the conference'' requirement of Rule 28 of the \nStanding Rules of the Senate, which prohibited consideration by \nconference committees of provisions not in the bill passed by either \nhouse, has been overturned. On October 3, 1996, the Senate casually did \naway with that rule by a vote of 56-39.\n  Likewise we no longer prohibit legislating on appropriations bills. \nThis was a most useful rule that had existed since the adoption of the \nStanding\n\n[[Page S12809]]\n\nRules of the Senate in 1884; it helped prevent all manner of mischief \nin the annual appropriations process.\n  Yet on March 16, 1995, during consideration of a bill to provide \nemergency supplemental appropriations for the Department of Defense, we \nvoted, in effect, to repeal the rule. An amendment was offered to \nimpose a moratorium on listing of new endangered species by the Fish \nand Wildlife Service. The Chair promptly sustained a point of order \nthat the amendment violated the rule against legislation on \nappropriations bills.\n\n  Without any thought given to the consequences, the ruling of the \nChair was immediately appealed and then overturned, by a vote of 57-42. \nA new precedent had been set, and the rule was wiped out. Not one word \nwas said on the floor, before or after the vote, about the terrible \nprecedent we were creating.\n  I voted against both of those changes to our rules. I found it \nastonishing on both occasions that the Senate would so blithely \ndisregard its own procedures.\n  The gigantic new Omnibus Appropriations Act, filled with hundreds of \nnon-appropriations provisions never considered separately in either \nhouse, is the latest example of why those two little-noticed votes were \nbig mistakes. Indeed, the distinction between appropriations measures \nand legislative changes is now so blurred that on Sunday, the House \nAppropriations Committee posted a press release on its website \nannouncing ``Significant Legislative Provisions in Appropriations \nBills.''\n  Parliamentary irregularities are creeping their way into acceptance. \nFor instance, in several cases the Senate has, by unanimous consent, \n``deemed'' bills passed before they are received from the House of \nRepresentatives. In 1997, a provision giving a $50 billion tax credit \nto the tobacco industry was slipped into a conference report after the \nconference committee had completed its work. (That provision was \nrepealed soon after its existence was discovered.)\n  In another case in 1998, the routine right to modify a floor \namendment was used for a different purpose altogether: to undo a \ncompromise agreement on assistance to tobacco farmers, and to defeat \nwithout a vote a bipartisan measure reported by the Committee on \nFinance. Also of concern is the now common practice of filing ``motions \nto bring to a close debate'' under Rule 22--cloture motions--on bills \nbefore a single word of debate has been uttered on the floor.\n  This nonchalance about our procedures reached an extreme in 1995 and \n1996 when we took up the Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution \nand the Line Item Veto Act. These measures, which were part of Item One \nin the ``Contract with America,'' proposed to dramatically alter the \nprocedures by which Congress, under Article I, Sections 7 and 8, of the \nConstitution, exercises the power of the purse.\n  We had the good sense to defeat the Balanced Budget Amendment, albeit \nnarrowly. However, the Line Item Veto Act passed the Senate by a vote \nof 69-31 on March 27, 1996--notwithstanding the pleas of this Senator \nand others that the bill was unconstitutional. Ultimately, of course, \nthat Act was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court on June 25, \n1998 in the case of Clinton v. City of New York. But not before the \nSenator from New York, along with our revered leader Senator Byrd and \nSenators Levin and Hatfield, had to take the extraordinary step of \nbecoming plaintiffs in one lawsuit, which was vacated due to lack of \nstanding, and amici curiae in a second suit. Happily, as I say, we \nfinally prevailed.\n  In his powerful concurring opinion concluding that the Line Item Veto \nAct violated the separation of powers, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote \nthat ``Liberty is always at stake when one or more of the branches seek \nto transgress the separation of powers.'' Justice Kennedy went on to \nsay this: ``The citizen has a vital interest in the regularity of the \nexercise of governmental power.''\n  I repeat: ``The citizen has a vital interest in the regularity of the \nexercise of governmental power.''\n  Surely this admonition applies to the regularity of the exercise of \npower in the United States Senate. We are not talking about mere \ntechnicalities or niceties to be observed or ignored at whim. The rules \nand procedures of the United States Congress matter. Just as the \nfinely-wrought proscriptions in our Constitution matter. Article I, \nSection 5 of the Constitution provides that ``Each House may determine \nthe Rules of its Proceedings. . .'' Those rules are meant to be, and \nmust be, obeyed.\n  The Supreme Court held that the Line Item Veto Act threatened liberty \nby distorting the carefully designed constitutional procedure for \npassage and enactment of laws. In quite the same way, our failure to \nobserve the rules and procedures of this institution threaten, \nultimately, democratic representation of the American people in the \nCongress. Disregarding our rules erodes the power conferred by citizens \non each elected Member of the Congress, undermining the integrity of \nour legislative process. And it therefore weakens the Congress as an \ninstitution and contributes to cynicism and a loss of confidence among \nthe citizenry about our competence to govern. If we do not take better \ncare, I fear we will find this institution in decline.\n  I know that my friend Senator Robert C. Byrd, whose knowledge of the \nSenate rules is unsurpassed, shares these concerns. Yesterday on the \nfloor, he said this of the pending Omnibus Appropriations Act:\n\n       I will never vote for another such monstrosity for as long \n     as I am privileged to hold this office. I hope that I never \n     see another such monstrosity. I will never again support such \n     a convolution of the legislative process as the one we have \n     seen this year, and I hope that others will agree that this \n     process is just as silly and as sad and as ridiculous and as \n     disgraceful as I think it is. I hope they will join me in an \n     effort to prevent it in the future.\n\n  That is not the kind of statement that Robert C. Byrd, the Ranking \nMember of the Committee on Appropriations and our sometime President \npro tempore, would make lightly. I hope Senators were listening.\n  Perhaps the Committee on Rules and Administration, on which Senator \nByrd and I serve together, will see fit to take up this issue. And I do \nhope all Senators will recognize the importance of regular order and \ntake greater care with the rules of this institution when the 106th \nCongress convenes in January of 1999.\n  In the meantime, on this measure, my vote is No.\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe the yeas and nays have been ordered, Mr. \nPresident. We are ready to proceed to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). The question is on agreeing to \nthe conference report. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I had hoped to make this floor statement \nin advance of the vote, but I could not be here yesterday. So, I have \nasked for time this morning to state my reasons for voting against the \nomnibus appropriations bill. And I do so with a conflict of my own \nviews because I think this bill provides very substantial funding for \nvery many important projects. However, I decided to vote against the \nbill because of the change from regular order and existing procedures \nin the appropriations process. The Constitution gives the authority to \n100 Members of the Senate and 435 Members of the House, but as the \nappropriations process went forward the final decisions were made by \nonly four Members.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order. I would like \nto hear the Senator, if we could have order in the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague, Senator Ashcroft, for asking for \norder. I would like to hear myself and am having some difficulty.\n  As I was saying, Mr. President, notwithstanding the fact that this \nbill contains funding for many, many vital programs for America, I \ndecided on balance to vote against it because it made such drastic \nchanges in existing procedure where the Constitution gives to the \nCongress the authority to appropriate, 435 Members in the House and 100 \nMembers in the Senate, and as the arrangements were finally worked out, \ncritical decisions were made excluding the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, excluding the chairmen of the relevant \nsubcommittees such as myself, with only the Speaker, the leader of the \nDemocrats in the House, our distinguished majority leader, and the \nminority leader in the Senate. I think that is very, very problemsome.\n  During the time allotted to me this morning I intend to summarize my \nviews.\n  Starting first with the accomplishments, it does provide for $83.3 \nbillion\n\n[[Page S12811]]\n\nin discretionary spending for the subcommittee which I chair which has \njurisdiction over three major departments--the Department of Education, \nthe Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of \nLabor. There were some very important appropriations items included, \nsuch as a $2 billion increase for the National Institutes of Health. My \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Harkin, the ranking member, and I \nworked very closely on this bill with our staffs, and I learned a long \ntime ago that if you want to get something done in the Congress and the \nSenate, you have to cross party lines to do it.\n  We added $2 billion to $13.6 billion in the National Institutes of \nHealth budget, with a vision for the 21st century of conquering cancer, \nwhich takes the lives of 44,000 women a year from breast cancer, and \nthe lives of many men from prostate cancer, conquering Alzheimer's, \narthritis and Parkinson's. We appropriated $1.1 billion for LIHEAP, \nwhich is home energy assistance going principally to the poor, \nsignificantly to elderly people who only have the option of either \nheating or eating. We have $2.5 billion for substance abuse. We have \nappropriated $156 million to protect women from violence, an increase \nof $21 million over last year.\n  For education programs, the total budget is $32.9 billion, an \nincrease of $3.5 billion over last year. For student aid, so vital for \nAmerican competitiveness worldwide and to improve quality of life for \nindividuals, we have $9.3 billion, an increase of $369 million over \nlast year, and for Head Start a total of $4.6 billion, an increase of \n$313 million. We have increased special education program funding to \n$5.1 billion, and we have put up some $1.2 billion for classroom size \nreduction, an objective I agree with, although we didn't get there the \nright way procedurally.\n  The bill further provides for $1.7 billion for job training, very \nimportant; $1.3 billion for the Job Corps, $1.4 billion for dislocated \nworkers, $564 million for mine safety, $871 million for summer youth \njobs, a program which the House of Representatives had tried to totally \neliminate.\n  And why in the face of these important expenditures did I vote \nagainst the bill? Because this bill never came to the Senate floor from \nthe subcommittee on Labor, Health, Human Services and Education \nAppropriations. My staff and I worked on an expedited basis in August \nso that on our second day back, September 1, the subcommittee could \nvote it out. The full committee voted it out on September 3, but it \nnever came up on the Senate floor. And similarly, the House of \nRepresentatives took only a small portion of the Labor, Health and \nHuman Services and Education bill up.\n  As a result, when we did not follow the regular order and the \ncustomary process, we did not follow the constitutional direction and \nthe direction which the Senate has adhered to for so many years. This \nwas, I think, to the detriment of the bill, although so many important \nitems have been funded, there could have been, I think, a better \nallocation had the people really responsible been involved throughout.\n  When the chairman of the subcommittee is excluded from the final \nnegotiations and the chairman of the full appropriations committee is \nexcluded, you lose the impact and the experience of the people who have \nworked most closely on the bill.\n  I would illustrate this point by noting what happened on October 9. \nThe President had a press conference in the Rose Garden severely \ncriticizing the Republican Congress on education, and I was asked to \nprovide part of the response in a subsequent press conference. I did so \nby pointing out that the House-Senate conference had provided more \nmoney on education than the President had requested in his February \nbudget. We had $31.8 billion, contrasted with the President's request \nfor $31.2 billion, meaning that we put up $600 million more than the \nPresident asked for. Not unexpectedly, with the President's bully \npulpit, his message carried the day and the congressional response was \nlost in the shuffle.\n  Then we had the issue of reducing average classroom size by hiring \nteachers, where the President had requested $1.2 billion. What was not \never understood publicly was that those funds were to be provided by \nmoneys from the tobacco settlement. However, there never was a tobacco \nsettlement. The President and his administration never provided any \nalternative source of funding. Senator Harkin, my distinguished ranking \nmember, and I and the rest of our subcommittee understood that, so we \nfound $300 million for title I, which could have been used for reducing \nclassroom size for next year. This was substantially more than that \nwhich could have been expended, and that, too, was lost in the shuffle.\n  What I think is especially disconcerting is the fact that when we \nRepublicans control both the Senate and the House, we should have been \nable to come to terms in September before the fiscal year ended and \nsubmitted bills to the White House, to the President, in regular order \nwhere the President would either have to sign them or veto them. Had we \ndone this in regular order, I think, with the public debate focusing on \nthe education issue, for example, the chances were excellent the \nPresident would not veto it when it would be understood the Congress \nhad provided more than he had requested and that we had complied with \nmuch of his initiative classroom size reduction.\n  But, when those bills were not presented until October and the only \nother option is closing up the Government, then the leverage is all \nwith the President, and the Congress cannot really perform its \nappropriation and legislative function.\n  The bills were not presented in September because of very strong \ndisagreements on so many substantive matters which should have been \nhandled by the authorizing committees. There was endless debate on \nwhether there would be student testing, endless debate on organ \ntransplants, endless debate on ergonomics--and we Republicans should \nhave concluded those matters. We should have excluded the legislation, \nby and large, although realistically you can never exclude it all. And \nwhile we should not legislate on appropriations bills, some of that is \nnecessarily done, but should not be done in a quantity to defeat our \nprocess of presenting these bills.\n  In the conference we had on October 9, with representatives from the \nOffice of Management and Budget, I raised the question about a \ndisagreement in priorities of some $330 million out of the $32 billion \nbill--a relatively small part, about one percent. Was the President \ngoing to veto our bill over that amount of money, because of those \ndifferences in priorities? The Office of Management and Budget \nrepresentatives said they did not know. I replied if they did not know, \nthey ought not to be in the process, that we ought to be legislating.\n  It would have been a very different outcome had we presented these \nbills to the President in September and had we focused on precisely \nwhat the Congress had done and where the areas of disagreement were, \nand on the fact that at that stage we had provided more money than the \nPresident had requested by $600 million, and that we had taken care of \nthe issue on reduction of classroom size.\n  We live in a society with many, many different views. What has been \nthe strength of the institutions of the American Government has been \nthe procedures which we have established for more than 200 years. Those \nprocedures are for the subcommittee to report, the full committee to \nreport, the matter to come to the floor of the Senate, for 100 Senators \nto be able to debate and offer amendments--and that was not done. And \nthat was not done in the House. We did not have an actual House-Senate \nconference on our bill, although we met informally. The product is not \nwhat should have been done. We do not live in an oligarchy under the \nconstitutional doctrine which governs our society.\n  But, where you have these decisions made on $500 billion in \nexpenditures and many, many substantive issues at the very last minute, \nit is an oligarchy. Mr. President, 535 of us have surrendered our power \nand our authority to a group of 4, and that is not the way the American \nGovernment is supposed to run. That has given disproportionate power, \nenormously disproportionate power, to the President because of the \nexperience we had at the end of 1995 and the beginning of 1996 when the \nGovernment was closed and the Congress got the blame.\n  What I have seen in the time I have been here is when there is blame, \nyou\n\n[[Page S12812]]\n\ncan usually divide it 50/50, right down the middle, half to the \nCongress and half to the administration. If there is partisan blame, \nyou can divide it right down the middle, half to the Republicans and \nhalf to the Democrats. I think the failure to follow regular order and \nour established procedures, the constitutional mandate and what we have \ndeveloped as a matter of congressional practice, is very, very, very \nserious. I think it warrants a very, very strong protest vote, which I \nhave cast.\n  I was interested to hear the comments of the distinguished senior \nSenator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd, who yesterday made a speech \nand, in more graphic terms than mine, called this a Frankenstein bill--\nit did not have a mother and a father--and said he was going to vote \nfor it. A few minutes ago Senator Byrd approached me on the floor and \nsaid he decided to vote against it. I asked him why. He said he had \npersuaded himself. He went home last night, thought about his speech, \ndecided he was right. He decided he was right on the Frankenstein part; \nhe was wrong on the part to vote for the bill.\n  I said I was delighted to hear that because of the high regard I have \nfor Senator Byrd, also the high regard I have for Senator Santorum, who \nis presiding at the moment, my colleague from Pennsylvania, who also \nvoted against this bill. We discussed it and he did not quite have the \noligarchy in mind, but he agreed with the principle that the 535 of us \nought not to cede our power to 4.\n  It is not easy to get to the U.S. Senate. It is not easy to stay \nhere. There is a lot of hard work that goes into what we have done. For \nexample, Senator Santorum and I represent 12 million people and, in \nchairing the subcommittee on this $83 billion bill, I have given very, \nvery serious consideration to all of these issues and I join him in \nthinking they should have been legislated in regular order.\n  I, again, compliment my distinguished colleague, Senator Harkin, for \nhis diligence and his work and his outstanding staff, Marsha Simon and \nEllen Murray. My staff is second to none, with Mark Laisch, Jennifer \nStiefel, Jack Chow, Mary Dietrich, Jim Sourwine. Most of all, \n``Senator'' Bettilou Taylor--she is technically the clerk--who \ncommented to me that she did not like my negative vote. Here she comes \nback on the floor. She heard her name mentioned. She thought it might \nhave been interpreted that I was not for education and health care. I \nthink my record is strong enough that my negative vote as a protest to \nthe procedure will be understood in light of all the work we did on \nthese education allocations and health care allocations. And Dan \nRenberg, who is my deputy chief of staff and legislative director, who \nis extraordinary in working with Bettilou in handling some 1,300 \nrequests which come to our office, and about five times that many phone \ncalls, and David Urban, my distinguished chief of staff, who also helps \nin making these legislative arrangements.\n  So, it is with mixed emotions that I vote no because procedures and \nformat are still the most important; that we follow regular order \nbecause we don t know about the quality of the next oligarchy of four \nwhich may seek control of the appropriations process.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that my full statements on the Omnibus \nAppropriations bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n         omnibus appropriations bill: problems with the process\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I want to express my strong objections to \nthe procedures which were followed on the omnibus appropriations bill, \nwhich contains the text of eight individual appropriations and \nauthorizing provisions totaling nearly $500 billion in spending.\n  The importance of this legislation stems from our Constitution, which \nprovides in Article I, section 9 that, ``no money shall be drawn from \nthe Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law.''\n  The regular order is for the 435 House members and the 100 Senators \nto consider the appropriations bills in sequence with floor action, \nconference reconciliation and then final action by each body before \npresentation to the President. This process, too, stems from the \nConstitutional directive in Article I, section 7 that a bill which has \npassed the House and Senate shall be presented to the President, who \nmay sign it into law, or veto the bill and return it accordingly to the \nCongress for their reconsideration.\n  This year, the final stages and key negotiations were carried on by \nonly 4 elected members: the Majority Leader and Minority Leader in the \nSenate and the Speaker and Minority Leader of the Democrats in the \nHouse, with the participation of White House representatives.\n  I chair the Appropriations Subcommittee which has jurisdiction for \nthe bill funding the Department of Labor, Department of Health and \nHuman Services and the Department of Education. Our bill did not reach \nthe Senate floor for consideration by the full Senate. And, except for \na small portion, our bill did not receive consideration by the full \nHouse of Representatives. Thus, the Senate could never formally convene \na full-fledged conference with the House on the Labor, HHS, Education \nbill. Recognizing that our bill would be wrapped into an omnibus \nspending bill, we held informal conferences involving the House and \nSenate Chairmen and ranking minority members, but we were not present \nwhen the final, key decisions were made.\n  In an early conference session on our bill, representatives of the \nOffice of Management and Budget raised questions about approximately \n$330 million of the $32 billion designated for education programs in \nour bill. I asked these Administration officials whether that \ndiffernce, slightly more than 1 percent of the total, would produce a \nveto. The OMB representatives responded that they did not know the \nanswer to my question. I then said if the difference would not produce \na veto, then the matter really ought to be left to the House and Senate \nnegotiators, who would reach their own conclusions as to the \nappropriate figures to be presented in the bill to the President.\n\n  With the Republicans in control of both the House and Senate, it is \nmy strongly held view that we had a responsibility to conclude the \nappropriations bills in September before the end of the fiscal year for \npresentation to the President. That agreement was not reached because \nof many pending military ancillary issues such as school testing, organ \ntransplants, ergonomics, etc. Had we finished Congressional action on \nthe appropriations bill on Labor, Health and Human Services and \nEducation, in September, for example, we could have then presented it \nto the President for his signature or veto with the issues \ncrystallized. It is entirely possible that the President would not have \nvetoed the bill.\n  However, when the bills were not ready for final consideration until \nOctober, the White House emerged with the most leverage because a \nfailure to agree meant the government would shut down.\n  On Friday, October 9, the President held an afternoon news conference \nin the Rose Garden criticizing the Republican Congress on education \nfunding. I was asked to give a part of the Republican reply in a \nCapitol press conference, which I did, pointing out that the House-\nSenate subcommittee conferees had approved $31.8 billion for Fiscal \nYear 1999 discretionary education spending, which was $600 million over \nthe President's budget request of $31.2 billion.\n  As expected with the force of the bully pulpit, the President carried \nthe day in the media arena with no Congressional reply receiving any \nsignificant attention.\n  On the subject of adding teachers to reduce classroom size, earlier \nthis year the President proposed paying for that $1.2 billion with \nproceeds from the tobacco settlement. Of course, there was no tobacco \nsettlement legislation enacted and the Administration had no fallback \nproposal to cover the attendant shortfall in funding.\n  Notwithstanding the absence of a tobacco settlement, my ranking \nmember, Senator Harkin, and I had worked through the figures and \nallocated $300 million in additional federal funds for title one which \ncould be used for school districts to hire new teachers and reduce the \naverage number of children assigned to each classroom teacher. We were \nadvised the budgetary outlays\n\n[[Page S12813]]\n\nwould be $50 million in the first year, which was more than enough for \nthe first year's funding and could be afforded within the existing \nSubcommittee allocation.\n  Again, all of that was lost in the last minute shuffle with the \nPresident criticizing the Congress without a factual foundation.\n  Had these issues on education, for example, been handled in a timely \nfashion in September with presentment of a Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education appropriations bill to the President, he would \nhave had to articulate his views in a public forum to justify a veto. \nThe result likely would have been entirely different.\n  It is my hope that we will not repeat this year's process. I firmly \nbelieve that if the people of America are given the opportunity to \nunderstand precisely what is happening, they will demand that we follow \nregular order in the appropriations process as set forth in the \nConstitution and the long-established practices of congressional \nlegislative action.\n\n\n   fiscal year 1999 labor, health and human services, and education \n                           appropriations act\n\n  Mr. President, this has been an unusual year for the Labor, Health \nand Human Services and Education Appropriations Subcommittee. While \nboth the House and Senate subcommittees reported bills out of the full \ncommittee, neither House ever had the opportunity to fully debate its \nmerits. I believe that a bill which constitutes the single largest \ninvestment in improving the health, educational standing and economic \nwell-being of our nation, and in one way or another, affects the lives \nof every man, woman and child in this country should have had the \nopportunity to be fully debated by all 100 Senators.\n  The subcommittee received over 1,300 requests from colleagues seeking \nmore funding, report language and special earmarks. We weighed each of \nthose requests very carefully, and wherever possible we accommodated \nour colleagues.\n  I want to extend my sincerest appreciation to Senator Harkin and his \nstaff, Marsha Simon and Ellen Murray for their role in this effort. I \nalso want to extend my thanks to each of the members of the \nsubcommittee for their cooperation.\n\n\n                                OVERVIEW\n\n  The Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill totals $291.9 billion of \nwhich $83.3 billion is for discretionary spending for FY'99 and an \nadditional $6.1 billion has been provided for education programs for \nFY'2000. The discretionary spending represents an increase of $8.9 \nbillion over the FY'98 approriations level.\n\n\n                               HIGHLIGHTS\n\n  This bill provides $10.8 billion for the Department of Labor. It \ncontains $871 million for summer youth, $1.7 billion to provide much-\nneeded job training and work experience for youth, including $871 \nmillion for summer employment and training programs that offer work \nexperience and academic enrichment to economically disadvantaged youth.\n  The bill also contains $1.3 billion for Job Corps training; $1.4 \nbillion to assist dislocated workers; and $564 million for the Mine \nSafety and Occupational Safety and Health Administrations to help \nsafeguard the health and safety of workers.\n\n\n                        COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS\n\n  There is perhaps no better example of the direct effect this bill has \non the needy than the community health centers program. This bill \ncontains $925 million for this program, an increase of $117 million \nover the fiscal 1998 level. Funds are used to provide comprehensive \nprimary care services to the medically indigent in underserved rural \nand urban areas, including the homeless, migrants and those living in \npublic housing.\n\n\n            CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION (CDC)\n\n  This bill includes $2.5 billion to maintain critical disease control \nand prevention activities carried out by the CDC. While we have made \ngreat strides in eradicating disease and illnesses that once plagued \nsociety, we cannot overlook some of the serious public health threats \nthat remain, including hepatitis, tuberculosis, HIV infection, and lead \npoisoning.\n\n\n                     NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH\n\n  I thank all of my colleagues agree that few federal activities affect \nthe lives of as many Americans as our investment in medical research. \nAnd few investments have such far-reaching effects on this nation's \nacademic and economic standing throughout the world.\n  In my view, the National Institutes of Health represents the crown \njewel of the Federal Government. For millions of cancer and heart \ndisease survivors, it is the tap root of new drugs and surgical \ntechniques that have added new years to life. It is in the frontline of \nnew vaccines that save the lives of children who would have been \nconsidered hopeless cases only a few decades ago. And for the millions \nof baby boomers who are shouldering their way into old age, it offers \nthe only source of hope against the devastating effects of Alzheimer's \ndisease, arthritis, and Parkinson's.\n\n  Last year, many of my colleagues voted in favor of doubling research \nfunding over the next 5 years. Earlier this year, I made a commitment \nto do all that I could to achieve that goal. The bill before the Senate \nincludes $15.6 billion for NIH, an increase of $2 billion over last \nyear's appropriation. That puts us squarely on the path to doubling \nNIH. More importantly, it signals a recognition that the progress we \nachieved in the past is not self-sustaining. Science is not an \novernight proposition. What we do today will determine the life-saving \nbreakthroughs of tomorrow.\n  This bill supports research across a wide array of diseases and \nafflictions, from breast and prostate cancer to diabetes and stroke.\n\n\n                                hiv/aids\n\n  I want to note the fact that this legislation also includes nearly \n$3.8 billion for AIDS research, prevention and services. This includes \n$1.4 billion for Ryan White Programs that provide comprehensive care, \nearly intervention and emergency services to those afflicted with AIDS. \nThe bill also includes $657 million for AIDS prevention activities \nsupported by CDC.\n\n\n                             women's health\n\n  Women's health continues to be a high priority under this bill. In \naddition to supporting expanded research on cancers affecting women, \nthis bill contains another $159 million for breast and cervical cancer \nscreening, as well as $15.5 million to advance the women's health \ninitiative, including $3 million for a campaign to educate young adults \nabout how to prevent osteoporosis.\n\n\n                        bioterrorism initiative\n\n  The 1995 nerve gas attack on the city of Tokyo killed 12 people and \nhospitalized thousands. This incident added a new and frightening \nword:--bioterrorism.\n  Earlier this year, the administration submitted an amended budget \nrequest for activities intended to counter bioterrorism. Should the \nPresident deem this an emergency, the bill would provide $154.7 million \nto combat this growing threat.\n\n\n                            substance abuse\n\n  One of the most serious threats to the fabric of our society is \nsubstance abuse. The problem is no longer confined to inner cities, but \nhas spread to every community in our country. To combat this threat, \nthe bill contains $2.5 billion for substance abuse prevention and \ntreatment, an increase of $213 million over the administration's budget \nrequest.\n\n\n                            family planning\n\n  For family planning activities, the bill recommends $215 million to \nsupport primary health care services at more than 4,000 clinics \nnationwide. This amount represents an increase of $12.1 million over \nthe 1998 appropriation. Over 85 percent of family planning clients are \nwomen at or below 150 percent of the poverty level and these additional \nfunds will help to ensure that these low-income women have access to \nquality health services.\n\n\n                         adolescent family life\n\n  The bill recommends $17.7 million, an increase of $13 million more \nthan the amount recommended by the President for the only federal \nprogram focused directly on the issue of adolescent sexuality, \npregnancy and parenting.\n\n\n                               head start\n\n  To enable all children to develop and function at their highest \npotential, the bill includes $4.6 billion for the Head Start Program, \nan increase of $313 million over last year's appropriation.\n\n[[Page S12814]]\n\nThis brings us closer to the goal of enrolling one million children in \nHead Start by the year 2002.\n\n\n                         violence against women\n\n  The bill includes $156 million to support the programs authorized by \nthe Violence Against Women Act. This is an increase of $21 million for \nprograms to provide assistance to women who have been victims of abuse \nand to initiate and expand prevention programs to begin to reduce the \nnumber of women who are forced to confront the horrors of abuse. \nIncluded is: $88.8 million for battered women's shelters; $45 million \nfor rape prevention; $15 million for runaway youth prevention; $6 \nmillion for domestic violence community demonstrations; and $1.2 \nmillion for the domestic violence hotline.\n\n\n                                 liheap\n\n  The bill maintains the $1.1 billion appropriated for the upcoming \nwinter's Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). In \naddition, the recommendation provides an advance appropriation of $1.1 \nbillion for the 1999/2000 LIHEAP Winter Program. The bill also provides \nadditional emergency appropriations of $300 million. LIHEAP is a key \nprogram for low income families in Pennsylvania and other cold weather \nStates in the northeast. This funding supports grants to States to \ndeliver critical assistance to low income households to help families \nmeet higher energy costs.\n\n\n                             aging programs\n\n  For programs serving the elderly, the bill before the Senate \nrecommends $2.1 billion, an increase of $105 million over the \nfiscal year 1998 appropriation. Included is: $440.2 million for the \nCommunity Service Employment Program which will provide more part-time \nemployment opportunities for the low-income elderly; $300.3 million \nmore for supportive services and senior centers; $486.4 million more \nfor congregate and home-delivered nutrition services; and $173.9 \nmillion more for the National Senior Volunteer Corps.\n\n\n                               education\n\n  To enhance this nation's investment in education, the bill before the \nSenate contains $32.9 billion in discretionary education funds for the \n1999/2000 school year, an increase of $3.5 billion over last year's \nfunding level. Specifically, the Goals 2000 Programs is funded at $491 \nmillion to promote education reform initiatives and $698.1 million for \nthe technology programs.\n\n\n                            education reform\n\n  For programs to educate disadvantaged children, the bill recommends \nnearly $8.4 billion, $345 million more than the amount appropriated in \nfiscal year 1998. These funds will provide services to approximately 7 \nmillion school children. The bill also includes $135 million for the \nEven Start Program, an increase of $20 million over the \nadministration's request to provide educational services to low-income \nchildren and their families.\n\n\n                               impact aid\n\n  For impact aid programs, the bill includes $864 million, an increase \nof $168 million over the budget request. Included in the \nrecommendations is: $50 million for payments for children with \ndisabilities; $704 million for basic support payments; and $28 million \nfor payments for federal property.\n\n\n                          bilingual education\n\n  The bill provides $380 million to assist in the education of \nimmigrant and limited-english proficient students. This recommendation \nis an increase of $26 million over the 1998 appropriation and will \nprovide instructional services to approximately 60,000 children. Within \nthe funds provided, $50 million has been included for professional \ndevelopment to improve teacher training programs.\n\n\n                           special education\n\n  One of the largest increases recommended in this bill is the $5.1 \nbillion for the special education programs to help local education \nagencies meet the requirement that all children with disabilities have \naccess to a free, appropriate public education, and all infants and \ntoddlers with disabilities have access to early intervention services. \nThe amount recommended will serve an estimated 4.95 million children at \na cost of $662 per child.\n\n\n                         class size initiative\n\n  The bill contains $1.2 billion to reduce class size in order to \nimprove academic achievement and reduce discipline problems. These \nfunds will be distributed among local educational agencies based on a \nformula that reflects both their relative number of children in low-\nincome families and school enrollments. These funds would provide local \nschool districts with the flexibility to hire more teachers and improve \nprofessional development for existing teachers.\n\n\n                              student aid\n\n  For student aid programs, the bill provides $9.3 billion, an increase \nof $369 million over the 1998 appropriation. Pell Grants, the \ncornerstone of student financial aid, have been increased by $125 for a \nmaximum grant of $3,125. The Supplemental Educational Opportunity \nGrants Program has also been increased to $619 million, the Work Study \nProgram is funded at $870 million and the Perkins Loans Program is \nfunded at $130 million.\n\n\n                           reading excellence\n\n  The bill also provides $260 million for a child literacy initiative. \nThe committee has provided these funds on an advanced funded basis. \nThis will give the authorizing committees adequate time to work out the \nspecifics of this new program.\n\n\n                            school violence\n\n  The bill provides $165 million for a new initiative to address the \nviolent behavior of students. Included is $40 million to assist schools \nin identifying and addressing the mental health needs of children and \npreventing aggressive behaviors, $90 million to support activities that \npromote safe learning environments, and $35 million for competitive \ngrants to recruit, train and employ school safety coordinators.\n  Finally, the bill provides $184 million for the National Labor \nRelations Board, $9.8 million over the FY '98 appropriation.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  Again, I want to thank Senator Harkin and all of the other members of \nthe subcommittee for their help in crafting this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized for 30 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Will the Senator from Missouri yield for an unanimous \nconsent request?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I will be happy to yield to my colleague from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I ask unanimous consent that following the remarks of the \nSenator from Missouri I be recognized to speak for up to 15 minutes as \nin morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. I thank the Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, We are very fortunate, Will Rogers once \nobserved, that we've never gotten all the Government we've paid for. \nFor most of this century, Mr. Rogers' words have stood the test of \ntime. Unfortunately, I fear that with this omnibus appropriations bill, \nthis 3,000-page, 40-pound, 2 foot high, $500 billion monster, we will \nbe getting all the Government we have paid for and then some.\n  This omnibus legislation reflects the Federal budget process at its \nworst. This package was not the result of democratic votes, open \ndiscussion, and legislators reflecting the will of the people. With \nlittle debate and lots of backroom deals, 8 of the 13 annual \nappropriations bills have been tossed into one enormous heap of \nspending. This is wrong.\n  Who has read this pile of programs and pork? Not a single Senator \nhas.\n  We didn't get a peek at a summary of this Government colossus until \nMonday afternoon, just 2 days ago. We won't see it in the Congressional \nRecord until after the vote.\n  The truth of the matter is, no one knows what is in this colossal \ncreation, and no one claims to be its father. It is said that victory \nhas a thousand fathers, but defeat is an orphan. This forsaken \nmonstrosity, which no one claims, nor has anyone read, deserved defeat \ntoday. We don't know much, but here is some of what we do know about \nthis measure.\n  The Social Security trust fund has been raided for spending more on \nthe programs and pork in this bill. Billions of dollars will be added \nto the national debt that our children will one day have to pay.\n  This legislation also breaks the much-heralded Balanced Budget \nAgreement.\n  And finally, we know that taxes, which are at record high levels, \nwill\n\n[[Page S12815]]\n\nnot be cut. Washington thinks it needs the people s money more than the \npeople need it.\n  When I came to the Senate in 1995, at the same time that the new \nRepublican majority assumed control of Congress, I hoped that Congress \nwould downsize the Federal Government and return money and power to the \nAmerican people. After 40 years of Democratic control of one or both \nHouses, it was finally time for Congress to uphold its responsibility, \nto minimize the Federal Government's intrusion into our citizens' lives \nand pocketbooks, to lower taxes and to reduce the size of Government.\n  Unfortunately, President Clinton remains the chief obstacle to lower \ntaxes and smaller Government, despite his claim in the 1996 State of \nthe Union Address that ``the era of big Government is over.'' That \nfamous line from President Clinton is about as accurate as his \npronouncement in January of 1998 that he wanted to save ``every penny \nof any surplus'' to preserve the Social Security system. Both are \nintentionally misleading and factually wrong.\n  But Congress also shares the blame. The 105th Congress has been \neither unable or unwilling to cut spending, has been, at best, \nreluctant to fight for tax cuts, and has now cut a budget deal that \nguarantees that Bill Clinton's vision of a costly and intrusive Federal \nGovernment survives for at least one more year.\n  The cost of the Federal Government is so staggering that numbers \nalone do not convey its enormity. We are spending more money today than \nour Founding Fathers ever thought possible. As Stephen Moore of the \nCato Institute has indicated:\n\n       Adjusted for inflation, the . . . [Federal] spending total \n     of $7.5 trillion for 1998-2002 is more money than America \n     spent to fight both world wars, the Civil War and the \n     Revolutionary War [combined]. In fact, in today's dollars, it \n     is more money than the U.S. Government spent on everything \n     from 1787 to 1960.\n\n  In the fiscal year 1999 alone, the Federal Government will spend more \nthan the entire Federal Government spent from our founding until 1920.\n  Without taking into account the $21 billion in new emergency spending \ncontained in this omnibus legislation, the Congressional Budget Office \nestimates that Federal spending has increased $205 billion over the \nlast 4 years. By comparison, in the previous 4 years, Federal spending \nincreased only $192 billion.\n  Last year, the Congress passed, and the President signed, the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997. There was much rejoicing, celebration and \nself-congratulations surrounding the passage of the bill, \ncongratulations from the Halls of Congress and down Pennsylvania Avenue \nto the White House. The backers of the bill proclaimed fiscal \ndiscipline was being imposed on Washington.\n  Mr. President, I did not join in that celebration, nor share in \nWashington's enthusiasm. The 1997 budget deal spent too much, provided \ntoo little tax relief and was unenforceable. The bill contained no \nmeaningful enforcement provisions, nothing to guarantee that future \nCongresses and administrations would limit spending or require the \nbudget caps to be strictly enforced.\n  As a matter of fact, I proposed an amendment to impose the spending \ncontrols on the balanced budget agreement, and that amendment to that \nagreement was defeated. As a result, we have seen just today that the \nbalanced budget agreement has been broken. Now promises made one year \nare ignored the next. Promises made last year for a balanced budget are \nignored this year. This omnibus bill we have voted on today confirms my \nworst fears: It breaks the budget limits set just 1 year ago, spends \nthe budget surpluses instead of saving it for Social Security, and \nkeeps more money in Washington without returning it to the rightful \nowners--the families that work day and night to earn it.\n  Mr. President, Americans are working longer than ever before to pay \ntheir taxes. According to the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, the average \nAmerican now works until May 10 to pay Federal, State and local taxes. \nIn a typical workweek, the average American works until late Tuesday \nafternoon just to pay taxes. And the tax burden is getting worse, not \nbetter.\n  For the past 5 consecutive years, the growth in personal tax payments \nhas outstripped that of wages and salaries. Americans deserve better \nthan this tax burden and better than a spending bill for which no one \nis accountable.\n  America needs a real tax cut. The Federal Government has collected \nmore taxes than the year before every year since 1983. We have been on \nan ascending, accelerating juggernaut of tax collections, and that \nmeans that the American people have not had a true tax cut in 15 years, \nwhile Washington has increased taxes twice in this decade, in 1990 and \n1993. Those two tax hikes will take a combined $600 billion extra from \nthe American people over the next 5 years.\n  It reminds me a bit of President Reagan's telling definition of a \ntaxpayer. Reagan defined the taxpayer as ``someone who works for the \nFederal Government but doesn't have to take a Civil Service exam.''\n  During the debate on the Senate budget resolution last April, a \nnumber of fiscally conservative Senators and I announced that we were \nprepared to vote against the resolution because it planned to spend too \nmuch and cut taxes too little--only $30 billion over 5 years, or a \nwhopping $1.83 per month in tax relief for every person in the country. \nWe asked instead for a meaningful tax cut and the elimination of the \nmarriage penalty which unfairly burdens 21 million couples simply \nbecause they are married.\n  In response to our concerns, the Senate leadership pledged to support \nthe larger of the tax cuts contained in either the House- or Senate-\npassed budget resolution. The leadership also agreed to make repeal of \nthe marriage penalty the Senate's top tax priority.\n  After the House adopted its budget resolution last May, the budget \nresolution process screeched to a halt. Why? The House budget \nresolution recommended cutting taxes $101 billion over 5 years. Given \nthe agreement we had with the leadership, the Senate was to have pushed \nthe House proposal. Unfortunately, many Senators would have rather seen \nthe budget resolution die than have Congress pass even modest tax \nrelief, equal about 1 percent of the revenue the Federal Government is \nprojected to collect over the next 5 years.\n  For the first time since the process was established in 1974, \nCongress failed to produce a budget resolution and killed any chance \nfor meaningful tax or spending cuts this year.\n  This unwillingness to cut taxes comes during a period in which we \nanticipate over $500 billion in surpluses over the next 5 years.\n  This unwillingness comes from President Clinton's misleading \npolitical promise to ``protect'' the surplus for Social Security. In \nhis 1998 State of the Union Address, President Clinton proposed \nreserving, in his words, ``100 percent of the surplus--that's every \npenny of any surplus--for Social Security.''\n  Well, promises made, promises broken. The mantra here in Washington \nlives on: ``You send it, we spend it.''\n  Despite President Clinton's promise not to use the Social Security \nfor anything but Social Security, the Administration has raided Social \nSecurity to fund a series of new spending initiatives--paid for by the \nsame surplus he is purporting to save for Social Security.\n  While the 1997 balanced budget agreement limits discretionary \nspending through fiscal year 2002, this new spending has overridden \nthese discretionary spending caps, shrinking the budget surplus and \nconsuming money that could be used to ``save'' Social Security.\n  It took Congress and the White House only 1 year to breach the budget \ncaps--1 year to break the promises made to the American people.\n  The Washington Post reported on Tuesday, October 20, that \ncongressional aides have confessed that the omnibus bill not only \ncontains $20.9 billion in ``emergency'' spending, but also busts the \ncaps by another $7 billion in nonemergency discretionary spending. That \nis $7 billion in broken promises--$7 billion in spending that under the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 should not be allowed to occur.\n  It is not surprising that the President found a way around the \nspending limits so quickly. As I have said on many occasions, taxes and \nspending are the only things in Washington more addictive than \nnicotine. In fact, this\n\n[[Page S12816]]\n\nbad habit of resorting to bogus ``emergency'' spending to circumvent \nthe discretionary caps resembles the behavior of an addict trying to \nrationalize his inability to stay sober.\n  Since 1991, Congress has passed $53.7 billion in emergency spending; \nthat is excluding Desert Shield and Desert Storm. Unfortunately, the \nPresident's ``emergency'' spending requests do not meet any emergency \nother than his inability to get all he wants to spend. There are no \neleventh hour developments that have made Social Security solvency a \nsecondary concern.\n  The President is proposing that the equivalent of at least 24 percent \nof this year's surplus be spent on a Bosnia deployment that is now 4 \nyears old, Government computer repairs--we have known about these \nneeds--increased embassy security, and a variety of other initiatives.\n  Now, many of these requests constitute real and important funding \nissues. But emergencies? Mr. President, the well-being of our elderly \nis too important for half-truths and doublespeak. Nothing but the \nPresident's unwillingness has prevented the Administration from \noffering $21 billion in emergency spending reductions out of the \nFederal Government's $1.7 trillion budget.\n  In other words, the President could have offered to reduce spending \nelsewhere to accommodate his emergencies. But apparently the President \nwould rather see our seniors' Social Security checks shipped overseas \nin the form of foreign aid or squandered on more Washington bureaucrats \nthan find savings amounting to less than 1 percent of the Federal \nbudget.\n  Mr. President, as I am sure you know, the Congressional Budget Office \nprojects the Federal Government will run a $137 billion on-budget \ndeficit over the next 5 years--fiscal years 1999 to 2003. In other \nwords, 21 percent of the $657 billion Social Security surplus over that \nperiod will be used to finance non-Social Security spending. Yet, the \nadministration is strangely silent about this matter.\n  If the administration sincerely opposes using the surplus for \nanything but Social Security, it should call upon Congress--as I have--\nto reduce projected spending by $137 billion over the next 5 years in \norder to eliminate the on budget deficit. Of course, the President will \nnot do this. He prefers to block tax cuts by scaremongering vulnerable \nolder Americans on Social Security, while spending all the money he can \nthrough budget loopholes--like the designation of his needs or desires \nas ``emergencies.''\n  Mr. President, we are here today almost 3 weeks into the 1999 fiscal \nyear. We voted on the omnibus appropriations package, one which I voted \nagainst, that will fund the Federal Government for the next 11 months. \nThis omnibus bill contains eight complete appropriations bills; but it \nalso contains increased funding for the other five appropriations bills \nthat have either been signed by the President or await his signature. \nEvery single one of the 13 appropriations bills was affected by the \nbill we passed today. It even increases spending in the bills already \nsigned into law by the President. Several of the appropriations bills \nincluded in this humongous monstrosity were never even considered by \nthe Senate--not at all, not even for 1 day.\n  Again, this massive pile of programs and pork, weighing 40 pounds, \nstanding 2 feet high, over 3,000 pages long, was not available until \nmid-day yesterday. Then there was just one copy in the Cloakroom for \nall offices to share. This bill is so huge that the Congressional \nRecord could not even print the bill until this morning, to be \navailable after the Senate vote.\n  Although the President and congressional leaders announced they had \nreached an agreement last Thursday, a rough summary was not even \navailable until Monday. We do not know everything that is in this bill. \nI do not know half of what is in this bill, and not a single Senator \ndoes, including the leadership and the appropriators.\n  There is something wrong when Congress passes one bill, one huge \nbill, that spends so much--all 13 appropriations bills are affected, \neven those already signed by the President--and there is only one copy \nto be shared. We should be held responsible for the decisions that we \nmake--decisions to spend the people's money, to spend the Social \nSecurity surplus, to increase the debt that will be owed by our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  Who is responsible here? Who can be accountable when they do not know \nfor what they are accountable? Today, it feels like I was asked to be \nnothing more than a rubber stamp for a deal made by a handful of \nindividuals who assume they had the power to speak for all of us.\n  I know what the press reports say, and what the Appropriations \nCommittee says, and what the President has said, but the bottom line is \nthis: This legislation has not been scored by CBO, the Congressional \nBudget Office. Nor has the Office of Management and Budget determined \nthat all of the emergency spending requests will be categorized as \nbudgetary ``emergencies.'' Of course, with no office getting a copy of \nthe bill before it was voted on, and with some 3,000 pages to review, \nweighing about 40 pounds, such an analysis was impossible.\n  So where does this leave the country? Congress has rejected calls for \ntax relief and has just passed a $500 billion omnibus spending bill \nthat will cut the surplus and boost the size and the intrusiveness of \nGovernment.\n  The President says he wants to save Social Security, yet his every \naction has been designed to save a catchy campaign slogan --``Save \nSocial Security First''--while he spends the Social Security surplus on \nnew initiatives. The Government continues to grow, and a tax cut is \nnowhere in sight. Yes, I fear we may soon get all the Government we \nhave paid for--and then some. But then Congress does not even know what \nwe have just paid for. And we do not know what we have just passed.\n  We can do better, and we must do better. Our resolve must stiffen. \nThe people of this country deserve better service from us, and we must \nprovide it. It is with that in mind that I object to the passage of \nthis measure today.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I also rise this morning to discuss my opposition to \nthe omnibus appropriations legislation that was before us this morning.\n  While I realize many of my colleagues would have preferred not to \nreturn for this vote, there are a number of us who believed that a vote \nwas essential on a bill that appropriates a third of our spending \npriorities for fiscal year 1999. To shirk our responsibility to the \ntaxpayers, to hide behind an unrecorded vote, was unconceivable.\n\n  I feel strongly that we are elected to represent the American people \nand to take care of the Nation's business. The people expect us to be \nresponsible. They expect us to be accountable. They expect us to be \nhere and do our job. In other words, when it is time to cast a vote of \nthis magnitude, they expect us to be here, to stand up and to be \ncounted.\n  The omnibus appropriation legislation includes $500 billion in \nfunding for many essential Government programs and functions. It \nrepresents 8 out of 13 appropriations bills, or two-thirds of this \nyear's entire appropriations work, one-third of our entire annual \nFederal spending. It is by far the most important piece of legislation \nwe have before us this year.\n  This monster bill consists of more than 4,000 pages. We can hardly \nlift it, much less take time to review it before the vote. I venture to \nsay that most Members of the Senate still have no idea what is in it. \nEven Evelyn Wood herself could not have made it through this volume in \nthe few short hours we had to digest it. It would take days to get \nthrough it, but we are only allowed to review it in the Chamber, with \nno copies available for the individual review that is necessary. I \ndon't believe they are available yet.\n  Just to approve it, we were told, and everyone would be free to go \nhome and campaign. One Democratic House Member was quoted as saying, \n``We would be better off not knowing what is in the bill.'' He said, \n``Ignorance is bliss.'' Even the House appropriations chairman called \nthis an ``ominous'' spending bill.\n  Shame on Congress. If that is truly what my colleagues really \nbelieve, and if they really do think so little of the\n\n[[Page S12817]]\n\ntaxpayers whose dollars fund every program, every agency, and every \npiece of pork tucked so carefully into this bill, I say to them, \nperhaps you have been in Washington too long. This is not how I look \nupon my own responsibilities to my Minnesota constituents and my \nconstitutional duty to the Nation. The people of Minnesota didn't send \nme here to rubber stamp anything, and certainly not this bill.\n  What disgusts me most is the process that produced this omnibus \nappropriations legislation. The entire negotiations were secretive, \narbitrary, conducted behind closed doors by only a handful of \ncongressional leaders and White House staff. The special interests were \nwell represented at that table, but the taxpayers clearly were not. \nAgain, the special interests were well represented at the table, but \nthe taxpayers clearly were not.\n  Is this the best deal we could get with this President? I guess it \nis. President Clinton was intent on spending more money, money from the \nsurplus, money that he said, in fact, should be saved for Social \nSecurity. But President Clinton's thoughts on spending Social Security \nmoney must have been more important than evidently saving Social \nSecurity.\n  As soon as the bill emerged from that protective cloak, it was thrown \nat us and we were told to agree to it. No process of floor \nconsideration, no debate, no amendments, no votes. I have to wonder \nwhether this is truly a democracy. This isn't the way we do business in \nthis great democracy. It is true Congress has behaved this way before \nand the secretive goings-on are nothing new. But this does not make it \nright.\n  As early at 1988, President Reagan stood up and asked Congress to \nchange this practice. It is wrong because it destroys our democracy. It \nundermines our political institution of government through \nrepresentation. It is wrong because it allows just a few to make policy \nwithout careful deliberation and to spend hundreds of billions of \ntaxpayers' hard-earned money without the taxpayers being duly \nrepresented. We must stop this practice now.\n  Early in March, I reluctantly voted for the fiscal year 1999 budget \nresolution in the Budget Committee. I did so to help facilitate the \nprocess and offer a chance to improve the budget plan as it moved to \nthe Senate floor. I later again voted for the budget resolution based \non a breakthrough agreement reached with the Senate leadership.\n  Under this agreement, our leadership would pursue the larger tax \nrelief number of either the Senate or House, and it would make the \nrepeal of the marriage penalty our top priority. They committed to a \ntax bill this year protected by reconciliation legislation.\n  Unfortunately, these commitments were never honored. What did we end \nup with instead? Tax increases, not tax relief. More spending, not \nleaner, more efficient Government. And again we faced a President who \nthreatened to veto a Government shutdown if we even dared to send him \ntax relief for the American people. President Clinton called Americans \n``selfish'' if they want some of their surplus money back, their extra \ntax dollars.\n  Republicans have joined Democrats and the President to raise the \nhigher spending levels added in the negotiations. It is beyond belief \nthat, facing the first budget surplus in a quarter of a century, that \nthis Congress could have joined with the President to produce this bill \nin this election year.\n  I have argued repeatedly before this Chamber that the surplus is \ngenerated directly by increased individual income tax payments and it \nhas little--little--to do with Government policy. In other words, the \ncredit for the surplus does not go to the President, to the Senate, or \nto the House, but the surplus goes to the productivity of the American \nbusiness and the American worker.\n  Outside the money earmarked for Social Security, we owe it to the \ntaxpayers to return at least some of that surplus to them. That would \nhave been the moral and it would have been the fair thing to do.\n  I also warned repeatedly that if we don't return at least a portion \nof the surplus to the taxpayers, and soon, that Washington will spend \nit all, leaving nothing for tax relief or the vitally important task of \npreserving Social Security.\n  The omnibus appropriations legislation proves my point dramatically. \nThis bill is nothing but a continuation of President Clinton's tax-and-\nspend policies. Again, the President's own words, ``Save Social \nSecurity first,'' and I guess what he really meant was, ``Let me spend \nthe Social Security surplus first,'' and make sure that the taxpayer \ndoes not get their hands on the surplus.\n  Despite the rhetoric about fiscal discipline, Washington has broken \nthe spending caps by using the budget surplus. The spending bill \nexceeds the caps by at least $20 billion, and the only reason there is \nany surplus still on the table is that Washington evidently ran out of \ntime to spend it.\n  To mask its budget maneuvering, Washington has covered its tracks \nwith budget gimmicks, including $4 billion in Social Security ``forward \nfunding'' into the year 2000. How are we going to adapt this to lower \nspending next year? Will we keep on forward funding into the future, \nshrinking and shirking our budget responsibilities?\n  Another dishonest accounting measure was to label this additional \nspending as ``emergency spending'' in order to justify the breaking of \nthe spending caps. Instead of fencing off the budget surplus to save \nSocial Security first, as it claims it is doing, Washington has spent \nan additional $22 billion of the budget surplus--a third of the \nsurplus--to fund non-Social Security programs--again, nearly one-third \nof the 1998 budget surplus. This is Washington hypocrisy of the highest \ndegree.\n  In the past few months, I heard so much demagoguery in the Chamber \nabout saving Social Security, and we have heard the President pledge \nrepeatedly to the public that he wanted to use every penny of the \nsurplus for Social Security. But to date, the administration is still \ndenying they have, in fact, used the budget surplus. It appears this \nadministration has a very unique way of interpreting the truth or \nadmitting the obvious.\n  Few of the ``emergency spending'' items in this bill are truly \nemergency related. Many of these dollars could have been added early on \nin the appropriations process. But the maneuvering allowed the \nPresident to spend more, and I know President Clinton's biggest \ndisappointment in this budget is he wasn't able to spend even more. The \nY2K problem is not new. The need for Bosnia troops funds and the \nreadiness funds is also not new. These should have been funded earlier. \nThey should have been funded through the normal budget and \nappropriations process. But that allowed them to spend more of the \nregular budget so they could come back and dig deeper into the surplus \nto spend more money.\n  I only wish this Congress and the President could be as creative in \nfinding ways to reduce taxes, cut spending and make the Government more \nefficient as they are in finding new and creative ways of spending \nmoney, especially the surplus, and making this Government even bigger.\n  It is ironic that my Republican colleagues are scared to death of \nusing the budget surplus for tax relief, despite the fact that it is \nthe taxpayers' money in the first place, but don't mind at all in \nhelping the Democrats to spend it.\n  This bill is a Christmas tree that is loaded not with ornaments but \nwith plenty of pork projects and backdoor spending. Here is one \nexample: The bill includes $1 billion for global warming, a 26-percent \nincrease from last year's funding level. The Senate and the House had \npreviously rejected this level of funding--rejected it--but somehow \nsomebody managed to just sneak it back into the bill. Yet the President \nhasn't even sent us the global warming treaty. So this funding \nbasically just mocks the Hagel-Byrd resolution that we passed last \nyear.\n  There are some good provisions that I support and worked hard to have \nincluded in this bill. There are many good things in here, such as the \ndesperately needed relief for farmers, IMF funding, and 100 percent \nhealthcare cost deductions.\n\n  Frankly, some of the provisions and funding will help my own state of \nMinnesota. But the reckless process and irresponsible spending \novershadows these good provisions. It was against my conscience to vote \nfor this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed by the inability of our own \nRepublican leadership to keep its promise to working Americans. I am\n\n[[Page S12818]]\n\nalso deeply troubled that the Republican Party seems to have lost its \ncourage to stand up to our principles. I expect compromises have to be \nmade, but not compromises so heavily weighted in one direction, \nallowing heavy handed arm twisting, black mailing tactics of this White \nHouse to succeed.\n  When I first ran for Congress six years ago, I was very proud to be a \nRepublican because we believed in our vision of a government that works \nfor the people, and we believed government should be limited to only \nthat amount needed for necessary services. The Democratic Party, on the \nother hand, has long believed that people should work for the \ngovernment--or, at the very least, that the government has a right to \nspend every penny it can take from working Americans. Basically, \nWashington doesn't believe Americans are smart enough to take care of \nthemselves. I don't know many Americans who believe they need \nWashington to hold their hand in spending their money or taking care of \ntheir families.\n  That is exactly why the American taxpayers ushered in an era of \nRepublican congressional leadership in 1994--a new majority that \npledged to provide fiscal discipline, individual freedom, personal \nresponsibility, and prosperity for all people.\n  What changes have this new majority made four years after the 1994 \nRepublican revolution? Well, the distinctions between the two political \nparties have all but disappeared; the taxes on working Americans are at \nan all-time high; the government is getting bigger, not smaller; \nfederal spending has increased from $1.5 trillion in 1994 to $1.76 \ntrillion today; and the national debt has grown from $4.9 trillion to \n$5.7 trillion, an $810 billion increase.\n  Mr. President, these are the differences for which this Republican-\nled Congress can take its share of the credit, or more honestly the \nblame!\n  Republicans failed not because our efforts have lost the support of \nthe people, but because our party has lost its backbone. It has lost \nthe courage to make a stand on principle and not abandon its moral \ncompass at the first sign of resistance.\n  Mr. President, each time Congress makes a promise to the taxpayers--\nas it did in promising significant tax relief this year--and then \ndeserts them, Congress comforts itself by saying it will come back next \nyear and enact an even larger tax cut. I view this as an insult that \nflies in the face of Reality! This is self-deceiving at best. If we do \nnot take a stand today, what is going to happen to make us more \ncourageous a year from now? Besides, each year we wait, the government \ntakes an ever-greater bite of the earnings of working Americans and the \ngovernment gets bigger and becomes harder to trim in the future.\n  Mr. President, another big mistake we made that helped create the \nmess we find ourselves in today is that we failed to pass the ``good \ngovernment'' legislation I proposed in 1997. I have repeatedly asked \nour leaders to honor the commitment they made during consideration of \nlast year's disaster relief legislation to bring up legislation that \nprovides an automatic CR at last year's funding level for remaining \nappropriations pending at end of the session. This would keep pressure \non appropriators to complete their business and keep all of us in the \nprocess--not just a select few. It would also keep us free from \npolitical blackmail: ``If you do not give me this, then I will shut \ndown the government and blame you for being heartless and \nineffective.'' It happened before, and Republicans were afraid it could \nhappen again, and the recklessness of this White House for political \npurposes is a reality. Had we such a process in effect this year that \nwould not allow the government to shut down, we would have completed \nthe business of the nation on September 30, and not been forced back \nhere to vote on October 20. This path, not the path we are currently \non, would have been the responsible path to take.\n  Mr. President, I therefore was forced to cast a ``no'' vote on this \nlegislation because I am deeply disappointed in this business-as-usual \nattitude, and deeply disgusted with the process the pork-laden, \nbackdoor spending, and the budget gimmicks. Americans deserve better. \nAnd let us put Congress and this President on notice, we will use every \nSenate rule available not to let this happen again next year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, unless less than 48 hours ago, only a few \nin this body had actually seen this nearly 4,000-page, 40-pound, non-\namendable, budget-busting legislation that provides over half-a-\ntrillion dollars to fund 10 Cabinet-level federal departments for the \nfiscal year that started 21 days ago. The bill exceeds the budget \nceiling by $20 billion for what is euphemistically called emergency \nspending, much of which is really everyday, garden-variety, pork-barrel \nappropriations. The bill is loaded with locality-specific, special \ninterest, pork-barrel spending projects, which are paid for by robbing \nbillions from the budget surplus.\n  I cannot in good conscience support a bill that makes a mockery of \nthe Congress' role in fiscal matters. This bill is a betrayal of our \nresponsibility to spend the taxpayers' dollars wisely and enact laws \nand policies that reflect the best interests of all Americans, rather \nthan the special interests of a few.\n  Most offensive and disturbing to me is the misallocation of more than \n$9 billion in so-called emergency defense funding in the bill. The \ndecision to spend only slightly more than $1 billion on military \nreadiness, when the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and each of \nthe Service Chiefs testified just last month about an impending \nreadiness crisis, is a fundamental abandonment of the men and women who \nserve in our Armed Forces.\n  I recently released a comprehensive report on the state of military \nreadiness that includes a lengthy compilation of material provided by \nthe Chiefs detailing the myriad of problems the Armed Forces are facing \nas a result of inadequate resources to support the missions their \ncivilian leaders have assigned them. In these documents and in their \ntestimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee just last month, the \nChiefs were unambiguous in pressing for additional funding to address \nseveral serious concerns.\n  Restoring military retirement benefits was the Chiefs' principal \nconcern, and I and others introduced legislation to do so. The Chiefs \ncited the need to increase military pay for the 25,000 military \nfamilies on food stamps. They asked for money to provide incentives to \nattract and retain qualified people in military service. They talked \nabout the dire need for more training and maintenance funds.\n  Mr. President, the Chiefs are the highest ranking military officers \nin our nation. Their sole mission is to ensure that our Armed Forces \ncan fight and win any future conflict. They are the ones whom we should \nheed when we are told how to avert a crisis in military readiness.\n  So what did the Congress decide to do to address the Chiefs' \nconcerns? We put over $9 billion in so-called emergency defense funding \nin this bill. But we allocated only $1.1 billion to the Chiefs' \npriorities, and spent the other $8 billion on other programs that, \nwhile important, will not reverse the declining readiness trend in our \nmilitary.\n  We did nothing to address the Chiefs' number-one concern--restoring \nmilitary retirement benefits for 20-year veterans to a full 50 percent \nof their highest three salary years. General Hugh Shelton, Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Congress very clearly that fixing \nthe military retirement system is his top recommendation for restoring \nthe readiness of our armed forces:\n\n       The most critical element of both current and future \n     readiness is the men and women we are privileged to have \n     serving in uniform today. Our people are more important than \n     hardware.\n\n  I concur whole-heartedly with the Chairman's remarks. Army Chief of \nStaff General Reimer has written to me that:\n\n       . . . the retirement package we have offered our soldiers \n     entering the Army since 1986 is inadequate. Having lost 25 \n     percent of its lifetime value as a result of the 1980's \n     reforms, military retirement is no longer our number one \n     retention tool. Our soldiers and families deserve better. We \n     need to send them a strong signal that we haven't forgotten \n     them.\n\n  Mr. President, we did nothing to address this clearly stated, number-\none concern.\n\n[[Page S12819]]\n\n  Instead, we bought three Gulfstream executive passenger jets, bought \nhelicopters for the Colombian anti-drug effort, and padded the budget \nto pay for burying utilities at Keesler Air Force Base. We gave another \n$210 million of defense money to the Coast Guard to pay for its drug \ninterdiction mission.\n  We did give the Services $200 million for military health care, but \nthat's less than a quarter of what's needed to ensure military \npersonnel and their families receive the care they need. And we took \ncare of other legitimate emergency costs, like ongoing operations in \nBosnia and embassy security. But on the whole, the Congress ignored the \nclear warnings of our highest ranking military leaders and, once again, \nlet their parochial priorities take precedence.\n  Obviously, the waste in this bill does not stop with defense \nspending.\n  Here is just a sampling of the egregious pork-barrel spending in this \nbill:\n  $250,000 to an Illinois firm to research caffeinated chewing gum;\n  $750,000 for grasshopper research in Alaska;\n  $1 million for peanut quality research in Georgia;\n  $1.1 million for manure handling and disposal in Starkville, \nMississippi;\n  $5 million for a new International Law Enforcement Academy in \nRoswell, New Mexico;\n  $1 million for Kings College in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, for \ncommercialization of pulverization technologies;\n  $250,000 for Hawaii Volcanoes Observatory;\n  $1.2 million for a C Canal visitors center in Cumberland, Maryland;\n  $250,000 for a lettuce geneticist in Salinas, California;\n  $500,000 for the U.S. Plant Stress and Water Conservation Lab in \nLubbock, Texas;\n  $162,000 for research on peach tree short life in South Carolina;\n  $200,000 for research on turkey carnovirus in Indiana;\n  $64,000 for urban pest research in Georgia;\n  $100,000 for vidalia onion research in Georgia;\n  An additional $2.5 million for the Office of Cosmetics and Color; and\n  $200,000 for a grant to the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation \nCommission.\n  And there is much more wasteful spending in this 4,000-page document. \nI have here 52 pages of items that I have found in this bill that meet \none or more of the criteria that I and others, such as Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste, the National Taxpayers Union, and other well-known \npork-watchers have used for many years. I have no idea yet of the total \namount of pork on this list, but I am sure it is in the billions of \ndollars.\n  Some of these earmarked projects may well prove meritorious and \ndeserving of the priority given them in this bill. The problem is that \nnone of these provisions went through the appropriate merit-based \nselection process, which is necessary to determine whether they are \nmore or less a priority than thousands of other projects that are not \nfunded in this bill. In addition, some of these provisions were never \nincluded in either the House or Senate version of any regular \nappropriations bill. They were simply added, behind closed doors, to \nthis massive, nonamendable omnibus bill.\n  Mr. President, we are wasting the people's money when we fund these \ndubious proposals. We undermine the faith of our constituents--the \ntaxpayers--when we continue the practice of earmarking and \ninappropriately designating funding for projects based on political \ninterests rather than national priority and necessity. Unfortunately, \nthat has occurred here. This bill is a shameful example of why the \nAmerican public has become cynical and skeptical of government.\n  We seem to have forgotten that all these programs, whether \nmeritorious or not, must be paid for. Designating spending as an \n``emergency'' doesn't make it free; it still has to be paid for. And \nthe Congress, blessed with the first budget surplus since 1969, has \nbeen unable to resist the temptation to dip into that $70 billion \nsurplus and spend it on pork.\n  The President declares we must save Social Security first. Members of \nCongress declare we must save Social Security first. Yet, we spend \nbillions from the surplus on everything but Social Security. We don't \nsave Social Security. We don't pay down the debt. We don't return to \ntaxpayers a little of their hard-earned money. But we can spend a \nlittle more on pork. I guess we can never have too much of that, Mr. \nPresident, surplus or no surplus.\n  Mr. President, we have lost track of our priorities. I am \ndisheartened that Congress found the time and money to finance any \nnumber of pet projects, yet we failed to address the needs of over \n7,000 children and families whose lives have been devastated by \nhemophilia-related AIDS, in part because of the government's failure to \nimplement the appropriate safety precautions for the nation's blood \nsupply in the 1980's. This is simply shameful.\n\n  Mr. President, we are supposed to follow a process in Congress for \nconsidering important legislation--a process that relies on openness, \nfairness, and public input. If we had adhered to that process in \ncrafting this bill, many of these egregious provisions might have been \neliminated and our priorities might have been compatible with the \npublic's priorities.\n  The process by which this bill was created is deplorable. \nNegotiations were conducted behind closed doors, out of sight of the \npublic as well as the vast majority of Members of Congress. Decisions \nwere made, and then reversed without notice.\n  A case in point, Mr. President, is a provision to clarify the status \nof auctioned spectrum licenses if the purchaser declares bankruptcy. At \n5:00 p.m. on Monday, just a few hours before the Omnibus Appropriations \nbill was filed in the House, I was told that this provision was \nincluded in the legislation. Yesterday morning, it had been dropped \nfrom the bill.\n  In addition, only after the bill was filed did I learn that several \nprovisions which are clearly within the jurisdiction of the Commerce \nCommittee, which I chair, were included in the bill. I know other \nauthorizing chairmen share my frustration at never having been \nconsulted or even advised about these matters.\n  Let me point to one example of an appropriation exceeding the amount \nauthorized for a program. The Senate authorized $192 million for the \nAdvanced Technology Program of the Commerce Department; the House \napproved $180 million. Yet this bill appropriates $203.5 million for \nthe program. What is the purpose of authorizing funding levels, when \nthe appropriators simply ignore it and alone decide how much money to \nappropriate?\n  Mr. President, I learned yesterday that the bill does not include a \ncost cap on the international space station, as I had earlier been \nassured--a cost cap that was included in the NASA reauthorization bill \nthat was reported from the Commerce Committee and passed by the Senate. \nAnd I learned that the bill includes a provision for a $20 million, \ntaxpayer-funded buyback of three boats to limit domestic competition in \nthe fishing trade off Alaska--legislation that the Commerce Committee \nhad not yet sent to the Senate.\n  Mr. President, speaking about the authorizing legislation in this \nbill, one of the greatest failures of the omnibus bill is its rejection \nof comprehensive legislation to improve aviation competition, safety, \nand security. Critical aviation programs were due to be reauthorized \nthis year, and the Commerce Committee duly reported the Federal \nAviation Administration Reauthorization bill to the Senate. It passed \nthe Senate last month, on an overwhelming vote of 92 to 1.\n  In this bill, we had an opportunity to stimulate much-needed \ncompetition in the aviation industry and enact a host of other critical \nimprovements in aviation policy. Frankly, because of the influence of \nthe major airlines and other secondary interests, the legislation was \nblocked. But what we did see fit to do is place a hold on activities of \nthe Department of Transportation to address anti-competitive behavior \nin the airline industry. Major airlines won; competition and consumers \nlost.\n  Mr. President, I am very disappointed to report that the major \nairlines have succeeded in dealing yet another setback to the nation's \nconsumers. As many of my colleagues are aware, the major airlines were \nable to scuttle the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization \nbill that passed the Senate last month by a vote of 92 to one. Some of \nthe biggest players in\n\n[[Page S12820]]\n\nthe industry fought against it because the bill contained numerous \nprovisions that would have enhanced airline competition, promoted new \nentry, and benefitted consumers. That is why the reauthorization bill \nwas reduced to a mere six-month extension of the airport grant program.\n  To add insult to injury, the major carriers have now succeeded in \nhampering efforts by the Department of Transportation (DOT) to curtail \nillegal competitive behavior industry. Regrettably, the omnibus \nappropriations bill includes provisions that would needlessly delay the \nissuance of pro-consumer airline competition guidelines that have been \nproposed by the DOT. Once again, the major airlines have gotten their \nway in Congress when it comes to protecting their turf. Not satisfied \nwith maintaining the status quo, these carriers have forced us to take \na step backwards.\n  Last April, the DOT took the commendable step of proposing guidelines \nto curb unfair and anti-competitive pricing behavior in the airline \nindustry. It didn't take long, however, for the major airlines to begin \nattacking the DOT for having the audacity to address this issue.\n  The DOT has already been taking its time reviewing public comments on \nits proposed guidelines, which I admit may be in need of improvement. \nThe added delay provided in the omnibus budget bill only serves to \naggravate the existing situation. The airlines readily admit that this \nextended delay gives them more time to kill the competition guidelines \noutright. That has been the airlines' goal from the start.\n  Shortly after the DOT proposed its guidelines, the Aviation \nSubcommittee held a hearing on airline competition, and the main focus \nwas these guidelines. The DOT presented very compelling evidence that \nthere have been instances of predatory behavior. But the major airlines \nmerely shrug when confronted with very specific examples of a major \ncarrier's driving a new entrant out of a market by irrationally cutting \nprices and increasing capacity.\n  Even though such conduct makes sense only if predatory behavior is \nthe standard, the major airlines insist that they only respond in \nnormal ways to new entrants.\n  Clearly, the DOT's effort to address this sort of behavior was too \nmuch for the major carriers to accept. They were able to exert enough \ninfluence on the budget negotiation process to put the competition \nguidelines on hold. The carriers were successful, despite that fact \nthat no such provision passed either Chamber of Congress.\n  With respect to airline competition policy, as well as many other \nmatters in the omnibus bill, this situation represents the triumph of \nspecial interests over the public interest. The losers here are not \njust the new airlines, but the consumers.\n  Despite this setback, I want to assure everyone that I will continue \nmy fight for full and fair airline competition. Whether because of \npredatory behavior, or artificial barriers to entry such as slots and \nperimeter rules, the traveling public has yet to realize fully the \nbenefits of deregulation. Fortunately, Congress will have an \nopportunity to take action again soon when the authorization for the \nAirport Improvement Program expires at the end of next March.\n  Mr. President, we must not let the major airlines dictate the terms \nof competition in their own industry. I am determined to see Congress \ndo better by consumers next time.\n  Mr. President, I am also deeply disturbed that the House leadership \nhas killed aviation competition legislation this session of Congress. \nCongress' record shows that it has done nothing to ensure a vibrant, \ncompetitive airline industry. Instead, the negotiators eliminated \ncompetition provisions such as new slot exemptions at capacity \ncontrolled airports, as well as efforts to loosen the perimeter rule at \nReagan National Airport. Legislation to manage the environmental \neffects of flights over national parks also fell by the wayside because \nof this approach. Obviously the agenda of some is only to protect the \nbig airlines against competition. Let's be clear, the big airlines have \nwon. Consumers lost. That is a record about which nobody should be \nproud.\n  Most of my Senate colleagues know that the Commerce Committee worked \nhard this year to develop a bill to reauthorize the Federal Aviation \nAdministration and the programs it oversees. Following a bipartisan, \ninclusive, and constructive process, we developed a package that among \nother things would authorize important airport construction grants. The \nlegislation would institute a host of safety and security enhancements. \nIt would provide the necessary spending to add more air traffic \ncontrollers in a congested system, and to make sure that the critical \nair traffic control systems are equipped to deal with the year 2000 \nproblem. And, the bill would have established a widely-endorsed system \nfor managing the environmental consequences of commercial air tour \nflights over national parks.\n  One of the key elements of the Senate FAA bill was the aviation \ncompetition title. It would have modestly enhanced the capacity at the \nfour slot-controlled airports in the country--LaGuardia and JFK in New \nYork, Chicago O'Hare, and Reagan National. The new entrant, low fare \ncarriers have been effectively shut out of these key markets, which are \ncritical to sustaining a healthy network and giving consumers new low \ncost choices.\n\n  Service to underserved markets in the country would have greatly \nbenefited under the Senate bill. Rural America has suffered the most \nfrom the effects of hub dominance and the lack of airline competition. \nMy colleagues from the Dakotas can tell you firsthand about the \ncrippling effects of the recent Northwest Airline strike, for instance. \nNorthwest dominates their region. When it shut down, they were \nliterally cut off from the rest of the country. This is unconscionable.\n  There are other, clear ``pockets of pain,'' according to the \nDepartment of Transportation and the General Accounting Office. These \ninclude communities in the Appalachian Region, such as Knoxville, \nTennessee; communities in the southeast, such as Jackson, Mississippi; \nDes Moines, Iowa, in the midwest; Rochester, Syracuse and Albany in \nupstate New York. The citizens of these communities will continue to \nsuffer from having to pay exorbitant air fares without any real kind of \nrelief that could have been provided with the FAA bill's promotion of \nadditional airline competition on existing routes, and additional \naccess for these underserved communities in key business markets such \nas Washington and New York.\n  There are two reasons why the FAA reauthorization bill failed in the \n105th Congress, along with its provisions to enhance competition in the \ndomestic airline industry. The first reason is the utter intransigence \non the part of the major airlines, and the unmitigated gall that they \nexhibit in defending the anti-competitive status quo. Their motives are \ndictated solely by increasing their profits with no concern for the \nfree market. It's about blatant anti-competitiveness. At the same time \nthat they herald industry consolidation and hoard capacity at their \nhubs, they continue to thwart efforts to respond to these changing \ndynamics in the industry.\n  Parochial interests on the part of members of Congress constitute the \nsecond reason that this bill failed.\n  Specifically, House lawmakers from Illinois and Virginia have taken \ndown the entire FAA bill because of a few noise complaints from their \ndistricts. We have done everything possible to accommodate their \nconstituents' noise concerns. We have minimized the impact of new \nflights by spreading them out so that there are only one or two new \nflights per hour. We have increased their noise mitigation funding. \nFurther, the FAA continues to enforce Congressional aircraft noise \nrequirements that have brought noise levels down in their neighborhoods \nsignificantly over the last decade.\n  Notwithstanding, these Members refused even to come to the table to \nacknowledge legitimate interests. Let us not forget, the FAA bill was \napproved freestanding by the Senate on a vote of 92 to one. However, \nthe House refused to even conference with the Senate on the bill.\n  This is not an insignificant issue. As I noted earlier, just ask the \npeople of North and South Dakota who were effectively paralyzed because \nof one airline. Competition is the principle upon which our free market \neconomy is based. It is a complete, utter and\n\n[[Page S12821]]\n\nwholesale abrogation of our responsibilities, not only to kill pro-\ncompetition and pro-consumer provisions of the FAA bill, but to stop \nany addressing of the issue by the proper authorities. The omnibus \nappropriations bill blocks pro-consumer airline competition guidelines, \nwhich were recently proposed by the Department of Transportation.\n  During these six months we will seize the momentum we developed this \nyear to enact aviation competition legislation. We will also be \nexamining additional pro-competition issues. It is too important to our \ncountry, to consumers and to the principles of our free market economy \nto look the other way.\n  Mr. President, as we work over the next six months to finish the job \nof reauthorizing federal aviation programs, I intend to use all means \nat my disposal to rectify this situation.\n  Mr. President, even today, there is confusion about what is in the \nbill and what is not, because the only copy that was available Tuesday \nto all Republican Senators was scattered in pieces around the \nRepublican Cloakroom. There are no copies of this bill available to the \npublic and only a few copies available in the Capitol. Most of what the \npublic knows about this bill comes from media reports and the rumor \nmill. Members of Congress are only slightly better informed about the \ndetails of this bill, and we have had no opportunity to carefully \nreview it.\n  And even if a Senator discovers that there is something in this bill \nthat is highly objectionable to him, he cannot amend the bill. He can \nonly vote for or against the entire package. It is all or nothing--take \nit or leave it. We are all held hostage to a process that protects \npork-barrel spending at the expense of good policy.\n  Well, I, for one, will leave it. That is why I voted against the \nwanton fiscal irresponsibility this legislation represents.\n  Mr. President, we cannot continue to do business this way. We have an \nestablished process and we should follow it. I intend to work with \nlike-minded Senators to develop needed reforms in that process to \nensure that the Congress cannot so easily sidestep the checks and \nbalances that are so clearly necessary to control wasteful spending and \nensure responsible legislating, and that were intended by the \nConstitution.\n  Mr. President, I do want to take a moment to talk about some of the \nprograms and provisions in this bill that are meritorious and which, in \nother circumstances, would have received my full support and my vote.\n  For example, the bill blocks the use of taxpayer-funded needle \nexchange programs for drug addicts, institutes new reforms to ensure \naccountability and market-based response measures within the \nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), and extends important tax \nprovisions, such as the work opportunity and research and development \ntax credit. Also, the bill contains $18 billion to replenish the \nInternational Monetary Funds depleted resources, which is critical to \nrestoring confidence and economic stability in the global economy.\n  This bill funds many important programs directly benefitting American \nfamilies and providing critical assistance to our children, including \nChild Care Block grants and Head Start. It increases funding for the \nDepartment of Education to almost $33 billion, including $8 billion for \ndisadvantaged children and over $5 billion for children with special \nneeds, but not at the expense of local control. The bill sends $1.1 \nbillion directly to local classrooms ensuring schools have the \nflexibility to determine how to meet the unique educational needs of \ntheir students instead of Washington bureaucrats, and it prohibits \nfederally funded national tests, leaving that decision to state and \nlocal authorities.\n  I am also pleased to see inclusion of the Internet Tax Freedom bill, \nintroduced as S. 442, in the omnibus appropriations bill. This limited \nmoratorium reflects the need for careful thought and analysis of the \nimplications for taxing electronic commerce, and the proper roles for \nlocal, state and federal government in taxing the Internet. Present \nfederal law neither authorizes, imposes, nor ratifies any excise, \nsales, or domain name registration tax on Internet use for electronic \ninterstate commerce, and only one fee for the Intellectual \nInfrastructure Fund. I am confident that this moratorium will allow \nCongress to move forward in developing a national strategy for \nadvancing electronic commerce and appropriate taxation of the Internet.\n  I am pleased to see that the provisions concerning Amtrak generally \nmaintain the integrity of the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act and \ncontinue the mandate for Amtrak to operate free of taxpayer subsidies \nby 2002. The bill also provides funding, though limited, directly to \nthe Amtrak Reform Council instead of channeling such funds through the \nSecretary of Transportation. These are good decisions, ones which I \nsupport.\n  Also contained in this omnibus bill is legislation to increase the \nnumber of H-1B visas for skilled foreign professionals who wish to work \ntemporarily in the United States in jobs unfilled by American workers. \nI cosponsored the original Senate legislation to raise the existing cap \non H-1B visas. The provisions in this bill will allow dynamic American \ncompanies and research labs to hire more skilled foreign professionals. \nAt the same time, we have incorporated safeguards to protect American \nworkers and provide substantial funding to educate and train Americans \nto fill the lucrative high-tech jobs that are available across our \ncountry. American companies, American workers, and the American \nconsumer will all benefit as a result.\n  The provisions I have just mentioned, and many others, are good for \nthe American people. In fact, if these and many of the other policies \nand programs contained in the Omnibus Appropriations bill had been \nproposed and considered in the established process, I would have voted \nfor them. Unfortunately, because the Congress has abandoned the normal \nprocess of legislating, my vote against this Omnibus Appropriations \nbill may also be construed, albeit wrongly, as a vote against these \nmeritorious provisions. My vote against this precedent-setting \nlegislation should be recognized for what it was--a vote against \nwasting taxpayer dollars and failing to ensure the readiness of our \nArmed Forces.\n  Responsible spending is the cornerstone of good governance. I look \nforward to the day when we can go before the American people with a \nbudget that is both fiscally responsible and ends the practice of \nearmarking funds in the appropriations process.\n  Mr. President, those of my colleagues who support this legislation \nwill say of us who oppose it that we are not practical politicians, \nthat we ask for the impossible--legislation that is free of compromise, \nthat we would let the perfect be the enemy of the good. That is a false \ncharge, and it fails utterly as a defense of a legislative process that \neveryone agrees is terribly, terribly flawed.\n  We do not ask that a Republican majority produce legislation that \nreflects in every detail our priorities and dismisses completely the \nviews of the President and the minority. We ask only that, on balance, \nany legislation--and surely legislation of this magnitude--reflect the \nprinciples upon which our majority was elected. We ask only that the \nCongress complete its work when it is supposed to complete it work, and \nin a manner that ensures fairness, openness, and inclusions. We ask \nonly that we adhere to a little truth in advertising.\n  When we say we are going to save Social Security first, we ask only \nthat we make some attempt to do so. When we call something an \nemergency, we should be able to say it with a straight face. When we \npromise to restore the resources necessary to provide for the common \ndefense, we must pay just a little attention to the concerns of the \nmilitary. When we promise to return to the people some percentage of \nthe money they have sent to Washington, we ask only that we rank that \npledge somewhat higher on our list of priorities than the usual \ncornucopia of parochial spending.\n  Those who voted against the omnibus appropriations bill would not let \nthe perfect be the enemy of the good. We simply oppose letting back-\nroom negotiations, business as usual, and pork-barrel politics be the \nenemy of principle.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The clerk will call the roll to \ndetermine the presence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S12822]]\n\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I voted today for the omnibus \nappropriations bill that was pending before the Senate, in large part \nbecause, very frankly, of my great doubt that delaying what already has \nbeen an utterly abominable legislative process would, at this late \npoint, improve the nature of the final product.\n  It should be abundantly clear to us all, to even the most casual \nobservers, that the first and most fundamental mistake made by this \n105th Congress was the unwillingness, or perhaps the inability, of the \nRepublican leadership to craft a budget resolution acceptable to a \nmajority of Members of both parties. But, amazingly, the Republican \nleadership was then unable or unwilling to put together a budget \nresolution that could even muster the majority support of its own \nparty. As a result, for the very first time since the current Budget \nAct was enacted, Congress was forced to proceed on with the 13 separate \nappropriations bills without the benefit of the direction of a budget \nresolution at all.\n  In fairness, this body did pass its own version of a budget \nresolution, and much of the difficulty in reaching an agreement with \nthe other body lies with the radical faction in the House, which was \nunwilling to support any measure unless it called for huge tax \nreductions funded out of a naked raid on the Social Security surplus. \nThere were a few Members of this body as well who indicated they could \nnot vote for a final resolution unless a tax cut/Social Security \nplunder plan was involved. So, April 15, the deadline for passage of a \nbudget resolution, came and it went, and in the end no agreement was \nreached between the Senate and the other body and no serious effort at \nbipartisanship, frankly, was ever attempted. The budget process that \nhas ensued, and we have witnessed its culmination today, is certainly a \ncase of the Republican leadership having to reap what it sowed.\n  Without the discipline of a budget resolution, this Congress then \nproceeded to make an utter mockery of the appropriations process.\n  Rather than deliberate debate and careful consideration of the 13 \nseparate appropriations bills needed to run the Federal Government, we \nwound up with an omnibus appropriations bill weighing some 40 pounds \nand going on for 3,825 pages as it compressed 8 of the appropriations \nbills, a supplemental appropriations bill, and miscellaneous matters \nall into one ill-considered mess. The bill we have had before us today \nis a consequence of massive, massive legislative mismanagement.\n  All this is not to say that the legislation that was before this body \ntoday did not have some redeeming strengths. There will be no Federal \nGovernment shutdown, and as the American people rightfully celebrate \nthe first balanced unified Federal budget in 30 years, the omnibus bill \ndoes stay within the previously agreed upon budget caps. Thanks to \nPresident Clinton and his earlier veto, this legislation does provide \nfor significant assistance for farmers and ranchers suffering through \nan economic crisis throughout much of rural America and, again, thanks \nto the President's tenacity, this bill will provide for the hiring of \nadditional teachers and the expansion of some key educational programs, \nsuch as Head Start.\n  But even here, the omnibus bill is not as good as it ought to have \nbeen. The agricultural provisions failed to address the underlying \nproblem of inadequate market prices for livestock and grain by \nneglecting to raise the marketing loan rates, and by eliminating price \nreporting and country of origin meat labeling, it does next to nothing \nfor livestock producers.\n  The educational provisions are inadequate in several areas, but most \nnoticeably, the Republican leadership refused to permit a Federal-\nState-local partnership which would have allowed the cost of school \nconstruction and renovation bonds to have been significantly reduced \nfor local taxpayers.\n  To this Senator, it is simply outrageous for some on the far \npolitical right to claim, as they have, that this commonsense provision \nwould have amounted to some sort of ``federalization'' of education. \nClearly, the decisions as to whether to build or renovate a school \nwould have remained at the local level, where such decisions belong, \nand the bulk of funding for such construction would likewise have \nremained appropriately enough with local taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, it is not federalization for the Federal Government to \nhelp local citizens reduce the cost of their education decisions, \ndecisions that they make at the local level, by partially writing down \ninterest rates on the bonds which these school districts would then \nhave to issue.\n  There are some who are referring, with some justification, to the \n105th Congress as the worst that has ever met in this Capitol Building. \nI don't know if that is true, but the mismanagement of this \nlegislation, coupled with the refusal of the majority leader to even \nallow meaningful debate and progress on such issues as managed health \ncare reform, campaign finance reform, and modernization of financial \nservices, among others, ought to be a source of shame for this \ninstitution.\n  Again, Mr. President, while some have voted against the omnibus bill \nas a protest gesture, motivated by any number of concerns, I wanted to \ndo the responsible thing, and I voted to pass this faulty but, frankly, \nat this point in time very necessary legislation. It is my hope, \nhowever, that never again will Congress proceed without a budget \nresolution and without an opportunity to debate and deliberate on \nindividual appropriations bills in a timely manner.\n\n\n                      Federal Vacancies Reform Act\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I am pleased that the essentials of S. \n2176 have been incorporated into the Omnibus Appropriations bill, H.R. \n4328. I appreciate the work of my colleagues, Senator Byrd in \nparticular, in seeing that this bill becomes law.\n  Mr. President, I wish to address the changes that have been made to \nS. 2176 since it was reported out of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. The legislative history of the bill is largely described in \nthe Committee report, S. Rep. 105-250. However, this is the opportunity \nto discuss the subsequent changes made in the bill.\n  The term ``first assistant to the office'' is incorporated into 5 \nU.S.C. Sec. 3345(a)(1), rather than ``first assistant to the officer.'' \nThis change is made to ``depersonalize'' the first assistant. Questions \nhave arisen concerning who might be the vacant officer's first \nassistant if the acting officer dies or if the acting officer resigns \nwhile a permanent nomination is pending. The term ``first assistant to \nthe officer'' has been part of the Vacancies Act since 1868, however, \nand the change in wording is not intended to alter case law on the \nmeaning of the term ``first assistant.''\n  A third category of ``acting officer'' is now permitted apart from \nfirst assistants and presidentially designated persons who have already \nreceived Senate-confirmation to hold another office. The President (and \nonly the President) may also direct an officer or employee of the \nexecutive agency in which the vacancy arises to be the acting officer \nif that officer or employee served in that agency for 90 days preceding \nthe vacancy caused by the departure of the prior Senate-confirmed \nofficer and, the officer or employee has been paid at a rate at least \nequal to a GS-15. Concerns had been raised that, particularly early in \na presidential administration, there will sometimes be vacancies in \nfirst assistant positions, and that there will not be a large number of \nSenate-confirmed officers in the government. In addition, concerns were \nraised about designating too many Senate-confirmed persons from other \noffices to serve as acting officers in additional positions.\n  The 180 day period in Sec.  3345(b) governing the length of service \nprior to the onset of the vacancy that the first assistant must satisfy \nto be eligible to serve as the acting officer is reduced to 90 days. \nUnder Sec.  3345(b)(1), the revised reference to Sec.  3345(a)(1) means \nthat this subsection applies only when the acting officer is the first \nassistant, and not when the acting officer is designated by the \nPresident pursuant to Sec. Sec. 3345(a)(2) or 3345(a)(3). The 90 day \nservice requirement is inapplicable to a first assistant who has \nalready received\n\n[[Page S12823]]\n\nSenate confirmation to serve in that position.\n  New Sec. 3345(c) was added to address the special case of an \nexecutive department (not executive agency) officer who serves not at \nthe pleasure of the President, but under a fixed term, and without a \nholdover provision that governs acting service in that office following \nexpiration of the fixed term. In that situation, without passing \njudgment on the constitutionality of fixed term appointees within \nexecutive departments, if the person whose term expires is renominated \nwithout a break in service, that already Senate-confirmed officer may \ncontinue to serve in the position subject to the time limits contained \nin Sec.  3346 until the Senate confirms or rejects that person's \nrenomination, notwithstanding the adjournment of the Senate sine die. \nThe subsection does not apply until the incumbent officeholder is \nrenominated, or when a person other than the previously appointed \nofficeholder is nominated.\n  In Sec.  3346(a), an exception is added for ``sickness,'' a narrower \ncategory than ``unable to perform the functions and duties of the \noffice.'' If the Senate-confirmed officer cannot serve because he is \nsick for more than 210 days, the acting officer may continue to serve \nduring the sickness, and no nominee need be submitted to the Senate to \navoid the vacant office provisions of Sec.  3348. The office is not \nvacant if the Senate-confirmed officer is sick, and he may reclaim the \noffice even after 210 days if he is no longer ill. However, the 210 day \nlimit will apply if the Senate-confirmed officer is unable to perform \nthe functions and duties of the office for other reasons. For instance, \nthe Doolin court stated that the current language of the Vacancies Act \ndoes not apply when the officer is fired, and for similar reasons, it \nmight not apply when the officer is in jail if he does not resign. To \nmake the law cover all situations when the officer cannot perform his \nduties, the ``unable to perform the functions and duties of the \noffice'' language was selected. Sickness is the only exception to the \n210 day limit, since in other circumstances when the officer is unable \nto perform the functions and duties of the office, there is no reason \nto allow the officer to reclaim his duties sometime after 210 days.\n  The 150 day period adopted in the Governmental Affairs Committee was \nlengthened to 210 days in each place it appeared in Sec.  3346 as an \naccommodation to the Administration in light of the increased time the \nvetting process now consumes.\n  The amendment's striking of ``in the case of a rejection or \nwithdrawal'' in Sec. 3346(b)(2) is to ensure that an acting officer can \nserve for 210 days if a second nomination is made of a person whose \nfirst nomination was returned by the Senate.\n  The phrase ``applicable to'' is replaced by ``the exclusive means for \ntemporarily authorizing an acting official to perform the functions and \nduties of'' in Sec.  3347(a) to ensure that the Vacancies Act provides \nthe sole means by which temporary officers may be appointed unless \ncontrary statutory language as set forth by this legislation creates an \nexplicit exception.\n  The phrase ``statutorily vested in that agency head'' is added to \nSec.  3347(b) to clarify that so-called ``vesting and delegation'' \nstatutes that permit the agency head to delegate functions and duties \nto subordinates in the department whose positions lack defined \nstatutory duties apart from assisting the agency head do not permit the \nagency head to appoint acting officials. Thus, the organic statutes of \nthe Cabinet departments do not qualify as a statutory exception to this \nlegislation's exclusivity in governing the appointment of temporary \nofficers.\n  Changes were made to Sec.  3348(b) to provide that the vacant office \nprovisions of the legislation apply not only when an acting officer has \nserved more than 210 days without a nomination for the office having \nbeen submitted to the Senate, but also prior to the 210 days after the \nvacancy occurs unless an officer of employee performs the functions of \nthe vacant office in accordance with Sec. Sec.  3345, 3346, and 3347 of \nthis legislation.\n  The tolling period provided in Sec. 3348(c) when the 210th day falls \non a day on which the Senate is not in session is extended from the \nfirst day that the Senate is next in session and receiving nominations \nto the second such day.\n  The changes clarify Sec.  3348(d) to provide that actions taken by \npersons not acting under Sec. Sec.  3345, 3346, or 3347 or as provided \nby Sec.  3348(b) of any function of a vacant office to which Sec. Sec.  \n3346, 3347, 3348, 3349, 3349a, 3349b, and 3349c apply shall have no \nforce or effect.\n  Added to the list of positions in Sec. 3348(e) that are not subject \nto the vacant office provisions are any chief financial officer \nappointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the \nSenate, since the head of the agency should not be permitted to execute \nthe functions of such an official. The amendment also adds to the same \nlist any other positions with duties that statutory provisions prohibit \nthe agency head from performing.\n  The Comptroller General's duties under Sec.  3349(b) are now to be \nperformed ``immediately'' upon his or her determining that the 210 day \nperiod has been exceeded.\n  Section 3349b is changed to preserve all statutory holdover \nprovisions in independent establishments, not merely those independent \nestablishments headed by a single officer.\n  The list of excluded officers contained in Sec.  3349c is expanded to \ninclude any judge appointed by the President by and with the advice of \nthe Senate to an Article I court. This includes the Court of Federal \nClaims, but this exclusion does not apply to administrative law judges, \nsince they are not appointed by the President by and with the advice \nand consent of the Senate. The list is also expanded to include members \nof the Surface Transportation Board, which, like the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission, is denominated an ``independent establishment'' \ndespite its location in an Executive department.\n  New Sec.  3349d addresses the situation when the 210 day service \nperiod for an acting officer expires without a nominee having been \nsubmitted to the Senate, and the 211th day occurs during a Senate \nrecess or adjournment of more than 15 days. Rather than wait until the \nSenate reconvenes to avoid the vacant office provisions of Sec.  3348 \nfrom taking effect, the President may submit to the Senate a written \nnotification of intent to nominate a permanent officer for a particular \noffice after the recess or adjournment. At that point, an acting \nofficer qualified to serve as such by this law may begin to serve as \nthe acting officer for that particular position. So long as the \nPresident actually submits the nomination of the person so designated \nin the written notification for that particular office within two days \nof the Senate's reconvening, the actions of the acting officer are \nvalid from the date the acting officer begins service and so long as \nthe nomination is pending. However, if the President does not actually \nnominate the person who was the subject of the written notification for \nthe particular subject designated in the written notification within \ntwo days of the reconvening of the Senate, then the notification \nconsidered a nomination that permitted the acting officer's service \nshall be treated after the second day the Senate reconvenes as a \nwithdrawn nomination is treated under this legislation.\n  The effective date of this portion of the bill is 30 days after the \ndate of its enactment. For any vacant office as of the date of \nenactment, the time limitations under Sec.  3346 apply as if the office \nbecame vacant as of the effective date of this section.\n  If the President nominates a person after the effective date of this \nsection for an office to which that person had been nominated before \nthe effective date, that second nomination will be treated as a first \nnomination under this section.\n  All other changes are intended to be purely technical.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the United States Constitution contains two \noptions providing for the appointment of the principal officers of our \nfederal government. First, the Appointments Clause, found in Article \nII, section 2, clause 2, states that the President ``shall nominate, \nand by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint'' \nsuch officers. Alternatively, should the Senate not be in session, \nArticle II, section 2, clause 3, authorizes the President to \nunilaterally ``fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess \nof the Senate,'' subject only\n\n[[Page S12824]]\n\nto the proviso that the recess appointment expires at the end of the \nnext session of Congress.\n  As the Supreme Court pointedly observed in the 1997 case of Edmond v. \nUnited States, ``the Appointments Clause of Article II is more than a \nmatter of `etiquette or protocol'; it is among the significant \nstructural safeguards of the constitutional scheme.''\n  With enactment of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998, an \nimportant step will have been taken toward securing the Senate's \nconstitutional responsibility to render its advice and consent on \npresidential nominations. It is my hope that this legislation, which \nmakes several substantive changes to the current Vacancies Act, will \nprotect this vital constitutional ``safeguard'' by bringing to an end a \nquarter century of obfuscation, bureaucratic intransigence, and \noutright circumvention\n  Mr. President, because I am an original sponsor of the Federal \nVacancies Reform Act, and because the Act as it is being enacted \ndiffers somewhat from the bill reported to the Senate by the Committee \non Governmental Affairs on July 15, 1998, (S. Rpt. 105-250), I wish to \noffer my perspective on the Act's application, time limitations, \nexclusivity and exceptions, enforcement, reporting requirements, and \neffective date and application to current vacancies.\n\n\n                              Application\n\n  Section 3345 states that the provisions of the Act will apply to any \nofficer in any executive agency, other than the General Accounting \nOffice, if that officer's appointment is made by the President, subject \nto the advice and consent of the Senate. Unlike current law, this \nchange will make clear that the Vacancies Act, as amended by this \nlegislation, applies to all executive branch officers whose appointment \nrequires Senate confirmation, except for those officers described in \nSection 3349c.\n  Section 3345 applies when an officer dies, resigns, or is otherwise \nunable to perform the functions and duties of the office (the latter \nprovision covers, inter alia, sickness or absence, which are listed in \ncurrent law, or expiration of a term of office). Should one of these \nsituations arise, the officer's position may then be filled temporarily \nby either: (1) the first assistant to the vacant office; (2) an \nexecutive officer who has been confirmed by the Senate for his current \nposition; or (3) a career civil servant, paid at or above the GS-15 \nrate, who has served in the agency for at least 90 of the past 365 \ndays. However, a person may not serve as an acting officer if: (1)(a) \nhe is not the first assistant, or (b) he has been the first assistant \nfor less than 90 of the past 365 days, and has not been confirmed for \nthe position; and (2), the President nominates him to fill the vacant \noffice.\n\n\n                            Time Limitation\n\n  Section 3346 places a strict time limit of 210 days upon how long an \nacting officer may serve. As the language of this section make \nabundantly clear, the time limit begins on the day the position becomes \nvacant, and not on any other date. The precise language that was used \nin the Act will correct the decision of the D.C. Circuit Court of \nAppeals in Doolin Security Savings Bank v. Office of Thrift \nSupervision, 139 F.3rd 203 (D.C. Cir. 1998). If, however, the President \nforwards to the Senate a first or second nomination to fill the vacant \noffice, the acting official may continue to serve until 210 days after \nthe nomination is rejected by the Senate, withdrawn, or returned to the \nPresident by the Senate.\n  With respect to this time limitation, section 3349d further provides \nthat the vacant office may be temporarily filled beyond the 210-day \ntime limit if, during a recess or adjournment of greater than 15 days, \nthe President formally notifies the Senate of his intention to nominate \na specified person for the vacant position, and, in fact, does submit \nto the Senate the nomination within two days of the end of the recess \nor adjournment. Should the President, for whatever reason, fail to \nforward the nomination, then any action taken by the acting official \nshall have no legal force or effect, nor shall that action be ratified. \nMoreover, such failure would render the position vacant as of the \nsecond day following the Senate's return.\n  Finally, on the issue of time, the Act, unlike current law, \nappropriately recognizes the difficulties faced by a new President \nfollowing his initial inauguration. To address that situation, section \n3349a provides that, with respect to any advice-and-consent position \nwhich becomes vacant during the first 60 days of the new President's \nterm, the 210 day time limitation shall not begin until 90 days after \nthe inauguration date, or 90 days after the date of the vacancy, \nwhichever is later. Effectively, then, this provision will give a new \nPresident up to 300 days to forward nominations to the Senate.\n\n\n                       Exclusivity and Exceptions\n\n  Mr. President, turning now to the question of the exclusivity of the \nAct, I think it is a fair assessment of this entire issue to say that \nthe matter of exclusivity is the bedrock point on which the executive \nand legislative branches have historically differed. Indeed, it is very \nlikely that we would not be here today were it not for the differing \ninterpretations as to the exclusivity of the Vacancies Act. And, \nwithout opening old wounds, suffice it to say that the problems that \nhave heretofore been brought to the attention of Congress were not the \nfault of any one President, any one Attorney General, and certainly not \nthe fault of any one political party. Accordingly, it is my fervent \nhope that the language of the Act will, once and for all, end this \ndecades-long disagreement.\n  As the language of Section 3347 makes clear, unless other statutory \nprovisions exist which explicitly authorize the temporary filling of \nvacancies in executive positions requiring Senate confirmation, or \nunless such provisions are enacted in the future, Sections 3345-3349d \nare to be the exclusive statutory means for filling vacant advice-and-\nconsent positions in the executive branch.\n  Moreover, in an effort to squarely address past problems, the Act \nspecifically prohibits the use of general, ``housekeeping'' statutes as \na basis for circumventing the Vacancies Act. Provisions such as, but \nnot limited to, 28 U.S.C. 509 and 510, which vest all functions of the \nDepartment of Justice in the Attorney General and allow the Attorney \nGeneral to delegate responsibility for carrying out those functions, \nshall not be construed as providing an alternative means of filling \nvacancies.\n  Finally, Section 3349b makes clear that the Vacancies Act, as now \namended, does not affect statutory holdover provisions. Nor does the \nAct, as explained in Section 3349c, apply to members of independent, \nmultiple-member boards or commissions, to commissioners of the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission, to members of the Surface Transportation \nBoard, or to any judge of any court constituted pursuant to Article I \nof the Constitution.\n\n\n                              Enforcement\n\n  Mr. President, with enactment of this legislation, the Vacancies Act \nwill, for the first time ever, contain an effective enforcement \nmechanism. As spelled out in Section 3348, failure to comply with \nSections 3345, 3346, or 3347 shall result in a vacant office remaining \nvacant, and no-one, other than the agency head, may perform the \nfunctions or duties that are assigned by statute or regulation to that \noffice exclusively. An action taken by an acting official who is not in \ncompliance with Sections 3345, 3346, or 3347 shall have no force or \neffect and may not be subsequently ratified.\n  For those who are concerned with this provision, I would point out \nthat, while this is an effective, and admittedly tough enforcement \nmechanism, it is not so stringent that it will result in governmental \nparalysis. On the contrary, not only is the head of the agency \nauthorized to carry out the most essential functions of an office \nforced to remain vacant due to noncompliance, but the language of the \nlegislation is crafted in such a way as to allow for the filling of a \nvacant office once the President submits a nomination to the Senate. In \nthat respect, then, the enforcement mechanism should not be considered, \nnor is it intended to be, a form of punishment, but, rather, a means of \nproviding incentive for the timely submission of nominations.\n\n\n                         Reporting Requirement\n\n  Because one of the keys to exacting compliance with the Vacancies Act \nis full and complete disclosure of information regarding vacant \npositions, Section 3349 establishes a provision for the regular \nreporting of information.\n\n[[Page S12825]]\n\n Under this section, the head of each executive branch agency shall, at \nthe appropriate time, submit to the Comptroller General and to each \nHouse of Congress the following information: Notification of any \nvacancy in an office subject to the Vacancies Act; the name of the \nperson serving in an acting capacity and the date such service began; \nthe name of any person nominated for the vacant position and the date \nsuch nomination was submitted to the Senate; and the date the \nnomination was withdrawn, rejected by the Senate or returned by the \nSenate. If the Comptroller General, once he has received the relevant \ninformation, determines that an individual is serving in an acting \ncapacity beyond the 210-day time limitation in violation of the \nVacancies Act, the Comptroller General is required to notify the \nSenate, the House of Representatives, various committees of the two \nHouses, the Office of Personnel Management and the President.\n  Mr. President, although these may seem to be rather routine \nprocedures, in this case they are vitally important, because one of the \ngreat difficulties in crafting this legislation has been the absence of \nreliable information. However, with these reporting requirements, the \nCongress and the executive branch will be in a far better position to \nobjectively evaluate the operation of the Vacancies Act, and, should \nthis issue require further review, will be prepared to discuss the \nmatter based on reliable data.\n\n\n          Effective Date and Application to Current Vacancies\n\n  Finally, let me address the matter of the Act's effective date and \napplication. First, as the legislation makes clear, the Act will take \neffect 30 days after the date of enactment. Next, the Act, and all of \nits provisions, will fully apply to any position which becomes vacant \nafter the effective date. Third, with respect to those positions that \nare vacant on the effective date, or those positions which are being \nfilled by an acting official on the effective date, only the time \nlimitations of section 3346 shall apply. None of the other provisions \nof the Act (including, but not limited to, the length of service \nrequirements contained in section 3345), shall apply to those \nindividuals currently serving in an acting capacity. Lastly, the Act \nmakes clear that, notwithstanding the fact that an individual may have \npreviously been nominated, the next nomination of that individual will \nbe treated as a first nomination for purposes of the Vacancies Act, as \namended.\n  Mr. President, that concludes my remarks on the meaning and intent of \nthe various provisions of the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998. \nHowever, I would like to take a moment to extend my congratulations and \nmy sincere gratitude to Senator Thompson, the distinguished chairman of \nthe Committee on Governmental Affairs, for all the time and effort he \nhas put into this endeavor. I also wish to thank the Democratic members \nof the committee--in particular Senators Glenn, Levin, Lieberman and \nDurbin--for their willingness to see this legislation through to \ncompletion. It was not an easy task, and I commend them all for their \nhard work. Despite the difficulties, though, I hope they will agree \nthat securing the rights of the Senate, and thus the integrity of the \nU.S. Constitution, is a task that bears doing no matter how demanding \nit may be.\n\n\n                Women's Health Cancer Rights Act of 1998\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President I rise today to applaud this body for \npassing perhaps one of the most critical pieces of legislation this \nCongress. Today, before the Senate, in the omnibus appropriations bill, \nis the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1998, or more \nappropriately, Janet's Law.\n  Mr. President, I first began the fight to pass this critical \nlegislation on January 30, 1997 when I introduced this legislation \nalong with Senator Diane Feinstein, Senator Olympia Snowe, Senators \nHollings, Moynihan, Domenici, Faircloth, Moseley-Braun, Biden, Inouye, \nMurkowski, Dodd, Kerrey, Hatch, Gregg, Smith, and Ford.\n  We faced an uphill fight, but we were persistent. We never gave up.\n  We couldn't--Mr. President, there was too much at stake. We took on \nthis fight for the women of America--our mothers and daughters, sisters \nand wives, grandmothers and friends. We took on this fight because it \nwas critical to the health of every woman in America.\n  Today, there are 2.6 million women living with breast cancer. In 1998 \nalone, more than 184,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer \nand, tragically, 44,000 women will die of this dreaded disease. Breast \ncancer is still the most common form of cancer in women; every 3 \nminutes another woman is diagnosed and every 11 minutes another woman \ndies of breast cancer.\n  I want to tell you, Mr. President, about one of those women, because \nthe battle against breast cancer is not about statistics--it's about \nreal women who are in the fight of their lives. Janet Franquet, a young \nwoman, just 31 years old, from my home state of New York was recently \ndenied reconstructive surgery following a mastectomy.\n  Janet Franquet was diagnosed with an extremely aggressive form of \nbreast cancer on December 11, 1997. Mrs. Franquet required a mastectomy \nand a very intricate, involved reconstruction of the breast following \nher mastectomy. The wound site required her surgeon to perform a very \nextensive procedure, medically necessary due to the considerable wound \nsite after the removal of her breast.\n  Mrs. Franquet's insurance provider, the National Organization of \nIndustrial Trade Unions (NOITU) Insurance Trust Fund refused to cover \nthe reconstruction of Mrs. Franquet's breast. Imagine the shock and \nhorror of being told by your HMO that surgery following the removal of \nyour breast is cosmetic. That is outrageous.\n  In fact, when the surgeon performing the reconstruction asked about \ncoverage, the Medical Director of the insurance company told Mrs. \nFranquet's doctor that breast reconstruction was considered cosmetic \nsurgery, and he would have to deny coverage.\n  So, Mr. President, I decided that I would give Mrs. Franquet's \ninsurance company a call. When I spoke with the Medical Director for \nthe insurance company, he told me that ``replacement of a breast is not \nmedically necessary and not covered under the plan. This is not a \nbodily function and therefore can not and should not be replaced.''\n  Mrs. Franquet and her family, were left to pay for the procedure out \nof their own pocket. The procedure cost approximately $16,500. Luckily, \nher doctor, Dr. Todd Wider, agreed to forgo payment for this life \nsaving surgery. But recently, the insurance fund agreed to pay for the \nsurgery--only after a lengthy appeal before the Board of Directors with \nlawyers and doctors testifying as to the medical necessity of the \nsurgery.\n  I ask you, Mr. President, how many other Janet Franquets are out \nthere? Will they be lucky enough to have a Dr. Wider to take care of \nthem, or will they be forced to forgo this lifesaving surgery so that \ninsurance companies can cut costs and save money?\n  That is why, Mr. President, I began this fight in the Senate and made \nit my crusade every day, at every opportunity. The D'Amato legislation \nwhich we will enact into law today makes critically important changes \nin how breast cancer patients receive medical care.\n  This important reform legislation will significantly change the way \ninsurance companies provide coverage for women diagnosed with breast \ncancer. This new law will ensure that breast cancer patients will have \naccess to reconstructive surgery following mastectomies. Too many women \nhave been denied reconstructive surgery following mastectomies because \ninsurers have deemed the procedure cosmetic and not medically \nnecessary. It is absolutely unacceptable and wrong that many insurers \nhave decided that this essential surgery is ``cosmetic.''\n  I know that there are going to be those who say let the marketplace \nwork, let free competition work. Well, that is simply naive. To say \nthat by insisting on a minimum standard, insisting on basic commonsense \nminimums we are interfering with the free market system is \npreposterous. For the government to not live up to its most basic duty \nof protecting its citizenry, that is what is wrong.\n  There exists a very basic relationship between a doctor and a patient \nthat no Member of Congress and no insurance bean counter can ever \nunderstand.\n\n[[Page S12826]]\n\nThat bond is so basic and so sacred that it is only the physician who \nis treating their patient who can truly understand it. It is only that \nphysician who can truly determine the best course of action for their \npatient and knows how to save their life. Congress has a duty to \nprotect that bond and ensure that the physician is able to practice \nmedicine.\n  This legislation is crucial not only for the women of New York, where \nbreast cancer ranks among the top in the Nation, but for the entire \ncountry as well. Our families have been ravaged by this horrible \ndisease. Our grandmothers, mothers and daughters, sisters and wives, \nchildren and friends have been afflicted at rates that are unexplained \nand far too high.\n  We must continue to work together, on a bipartisan basis, to find a \ncure for breast cancer. But until a cure is found, we must ensure that \nwomen receive the treatment they deserve. This legislation protects \nwomen and the families and friends of women who have been diagnosed \nwith breast cancer.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this bill be recognized \nas Janet's Law, after Janet Franquet, the woman who was the inspiration \nfor this bill and who in fact serves as a heroine to many women who \nwere denied reconstructive surgery prior to her. Thanks largely to Mrs. \nFranquet's efforts and determination in this issue, no woman will ever \nbe denied reconstructive surgery again. Janet's case has served as an \ninspiration for me to keep fighting in the war against breast cancer \nand should be an inspiration to every Member of Congress.\n  I thank all my colleagues for helping me pass this critical \nlegislation, and I thank the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nchairman Stevens and the majority leader, Senator Lott for their hard \nwork in ensuring the protection of American women who have been \nafflicted with breast cancer.\n\n\n                The Need to Track Former TANF Recipients\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today, I would like to call attention \nto a small but very important issue that was not addressed in the \nappropriations bill that was considered today. In short, Congress has \nnot provided the necessary funding to HHS to track what happens to \nfamilies who have been dropped from the welfare caseloads.\n  Back in April when the Senate passed the budget resolution, it \nincluded an amendment that I offered directing HHS to determine whether \nformer welfare recipients are achieving ``economic self-sufficiency'' \nonce they stop receiving benefits. But a budget resolution was never \nadopted by Congress. I ask all my colleagues, why don't we want to know \nwhat is happening to families after they leave welfare? Are we afraid \nof what we might find?\n  So many of my colleagues keep talking about the success of reform, \nciting the dramatic drop in the number of caseloads. But I ask you, do \nwe know where those families are? Are they better off? Have they \nachieved economic self-sufficiency? Or are they more deeply enmeshed in \npoverty? Why are we not interested in finding answers to these \nquestions? As policy makers it is our duty and our responsibility to \nmake sure that the policies we enact for the good of the people \nactually are doing good for the people. But if we don't go and find out \nhow they are actually affecting families, how will we know? We need to \nput in place the means to address these very critical questions, and \ndirecting HHS to set up a means of evaluating what happens to families \nis the most common sense way to approach this issue.\n  Evaluation is one of the key ingredients in good policy making and it \ndoes not take a degree in political science to realize what anyone with \ngood common sense knows: if we want to try something new, we need to \nassess how that new program works. Now when Congress enacted welfare \nreform, the goals as I understood them were to move people off of \nwelfare and dependency and into jobs and economic self-sufficiency. The \ndropping number of caseloads implies that we have met only part of the \nfirst goal--moving families off of welfare. But eliminating dependency \nand achieving economic self-sufficiency through a job that supports a \nfamily are effects that can only be determined over a longer period of \ntime. As policy makers--regardless of ideological stripe--it is our \nrole to ensure that the programs that Congress enacts to provide for \nAmerican families' well-being are effective and produce the goals we \nintended them to. We need to know what is happening with the families \nwho are affected by the new reform, whether it is in fact effectively \nhelping low income mothers and their children build a path to economic \nself-sufficiency.\n  What we do know, what everyone knows is that the caseloads have \ndropped dramatically--1.3 million families have left welfare since \nAugust of 1996 alone, that is 4.5 million total recipients including \nmothers and their children. But what that number tells us is only a \nsnapshot of the broader picture.\n  I want to take a moment to talk about this number and what it tells \nus. First of all, we have to recognize how naive it is to assume that \nall 1.3 million of those families are finding jobs and moving towards a \nlife of economic self-sufficiency, because that number only tells us \nabout families that have been dropped from the caseload--and families \ndrop from the caseloads for many different reasons. A family may lose \ntheir benefits due to sanctions, or they may leave welfare on their \nown, for many reasons which we do not know. Even more troubling is that \nalthough the number of families receiving welfare has declined, \nindicators of poverty have not shown a similar or equal rate of \ndecline, which means that many families who are eligible for assistance \nare not even applying.\n  Even among families where the parent has found a job--because without \nit they would not be receiving any assistance--we know very little. We \ndo not know how long those jobs are lasting or whether they are the \nkind of jobs that will put families on a path to economic self-\nsufficiency. Just because a parent finds a job does not mean that the \nfamily is no longer poor. Getting a job that pays a family wage, that \nenables a mother to provide a life for her children that lifts them all \nout of poverty does not happen overnight. We need to know what happens \nto families 6 months, 12 months, even a couple of years down the road. \nAnd we do not know that.\n  No one seems to know, even those members of Congress who keep \ntrumpeting the ``victory'' of welfare reform. Just a few weeks ago, in \nthe Conference Committee for the Higher Ed. bill, I asked my colleagues \nif they knew of any research demonstrating that these 1.3 million \nfamilies had indeed achieved economic self-sufficiency and no one had \nan answer for me. No one! Let me just say that accepting a very narrow \nmeasure of what has happened to 1.3 million families is no victory in \nmy book.\n  Each family is more than a number, more than another tally mark to be \nadded to that statistic of 1.3 million caseloads. Adding up that tally \ndoes not answer critical questions. Questions like why did that family \nstop receiving benefits? Was it due to an increased income from the \nmother's job? If yes, then what kind of wages is that mother now \nmaking? Does she have a job that is going to enable her to continue to \nprovide for her family, or will the next crisis of a sick child, a \nbroken down car, or some other unforeseen problem push her back to \nneeding assistance? We have very little information about the \nsituations of these 1.3 million families. We are in the dark because we \nturned off the lights.\n  Now, let me back up a minute and provide my colleagues with some \nbackground on this issue of asking the necessary questions about the \nimpact of welfare reform. Requiring states to evaluate the impact of \nnew welfare policies is not new. Not at all. In fact, prior to enacting \nthe 1996 reform, all states that applied for a waiver to try an \nexperiment with their AFDC program--and 43 out of 50 states had been \ngranted waivers by 1996--were required under the regulations of the \nwaiver to hire an outside contractor to evaluate the impact of their \nnew program. For example, in Minnesota, two of the primary criteria for \nevaluating the programs were whether the program ``helped families \nincreased their income and self-sufficiency'' and ``supported families' \nmovement toward self-support.''\n\n  But when Congress enacted TANF, states were no longer required to \ncontinue those evaluations. In fact, 24\n\n[[Page S12827]]\n\nstates stopped the evaluation process altogether, and only 19 have \napplied for funds to continue those evaluations. That means that over \nhalf of the states ended their project evaluations when Congress \ndropped the requirement to assess the impact of reform.\n  Of course these projects that I have just mentioned are not the only \nevaluations of the new reform. When states begin to apply to HHS for \nthe $1 billion in bonus money for successfully moving families into \nself-sufficiency, they will be required to report on the status of both \ncurrent and former recipients. Then, HHS will have some information \nabout what is happening. But that information will not be available \nuntil at least the Fall of 1999.\n  Last year Congress considered this issue important, since we \nspecifically earmarked $5 million in the FY98 Labor-HHS appropriations \nfor HHS to give to states interested in doing their own tracking \nstudies. And just a few weeks ago, HHS announced it had awarded grants \nto 13 state and county projects to track ``leavers''--those who have \nbeen dropped from the caseloads due to increased earnings or sanctions, \nand those who have not even applied for assistance even though they are \neligible. This is an example of responsible policy making, and I will \nbe very interested in the outcomes of these evaluations. But in a \nyear's time, these 13 projects will be cut off at the knees. These \nprojects will be unable to complete their planned evaluations because \nthey will not have the necessary funds. Why? Because Congress has \nfailed to appropriate similar funds for FY99. I ask you again, what are \nwe afraid of?\n  We do have some information, but it is not very helpful. You might \nnot want to know about it, but I'm going to talk about it anyway, \nbecause I want to illustrate that what information we do have is very, \nvery limited.\n  Recently released reports give us some idea of what is happening, but \nthere are huge holes in what we do know. The good news is that many \nstates--31 according to the National Conference of State Legislatures--\nare conducting various types of tracking studies on their own. The bad \nnews is that these studies are wildly diverse in terms of who they \ntrack, how long they track recipients, and when their reports will be \navailable to the public.\n  Let me just give you a snapshot of what this kind of tracking system \nlooks like. The studies run the gamut from those examining all closed \ncases, to only sanctioned cases, to cases closed due to increased \nearnings, to families diverted from ever applying for assistance. And \nthe time frames of the studies range from 6 months to five years and \neverything in between.\n  But the really frustrating thing about what appears to be a potential \nwealth of data is that there is no central clearinghouse for it. As I \nmentioned before, HHS received a special $5 million appropriation for \nFY98 to fund some tracking studies. But the funds were only to provide \nhelp to states to do their own tracking. It did not provide funds so \nthat HHS could act as a central location for analyzing the results of \nthese studies. So, while I was glad that Congress committed necessary \nresources to studying what happens to families after they leave \nwelfare, that is only part of the job. We need an efficient means of \nanalyzing the information that we do collect, and directing HHS to \nserve as a central clearinghouse would have been the best way of doing \nthat.\n  There are other problems with this scatter-shot approach to tracking. \nOne of them is that it does not allow us to trace what happens to \nfamilies that get sanctioned. Do they get caught up in a ``churning'' \ncycle, getting sent to the end of the line, deepening the hardship of \nan already poor family? One study in Iowa of families that had been \nsanctioned found that only 30% were working 30 hours a week or more and \nalmost half of them had experienced a dramatic decrease in their income \n(over $380 per month).\n  From several studies, in New Jersey, Iowa, and Tennessee, it seems \nthat many families who are being dropped from welfare due to sanctions \nare turning to other family members for assistance. A study in New \nJersey showed that almost 50% of the families that were sanctioned and \nlost their benefits turned to family for aid; in Tennessee, 71% sought \nhelp from other family members. While I understand the intent of \nwelfare reform was to decrease families' dependency on welfare, I do \nnot think--and I am confident that my colleagues agree--that it was \nCongress's intent to shift the burden of assistance to other low income \nfamilies who are just keeping their own heads above water.\n  Families that get sanctioned are at least within the state's data \nbase and are easier to track. The groups that we really know very \nlittle about are those families in need who never even make it onto the \nofficial welfare roles. Many families are discouraged from even \napplying for aid or get diverted by receiving a lump sum of 2 or 3 \nmonths of benefits. In New York City--in Brooklyn and Queens--the \nprimary goal of city welfare offices, according to its official manual, \nis to discourage families from even applying for assistance by \nencouraging them to get a job or depend on relatives.\n  While this may initially save the state money and reduce its \ncaseloads, shifting the need of mothers and their children to other \nfamily members spreads individual resources more thinly and risks \nexpanding the number of families in poverty. More disturbing is that \nthis phenomenon does not appear to be only happening in New York. I \nthink this is a very troubling trend that seems to be attached to these \ngroups, one that I want to bring to my colleagues' attention because I \nthink it will have greater implications for all low-income working \nfamilies.\n  As I have mentioned, very little research looks at the long term \nimpact of reform, and most of the studies I have mentioned above are \nshort-term studies. But a program in Oregon is often cited as one to \nemulate. I would like to take a moment here to tell my colleagues about \nthis particular program, because I think this case shows us the \nimportance of getting more information than just the number of \nrecipients dropped from the caseloads.\n  Unlike other welfare to work programs that focused on recipients just \ngetting a job--any job--the Portland program provided really strong \nsupport services to help families find a ``good'' job, a full-time job \nthat paid above minimum wage, included medical benefits and the \npotential for advancement. The way that the Portland program did this \nwas to take a ``mixed services'' approach. And what that translates \ninto is what I would think would be a good job search program for \nanyone, whether they were on welfare or not.\n  First, staff assessed the skills and interests of recipients, and \nthen they worked closely with individual recipients to help them plan a \nstrategy for getting what they needed to find a good job. Those folks \nthat needed educational or vocational training were sent to do that. \nTraining also included programs that helped parents who needed some \nlife skills training to improve their employability. And as recipients \nwere participating in these programs, program staff worked closely with \nlocal companies and employers to match recipients with good jobs where \nthey would succeed.\n  For many families, this approach worked to get them jobs that did pay \nhigher than the minimum wage at the time ($4.15), and many were still \nat their jobs at the end of two years. But, there is a finer point that \nneeds to be made about what appears to be good news in this study. The \njobs that parents got were higher than minimum wage, but they were \nstill only $6 an hour at the most. Well, that just isn't enough for a \nfamily of three--a mother and two children, which is what the average \nfamily on welfare consists of--to make ends meet. And the bigger \ndownside is that although many families were able to leave welfare, 40% \nof families were still receiving cash assistance at the end of two \nyears.\n  Even if we were to be optimistic about the potential for these $6 an \nhour jobs to translate into job advancement and greater earnings, what \nabout the other 40% who still needed cash assistance? We cannot be \ncelebrating welfare reform as a ``success'' when so many former \nrecipients have jobs that only move them to just beyond the eligibility \nline for cash assistance but do not set them on that path to economic \nself-security. And, probably more importantly, we need to know more \nabout the specific barriers that keep those 40% of families from \ngetting a ``good job'' too. We just cannot walk away from them.\n\n[[Page S12828]]\n\n  As I mentioned, the program in Portland is unusual compared to other \nwelfare-to-work programs. On the other end of the spectrum are programs \nlike Wisconsin Works, better known as W-2. With the W-2 program, the \nbasic premise is that parents will not get cash assistance unless they \nare working. This kind of program moves parents into the work force \nvery quickly, because they need that cash assistance. But what a recent \nstudy of Milwaukee families found was that even though parents are \ngetting jobs quickly, 6 months later three quarters of them were no \nlonger employed. And of those parents who did get jobs, only 14% were \ngetting paid full time wages. That means that less than 2 out of 10 \nfamilies had a parent who was working full time.\n  This is very disturbing information. What is happening to these \nfamilies who are getting pushed into the work force so quickly that \nthey are not given the opportunity or the training to find jobs that \nare more likely to translate into sustained, full-time employment. \nBased on this study, it is very clear to me that we as policy makers \ndefinitely need to know about how other ``work first'' approaches are \naffecting families. When less than 2 out of 10 families has a parent \nbringing home a full time wage, there are a lot of families who are not \nmaking ends meet, and that is not a success in my book.\n  Looking at the administrative side, we know that since the caseloads \nhave dropped dramatically, states have more funds available to provide \nsupport services to families trying to find jobs. However, the 1.3 \nmillion drop in caseloads is only a drop in the number of families \nreceiving cash assistance; many of those families are still receiving \nother support services such as subsidized child care, transportation, \nhousing and medical care. When the labor market hits a downturn--which \nis the direction it appears to be heading--and many families are forced \nto return for cash assistance, what will happen to the states' ability \nto provide these support services necessary to put those mothers back \nin the workforce? There is much uncertainty about the future and we are \ndoing little to reduce it.\n  Even those of my colleagues who supported the 1996 welfare reform \nbill must recognize Congress's important responsibility of finding out \nwhat is happening to those 1.3 million families who have been dropped \nfrom the roles. Reform is not a one-shot deal. Real reform involves \nlong term oversight to insure that policies benefit all parties: states \nand poor mothers and their children.\n  I have always said, the true test of welfare reform will come in the \naustere economic times, when many more families will need it most. Will \nwe wait until folks are again in dire straits before we begin to gather \ninformation about how to correct the programs that we have just \nreformed? Are we really going to allow ourselves to be so short-\nsighted? Or will we recognize that our responsibility to enact good \npolicies that protect our most vulnerable populations such as poor \nmothers and their children is intrinsic to our duty as good and \neffective policy makers. Not until we are sure that this reform has \naccomplished all of its goals-- eliminating dependency and helping \nfamilies to establish and maintain economic self-sufficiency--can we \ntruly claim that this reform is good and sound policy for all.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep concern for \nsome of the provisions in the omnibus measure that we have passed \ntoday. I voted for this bill because I believe that there are some very \ngood provisions in it, and, on balance, I think it serves the American \npeople well. It re-energizes our national drug control effort. It tries \nto boost the morale and readiness of our armed forces, rather than \ncontinuing the dangerous trend toward a hollow military. It helps \nprotect citizens' second amendment rights. It prohibits Federal funding \nof needle exchanges. The bill retains language blocking Members of \nCongress, judges and members of the Federal executive service from \nreceiving a cost-of-living increase. There is a one-year moratorium on \nDepartment of Education-sponsored national testing. I voted for this \nbill because I have been assured that we have stayed within the budget \ncaps.\n  I am concerned, however, about the integrity of the budget and \nappropriations process and the classification of emergency spending \nthat has prevailed in this omnibus measure. Other Senators have spoken \nhere on the Senate floor about the dereliction of congressional duty in \nfailing to pass 13 individual spending bills during this year's session \nof the Senate. Instead, because of partisan politics, we are here \npassing a massive spending bill that rolls eight appropriations bills \ninto one large catch-all bill, which also includes dozens of extraneous \nmatters. If that is not bad enough, we have also included ``emergency'' \nspending to the tune of more than $20 billion.\n  This spending is considered outside of the budget and therefore not \nsubject to the budget caps. What this means, however, is that this $20 \nbillion comes directly out of the budget surplus. It is sometimes \nnecessary to appropriate funds for emergencies like hurricanes, floods \nor other natural disasters. I am disappointed, however, that we have \nappropriated billions of dollars for things that can hardly be \nconsidered emergencies. Our troops have been in Bosnia for three \nyears--is this a surprise? The Year 2000 problem? With foresight, we \ncould have planned for this through the regular appropriations process \nrather than designating it as an emergency. So instead of making room \nfor these spending priorities, the President has declared them \nemergencies and instead of imposing fiscal discipline, he--and we--have \nused the surplus that the President demanded be saved for Social \nSecurity to pay for them.\n  As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I think it should be our \nfirst priority next year to examine how we classify emergency spending. \nNo longer should the Congress--or the President--be allowed to spend \nour budget surplus for matters that should be paid for through the \nregular appropriations process. Second, I would like to reiterate my \nsupport for Senator Domenici's biennial budgeting bill. It is at times \nlike this that the need for biennial budgeting becomes even clearer.\n  Mr. President, as I said, this bill, though far from perfect, will \nwork more good than mischief. There are real problems with this bill \nand the process that created it; however, we must sometimes accept that \nour system of government divides power between Congress and the \nPresident. The President's priorities differ from most of our \npriorities. In these circumstances, compromise must rule the day.\n  Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I look \nforward to meeting our budgeting challenges when we return next year. I \nhope that we are able to continue on the course that we set last year \nwhen we enacted tight discretionary spending caps and charted a course \ntoward a $1.5 trillion surplus. While I am concerned about the process \nthat got us here today, I remain hopeful that we will take the \nnecessary steps next year to keep us on our course toward fiscal \nresponsibility and continued prosperity.\n\n\n                    charitable giving incentive act\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, among the provisions included in \nthe tax package we voted on today is a provision of great importance to \nthe charitable giving community: an extension of the enhanced deduction \nfor contributions of publicly-traded stock to private foundations. \nAlthough extending this deduction benefits many and is a useful tool \nfor providing funds for charitable purposes, this deduction alone is \nnot enough.\n  In this era of ever-tightening fiscal constraints, we have asked our \ncommunities to do more and more for those less fortunate. Charitable \norganizations in our communities have become an integral part of the \nsafety net for the poor and homeless and significant sources of \nassistance for education, health care, child development and the arts.\n  To meet the increasing deficit in unmet social needs, the government \ncannot merely expect the private sector to fill the gap, but must \nprovide the leadership for the use of private sector resources through \nchanges in the Tax Code. One source of untapped resources for \ncharitable purposes is the contribution of closely held corporate \nstock. Under current law, the tax cost of contributing closely held \nstock to a charity or foundation is prohibitive, and it\n\n[[Page S12829]]\n\ndiscourages families and owners from disposing of their businesses in \nthis manner.\n  Earlier this year, I was joined by Senators Feinstein, Wyden, Baucus, \nand Gorton in introducing legislation that would provide an incentive \nto business owners to use their corporate wealth for charitable causes. \nS. 1412, the Charitable Giving Incentive Act of 1998, would permit a \nclosely-held business to transfer its assets into a 501(c)(3) \ncharitable organization without paying the 35 percent corporate level \ntax. Thus, the recipient charity would receive the full benefit of the \ngift. Identical legislation has also been introduced in the House by \nRepresentatives Dunn, Furse, Nethercutt, Hooley, Paul, and Smith of \nOregon.\n  In addition to this bipartisan congressional support, we have \ngarnered support from the charitable community. It is my intention to \nreintroduce this legislation in the 106th Congress, and I look forward \nto working with the Finance Committee Chairman Roth, Ranking Member \nMoynihan and my Senate colleagues to legislate changes that will make \nit easier for the citizens of this country to give to charitable \ncauses.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from \norganizations supporting the legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  October 9, 1998.\n     Senator William Roth,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on Finance, U.S. Senate, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       The undersigned organizations are all tax exempt 501(c)(3) \n     charitable entities, or representatives thereof, whose \n     efforts are dependent upon the charitable giving of concerned \n     individuals. With the needs of our communities growing, and \n     in some cases the financial support from government agencies \n     diminishing, many endeavors are increasingly reliant upon a \n     core group of concerned, consistent, and active givers. It is \n     important to encourage and reward the selfless sharing by \n     this group and to expand its membership.\n       Accordingly, we support legislation that has been \n     introduced in this Congress to provide tax incentives for the \n     donation of significant amounts of closely-held stock. H.R. \n     3029 and S. 1412, the Charitable Giving Incentive Act, would \n     permit the tax-free liquidation of a closely-held corporation \n     into a charity if at least 80 percent of the stock of the \n     corporation were donated to a 501(c)(3) organization upon the \n     death of a donor. Thus, the 35 percent corporate tax that \n     would otherwise be paid is not imposed: all of the value of \n     the contribution would go to charitable purposes. This is the \n     same tax result as would occur if the business had been held \n     in non-corporate form.\n       The current disincentive for substantial contributions of \n     closely-held stock should be corrected at the earliest \n     opportunity. We believe such a change would encourage \n     additional transfers to charity because the donors will see \n     more of the benefit going to the charity and not to taxes. We \n     hope that appropriate tax incentives will encourage more \n     families to devote significant portions of their businesses, \n     and their wealth, to charitable purposes.\n       As a key member of Congress, we urge your active support \n     for this effort to expand charitable giving by individuals \n     and businesses. The needs are great. While government cannot \n     do it all, it can provide leadership for others to do more by \n     removing current impediments. Your support and assistance are \n     needed. Thank you for your favorable consideration of this \n     request.\n           Sincerely,\n       Council on Foundations; Council of Jewish Federations; The \n     Children's Foundation; The National Federation of Nonprofits; \n     and The National Community Action Foundation.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I voted against the \nOmnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for \nFiscal Year 1999. One of the principal reasons why I voted against the \nbill is that it does not include two critically important provisions of \nthe Smith amendment to the Commerce, Justice, State appropriations bill \nthat passed the Senate on July 21, 1998, by a vote of 69-31. The Smith \namendment provided major protections of the rights of law-abiding gun \nowners under the second amendment to the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  As passed by the Senate last July, the Smith amendment included three \nmajor provisions. First, the Smith amendment prohibited the Federal \nBureau of Investigation from charging a user fee or ``gun tax'' for the \nso-called Brady handgun National Instant Check System (NICS) that will \ngo into effect later this year. Second, the Smith amendment required \nthe ``immediate destruction'' of all records related to gun purchasers \nwho are determined by the system to be legally entitled to buy a gun. \nThird, the Smith amendment created a private cause of action on the \npart of any individual gun purchaser who is the victim of a violation \nof either or both of the first two provisions of the amendment.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, only the first provision of the Smith \namendment remains intact in the final version of the omnibus \nappropriations bill. Although I am pleased that the FBI's gun tax \nscheme is now dead, I am deeply disappointed that those who negotiated \nthis bill with the administration have ignored the legislatively \nexpressed will of 69 United States Senators by rendering all but \nmeaningless the second, and eliminating altogether the third, \nprovisions of the Smith amendment.\n  The omnibus appropriations bill replaces the Smith amendment's \nrequirement for the ``immediate destruction'' of records on law-abiding \ngun owners with one that only requires ``destruction'' of such records. \nThus, the bill leaves open to question just how long the FBI may \nlawfully retain such records.\n  Although the omnibus appropriations bill does not include the Smith \namendment's language explicitly creating a private cause of action, I \nbelieve that the bill retains an implied cause of action. Assuming that \nthe courts will interpret the new law in a manner that gives full \neffect to legislative intent, judges will recognize such an implied \ncause of action on the part of gun owners to sue in Federal court in \norder to protect their rights under the Smith amendment.\n  Mr. President, early in the 106th Congress next year, I will be \nintroducing legislation encompassing all of the protections of the \nSmith amendment for which 69 Senators voted last July.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I voted in favor of the omnibus \nappropriations bill this morning, but I did so with some reluctance. \nWhile I am marginally pleased with this bill's contribution to \neducation and defense, my primary concern is the $20.9 billion in \nemergency spending included in this bill that further jeopardizes the \nSocial Security trust fund.\n  In July, the Congressional Budget Office predicted the Federal \nGovernment will run a $63 billion surplus in 1998 if the Social \nSecurity trust fund is included in the budget calculations. We still \nrun a $41 billion deficit, however, if the surplus in the Social \nSecurity trust fund is excluded. The Federal Government will not run a \nsurplus without the inclusion of the Social Security trust fund until \n2002, when CBO expects a $1 billion surplus. By 2008, the surplus will \nrise to $64 billion, without counting the Social Security trust fund.\n  However, the omnibus appropriations package includes $20.9 billion in \nemergency spending--spending outside of the caps established in last \nyear's balanced budget agreement, spending that is not paid for with \noffsets in other government programs.\n  So how are we paying for $20.9 billion in emergency spending? We're \nusing money from the surplus--a surplus that doesn't exist yet unless \nwe include the Social Security trust fund in our calculations.\n  I am dismayed by this outcome, especially when I recall the way we \nstarted this year. The President urged Congress to ``Save Social \nSecurity First'' during his State of the Union Address in January. In \nlate April, the President again stated, ``I will resist any proposals \nthat would squander the budget surplus, whether on new spending \nprograms or new tax cuts until Social Security is strengthened for the \nlong-term.''\n  Apparently, the President is ignoring his own advice. During \nnegotiations over the appropriations package, the President pushed for \n$20 billion in so-called emergency spending. He did not propose to \noffset this spending with cuts in other Government programs. In fact, \nby categorizing his spending requests as ``emergencies,'' he plans to \nspend a large part of the surplus he himself designated for saving \nSocial Security in January.\n  Frankly, I question the legitimacy of the ``emergencies'' identified \nby the President--the year 2000 computer problem, military \nresponsibilities in Bosnia, and the decennial census.\n\n[[Page S12830]]\n\nThese so-called emergencies have been on the radar screen for years. \nUnfortunately, the President failed to place a priority on these \nchallenges when he gave Congress his budget in February.\n  Now we have several ``emergencies'' for which the President is \nwilling to dip into the surplus he deemed sacred in January--a surplus \nthat does not exist unless we tap into the Social Security trust fund.\n  Unfortunately, Congress capitulated to the President's inconsistent \ndemands and policies. Today we approved a spending package that dips \ninto the surplus that should be used to reform Social Security--a \nsurplus that only exists with the current, but temporary, surplus in \nthe Social Security trust fund.\n\n  Social Security reform is expected to top next year's congressional \nagenda. Unfortunately, this spending package starts us off on the wrong \nfoot.\n  The President is willing to stick to his commitment to ``Save Social \nSecurity First'' when he wants to deny taxpayers tax relief. However, \nthe surplus appears to be fair game when we are unwilling to make the \ntough choices needed to fund reprogramming government computers for the \nYear 2000, our continued military presence in Bosnia, or a \nresponsibility as old as the Constitution--the decennial census.\n  Finally, I would like to stress my sincere hope that Congress and the \nPresident will engage in a constructive and honest debate over how to \nreform the Social Security system next year. We can't politicize this \nissue--our children and grandchildren depend on an honest and \nbipartisan reform of a system that will not meet its obligations for \nthe next generation of retirees.\n  After declaring Social Security a priority during the State of the \nUnion Address, the White House fell silent--invoking the famous pledge \nonly when politically expedient. After President Clinton's speech, a \nnumber of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have made tough \nchoices and released Social Security reform packages. The White House \nmust engage in this process. We do need to save Social Security first.\n  While I admit that I do not approve of the manner in which the \nemergency spending was added to this bill, I am pleased that it \nprovides a much needed additional $7.5 billion for the Department of \nDefense to ensure the readiness of our nation's armed forces, to tackle \nthe Y2K problem and sets aside funding for a ballistic missile defense. \nAfter 14 straight years of declining defense spending, the readiness of \nU.S. Armed Forces is clearly at risk.\n  By 2003, active duty military personnel strength will decline almost \nin half from 2.2 million to 1.36 million, the number of active Army \ndivisions will drop from 18 to 10, the number of Navy ships will drop \nfrom 569 to 346, and the number of Air Force fighter wings will be \ndecreased from 25 to 13.\n  At the same time, we are spending more of our defense resources on \npeacekeeping missions and our military personnel are spending more and \nmore time on overseas deployments and less time training. If this trend \ncontinues it is unlikely the U.S. armed forces will not be the \npreeminent military force they were during the gulf war.\n  Unless we take action now to modernize our weapons systems, aircraft, \nand ships, other nations may catch up to the U.S. technologically, \nplacing our military personnel at greater risk and eroding the tactical \nadvantages they enjoy on the battlefield today. We must work to ensure \nthat our fighter planes, tanks, submarines, and missiles are the best \nin the world.\n  This bill provides $1.1 billion to fund urgent readiness shortfalls \nin the services, such as flying hours, spare parts, depot maintenance, \npersonnel recruiting and retention initiatives.\n  One billion is also set aside for a strategic anti-ballistic missile \ndefense system. I'm pleased that appropriators recognized this priority \nas rogue states aggressively pursue the acquisition of nuclear and \nchemical weapons technology. It is disappointing that the efforts of my \ncolleague Senator Cochran to pass legislation to establish a National \nMissile Defense system has failed two times this year by a margin of \nonly one vote.\n  Not surprisingly, education was another issue the White House \ndemagogued in this process for political purposes. This is a debate I \npersonally welcome. This year's spending negotiations drew a bright \nline between the President and Republicans. The amount of money was \nnever an issue. In fact, our budget agreement matched dollar-for-dollar \nthe President's request for education spending. The debate was not \nabout money--but about who gets to spend it.\n  Some Republican priorities were clearly represented in the omnibus \npackage. This bill includees a $32.7 billion investment in our \nchildren's education; $91 million more than the President requested for \ndisadvantaged students and $500 million more than the President thought \nwe should spend on special education. And this bill includes $1.2 \nbillion for school districts to hire new teachers.\n  This last program, providing new teachers for our nation's schools \nprovided a real opportunity to debate the fundamentally different \napproach Republicans and Democrats have toward our nation's schools. \nWho do you trust with our children's education? Bureaucrats in \nWashington DC? Or those who know our children by name--their parents, \nteachers, and locally elected school board members.\n  Through this process it was clear that the President simply wanted to \nrepeat the pattern of more top down control from Washington DC, new \nrules and regulations, more bureaucrats and more paperwork meaning that \nless money reaches our nation's classrooms.\n  According to the House Education at the Crossroads report, we already \nhave some 760 Federal education programs, requiring over 48.6 million \nhours worth of paperwork per year. Both the House and Senate recognize \nthat we simply cannot continue to add to that burden. Earlier this year \nboth bodies approved measures which would radically change the way \neducation funs are spent. The House approved the Dollars to the \nClassroom Act on September 18, 1998 and the Senate approved my block \ngrant approach earlier this year on the Coverdell education savings \naccount bill. Both proposals support the same philosophical approach, \neducation decisions should be made by those closest to our children--\ntheir parents, teachers and locally elected school board members--not \nWashington, DC bureaucrats.\n  This new initiative to hire teachers represents a first step toward \ntrusting local decisions regarding our children's education. \nRepublicans were responsible for making sure that 100% of this new \nmoney would be spent by our local school districts not by Federal or \nState bureaucrats. Schools will be able to hire teachers for any grade, \nno matter where the need is and schools may hire special education \nteachers; neither would have been possible under the President's \nprescriptive proposal.\n  Importantly, few rules and regulations will accompany this new money. \nThe President wanted to add this money to a program that already has \n171 pages of ``non-regulatory guidance'' from the Federal Government. \nWith the Federal Government providing only 6 percent of the funding for \nour local schools, and 50 percent of the regulation and paperwork--it \nwas important that we not add to that burden. Republicans insisted that \nthis new money be funneled through an existing block grant program.\n  In a 1997 State of Education speech, Secretary Riley said, ``* * * we \nshould not cloud our children's future with silly arguments about \nFederal Government intrusion.''\n  But that is exactly what this debate was and is about--and it \ncouldn't be more important. It will again be the focus of debate next \nyear as Congress works to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act.\n  I will continue to work in the 106th Congress to save Social Security \nand to restore authority over our children's education to those who are \nclosest to our children--their parents, teachers, principals, and \nlocally elected school board members.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I expressed yesterday my abhorrence of the \nprocess that produced this behemoth Omnibus Bill. I said, however, that \nI would vote for it, because it contained some good things for the \nNation. That is true, but I just could not do it. I cannot support such \na twisting of constitutional intent and of the legislative process. \nTherefore, I voted no, so that I can sleep more peacefully tonight.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, earlier today, we passed an Omnibus \nAppropriations bill that expressed important\n\n[[Page S12831]]\n\nCongressional intent regarding the education of American children. By \npassing legislation to reduce class size in public schools, we are \ndoing something concrete, common-sense, and effective to improve the \nquality of education across America. I am very proud of this Congress \ntoday.\n  But although there has been plenty of attention this last week \ndevoted to the issue of class size reduction through helping local \nschool districts to hire qualified teachers, I feel we are in danger of \noverlooking the true significance of the policy and funding we have \npassed here today.\n  By making this investment, which we will be increasing over the next \nseveral years, we are sending an important message to every community \nin this nation. The message is ``we have been listening. We have heard \nyou. You've been saying that class size reduction is important because \nit makes a tangible difference in real-world public schools.''\n  This new law will not solve every problem in every school in America; \nthat is not the appropriate federal role. Local communities make the \ndecisions that improve local schools. The federal role is to support \nlocal decisions. I want people to know that Congress is finally \nlistening; this place is starting to ring with your voice. This class \nsize effort will help jump-start discussions in every local community \nand every state legislature--where the class size decisions that affect \nall schools will be made. And, this appropriations bill puts us all on \nthe road to doing something tangible to helping the students in \nAmerica's schools.\n  Some in Congress have made the argument: ``who do you trust to make \ndecisions regarding the education of your children, your local \neducators and school boards, or some faceless bureaucrat in Washington, \nD.C.?''\n  For 5 years, I was a school board member in the Shoreline School \nDistrict. I saw first-hand how every decision gets made in a school \ndistrict, including how many teachers get hired, and what the budget \nwill be for supplies, and what changes will be made to the bus \nschedule. And in those years and all the years since, I have heard \nlocal citizens say about the laws that affect their schools that they \nwant their government to learn how to listen to the people it \nrepresents.\n  I have not heard people say that the government should walk away from \nits responsibilities, to support the children in public schools across \nAmerica. I have not heard people advocate that the federal government \nshould ignore its responsibility to prevent unfair treatment, or that \nit should ignore national priorities.\n  I have heard many times, however, parents and other local citizens \nask very loudly for government to set goals, to get us on the right \npath, to do what works, to streamline its efforts, and to invest in \ncommon-sense solutions.\n  At the top of this list is class size reduction. Class size is \ncommon-sense, and it does work.\n  The research shows it:\n  A 1989 study of the Tennessee STAR program, which compared the \nperformance of students in grades K-3 in small and regular-sized \nclasses, found that students in small classes (13 to 17 students) \nsignificantly outperformed other students in math and reading, every \nyear, at all grade levels, across all geographic areas.\n  A follow-up study of the STAR program in 1995 found that students in \nsmall classes in grades K-3 continued to outperform their peers at \nleast through grade 8, with achievement advantages especially large for \nminority students.\n  Other state and local studies have since found that students in \nsmaller classes outperform their peers in reading and math, perform as \nwell or better than students in magnet or voucher schools, and that \ngains are especially significant among African-American males.\n  A 1997 national study by Educational Testing Service found that \nsmaller class size raises average achievement for students in fourth- \nand eighth-grade math, especially for low-income students in ``high-\ncost'' regions.\n  Particularly of note in the 1997 ETS study was the finding that in \neighth-grade, the achievement effect comes about through the better \ndiscipline and learning environment smaller class size produces. As \npolicy-makers try to make decisions that will affect students in the \ncritical years of middle-school, class size makes a difference in terms \nof both behavior and academic achievement.\n  In addition, state organizations representing thousands of local \neducators know that hiring more high-qualified teachers to reduce class \nsize works:\n  Larry Swift, Executive Director Emeritus of the Washington State \nSchool Directors' Association says it well:\n\n       As we pursue our state's goal of improving learning for all \n     of our students, it becomes increasingly important that all \n     of our resources be used efficiently and effectively. The \n     most valuable resource in today's schools is the people who \n     devote their time and effort to make schools successful--the \n     teachers. Reducing the ratio of students to adults is \n     particularly critical for youngsters with a variety of \n     learning challenges that must be overcome if those students \n     are to meet the new, higher learning standards.\n\n  Kenneth Winkes, with the Washington Association of School Principals \nsays:\n\n       It is increasingly evident that students entering our \n     schools have diverse and unique needs which can only be \n     addressed by principals, teachers, and support personnel who \n     are not overwhelmed by crowded classrooms. Rather, educators \n     must be able to devote attention to each student in smaller, \n     more manageable classes.\n\n  Lee Ann Prielipp, President of the Washington Education Association \nsays: ``When educators have too many students in a class, it is hard \nfor them to give each student the individual attention that students \nneed. It is this individual attention that is at the heart of the \nlearning process, and it is crucial in helping our students succeed.''\n  And, as I've pointed out before, students themselves have thoughts \nabout the importance of class size reduction:\n  Brooke Bodnar, age 16, recently moved from a school with larger \nclasses to Olympia High School, which has smaller classes. She says: \n``. . . with smaller classes I'm learning so much more. Class is going \nso much faster.''\n  Jared Stueckle, age 16, a junior at Selah High School, believes that \neducation should be a higher priority in funding, and that class size \nis a good investment. Jared says: ``The classes in which the number (of \nstudents) is lower I generally do better, but in a crowded class, the \nteacher does not give us enough individual attention.''\n  Meghan Sullivan, age 15, a 10th grader at Tumwater High School, says: \n``. . . reduction is needed especially at the K-5 grade levels. This is \nthe beginning of their education and this is where they form study \nhabits and learning skills, so it's more important to get some one-on-\none contact with teachers.''\n  Antonella Novi, age 18, a senior at Anacortes High School, says:\n  ``Smaller class sizes enrich the learning experience for the student \nand the teaching experience for the teacher.''\n  Jaime Oberlander, age 16, a junior at Tumwater High School, says:\n  ``I know that I have learned more in smaller classes. I have a \nstronger relationship with the teacher. I am less intimidated to \nparticipate in class discussions or ask for help when I need it. I also \nreceive more feedback from my teacher . . . my teacher can spend more \ntime critiquing my work and helping me to learn.''\n  The American people have said over and over how important class size \nreduction is to them. When students start school in the fall, parents \nusually ask two questions: ``Who is my child's teacher?'' and ``How \nmany students will be in my child's class?'' This is because, next to \nparents and family, the teacher is one of the most important adults in \nevery child's life. We want that teacher to be the best-trained, most-\nqualified person available. And, we want the number of students in \nclass to be manageable, so each student has access to the teacher, and \nthe teacher is not reduced to doing ``crowd control.''\n  Qualified teachers in small classes can provide students with more \nindividualized attention, spend more time on instruction and less on \ndiscipline and other tasks, cover more material more effectively, and \nwork more closely with parents. Today Congress has done something \nsignificant and important--taken the first step to helping local \ncommunities increase the number and quality of the teachers in \nAmerica's schools.\n\n[[Page S12832]]\n\n  I want to thank all those who helped this happen, from the President \nand his staff, to Secretary Riley and those who work so diligently, to \nSenator Daschle and our Democratic Leadership in both the Senate and \nthe House. I want to particularly thank Senator Harkin, who worked with \nme on a strategy to turn the early defeat of the Administration's \nlarger class size proposal into a one-year version, funded through an \nexisting program--a clear victory for every student in America. I also \nwant to especially thank Senator Ted Kennedy for his stalwart efforts \nto negotiate the final elements of this bill in consultation with me. \nHis work is always excellent, here particularly so.\n  And I'd like to single out the people who joined me as co-sponsors of \nmy bill, the Class Size Reduction and Teacher Quality Improvement Act \nof 1998: Senators Kennedy, Dodd, Daschle, Moseley-Braun, Boxer, Levin, \nRobb, Lieberman, Reed, Lautenberg, Landrieu, Torricelli, Bryan, Kerry, \nAkaka, Glenn, Bingaman, and Mikulski. And I would like to thank Senator \nRuss Feingold who has given so much time and attention to the issue of \nclass size reduction, and recognizing local efforts.\n  Finally, I would like to thank a few key staff people who worked on \nthis issue all year: Marsha Simon, Ellen Murray, and Bettilou Taylor \nfrom the Appropriations Committee staff and Bev Schroeder with Senator \nHarkin, Joan Huffer with Senator Daschle, and Danica Petroshius with \nSenator Kennedy and Amy Abraham with the Budget Committee. I would also \nlike to thank Greg Williamson, Micki Aronson, April Graff, Kennie \nEndelman and Minerva Lopez with my staff.\n  As with all things, the class size legislation would not have passed \nwithout the efforts of many, many people all working with \ndetermination, willing to make compromises on details and get to the \nimportant goals.\n  On other educational issues, we have also made progress this year. \nThe funding levels for adult and family literacy programs have seen \nmodest improvement--something I've worked hard for, and something that \nneeds more improvement. And children's literacy has seen an important \nfirst step, in passage and funding for the Reading Excellence Act. \nReading efforts around the country and in my state should look on this \nnational attention to reading as the first step to further support.\n  On education technology, we have made such important investments. Not \nonly did we fund $75 million for teacher technology training for pre-\nservice teachers, but this year we passed the Higher Education Act, \nwhich includes my Teacher Technology Training bill, and we have \nprovided another $75 million to fund the partnerships that will make \nthe new law possible in every local community.\n  On funding for the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act, we \nhave included the $500 million I asked for in my budget amendment \nearlier this year, and we did not have to jeopardize other educational \npriorities to do it. In addition, by including special education \nteachers in the class size proposal, we have taken important steps to \nhelping local communities deal with the important educational needs of \nall students.\n  There were also mis-steps in this bill--cuts to our schools that did \nnot need to happen, negative language that will stir up unnecessary \nill-feelings, or funding shifts, such as the one under the Safe and \nDrug-Free Schools program, that should have been done in a way more \nreflective of local expertise. But all in all this is a good bill for \neducation, and puts us on the right path.\n  The Americans I talk to about education funding usually cannot \nbelieve that education is really a priority in Congress. After all, \nonly 1.8 percent of overall education spending goes to education. This \nis the next great challenge. People want Congress to live up to its \nresponsibilities, to look at its priorities, and to listen to people in \ncommunities across this great nation. This year, we made some important \ninvestments. Next year, we reauthorize the major K-12 education laws. \nWe must look to all of these processes with respect for local \nknowledge, with bipartisanship, and with a steadfast determination to \nmaking education better for all students.\n\n\n                     GULF WAR VETERANS ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I want to highlight a provision contained \nwithin this massive omnibus appropriations bill, H.R. 4328, that \naddresses a longstanding debt owed by this nation to the veterans of \nthe Persian Gulf War. Title XVI of Division C of this bill contains the \nPersian Gulf War Veterans Act of 1998. In five short sections, the \nPersian Gulf War Veterans Act of 1998 lays out a sound, scientific \nprocess by which the Secretary of Veterans Affairs may make a \ndetermination, based on the recommendations of the National Academy of \nSciences or other sound scientific or medical evidence, that diseases \nsuffered by Gulf War veterans are linked to hazardous materials they \nwere exposed to during that conflict. That is, the Secretary now has a \ncredible process to determine what diseases should be considered \nservice-connected for purposes of providing health care and disability \ncompensation to Gulf War veterans.\n  This is not some give-away program, but a long overdue recognition \nthat Gulf War veterans may be suffering from invisible wartime wounds \njust as real as any left by bullets--wounds to their immune systems, to \ntheir muscles and joints, or to their internal organs, caused by the \ntoxic fog of chemicals, oil well fires, and medications in which they \nwere immersed. This nation has a long history of caring for the men and \nwomen who were wounded in her service, and it is a shame that it took \nover seven years to recognize and honor our commitment to these \nveterans.\n  I have seen some news reports that this provision will cost between \n$1 and $6 billion over ten years. I do not know what these estimates \nare based on. The Congressional Budget Office determined that this \nprogram would cost $40 million over the first five years, and a total \nof $490 million over ten years. That is not an extravagant bill to pay \nfor a war that cost the United States over $60 billion for less than \ntwo months of actual fighting--for a mere 100 hours of actual on-the-\nground combat. Almost 700,000 service personnel were in the Southwest \nAsia theater during the initial phase of the conflict, and over one \nmillion service personnel have pulled tours of duty in Saudi Arabia and \nKuwait since 1991. Over 120,000 of these men and women are now on \nDepartment of Defense or Department of Veterans Affairs Gulf War \nregistries, many suffering from multiple debilitating symptoms since \ntheir service in the Gulf.\n  The provisions in this omnibus bill were extracted from S. 2358, a \nbill I introduced with Senator Rockefeller and Senator Specter, the \nRanking Member and Chairman, respectively, of the Senate Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, on July 27. I am proud of this collaboration, which \nI believe produced a sound as well as needed piece of legislation. \nAlthough S. 2358 was adopted by the Senate in the closing days of this \nCongress, and after the process of putting together the omnibus \nappropriations bill had begun, no action was taken on it by the House \nof Representatives. Some elements of S. 2358 were included in two \nHouse-passed bills, H.R. 3980 and H.R. 4110, that were sent to the \nSenate, again, after the process of putting together the omnibus \nappropriations bill had begun. In my opinion, these bills fell far \nshort of delivering on our commitment to Gulf War veterans.\n  In both H.R. 3980 and H.R. 4110, the National Academy of Sciences was \ndirected to conduct a study and to make recommendations to the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs regarding illnesses that might be linked \nto service in the Gulf. But, the Secretary was directed only to make \nrecommendations to Congress. The veterans would not receive any \nimmediate assistance. It would be up to Congress to make the \ndetermination of service connection, find the funds to pay for it, and \nconvince both Houses of Congress and the President to agree that action \nshould be taken. Mr. President, I do not believe that adding this kind \nof delay to the process aids our veterans. We can do better, and we did \nbetter in S. 2358. Let the Secretary do his job, and if we do not like \nthe way he carries out his job, then we can take corrective action.\n  Mr. President, I have already noted that these compromise bills \narrived in the Senate late in this session, after work on the omnibus \nappropriations bill had begun. As the Ranking Member on the Senate \nAppropriations Committee, I had already added S. 2358 to the\n\n[[Page S12833]]\n\nlist of legislation to be considered for inclusion in the omnibus \npackage. I did this not because I approve of this way of passing \nlegislation on an appropriations bill and especially not on a \nmonstrosity like this omnibus bill, but because I saw an opportunity to \ndo something useful and needed for these veterans. They do not deserve \nany additional delay. And when I saw that the compromise language \ncontained only a study, and the possibility of further delay for these \nveterans, I became determined to include the key elements of S. 2358 in \nthe omnibus appropriations bill.\n  Now, I have been noted for my stubbornness--my friends call it \ntenacity or perseverance, but my opponents call it stubbornness. On \nthis matter, I was determined, tenacious, persistent, and, yes, even \nstubborn. As a conferee on the omnibus appropriations bill, I was able \nto defend my position. This section of the omnibus bill was among the \nlast issues decided. I sincerely thank my colleagues, Senator Stevens, \nChairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Representatives \nLivingston and Obey, the Chairman and Ranking Member, respectively, of \nthe House Appropriations Committee, who supported my efforts to include \nthis provision in the final bill. They did this over the objections of \nthe Administration. For their leadership and courage in defending the \ninterests of Gulf War veterans they merit great praise.\n  The veterans of the Gulf War have struggled for seven years to have \ntheir wartime sacrifices recognized for what they are--the scars of \nbattle. I hope that Title XVI of Division C of H.R. 4328 will set this \nprocess on a track that is both credible and fair, and that will follow \nthrough on our nation's commitment, in the words of Abraham Lincoln, \n``To take care of him who has borne the battle. . . .''\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, I voted for H.R. 4328, the \nomnibus appropriations bill. I believe that on balance, this \nlegislation will benefit California.\n  This bill is 4,000 pages, 38 pounds, and stands a foot tall. It \nappropriates $500 billion, funds a third of the federal government for \nfiscal year 1999, and includes many pieces of authorizing legislation. \nMy staff reviewed the entire bill yesterday. It includes properly \nwritten legislative bill language as well as many hand written changes \nand amendments. Congressional negotiators, the administration, and many \nstaff members have worked for weeks to finalize this legislation today, \nbut that work was often done behind closed doors without the full \nreview of the Senate.\n  I do not believe that this is the way the Congress should do its \nwork. Our choice today was to shut down the government or pass this \nbill.\n  I want, however, to note that the omnibus bill provides many benefits \nfor Californians.\n\n\n                               education\n\n  This bill funds several education initiatives. It includes $1.2 \nbillion to hire teachers and reduce elementary class sizes, an effort \nalready underway in California. This will mean 3,500 new teachers in \nCalifornia. This bill also includes increased funding for Head Start, \nfor Education Reform, for bilingual education, for charter schools, for \neducational technology and for student financial assistance.\n  California school enrollment is growing at 3 times the national rate. \nWe need to build 7 new classrooms a day at 25 students per class just \nto keep up with the growth in student population. We have students in \nclosets, in cafeterias, in portables. We have some of the largest class \nsizes in the nation. We have 22,000 teachers on emergency credentials. \nCalifornia ranks last in the nation in the percentage of young adults \nwith a high school diploma. Our students rank 37th in the country in \nSAT scores.\n  The California public school system has gone from one of the best, to \none of the worse. Mr. President, quite simply, we welcome this \nassistance for the California education system.\n  I am disappointed that the bill includes a ``hold harmless'' \nprovision for ESEA Title I.\n  Title I is the largest federal elementary and secondary education \nprogram, providing funds to virtually every school district in the \ncountry to educate disadvantaged children. Title I has often been \ncalled the ``anchor'' of all elementary and secondary education \nprograms since its enactment in 1965. The bill includes $7.8 billion \nfor Title I grants to school districts. California received $830 \nmillion last year.\n  Unfortunately, the bill includes a 100 percent ``hold harmless'' \nprovision under which no school district would receive an allocation \nthat is less than its allocation of the previous year. But the effect \nof the hold harmless provision for California, that has had an increase \nin the number of poor children, is not to receive all of the increase \nin funding to which we are entitled, entitled by law. Thankfully, the \nbill does include an ``extra'' $301 million that would provide some \nfunds for high-growth states like mine. California could receive as \nmuch as $60 million out of the $301 million. I believe the dollars \nshould go equally to all children in the country based on need.\n  I call on my colleagues to join me in working to join in an effort to \nmake sure the dollars follow the children.\n  This Senator pledges to devote every ounce of energy I can muster to \nhelp our schools deliver on the promise of opportunity and achievement \nthat America's public schools have always represented and I call on my \ncolleagues to join me today in this campaign.\n\n\n                         california environment\n\n  I am pleased that the Omnibus Appropriations bill includes funding \nfor a number of important land acquisition projects in California, \nincluding $2 million for the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation \nArea, $1 million for the Santa Rosa Mountains, and $1.5 million for the \ncontinued acquisition of Bair Island for the Don Edwards San Francisco \nBay National Wildlife Refuge. While I am pleased that the bill includes \n$1 million for land acquisition in the Lake Tahoe Basin, I would have \npreferred to see the $3 million provided by the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee. Lake Tahoe is an important national resource, and we need to \nmake it a higher priority if we are to stem the environmental decline \nthat is already affecting the area. I intend to work with my colleagues \nto further address the problems of Lake Tahoe in the 106th Congress.\n\n  The Salton Sea bill as approved calls for completion of a plan to \nsave the Salton Sea by January 1, 2000. It provides a total of $5 \nmillion in additional funds for biological studies and to conduct \ndemonstration projects to clean up the New and Alamo Rivers. These \nfunds, along with an additional appropriation for the Bureau of \nReclamation in a separate section of the bill, provide all the money \nthat will be required to prepare a plan and conduct all environmental \ndocumentation. As a result, Congress and the President will be able \nearly in the year 2000 to authorize and appropriate funding for a \nproject to save this incredibly valuable resource.\n\n\n                     transportation infrastructure\n\n  One of the most important sections of the omnibus appropriations bill \nprovides funding for our nation's roads, airports, and transit systems. \nThis bill will ensure that California's transit systems are more \nefficient and our roads and airports are safer. The bill will improve \nthe quality of life of California residents by increasing mobility, \nreducing congestion, and improving the environment.\n  The bill provides a total of $73 million for the Los Angeles County \nMetropolitan Transit Authority (MTA). This includes $62 million for the \nNorth Hollywood Red Line extension, $8 million for the Regional Transit \nAlternative Analysis study for the Mid city and Eastside, and $3 \nmillion for the purchase of new clean fuel buses. This funding level \nwill allow the MTA to proceed with its restructuring plan as well as \nimprove bus service and move towards the competition of two important \nrail links.\n  The bill also provides $27 million for the Tasman West Rail Extension \nproject. The Tasman West Extension will link the heavily congested \nresidential areas of Santa Clara, Sunnyvale, and Mountain View with the \nSilicon Valley. The funding in this bill will allow the project to \ncontinue without interruption and hopefully will permit it to be \ncompleted ahead of schedule and under budget as is now projected.\n  Other important California rail projects funded in this bill are: \n$23.48 million for the Sacramento south corridor extension, $3.5 \nmillion for the San\n\n[[Page S12834]]\n\nDiego Mission Valley and midcoast corridor, $3 million for the \nOceanside-Escondido light rail project, $1 million for the San \nBernardino Metrolink project, and $500,000 to upgrade the rail line \nconnecting the cities of Riverside and Perris.\n  The bill also provides almost $420 million in formula grants to \nCalifornia. These grants will fund capital projects and finance \nimprovements in equipment and facilities associated with mass \ntransportation. This is an increase of more than $40 million from \nFiscal Year 1998. Included in the formula grants are $171 million for \nLos Angeles, $98.8 million for San Francisco and Oakland, $35 million \nfor San Diego, and $26 million for San Jose. The bill also provides \n$6.2 million in grants for the special needs of elderly and disabled \npeople in California and $8.2 million for non-urbanized areas of the \nstate.\n  Another major component of the transportation appropriations bill is \nfunding for buses and bus facilities. Again, this is very important for \nCalifornia where bus systems play a vital role in the transportation \ninfrastructure of our cities. This bill provides more than $30 million \nto 30 cities and transportation authorities throughout the state. While \nI would have preferred to see a higher level of funding for many of \nthese projects, the appropriations in this bill will allow local \ncommunities to begin purchasing badly needed fuel efficient buses and \nimproving deteriorating bus facilities.\n  I am disappointed that the conference committee reduced funding for \nthe Bay Area Rapid Transit extension to the San Francisco Airport to \n$40 million. This is a dramatic cut from the $100.6 requested by the \nAdministration and will seriously impair BART's ability to complete the \nproject on schedule.\n  Project construction for the BART/SFO extension is already underway. \nContracts for over 90 percent of the construction activity have been \nawarded totaling $607 million. The State of California has recently \nagreed to provide an additional $57 million for the project. It is \nunfortunate that the federal government has failed to demonstrate the \nsame level of commitment to this project that has been shown at the \nstate and local level.\n  I believe that bringing rapid rail transit to the San Francisco \nAirport is of critical importance to continued economic viability of \nthe region. I am hopeful that this setback in federal funding will not \nendanger the project and I will work in the 106th Congress to insure \nthat additional funds are made available.\n\n\n                          Securing the Border\n\n  The bill provides $97 million next year for 1,000 additional border \npatrol agents and 140 support personnel at the border, increasing our \nability to interdict illegal aliens at the heaviest alien traffic areas \nsuch as the Southwest border. It also provides $21.8 million for \ninterior enforcement, providing the badly needed resources for INS to \nwork with state and local law enforcement against illegal immigration.\n  I am very pleased by the inclusion in the omnibus package of a number \nof measures that will have a direct impact on our efforts to prevent \nillegal narcotics from being transported across the Southwest border. \nThese provisions are good news for California.\n  I want to thank Senator DeWine and Senator Bob Graham for their many \nmonths of leadership in this effort, and for their willingness to work \nwith me to include provisions that will mean fewer drugs on the streets \nof California.\n  The supplemental appropriation portion of this bill will increase \nspending on drug interdiction by a total of $690 million for the \ncurrent fiscal year. Of that total, $90 million is designated \nspecifically for enhancements at the Southwest border, which is still, \nwithout question, ground zero for U.S. drug interdiction efforts. This \namount includes $80 million for the U.S. Customs Service to purchase \nand deploy non-intrusive inspection technology, such as truck X-rays \nand gamma-imaging for drug interdiction at high-threat seaports and \nland border ports of entry; and $10 million for INS to purchase and \ndeploy border barrier and surveillance technology, such as effective \nfences and night-vision scopes.\n  These funds will make a real difference on the ground. DEA \nAdministrator Tom Constantine recently told me that he estimates that \none ton of cocaine is smuggled across the Southwest border each and \nevery day. The smugglers are growing more sophisticated every year, and \nour agents badly need state-of-the-art technology to counter them, \nwhich this bill provides.\n  In addition, the omnibus package includes the Western Hemisphere Drug \nElimination Act, of which I was an original cosponsor. This act, which \nauthorizes $2.6 billion over the next three years for enhanced drug \ninterdiction programs, and requires annual regular reports by ONDCP and \nother drug-fighting agencies on their progress, contains two key \nprovisions which will directly impact Southwest border, and which were \nincluded at my request: authorization of funding for the U.S. Customs \nService to purchase truck X-rays as part of its 5-year technology plan; \nand authorization of $50 million for developing and purchasing computer \nsoftware and hardware to facilitate direct communication between all \nthe agencies that work on drug interdiction at the border.\n  Technology offers an important way to fight drug smuggling. Improved \ncommunication and coordination among our various border enforcement and \ndrug interdiction agencies is another. Without effective interagency \ncommunications systems between Customs, INS, the FBI, DEA, and the \nBorder Patrol, our ability to detect drug smugglers and interdict drugs \nat the border is seriously jeopardized. The funds authorized by this \nbill will enhance the effectiveness of all these agencies' interdiction \nefforts. That translates into fewer drugs on our streets.\n\n\n                         Naturalizing Citizens\n\n  The Omnibus Appropriation provides $171 million for additional \nnaturalization services of which $11.6 million will be provided \nspecifically for reducing the naturalization backlogs for those \nlocalities with backlogs of 15 months or longer. For California, San \nDiego, Los Angeles and San Francisco along with other counties who \ncurrently have a backlog of 2 years may receive the funds to help \nexpedite naturalization applications.\n\n\n                            Methamphetamine\n\n  I am very pleased that the Methamphetamine Trafficking Penalty \nEnhancement Act of 1998 was included in this bill. This provision \nincreases penalties for methamphetamine trafficking, making them \nroughly equivalent to those for trafficking in crack cocaine. \nSpecifically, it lowers the quantity of meth which qualifies for the \nhighest level of federal drug penalties from 100 grams to 50 grams, the \nsame as for crack. Dealers at this level get a 10 year mandatory \nminimum sentence for a first offense, a 20 year mandatory minimum for a \nsecond offense, and life for a third offense.\n  Similarly, it also lowers the quantity of meth which qualifies the \nnext-most serious level of federal drug penalties from 10 grams to 5 \ngrams. Again, this is the same quantity as is provided for crack. \nDealers of this amount receive a 5 year mandatory minimum for a first \noffense, and a 10 year mandatory minimum for subsequent offenses.\n\n  This provision originally was part of the Comprehensive \nMethamphetamine Control Act of 1996, which I wrote with Senators Hatch \nand Biden. We were forced to drop this provision to pass the bill by \nunanimous consent that year, and this year it was re-introduced by \nSenator Ashcroft. I am proud to be the first co-sponsor of Sen. \nAshcroft's bill.\n  Two aspects of methamphetamine make the rapid growth in California \nespecially troubling.\n  First, meth leads to paranoid, violent, and even bizarre behavior by \nhardcore users. I will never forget the report of a New Mexico man, \nhigh on meth and alcohol, who beheaded his 14-year-old son and threw \nthe head out of the window of his van, on a crowded highway.\n  Second, meth is cooked in this country in dangerous, clandestine \nlabs, which use highly flammable chemicals, blow up in explosions, and \nleave toxic, hazardous waste sites, which require environmental \ncleanup.\n  This is not a silver bullet which will solve the problem, but it is \none more useful step which we can take in this fight.\n  I am also pleased that this bill contains several appropriations \nwhich I\n\n[[Page S12835]]\n\nworked for to combat the spread of methamphetamine: $18.2 million for \nthe California Bureau of Narcotics Enforcement's anti-methamphetamine \nstrategy; $24.5 million to hire 100 new DEA agents to target meth \ntrafficking organizations; and $5 million for hazardous waste cleanup \nof lab sites.\n  I am disappointed, however, that the conferees did not support the \nSenate's appropriation of $15 million for transfer to the Drug \nDiversion Control Fee Account. The clandestine meth labs operate \nprimarily by converting legitimate pharmaceutical products, such as \npseudoephedrine and ephedrine, into meth. The Drug Diversion Control \nFee Account supports the DEA's efforts to control the diversion of such \nlegitimate pharmaceuticals to illicit use, and we should provide it \nwith greater support.\n\n\n                         justice appropriations\n\n  I am pleased that several programs for which I have worked are fully \nfunded in this bill:\n  COPS funding 88,000 police officers throughout the country now has \n$1.4 billion provided in this bill to fund another 17,000, reaching the \nPresident's goal of hiring 100,000 police--and exceeding it by 5 \npercent.\n  Local Law Enforcement Block Grant continued funding of $523 million \nfor this program, which is important to California's cities and \ncounties who utilize this funding to supplement COPS funding for non-\npersonnel law enforcement expenditures.\n  $283 million is provided for the Violence Against Women Act, \nincreasing support for these programs. I have heard from women's \norganizations in support of funding for battered woman's shelters and \nother support services. California sorely needs these resources.\n  The President's budget request of $95 million for at-risk children's \nprevention programs is fully funded, as I requested. With a growing \nadolescent population, California needs continued funding of anti-\ntruancy, mentoring, and curfew initiatives.\n  A total of $40 million is provided in various ways for the successful \nWeed and Seed program. Criminal gang activity is a severe problem in \nmany California cities and localities, and many of these California \ngangs spread their criminal activity to other states. I am committed to \ncurbing the growth of gangs, and Weed and Seed prevention funds are \nessential to that effort. I have heard from a number of California \nmayors, including Mayor Omar Bradley from Compton, who support the \nprogram and expanded funding.\n  Another $12 million is provided for prevention efforts to combat \nyouth gangs, under the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act.\n\n\n                   Terrorism and technology programs\n\n  This bill also provides for several programs which were of particular \ninterest to me as ranking member of the Subcommittee on Technology, \nTerrorism and Government Information of the Judiciary Committee;\n\n  Extensive funding is provided for a variety of programs to combat \nterrorism and to be prepared to meet the threat which this form of evil \nposes, including: $145 million for the counterterrorism fund, $135 \nmillion for state and local preparedness for the threat of chemical and \nbiological weapons, including: personnel protective gear, \ncommunications equipment, decontamination equipment, training, needs \nassessment, technology development; and bomb technician equipment. It \nalso includes: $10 million for the National Critical Infrastructure \nProtection Center, $282 million to the FBI for counter-terrorism and \nforeign counterintelligence investigations.\n  $23.4 million is authorized from Justice's asset forfeiture fund to \nsupport more efficient use of the communications spectrum by law \nenforcement. The need to have adequate spectrum available for law \nenforcement is a particular concern of local law enforcement leaders \nfrom California. Enabling more efficient use of the available spectrum \nwill help to address this concern.\n\n\n                            crime prevention\n\n  This bill also provides for several California programs to reduce \ncrime which I have supported, including:\n  State Criminal Alien Assistance Program: I am particularly pleased \nthat continued funding of $585 million to reimburse states and \nlocalities for the cost of incarcerating criminal aliens is provided, \nrestoring the $50 million which had been cut by the Senate. This is \nparticularly important to California, which bears the lion's share of \nthe burden of incarcerating criminal aliens. This, however, is still \nnot sufficient to meet the costs borne by the states and localities, \nand I will continue to work in the future for this program.\n  Delancy Street Foundation/Criminal Justice Council Juvenile Justice \ninitiative received $750,000 earmarked for this public-private \ncomprehensive effort designed to interrupt the cycle of chronic crime \nand transform a young person's negative cycle to a positive one by \nproviding major life-altering interventions at continuous points. This \nprogram can serve as a model for the rest of the nation in \nsimultaneously decreasing juvenile crime and providing new and real \nopportunities for youths.\n  Compton's crime problems merit special consideration and treatment. \nAccording to Mayor Omar Bradley, there are 9,000 suspected gang members \nin Compton, amounting to ten percent of the City's population. \nCompton's homicide rate is nearly 10 times that of similar sized cities \nin the Southeast L.A. area, with more homicides in January alone (14) \nthan 23 of the other 27 cities had in all of 1996. Seventy-six percent \nof suspected homicide offenders were under the age of 27. The report \ndirects the Justice Department to consider grants to help fight this \nuniquely severe crime problem by upgrading Compton's woefully outdated \npolice computer system and by establishing a Compton Youth Intervention \nCenter for afterschool programs to serve as a safe haven for 1,000 \nyouth.\n  My colleagues from California, Senator Boxer, and I jointly requested \nthis $2 million earmark to support this proven, successful initiative \nthat has already helped over 12,000 California police officers better \nunderstand how they can promote tolerance and reduce prejudice in their \nworkplaces and communities. With this additional funding, the Center \ncan implement its plan to conduct four-day workshops to train tolerance \ninstructors from police Departments from around the country on how to \ncontrol prejudice and hate crimes. These officers will then be able to \ngo back to their communities and teach other officers how to combat \nprejudice and bias.\n  The overwhelmed 911 emergency response system has prompted cities \naround the nation to experiment with a 311 non-emergency number to \nrelieve the burden and improve access to emergency assistance. The 311 \ntelephone system would allow police departments such as Los Angeles' to \nfree officers from the burden of responding to non-emergency 911 calls \nand gives the community an easy-to-remember link to the police, thus \nstrengthening community policing. The conference report supports the \nuse of funds for non-emergency numbers such as 311.\n\n\n                            cancer research\n\n  The bill also includes $2.9 billion for the National Cancer \nInstitute, a 15 percent increase. Cancer afflicts 1.2 million Americans \neach year. Cancer will kill 1,500 people a day this year. But we \ncurrently invest less than 2 percent of cancer's health care costs in \nresearch to find a cure and treatments. NCI can currently only fund 28 \npercent of grants, less than one-third approved for funding.\n  In the September 25 hearing of the Senate Cancer Coalition, Dr. Allen \nLichter, President of the American Society for Clinical Oncology said, \n``It often takes several years to get a clinical cancer trial activated \nfrom the idea stage to the point of involving patients because of \ninsufficient funds. For every clinical trial that gets activated, there \nare many worthwhile trials sitting undone.''\n  I submit that this is not a vigorous war on cancer, when we are \nfunding less than one-third of grants proposed.\n\n\n                         BREAST RECONSTRUCTION\n\n  I am also pleased that the bill includes language requiring insurance \nplans that cover mastectomies to also cover breast reconstruction and \nprostheses. The language in this bill is taken from S. 249, a bill that \nI introduced with Senator D'Amato on January 30, 1997. One study found \nthat 84 percent of patients were denied insurance coverage for \nreconstruction of the removed breast, calling it ``cosmetic.'' Plans \nhave arbitrarily denied this very necessary surgery, to make a woman \nwhole. Twelve states require coverage\n\n[[Page S12836]]\n\nof breast reconstruction, including my own, but we need a national \nstandard. This provision can bring hope and help restore self-esteem to \nthousands of women who lose their breast to breast cancer every year.\n\n\n                  PROTECTING CHILDREN'S ONLINE PRIVACY\n\n  The Omnibus Appropriations bill requires the Federal Trade Commission \n(FTC) to take steps to protect children's privacy on the Internet, \nsimilar to provisions authored by Senator Feinstein in S. 504, the \nChildren's Privacy Protection and Parental Empowerment bill. \nSpecifically, the Omnibus bill directs the FTC to require commercial \nwebsite operators to follow fair information practices in collecting \nand using personal information from children age 12 and under. \nCommercial websites must obtain verifiable parental consent for the \ncollection, use, or disclosure of personal information from children. \nStates are authorized to enforce the regulations. The bill further \ndirects the FTC to provide incentives for self-regulation by operators \nto protect such information. The FTC is required to report to Congress \non the implementation of the regulations.\n\n\n                           EMPOWERMENT ZONES\n\n  I am also pleased that the bill includes $60 million in social \nservices grant funding for a second round of 20 urban and rural \nempowerment zones. The empowerment zone concept has shown great promise \nin promoting economic development in some of our nation's income \ncommunities. I know of a number of California communities who are \napplying for empowerment zone designation in this latest round, and if \nselected, this funding will enable them to attract business to their \narea and prepare residents for jobs.\n\n\n                            NEW COURTHOUSES\n\n  The bill includes funding to acquire sites for two new Federal \ncourthouses, in San Jose and San Diego. These courthouses are badly \nneeded to relieve the pressure of rising criminal, civil, and \nbankruptcy case filings. The bill includes $15.4 million to purchase \nland for the new courthouse in San Diego, and $10.8 million to purchase \nland for the new courthouse in San Jose.\n  The Omnibus Appropriations include $36 million for the State of \nCalifornia, pursuant to the agreement worked out between the state and \nthe federal government to settle California's claim to lands that were \nlocated in the Elk Hills Naval Petroleum Reserve. This funding has been \na bipartisan priority for California's entire delegation, and I am \npleased to see that it was included in the final bill.\n\n\n                         INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS\n\n  The international affairs provisions of this omnibus package contain \na number of important steps forward in stabilizing the global economy \nand combating the scourge of international drug trafficking.\n  I am pleased that our colleagues in the House finally saw the wisdom \nof providing the $17.9 billion to the International Monetary Fund that \nthe President requested. These funds are among the best investments we \ncan ever make. In 1998, we have seen economies across Asia and Latin \nAmerica and in Russia go into virtual free fall. And if there is one \nprinciple of the global economy today, it is that economic turmoil \nabroad is sure to affect us here at home.\n  When the currencies of our trading partners fall through the floor, \nas we have seen repeatedly this year, they are unable to purchase U.S. \nexports. That translates into lost American jobs, as our producers \ndiscover that there is no one overseas to buy their products. The funds \nwe are providing the IMF in this bill, and the additional funds they \nwill leverage from other donors, will help to stabilize the economies \nof our trading partners, protecting our export markets from further \ncollapse, and saving U.S. jobs. In a state with an export-driven \neconomy like California, this is good news. The IMF reforms called for \nin this bill that will ensure greater transparency and more market-\nbased lending practices are helpful, but the most important news is \nthat the IMF's coffers will be replenished, allowing it to provide \nfurther assistance to vulnerable economies around the world.\n\n  The Foreign Operations Appropriations section of this bill also \nincludes an important earmark, which I want to highlight: $75 million \nin economic assistance to Indonesia. I do not think that most Americans \nappreciate the strategic and economic significance of Indonesia, the \nfourth most populous nation in the world. Indonesia's status as the \npolitical and economic anchor of Southeast Asia make the economic and \npolitical crisis there that much more serious. The assistance that will \nbe provided by this act--as directed by policy language in the bill \nwhich I authored--will help alleviate the most severe suffering and \nfood shortages in Indonesia, while helping to ease the transition to a \nmore democratic form of government and the reform of the Indonesian \neconomy.\n  An important component of restoring social and economic stability to \nIndonesia is ensuring that all Indonesians, including minority ethnic \ngroups, are protected and able to participate fully in the society. For \nthat reason, I am pleased that the bill includes a provision I offered \ndirecting the President to assist the Indonesian government and \nappropriate non-governmental organizations in their investigation of \nthe brutal violence and rapes against Indonesian Chinese in May of this \nyear. In six months we will receive a report from the Administration on \nthe findings of these investigations, and the steps taken by the \nIndonesian government to punish the perpetrators of the violence and \nprotect Indonesian Chinese from its repetition.\n\n\n                     state department authorization\n\n  Let me say a word about the State Department Authorization portion of \nthis bill, which contains some important progress, but also one major \ndisappointment. I am pleased that after nearly four years of back-and-\nforth haggling, the State Department reorganization plan--now agreed to \nby the Administration and the Congress--can proceed. It should help to \nstreamline our foreign affairs agencies and reduce unnecessary \nduplication of effort. In addition, I am pleased that the bill includes \na provision I authored which will allow us to increase pressure on \nalien parents who abduct American citizen children from an American \nparent with legal custody by allowing us to deny visas to those who \nsupport the abducting parent.\n  But something very important is missing from this section of the \nbill: authorization to pay off our arrears to the United Nations. \nUnbelievably, the Republican leadership has acceded to the wishes of a \ntiny minority of their caucus, which has insisted on perpetuating an \nartificial link between paying U.N. arrears and international family \nplanning assistance. Despite broad agreement on a three year plan to \npay off our U.N. arrears while the U.N. conducted significant reforms a \ngroup of hardline House members have chosen to hold these arrears \nhostage to their agenda on a wholly unrelated, essentially domestic \nissue: abortion.\n  Under the false impression that by weakening our international family \nplanning programs with Mexico City restrictions, they could prevent \nabortions--in fact, they would do the opposite, depriving many women of \ncontraceptives and thereby leading to more abortions--these Members \nhave insisted on weakening the United States' international reputation \nand the United Nations, causing great harm to our foreign policy \ninterests.\n  This tactic is utterly irresponsible, and yet, the Republican \nleadership has gone along with it. They will send this bill without \nU.N. arrears, and the President will sign it. Then they will send the \nfree standing bill which contains U.N. arrears, but also contains \nMexico City restrictions, and, as we all know, the President will veto \nit. And although the United States will, by the skin of our teeth, \navoid losing our vote in the U.N. General Assembly for non-payment of \narrears--postponing the crisis for one year--we will have to begin this \neffort all over again next year. Our foreign policy interests will be \nplaced at further risk, all for the sake of a political point about \nabortion. And though I will vote for this bill, I am deeply distressed \nby the failure to include authorization to pay our U.N. arrears. It is \na mistake that I believe we will regret.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I voted no on this Omnibus spending bill. \nI did so reluctantly, because most of what I know about it--which is \ncontained in the pages about agriculture, education and other areas--I \nlike. It is because of the several hundred pages that are a complete \nmystery to me that I vote no.\n\n[[Page S12837]]\n\n  Mr. President, democracy should not work this way. The people send us \nhere to deliberate serious matters of public policy and to represent \ntheir interests and the nation's in the debate. In this case there was \nno debate, and it was not possible to represent anyone's interests \nbecause it is impossible to know how, if at all, those interests \ncomport with a bill whose 3,800 pages were not even published until the \ndark of last night.\n  Lest the American people be confused about why it has come to this, \nthere is a simple answer. The majority party did not schedule Congress' \ntime to do the work the people pay us to do. One of the Congress' most \nbasic duties is to decide how the people's money is to be spent. That \nprocess involves the passage of 13 appropriations bills, of which we \nmanaged to pass a whopping total of five in several months. The \nmajority party found ample time to debate matters of such crashing \nimportance as the scourge of human cloning and the name of the airport \nfrom which most of us are going to flee this scene later today. Let \nthere be no mistake about it: The necessity of a $500 billion omnibus \nbill did not arise from grand ideological disputes. It came from a \nfailure, plain, simple and unadulterated, to do our jobs because the \nmajority party chose to use the Congress' time to do other things.\n  As a result, the American people suspect that what has happened over \nthe last few days was a back-room deal involving hundreds of billions \nof dollars of their money being spent with no opportunity for their \ninput, debate or, for that matter, even for their elected \nrepresentatives to see the final product. Why is that? I submit the \nreason might be that this bill was a back-room deal involving hundreds \nof billions of dollars of their money being spent with no opportunity \nfor their input, debate or, for that matter, even for their elected \nrepresentatives to see the final product.\n  Later today I intend to participate in a panel discussion featuring \nthe senior Senator from New York, who will discuss his new book on \nsecrecy and national security. His thesis is that excessive secrecy \nproduces suspicion, mistakes and unnecessary costs. I completely agree \nwith him. This budget process--which the Senator from New York has \naptly noted moves us toward something akin to a parliamentary system in \nwhich decisions are made behind closed doors by a select few--proves \nthat the Senator's thesis on secrecy in national security applies \nequally to secrecy in domestic policy. It breeds suspicion, and it \nbreeds mistakes. There are few things I can say with certainty about \nthis budget, since very few of its several thousand pages were \navailable before yesterday, but I can predict one thing with total \nconfidence: When the smoke clears and the budget is actually read, \nthere are going to be things in it that would never have survived a \npublic debate.\n  The majority will protest that this last-minute flurry was caused by \nthreats of vetoes from the President. I am not overly sympathetic on \nthat point, Mr. President. The current occupant of that office has held \nit for six years. His views on appropriations bills are not a mystery \nsprung on the majority party at the last moment. He submitted a budget \nat the beginning of this year outlining what he wanted. He does not \nschedule the Senate's time for debate.\n  We cannot go on like this year after year, Mr. President, taking \nmoney from the pockets of taxpayers and then huddling behind a closed \ndoor to negotiate among a select few--many of them unelected--how to \nspend it. This is not government of, by and for the people. It is only \nhalf in jest that I say, sadly, that it is more like government by four \npeople.\n  As I said, Mr. President, I cast my nay vote reluctantly because I am \npleased with much of what I know about this bill. I am glad we \nsucceeded in convincing the majority of the need to extend a helping \nhand to America's first industry--agriculture--at a time of grave \ncrisis. I believe children in school are going to learn more and better \nbecause we are putting teachers in the classroom. I'm delighted the tax \nportion of this bill includes a provision much like a bill which I have \nintroduced which would prevent working families from paying higher \ntaxes by allowing them to deduct their child care, child and education \ncredits under the Alternative Minimum Tax. This bill also provides a \nmuch-needed extension of the R tax credit and will help the self-\nemployed, particularly farmers, by accelerating the deductible amount \nof their health insurance costs.\n  At the same time, I am very disappointed the livestock price \nreporting provision, which I authored in the Senate, was dropped from \nthis package. I do not believe the home health care problems we face \nwill be ``solved'' by this bill and we should not be led to believe \nthat the agriculture crisis in this country will come to an end as a \nresult of this bill. In addition, I firmly believe that the thousands \nof people in this country waiting for organ transplants, will be hurt, \nnot helped by further delay in issuing regulations governing organ \ntransplant allocations.\n  But what I object to the most is not what we know about this bill, \nbut what we do not, and can not. You can stir up a lot of mischief in a \nbill that runs over 3,800 pages that no one has read.\n  Maybe we can take some comfort in the hope that the 106th Congress \nwill do better. We won't be perfect. But perhaps we can get a jump on \nour pursuit of perfection by acting like a democracy, then by doing the \nwork we are paid to do.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to speak a few minutes about \nthe bill we just passed. I would like to register my personal views \nabout both the substance of the bill and the process by which it was \npassed.\n  I have very mixed emotions. First, I am very disappointed in a \nprocess that led to this midnight power play. This bill, as has been \npointed out by others speaking before me, is almost 4,000 pages long. \nIt weighs 40 pounds. It contains about $500 billion in Federal \nspending. I might tell you, Mr. President, that $500 billion is enough \nto pay for the State budget of Montana for 200 years. It was also \nproduced within 24 hours' notice of this vote. As a practical matter, \nmost offices had no more than a few hours to look at this bill. They \nhad no copies of it. They had to go to a central location and wade \nthrough it with other staff members. There is nobody in this entire \nCongress who knows all of the provisions in this bill; it is that \nmassive, and it was written behind closed doors.\n  Mr. President, I will admit that it is a with many worthwhile \nprojects and programs. For example, it provides assistance for farmers, \nso important to the State of Montana and other farming states. It has \nprovisions that help increase our investment in education, again not \nonly for the Nation but for my State of Montana. It provides important \nnew tools on the war against drugs. And it provides important new \nfunding for health care programs. The bill also provides money for the \nInternational Monetary Fund to help fulfill our obligations as a leader \nin the global community. By doing so, we are strengthening the \neconomies on which our export markets depend. Montana has seen wheat \nexports decline by 50 percent, almost entirely because of lack of \ndemand in Asia. In addition, one company, U.S. Semitool in Kalispell, \nMT, has had to lay off over 200, again because of a reduction in \ndemand.\n\n  By funding the IMF we also fulfilled our role as leader of the world \ncommunity. Like it or not, the United States is the sole remaining \nsuperpower, and our leadership is essential in resolving international \ncrises. By appropriating $18 billion for an IMF credit line, Congress \nis letting the world know that the United States is interested in \nliving up to its unique role. Incidentally, it should be noted that the \nUnited States has never lost one thin dime in the last 50 years that we \nsupported funding for the IMF. It is not the big drain that some \npeople, unfortunately, believe it is.\n  Mr. President, I obviously have serious reservations about the \nprocess with which this bill reached the Senate floor. That said, I do \nwant to commend the efforts of those who made a flawed process better. \nThe President's Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles, who is departing, was \noutstanding. He will be sorely missed by anyone, who has worked with \nhim. I know of no finer public servant than Mr. Bowles.\n\n[[Page S12838]]\n\n  The President's Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Jack \nLew, has likewise been a pleasure to work with, as has Larry Stein, the \nPresident's congressional liaison. There are many others I could name \nin the executive branch with whom I worked--devoted servants tenacious \nin their support for good programs for our country.\n  The same applies to the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Stevens, and Senator Byrd. Both are tremendous leaders and both \nare tremendous men. The House leadership was also very helpful at \ntimes, as were the chief persons in the House Appropriations Committee. \nI very much appreciate their efforts, without which we would have faced \nan even more objectionable means of legislating today.\n  Mr. President, I am convinced that Americans are less concerned about \nthe process we have used to pass this bill than what is actually in it. \nWhether it is highway funding an airport project, I think process is \nless important than outcome, as long as results are delivered. I think \nTip O'Neill, the former Speaker of the House, said it best: ``all \npolitics is local.''\n  So, why am I so concerned about the process? Let me explain. \nOrdinarily, bills that go through the Congress arrive through \ncommittees. They are debated there and, if passed, sent to the floor. \nAfter being placed on the calendar, the majority leader--some years it \nis a Republican leader, other years it is a Democratic leader--sets the \nagenda and decides which bills to bring up to be debated before the \nSenate. It is generally a collegial agreement between the majority \nleader and the minority leader as to which bills are brought up and \ndebated.\n  Following debate and passage on the floor, bills go to a conference, \nbecause the House has gone through a similar procedure. Many of the \nbills that are brought up on the floor under the Senate rules have \nadded onto them various amendments. Some amendments are relevant and \ngermane to the bill before the Congress but often, under the Senate \nrules, many are not. Regardless, all of those provisions are debated, \nin full view of the public and press. Senators cast their votes yes or \nno--sometimes with recorded votes, sometimes with voice votes--but then \nthey go to conference.\n  What happens in conference? Generally, the principal members of the \ncommittee of jurisdiction meet with the principal members of the \ncommittee of jurisdiction of the House of the bill that passed, because \nthey are similar but there are different provisions. There are some \nadjustments the conferees have to make, so they recommend the same bill \nwith the same provisions back to both bodies. Both bodies then vote yes \nor no, and, if passed, the President gets one bill. The President can \nsign it, veto it, or pocket veto the bill.\n  That is the procedure, and it is basically the procedure our Founding \nFathers had in mind when they wrote the Constitution. They didn't write \nall the rules for the House and the Senate, but they decided there \nshould be a House and Senate and the bodies should make their own \nrules. They intended that Congress should operate in the context of \nopenness in government and representative democracy in government. That \nwas the whole purpose of our Founding Fathers writing the Constitution, \nescaping tyranny from Europe: representative democracy, where the \npeople are in charge.\n  Mr. President, I am not going to stand up here as a purist and say we \nshould follow that lock, stock and barrel. We have to be practical and \ndo what works, but we must do so with full respect for the people who \nelected us, the people we have the privilege of serving.\n  Unfortunately, something very different than the process I just \ndescribed was used to pass this omnibus appropriations bill. What \nhappened, essentially, is that 3,800 pages of legislation--which, by \nand large, contains 8 appropriations bills that did not pass both \nbodies and go to conference, was put in one conference report. This \nlegislation did not go to the floor of the House or the Senate, where \nit could be debated and amended. It is legislation, rather, which is in \nthis conference report and sent back to the House and Senate \nunamendable--unamendable. I might also mention that roughly half this \nbill is authorizing language that ordinarily goes through the committee \nprocess.\n  So who made the decisions that resulted in this 4,000 page bill? Were \nthey the chief people in the committees of jurisdiction? No. Were they \nDemocrats, Democratic leadership? Not very often. So, who were they? \nEssentially, the people in the closed room--unavailable to the press, \nto the public, unavailable to other Senators--were top staff in the \nadministration and the leadership of the House and Senate, usually \nRepublican and to some degree Democratic, which would mean about five \nor six, maybe eight Members of Congress.\n  Mr. President, we have 535 Members of Congress, roughly. Eight of \nwhom were in the room with the administration officials, hammering this \nbill out. There is so much here, even they do not know what is in it. \nWhat did the rest of us do? We had little choice but to do the very \nbest for our people at home and get on the phone. We called the select \nfew in that room, trying to make our views heard, trying to make a \nsemblance of a democratic process.\n  I spent a lot of time talking to the chief administration officials \nwho I know were in the room. To their credit, they listened to me. And \nto their credit, they agreed with a good number of the views that I was \nespousing.\n  I did the best I could, given the circumstances we had, and I am \npleased that those people in the room decided to include some Montana \nprovisions, like Canyon Ferry; various land and water conservation \nfunds, like money for the purchase of the Royal Teton Ranch right next \nto Yellowstone Park; funding to help the massive Gallatin land \nexchange; the purchase of Lindbergh Lake, for a number of the same \nreasons. There are a lot of provisions in this bill that directly \naffect my State, in addition to broad national policies, such as more \nteachers, more funding for education, and so forth.\n  But I believe, Mr. President, that there comes a time when the \nprocess becomes so corrupted that it undermines and corrupts the \nlegislation that is passed.\n  Let me give a little personal background here. Several years ago, I \nwas involved in writing Montana's State Constitution. I think we are \nthe last State in the Nation to rewrite a constitution. There is a very \nimportant provision in our State's constitution called an open meeting \nlaw. In Montana's constitution, all public meetings are open to the \npress. The Governor of our State knows all the meetings he has in his \noffice will be attended by the press.\n  Sure, it causes some problems. Some in State government say, ``Oh, my \ngosh, this is a terrible provision; it cramps our style; it makes it \ndifficult for us to do our work.'' Sure, it makes it sometimes \ndifficult, but we all know deep down it is for the public good and, as \nwith a lot of things that are good, it takes effort, it takes hard \nwork. Most of the good things in life take effort and hard work. This \nis one of those. We have an open process in Montana, and we have a much \nhigher view in Montana of our public servants. It is very helpful.\n  I will relate another personal experience which indicates my resolve \ntoward a more open representative process. It occurred a little more \nthan 20 years ago, when I was a freshman Member of the House. I had a \nfree hour with not much to do, and I said, ``Well, I think I will learn \nsomething. I will go to a tax conference writing a tax bill,'' by \nSenate conferees, House conferees, Senate Finance Committee, House Ways \nand Means Committee, top folks who are in the conference for a large \ntax bill.\n  I asked around, ``Where is this meeting, where are they?'' I got the \nrunaround. Nobody could tell me where they really were. I finally went \nto Mike Mansfield, then majority leader of the Senate. I thought, \n``Gee, Senator Mansfield could find out where it is occurring.'' Sure \nenough, his people told me. I went over there. A policeman was standing \nright at the doorway. I said I am a Member. I think he thought I was a \nmember of the conference, so he let me in.\n  I took a seat in a corner so I could watch and learn a little about \ntax policy and how conferences work. I was there, minding my own \nbusiness listening to Wilbur Mills, chairman of the Ways and Means \nCommittee, and Russell Long, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, \ntalking.\n\n[[Page S12839]]\n\n  They were trying to work out this bill. There were a lot of executive \nbranch people in the room. Treasury Secretary Bill Simon was in the \nroom, along with other executive branch people. I was just sitting \nthere about 5 or 10 minutes, and up walked a senior House Member, \nCongressman Burke from Massachusetts. He said, ``Sorry, you can't be \nhere.''\n  I asked, ``Why? Why can't I be here?''\n  He said, ``Well, it's the rules.''\n  I said, ``What rule is it?''\n  He said, ``Well, it's the Senate rule.''\n  I said, ``What Senate rule is it?''\n  He said, ``I'm sorry, you just can't be here. Nobody can be here. No \nother Member of the House and Senate can be here. Not even Congressman \nBill Green can be here.''\n  Bill Green, who was then a Member of the House Ways and Means \nCommittee who successfully authored the provision on the floor of the \nHouse to modify the percentage of the oil depletion allowance, even he \ncouldn't be in the room. All the people allowed in the room were the \nconferees. It was closed doors and that is it.\n  I said to Congressman Burke at the time, ``Look, I'm not going to \ncause a fuss here, but this is wrong. It is just not right that this is \nnot open to the public, certainly to Members of the Congress.''\n  That afternoon, I stood before the House, along with Congressman Ab \nMikva, who also did not like that process, and we voiced our \ndisagreement and displeasure. Next year, things opened up because it \nwas the right thing to do.\n  Perhaps I have too much of a personal investment in this, but I do \nbelieve the people are much better served the more the process is open \nand the more the process is not corrupted as, in my judgment, this \nprocess is.\n  Again, about half of the U.S. Government bills, which did not pass \nthe House or the Senate or go through committees in the full light of \nday, which did not pass the floor of the House, some of which were not \neven brought up on the floor of the House or the Senate, were put in \nthis huge bill, then sent back to the Senate and the House unamendable. \nNo amendments are in order, Mr. President, in this process; none.\n  I suppose there is a reason for that because none of us know what is \nin the bill. How can we offer an amendment if we don't know what is in \nthe bill? I asked the Parliamentarian not long ago: How much of this is \nauthorization, how much is appropriations? He said, ``Senator, we just \ndon't know; this huge stack here is too big for us to have gone through \nit by now. We just don't know.''\n  As I said, Mr. President, I am in an anxious position here because a \nlot of good is in this bill. But the process, in my view, is wrong. \nThat's why I voted no on the bill.\n  The provisions that are in this bill I would have worked for in \nseparate bills, in separate agriculture bills or Agriculture \nappropriations bills or in other authorizing bills that would \nordinarily come before the Congress.\n  Again, I am not going to be a purist about this, I just want to be \npractical. We have done this 2 years in a row, dumping so much in such \na very undemocratic way into a huge bill written behind closed doors, \nwritten by only a few Members of the House and Senate and the \nadministration. This process dangerously disenfranchises most Senators, \nHouse Members and American voters.\n  We, as Senators and House Members, don't have an opportunity to go \nback to our people and say, ``What do you think of this provision?'' \nThey don't have an opportunity to say to us, ``We don't like what is in \nthere, vote this way or that. They are disenfranchised, cut out of the \nprocess.\n  This is not legislation by representative democracy, Mr. President. \nIt is legislation by a very few, by oligarchy.\n  At a deeper level, what does that do? It further undermines the \npeople's confidence or belief in Government. This process does that. It \nconfirms some of the worst views a lot of Americans have; namely, oh, \nthose guys back there in Washington are just out for themselves; they \ndon't care about us.\n  Mr. President, we must draw the line. Enough is enough. We all know \nthat the more issues are actually fully debated--and I mean debated--\nthe more the public has a chance then to see what is going on, and they \nthemselves get more involved. To the extent we do that, this country \nwill be stronger. We know that. We also know that the less the people \nare involved, the less they know what is going on, and the weaker this \ncountry is going to be.\n  Mr. President, we are the world's oldest democracy. We have a form of \ngovernment where the people elect their representatives to do their \nnation's business. We are not a kingdom, we are not a monarchy. And we \nwill be the leader in the next century if people are more involved in \ngovernment. And they will be more involved in government the more we, \nas representatives, respect them, respect their views, want their \nviews, want them to be able to comment on what we are doing or not \ndoing.\n  But on the other hand, the more we disrespect people by hiding behind \nclosed doors, in the dark of night, the more we will cause a further \ndeterioration of our government and weaken the United States role as \nthe world leader that we want to be in the next century.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me say that this is a sad moment for me. \nI cast my vote with reservation, fully aware of the good that this bill \ncontains. But vote no I must, simply because I think that to vote yes \nwould be to cast a vote for exclusivity and against the democratic \nprocess. I worked very closely with some individuals who made a few of \nthis bill's important provisions reality, and I do not want now to be \nvoting against their reference. They made a good effort and did a very \ngood job, given the situation they were in, given the circumstances \nthey faced. They were helpful to those of us who were working for our \nStates and had nothing else to do--no alternative--but to try to work \nwith this abominable process.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I want to say that next year it is \ncritically important that we prevent this process from happening again. \nWe have done this two years in a row, and each year more and more and \nmore is getting dumped into this omnibus conference report process. If \nthis trend continues, then within a year or two maybe three-quarters of \nGovernment is going to be in there; maybe everything is soon going to \nbe in there, which means I might as well not report for work until the \nfinal 3 weeks of the Congress, because that is where it is all done, \nwith those few people behind closed doors.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12810-6", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12839-S12841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FAREWELL TO RETIRING SENATORS\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, in this last day of the 105th Congress, I \nthink it is appropriate that we take a little more time to express our \nappreciation and our admiration for our retiring Senators. I look down \nthe list: Senator Bumpers of Arkansas; Senator Coats of Indiana; \nSenator Ford, the Democratic whip, of Kentucky; Senator Glenn, who will \nsoon be taking another historic flight into space; and Senator \nKempthorne, who I believe is also going to be taking flight into a new \nposition of leadership and honor. This is a distinguished group of men \nwho have been outstanding Senators, who have left their mark on this \ninstitution. I believe you could say in each case they have left the \nSenate a better place than it was when they came.\n  Have we had our disagreements along the way? Sure, within parties and \nacross party aisles. I have to take a moment to express my appreciation \nto each of these Senators. I especially want to thank Senator Ford for \nhis cooperation in his position as whip. We worked together for a year \nand a half as the whip on our respective side of the aisle and we \nalways had a very good relationship. Of course, I have already \nexpressed my very close relationship for Senator Coats and for Senator \nKempthorne.\n  To all of these Senators, I want to extend my fondest farewell.\n  As majority leader, I feel a responsibility to speak for all of us in \nbidding\n\n[[Page S12840]]\n\nan official farewell to our five colleagues who are retiring this year.\n  It was 1974 when Dale Bumpers left the governorship of Arkansas to \ntake the Senate seat that had long been held by Senator Fulbright. \nThere are several Senators in this Chamber today who, in 1974, were \nstill in high school.\n  Four terms in the Senate of the United States can be a very long \ntime--but that span of nearly a quarter-century has not in the least \ndiminished Senator Bumpers' enthusiasm for his issues and energy in \nadvancing them.\n  He has been a formidable debater, fighting for his causes with a \ntenacity and vigor that deserves the title of Razorback.\n  It is a memorable experience to be on the receiving end of his \nopposition--whether the subject was the Space Station or, year after \nyear, mining on public lands.\n  Arkansas and Mississippi are neighbors, sharing many of the same \nproblems. From personal experience, I know how Senator Bumpers has been \nan assiduous and effective advocate for his State and region.\n  No one expects retirement from the Senate to mean inactivity for \nSenator Bumpers, whose convictions run too deep to be set aside with \nhis formal legislative duties.\n  All of us who know the sacrifices an entire family makes when a \nspouse or parent is in the Congress can rejoice for him, for Betty, and \nfor their family, in the prospect of more time together in a well \nearned future.\n  Senator Dan Coats and I have a bond in common which most Members of \nthe Senate do not share. We both began our careers on Capitol Hill, not \nas Members, but as staffers.\n  I worked for the venerable William Colmer of Mississippi, Chairman of \nthe House Rules Committee, who left office in 1972 at the age of 82. \nSenator Coats worked for Dan Quayle, who came to Congress at the age of \n27.\n  Despite the differences in our situations back then, we both learned \nthe congressional ropes from the bottom up.\n  Which may be why we both have such respect for the twists and turns \nof the legislative process, not to mention an attentive ear to the \nviews and concerns of our constituents.\n  Now and then, a Senator becomes nationally known for his leadership \non a major issue. Senator Coats has had several such issues.\n  One was the constitutional amendment for a balanced budget. Another \nwas New Jersey's garbage, and whether it would be dumped along the \nbanks of the Wabash.\n  The garbage issue is still unresolved, but on other matters, his \nsuccess has been the nation's profit.\n  He has championed the American family, improved Head Start, kept \nchild care free of government control, and helped prevent a federal \ntakeover of health care.\n  His crusade to give low-income families school choice has made him \nthe most important education reformer since Horace Mann. His passionate \ndefense of children before birth has been, to use an overworked phrase, \na profile in courage.\n  Senator Coats does have a secret vice. He is a baseball addict. On \ntheir honeymoon, he took Marcia to a Cubs game. And when he was a \nMember of the House, he missed the vote on flag-burning to keep a \npromise to his son to see the Cubs in the playoffs.\n  To Dan, a commitment is a commitment. That is why he is national \npresident of Big Brothers. And why, a few years ago, he kept a very \nimportant audience waiting for his arrival at a meeting here on the \nHill.\n  He had, en route, come across a homeless man, and spent a half-hour \nurging him to come with him to the Gospel Rescue Mission.\n  Here in the Congress, we must always be in a hurry. But Senator Coats \nand his wife, Marcia, have known what is worth waiting for.\n  They have been a blessing to our Senate family, and they will always \nremain a part of it.\n  Senator Wendell Ford stands twelfth in seniority in the Senate, with \nthe resignation of his predecessor, Senator Marlow Cook, giving him a \nsix-day advantage over his departing colleague, Senator Bumpers.\n  He came to Washington with a full decade of hands-on governmental \nexperience in his native Kentucky. He had been a State senator, \nLieutenant Governor, and Governor. With that background, he needed \nlittle time to make his mark in the Senate.\n  In that regard, he reminds me of another Kentuckian who make a \nlasting mark on the Senate.\n  Last month, I traveled to Ashland, the home of Henry Clay, to receive \na medallion named after the man once known as Harry of the West. \nSenator Ford was a prior recipient of that award, and appropriately so.\n  Henry Clay was a shrewd legislator, a tough bargainer, who did not \nsuffer fools lightly. That description sounds familiar to anyone who \nhas worked with Senator Ford.\n  He can be a remarkably effective partisan. I can attest to that. \nThere is a good reason why he has long been his party's second-in-\ncommand in the Senate.\n  At the same time, he has maintained a personal autonomy that is the \nmark of a true Senator. He has been outspoken about his wish that his \nparty follow the more moderate path to which he has long adhered.\n  Senator Ford's influence has been enormous in areas like energy \npolicy and commerce. Contemporary politics may be dependent upon \nquotable sound-bites and telegenic posturing, but he has held to an \nolder and, in my opinion, a higher standard.\n  One of the least sought-after responsibilities in the Senate is \nservice on the Rules Committee.\n  It can be a real headache. But it is crucial to the stature of the \nSenate. We all owe Senator Ford our personal gratitude for his long \nyears of work on that Committee.\n  His decisions there would not always have been my decisions; that is \nthe nature of our system. But his work there has set a standard for \nmeticulousness and gravity.\n  All of us who treasure the traditions, the decorum, and the comity of \nthe Senate will miss him.\n  We wish him and Jean the happiness of finally being able to set their \nown hours, enjoy their grandchildren, and never again missing dinner at \nhome because of a late-night session on the Senate floor.\n  There are many ways to depart the Senate. Our colleague from Ohio, \nSenator John Glenn, will be leaving us in a unique fashion, renewing \nthe mission to space which he helped to begin in 1962.\n  In the weeks ahead, he will probably be the focus of more publicity, \nhere and around the world, than the entire Senate has been all year \nlong.\n  It will be well deserved attention, and I know he accepts it, not for \nhimself, but for America's space program.\n  For decades now, he has been, not only its champion, but in a way, \nits embodiment.\n  That is understandable, but to a certain extent, unfair. For his \nastronaut image tends to overshadow the accomplishments of a long \nlegislative career.\n  In particular, his work on the Armed Services Committee, the Commerce \nCommittee, and our Special Committee on Aging has been a more far-\nreaching achievement than orbiting the earth.\n  With the proper support and training, others might have done that, \nbut Senator Glenn's accomplishments here in the Senate are not so \neasily replicated.\n  This year's hit film, ``Saving Private Ryan,'' has had a tremendous \nimpact on young audiences by bringing home to them the sacrifice and \nthe suffering of those who fought America's wars.\n  I think Senator Glenn has another lesson to teach them. For the man \nwho will soon blast off from Cape Canaveral, as part of America's \npeaceful conquest of space--is the same Marine who, more than a half \ncentury ago, saw combat in World War II, and again in Korea.\n  His mission may have changed, but courage and idealism endure.\n  In a few days, along with Annie and the rest of his family, we will \nbe cheering him again, as he again makes us proud of our country, proud \nof our space program, and proud to call him our friend and colleague.\n  Senator Dirk Kempthorne came to us from Idaho only six years ago. He \nnow returns amid the nearly universal expectation that he will be his \nState's next Governor. It will be a wise choice.\n  None of us are surprised by his enormous popularity back home. We \nhave come to know him, not just as a consummate politician, but as a \nthoughtful, decent, and caring man.\n\n[[Page S12841]]\n\n  This is a man who took the time to learn the names of the men and \nwomen who work here in the Capitol and in the Senate office buildings.\n  In fact, his staff allots extra time for him to get to the Senate \nfloor to vote because they know he will stop and talk to people on the \nway.\n  During the memorial ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda for our two \nofficers who lost their lives protecting this building, Senator \nKempthorne noticed that the son of one of the officers, overwhelmed by \nemotion, suddenly left the room.\n  Dirk followed him, and spent a half-hour alone with him, away from \nthe cameras. The public doesn't see those things, but that's the kind \nof concern we expect from him.\n  His willingness to share credit gave us our Unfunded Mandates Act and \nreauthorization of the Safe Drinking Water Law. And his eye for detail \nand pride in his own home State led to the transformation of that long, \nsterile corridor between the Capitol and the Dirksen and Hart office \nbuildings.\n  Now, as tourists ride the space-age mechanized subway, they enjoy the \ndisplay of State flags and seals that form a patriotic parade. It \ndelights the eye and lifts the spirit.\n  If you've ever visited Idaho, known its people, and seen its scenic \nwonders, you don't have to wonder why he's leaving us early.\n  You wonder, instead, why he ever left.\n  Years ago, he explained his future this way: That he would know when \nit was time to leave the Senate when he stopped asking ``why'' and \nstarted saying ``because.''\n  We're going to miss him and Patricia, and no one needs to ask \n``why.'' Even so, we know the Governor will be forceful spokesman on \nthe Hill for all the governors.\n  They could not have a better representative. The Senate could not \nhave a better exemplar. We could not have a better friend.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to pay tribute to two members of my \nSenate team who plan to leave us by the end of the year.\n  As our Sergeant at Arms, Greg Casey holds one of the Senate's highest \npositions of trust and authority. It is an awesome job, overseeing the \nhundreds of employees who keep the Capitol in operation.\n  There is also a ceremonial component to the position of Sergeant at \nArms, and Greg has performed in that role admirably well.\n  But behind the formalities lie enormous operational responsibilities. \nIt is not a job for the weak of will. Greg's performance has set, for \nall future occupants of his office, a new standard of energy, \nefficiency, and spirit.\n  By recognizing hard work and achievement at all levels, he has led \nthe entire Capitol work force to become more professional, more modern, \nand more team-oriented.\n  Before appointing him Sergeant at Arms, I had the benefit of his \nmanagerial skills as administrative officer to the Majority Leader.\n  He helped me reassemble the office after Senator Dole moved on to \nother efforts. And before that, he had served for years as Chief of \nStaff to Senator Larry Craig of Idaho.\n  That was a natural fit, for Greg is a classic Idahoan, like his \nState's two Senators, to whom he has been close since his college days. \nHe is a doer, not a talker, and is undaunted by the challenges from \nwhich others shrink. He has done a great job for me, for the Senate, \nand for his country.\n  One of his chief concerns has been the security of the Capitol.\n  Even before the tragic events of last July, he had begun to enhance \nthe safety of those who visit, and those who work in, this building.\n  We thank Julia, his wife, and their little boy, Greg Jr., for their \nsacrifice of the family time that means so much to them. And we share \ntheir happiness that they will now have more time together.\n  The second member of my team who will be leaving in the near future \nis Steve Seale, legal counsel to the Majority Leader.\n  Steve came to Washington a little more than two years ago at my \nrequest--and gave up a seat in the Mississippi Senate to do so. Even \nmore of a sacrifice was moving, with Miriam and their two little girls, \nCaitlin and Elise, from their home in Hattiesburg to the wilds of \nNorthern Virginia.\n  He has poured his heart into what can be a thankless task: guarding \nevery line of the law, while telling those in authority what they \ncannot do.\n  In official Washington today, no one needs to be reminded of how \nimportant those functions are.\n  Steve has handled an array of judicial, legal, and constitutional \nissues for me; and I have not been alone in relying on his counsel.\n  I have deeply appreciated his loyalty, but I have valued even more \nhis willingness to put the law--in all its complexity and with all its \nrestrictions and limitations--before all else, including the \nconvenience of person or of party.\n  Displayed on his desk is a hand-written note from his two daughters, \nwhich, with certain adjustments in spelling, reads like this: ``Dear \nDad, come home for hugs and kisses.''\n  The Senate cannot beat that offer, and I do not begrudge Steve the \nopportunity to put family first. Indeed, many Members of Congress will \nenvy him.\n  There is a saying among persons who have been on my staff, all the \nway back to my early days in the House of Representatives.\n  They say that, once you have worked for Lott, you always work for \nLott.\n  I take that as a compliment, and I'm taking this occasion to let \nSteve know that, in his case, it is going to apply for a long, long \ntime.\n  Mr. President, before we turn to other business, I should offer one \nfinal tribute.\n  When the American people tune in to our televised proceedings, they \noften see, here beside me or elsewhere on the Senate floor, a lovely \nyoung woman, tall, blonde, and beautiful. Her name is Alison Carroll \nMcSlarrow.\n  What they cannot see is that she is smart, hard-working, savvy, \ndedicated, principled, caring, ingenious--a master of our legislative \nprocess, expert in our Senate rules, an astute advisor, and a \npersistent voice of conscience to do the right thing.\n  She came to the Senate after teaching grade school. That experience \nboth reflected and strengthened her interest in children. It helps to \nexplain her opposition to the destructive policies that have for so \nlong dominated federal education programs.\n  As legislative assistant to Senator Dan Coats, as a Republican \nstaffer in the Labor and Human Resources Committee--and as my chief \nfloor assistant when I was the Majority Whip, she has had a major \nimpact, not only on the processes we follow, but on the policies we \nhave advanced.\n  Indeed, her determination to protect the health care of the American \nfamily had a great deal to do with the defeat of the President's plan \nto bring that sector of the economy under government control.\n  For the last two and a half years, she has been my deputy chief of \nstaff. I have relied upon her for everything from vote counts to policy \nanalysis, from parliamentary tactics to legislative strategy.\n  In her office hangs a framed series of photographs, taken when she \nwas seated next to me here. As I made some expansive gesture, I somehow \nknocked her in the head.\n  Her composure never changed; mine did. She remained the consummate \nprofessional, doing her job above all else.\n  Before the 106th Congress assembles in January, Alison and her \nhusband, Kyle, Senator Coverdell's chief of staff, will have moved to \nArizona, where he will be working for former Vice President Dan Quayle. \nIt is hard to imagine my office without her.\n  I will miss her expertise, of course, and the way she stands up to me \nmore than anyone else on my staff. I will miss her good humor and her \nidealism. And the Senate will miss her more than I can say.\n  She leaves with our gratitude, our admiration, and our love.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12839-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12841-S12842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TRIBUTE TO STAFF\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have to recognize some of my own staff \nmembers. Alison Carroll McSlarrow has been my deputy Chief of Staff for \nthe past couple of years. She has done a wonderful job. I have tried to \ntalk her out of getting married and then out of moving to Arizona. But \nKyle\n\n[[Page S12842]]\n\nMcSlarrow, who worked with me a while, and now works with Senator \nCoverdell, swept her off her feet and now off to Arizona. I will never \nquite get over what he has done to me. They are a great and wonderful \ncouple. Alison has come to be one of my most trusted aides. She is so \ncompetent. I have always been able to rely on her. I will miss her \ntremendously. I wanted to have an expression of my appreciation in the \nRecord for her.\n  My counsel, Steve Seale, will be going downtown to work with a law \nfirm, which will remain nameless for now. He is a close friend from my \nown State of Mississippi. He was a naval officer and he was a State \nSenator and had an outstanding law practice. He left that to come and \nwork for me over the past 3 years. He has done an outstanding job. I \nwish him the very best in the future.\n  Last but not least, I want to especially recognize our Sergeant at \nArms, Gregg Casey. Gregg had worked for, of course, our policy \nchairman, Larry Craig. He did a great job with him as Chief of Staff. \nHe is a very close friend of Dirk Kempthorne, the other Senator from \nIdaho. He came to my aid when I became majority leader to try to help \nme get my office organized, as I was putting 3 separate staffs into \none. He has a real talent for organization and getting an office set up \nwhere it can be administered properly. I had another emergency on my \nhands. We had a need for a new Sergeant at Arms and he agreed to not go \nback with Senator Craig and go into this position of Sergeant at Arms. \nOver the past 2, 2\\1/2\\ years, he has done a great job in my Senate \noffice and as Sergeant at Arms. It has been difficult in many respects \nbecause there were problems that needed to be dealt with. He stepped up \nto the task.\n  Of course, we had the very trying experience when we had two of our \nown security people here in the Capitol killed. That week, I'm sure, is \none that has been indelibly marked in Gregg Casey's mind--the horror of \nit and all that went on. Actually, through it all, a family atmosphere \ncame out of it, and everybody felt a closeness. He did a great job in \nthe aftermath of that and provided real leadership. I know he is going \nto have many great opportunities in the future. I thank Gregg Casey for \na job well done as Sergeant at Arms. This place is better because of \nthe service he has given.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12841-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12842-S12843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   THE NATIONAL SALVAGE MOTOR VEHICLE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am very disappointed that there was an \nobjection to the final passage of the National Salvage Motor Vehicle \nAct of 1998. This bipartisan consumer measure would have combated the \ngrowing and costly fraud of selling rebuilt salvage vehicles as \nundamaged used cars. This small, but important package would have saved \nconsumers and automobile dealers more than $4 billion annually and \nwould have kept millions of structurally unsafe vehicles off America's \nroads and highways.\n  As my colleagues are aware, the practice of selling salvage vehicles \nwithout disclosing their damage history has become a serious national \nproblem--aided by titling requirements that vary from state to state. A \nsignificant number of our colleagues in this chamber recognized that \nthe status quo simply is not working. Something needed to be done to \nprotect used car buyers and automobile dealers all across America from \ntitle washing. This Congress took action to quell this anti-consumer \nplague that has preyed on unsuspecting victims for far too long. \nUnfortunately, the Administration killed this much needed consumer \nprotection measure.\n  Mr. President, the House of Representatives, under the stewardship of \nChairman Tom Bliley of the House Commerce Committee, and Congressman \nRick White, the author of the House companion bill, passed most of the \nSenate's legislation on October 10 with bipartisan support. The House \nwisely chose to exclude a federal overlay system in addition to \nexisting state branding procedures. This duplicative approach was \nstrongly opposed by the American Association of Motor Vehicle \nAdministrators which represents the very people who would administer \nthe provisions of any auto salvage legislation.\n  Removing the proposed federal overlay was not taken lightly. The \nHouse took a serious look at a recent letter from the AAMVA which \nstrongly objected to the concept of dual federal and state branding \nsystems. Based on its analysis, the House concluded that the proposed \nfederal overlay scheme would have created greater consumer confusion \ninstead of achieving the legislation's intended purpose of enhancing \ninformation disclosure. At this time Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record the October 5, 1998 letter from \nthe American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators to House \nCommerce Committee Chairman Tom Bliley.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                           American Association of\n\n\n                                 Motor Vehicle Administrators,\n\n                                   Arlington, VA, October 5, 1998.\n     Hon. Tom Bliley,\n     Chairman, House Commerce Committee, Rayburn House Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bliley: On October 2, the Senate passed Bill \n     852, the National Motor Vehicle Safety, Anti-Theft, Title \n     Reform, and Consumer Protection Act of 1997. Senate 852 \n     incorporates the Levin amendment, which specifies a federal \n     overlay of salvage terms and procedures. Under the federal \n     overlay approach, a state which chooses to adopt the federal \n     standards is free to also retain its current, inconsistent \n     definitions and procedures with respect to salvage vehicles.\n       We understand that the bill will now be considered by the \n     House/Senate Conference Committee. We believe that the \n     federal overlay approach is unacceptable for three reasons:\n       1. It undercuts the important objective of uniformity in \n     the handling of salvage vehicles;\n       2. Since participation in the federal standards is entirely \n     voluntary for the states, the federal overlay approach serves \n     no useful purpose, while undercutting the important goals of \n     the bill; and\n       3. It creates an unworkable system.\n       Therefore, we request that the federal overlay system be \n     stricken from the final bill so that the bill can achieve the \n     important objectives which Congress, motor vehicle \n     administrators, law enforcement, dealers and others have long \n     worked toward. Even without the Levin amendment, Senate 852 \n     already contains substantial compromises that address the \n     concerns of proponents of the Levin amendment.\n       Specifically, the federal overlay approach creates problems \n     including:\n\n\n                           lack of uniformity\n\n       The federal overlay approach completely destroys the \n     primary goal of the legislation: to move toward uniformity of \n     definitions and procedures with respect to salvage vehicles. \n     Such uniformity was the most fundamental of the \n     recommendations of the Motor Vehicle Titling, Registration \n     and Salvage Advisory Committee. In making this \n     recommendation, the Advisory Committee was, in part, \n     addressing Congress' mandate in the Anti Car Theft Act of \n     1992, which directed the Advisory Committee to ``include an \n     examination of the extent to which the absence of uniformity \n     and integration of State laws regulating vehicle titling and \n     registration and salvage of used vehicles allows enterprising \n     criminals to find the weakest link to `wash' the stolen \n     character of the vehicle.''\n       During the advisory committee's deliberations, it was \n     estimated that there were approximately 65 different words \n     and symbols used in the states to designate salvage and other \n     damaged vehicles, a jumble of terms creating problems for \n     motor vehicle administrators, law enforcement and the \n     consumers they both serve. Rather than moving us toward \n     uniformity, the federal overlay approach raises the specter \n     of actually adding to these 65 terms and symbols.\n\n\n                            lack of benefit\n\n       The federal overlay approach is particularly disturbing in \n     that, given constitutional constraints, participation in the \n     federal standards is voluntary for the states. Since there is \n     no mandate on the states and since a state has to voluntarily \n     adopt the federal standards in order to be affected by them, \n     it is especially troubling that Congress would set up a \n     system in which a state would have two inconsistent programs \n     in place.\n\n\n                           practical concerns\n\n       In our view, the federal overlay poses an unworkable and \n     unrealistic result. Some examples of these problems are as \n     follows:\n       1. Because the federal definition and the state definition \n     would not be the same, a vehicle could meet the federal \n     definition but not the state definition, or could meet the \n     state definition and not the federal definition. In such a \n     common circumstance, what is the consumer to understand from \n     a title which tells him or her ``this vehicle is federal \n     salvage but not state salvage'' or ``this vehicle is not \n     federal salvage but is state salvage''?\n       2. If a vehicle is both federal salvage and state salvage, \n     which procedures are to apply? These procedures include \n     application, reporting timeframes, inspection, disclosures, \n     branding, etc. and will, in almost all cases, be different \n     under the federal standards than under the state standards.\n\n[[Page S12843]]\n\n       3. If a vehicle is a ``flood vehicle'' under the federal \n     standards, but is a ``salvage vehicle'' under the state \n     standards (a very common result), do the flood procedures or \n     the salvage procedures apply?\n       4. If an insurance company leaves a vehicle which meets \n     both the federal salvage standard and the state salvage \n     standard with the owner, which owner-retained procedure is to \n     be followed?\n       5. Under the federal standard, a nonrepairable vehicle \n     certificate is to be limited to two transfers. Most state \n     laws do not contain a similar limitation. Does the federal \n     standard or the state standard apply?\n       6. Under Senate 852, it is a crime not to apply for a \n     federal salvage title. Under state laws, it is a crime not to \n     apply for a state salvage title. How does an applicant avoid \n     committing a crime if a vehicle is both a federal salvage \n     vehicle and a state salvage vehicle?\n\n\n                         Administrative burden\n\n       State departments of motor vehicles would be tasked with \n     implementing many provisions of Senate 852 as amended. They \n     would need to interpret this complex law and apply it \n     consistently. Responsibilities would include determining the \n     proper designations for state and/or federal branded \n     vehicles, re-titling the vehicles, explaining the dual \n     designations to citizens, etc.\n       The burden of interpreting and maintaining two sets of \n     standards could discourage states from even attempting to \n     implement the federal provisions. For the states that do \n     attempt to implement, it will cause a ripple effect of \n     confusion and errors among states that do not implement.\n       The amended bill would also create a burden upon users of \n     the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System. As \n     additional variations of salvage brand codes increase, the \n     possibility of misinterpretation would increase as well. The \n     bill's provisions would also require modifications to \n     technical system design, which would in turn require \n     expenditures of resources by states, central file providers, \n     service providers, and the system operator to accommodate.\n       There are dozens of other practical concerns with the \n     federal overlay approach, but the above give a sense for the \n     impracticality of the approach. The more difficult an \n     approach is to administer and to understand, the easier it is \n     for the unscrupulous to again ``work the system'' and for \n     consumers to be defrauded.\n       If you would like additional information, please contact \n     Larry Greenberg, Vice President, Vehicle Services, or Linda \n     Lewis, Director, Public and Legislative Affairs, at 703/522-\n     4200.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Kenneth M. Beam,\n                                                  President & CEO.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. The motor vehicle administrators, the real front line \nexperts on this issue, carefully and thoughtfully outlined their \npractical concerns with the proposed federal overlay approach.\n  First, the AAMVA letter noted that a federal overlay along with a \nseparate state branding process undercuts the important objective of \nuniformity in the handling of salvage vehicles.\n  Second, since participation in the federal standards is entirely \nvoluntary for the states, the federal ``overlay'' approach serves no \nuseful purpose.\n  And, third, the letter pointed out that the federal overlay would \ncreate an unworkable, unmanageable system.\n  The AAMVA also cautioned in its letter that ``the burden of \ninterpreting and maintaining two sets of standards could discourage \nstates from even attempting to implement the federal provisions. For \nthe states that do attempt to implement, it will cause a ripple effect \nof confusion and errors among states that do not implement.'' In my \nview, these are compelling arguments against adopting the federal \noverlay approach that was added when the bill passed the Senate on \nOctober 2.\n  Since the legislation was reported by the Senate Commerce Committee \nin November of last year, a large number of changes were made to the \nbill in an effort to address expressed concerns. Again, I would \nemphasize that the final title branding legislation included a number \nof significant changes to make the bill even more pro-consumer and to \nprovide states with maximum flexibility. It closed the gaps that exist \nbetween conflicting state vehicle titling laws that allow dishonest \nrebuilders to perpetuate their fraudulent schemes without the need for \na complicated, redundant, and burdensome federal overlay framework.\n  The bipartisan compromise package included:\n  A salvage threshold that was lowered from 80 percent to 75 percent.\n  A provision that allows states to cover any vehicle, regardless of \nage.\n  A provision that grants state Attorneys General the ability to sue on \nbehalf of citizens who are victimized by rebuilt salvage fraud and \nrecover monetary judgments for damages that citizens may have suffered.\n  With respect to the bill's ``prohibited acts,'' the Senate bill \nreplaced the House's ``knowingly and willfully'' standard with a \n``knowingly'' standard.\n  Two new prohibited acts, one related to making a flood disclosure and \nthe other related to moving a vehicle or title in interstate commerce \nfor the purpose of avoiding the bill's requirements.\n  Flexibility for the states to provide additional disclosures to their \ncitizens regarding the damage history of vehicles; synonyms of the \ndefined terms that a conforming state could not use in connection with \na vehicle were deleted.\n  A provision that allows a state to establish a lesser percentage \nthreshold for salvage vehicles if it so chooses. In other words, a \nstate could set its threshold below the 75 percent level and still be \nin compliance with the provisions of the bill. Some consumer groups and \nsome attorneys general advocated that states should be able to set \ntheir thresholds lower if they so desire. In the interest of \ncompromise, we agreed to adopt that position.\n  The package that I just outlined clearly indicates that the \nsupporters of the legislation proceeded in good faith to reach a \nreasonable compromise for an effective bill. A number of changes were \nadopted a long the way in effort to protect used car consumers from \ntitle laundering. Equally important, the changes preserved the right of \nthe states to determine what is in the best interests of their \ncitizens.\n  While I commend my colleagues in both chambers and from both sides of \nthe aisle for passing versions of this important consumer protection \nlegislation, I again want to express my regret that the Administration \nchose to oppose the National Salvage Motor Vehicle Act.\n  Now, instead of improving the hodgepodge of state titling laws, the \nAdministration allows unscrupulous auto rebuilders to launder car and \ntruck titles so they bear no indication of a vehicle's damage history. \nPerpetuating a costly fraud. A $4 billion annual consumer swindle.\n  Instead of endorsing this pro-disclosure measure and protecting \nAmericans from title fraud, the Administration has allowed more wrecks \non wheels to be put back on our roads and highways.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12842-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12843-S12844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SUPERFUND RECYCLING EQUITY ACT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I would like to express my personal \ndisappointment that S. 2180, the Superfund Recycling Equity Act, was \nnot enacted into law by this Congress.\n  The Lott-Daschle scrap recycling bill was cosponsored by 64 Senators \nand over 300 members of the House. It was strongly supported by the \nAdministration, the environmental community and the scrap recycling \nindustry.\n  Mr. President, the odds for success don't get much better than this.\n  S. 2180 would have provided much needed liability relief to those who \ncollect scrap metal, paper, glass, plastic and textiles and arrange for \nit to be recycled. These are people who should not be held responsible \nfor the pollution of a Superfund site. The Administration agrees. A \nmajority in the Congress agrees. The environmental community agrees. \nThis may be the one and only item within the scope of Superfund reform \nthat has the unanimous support of all parties!\n  That's why, Mr. President, every comprehensive Superfund bill since \n1994 has contained virtually the same language as is found in S. 2180. \nThe same agreements, the same exemptions and the same relief.\n  I believe in recycling and in the American businesses that recycle. \nMy colleagues on both sides of the aisle do too, and that's why we have \ncome as far as we have towards bringing relief to this industry. No one \nin this Chamber would argue that it's better to make new aluminum cans \nthan to recycle the old ones. No one would say that used cans should go \nto the county landfill while new resources go towards making new cans.\n  But that is just what this body is saying by failing to act on this \nlegislation: Recyclers should be held liable for polluting a site \nbecause they provided the materials that created a product that someone \nelse misused in\n\n[[Page S12844]]\n\nan environmentally damaging way. Is Congress content to let this stand? \nShould we continue to hold these innocent parties liable simply because \nthe technical legal fix is a stand-alone bill excerpted from a \ncomprehensive context?\n  Mr. President, I understand the desires of Chairmen Chafee, Bliley \nand Shuster to pass real comprehensive reform. I have always supported \ntheir efforts to do so. However, I cannot believe that moving the \nrecycling provisions separately endangers their ability to do a \ncomprehensive bill. The recycling piece has never been the reason for \nfixing Superfund--and it has certainly never held back progress on a \ncomprehensive bill. Recycling is, given the scope, a very minor part of \nthe total package. Minor, but eminently important to those who continue \nto be forced into funding cleanups for which they are not responsible.\n  Mr. President, I am disappointed that some in the business community \nwould rather see no action on Superfund than allow S. 2180's almost 400 \nCongressional cosponsors to realize a tiny step forward. There are over \n2,600 recycling facilities nationwide who suffer because of this \n``scorch the earth'' mentality. It is indeed a tragedy, Mr. President, \nthat we cannot recognize this common ground, agree on a solution and \nmove on.\n  Mr. President, I hope that in the 106th Congress, we will take a look \nat Superfund with new eyes. I know we can find ways to provide American \nbusinesses--both large and small--some relief. I know we can actually \nget some clean up done, instead of pouring federal and private sector \nmoney into lawyers' pockets. Let's make sure that the parties who mess \nup are the parties that clean up. That's the bottom line and the goal \nwe all strive towards regardless of philosophy or party.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank those members of the House and \nSenate who have been such an integral part of moving S. 2180 forward. \nFirst and foremost, I would like to thank the Minority Leader, Mr. \nDaschle, who has been a great partner and advocate throughout the \nprocess of moving this bill. It is good to know that we can team up on \nissues like these--I hope to continue to do so in the future.\n  I would also like to thank Congressman Tauzin, our House sponsor, for \nall of his efforts. Without a concerted push from both chambers, it is \ndoubtful that we would have come as close as we did.\n  I would also like to thank the Speaker, the White House and the EPA \nfor their interest and support on this issue.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to thank the Institute of Scrap \nRecycling Industries, Inc. (ISRI) for its input. Its membership were \ninstrumental in highlighting the plight of recyclers to their \nCongressional representatives. I hope that they are willing to join us \nin putting a shoulder to the grindstone again next Congress.\n  Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12843-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   INTERNET DOMAIN NAME REGISTRATION\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Internet Tax Freedom \nAct was included in the 1998 Omnibus Appropriations bill.\n  Congress wants a limited moratorium, accompanied by a careful review \nof all Internet and electronic commerce tax issues. This will give \nCongress the opportunity to properly evaluate state and local \ngovernment interstate taxation, federal taxation and trade treatment of \nthe Internet and electronic commerce. By enacting this measure, \nCongress also declared that the Internet should be free of any new \nfederal taxes during the moratorium.\n  Mr. President, present federal law imposes no tax specifically on the \nInternet, including domain name registrations. However, with several of \nmy colleagues, I have become aware of a pertinent U.S. Federal Court \ncase, Thomas et al v. National Science Foundation et al. In this case, \nthe Court recently declared that Section 8003--Ratification of Internet \nFees--of the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of FY98 did \nsanction what had been previously found by the Court to be an \nunconstitutional tax on domain name registrations.\n  I want to take this opportunity to state for the record that Section \n8003 was never intended by Congress to ratify a tax on the Internet, \nbut only to address a fee for the Intellectual Infrastructure Fund. Let \nme be clear. Section 8003 was not an authorization of any tax, \nunconstitutional or otherwise.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased this Congress rightly recognized the \nimportance of the Internet and electronic commerce to America's \neconomy, and the need to eliminate uncertainty and confusion \nsurrounding Internet taxation policies.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12844-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12844-S12845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO THE SENATE STAFF OF THE 105TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as the 105th Congress comes to a close, I \nwant to recognize some of the people without whom the Senate simply \ncould not operate--the loyal staff who serve this institution day in \nand day out with great dedication and pride.\n  The sacrifices staff make are largely unknown to most people outside \nthe Senate, except perhaps their families. When most of us leave for \nhome after a late night, the Official Reporters of Debates, the \nParliamentarians, the Bill Clerks, often face several more hours in the \noffice to finish up that day's legislative work. Staff often work \naround the clock to finalize important legislative measures, such as \nthe omnibus appropriations bill we just passed.\n  Anyone who understands the Senate understands the crucial role staff \nplays. Today, I want to thank all Senate staff for their service to the \nSenate and to the Nation.\n  In particular, I want to mention some of the people who are \nresponsible for the daily operations of the Senate. I begin by \nexpressing my gratitude to the office of the Secretary of the Senate. \nGary Sisco, Secretary of the Senate, is responsible for some of the \nmost important activities in the Senate such as the Official Reporters \nof Debates, the Legislative and Bill Clerks, the Disbursing Office, the \nInformation Systems and Computer Staff, the Senate Page School, the \nHistorical Office and many other vital offices in the Senate. He has \ndone a wonderful job of overseeing and improving the delivery and \nquality of services of those offices. I appreciate the professionalism \nand even-handedness he has exhibited throughout the 105th Congress. \nGary is ably assisted by Jon Lynn Kerchner, Lura Nell Mitchell and Beth \nCollett.\n  Gregory Casey, who will be leaving the Senate shortly, has \ndemonstrated tireless dedication to the Senate in the execution of his \nmany responsibilities as Sergeant at Arms of the Senate. I'm thankful \nhe didn't have to arrest any of us during his tenure as Sergeant at \nArms and I commend him for his excellent management of a very large and \ncomplex operation. We will miss Greg and wish him the very best in the \nchallenges that lay ahead. The Sergeant at Arms has been supported by \nthe capable assistance of the Deputy Sergeant at Arms Loretta Symms and \nLarry Harris, his Administrative Assistant. The Sergeant's office is \nalso assisted by the work of Becky Daugherty, Laura Parker, Carol \nKresge, Mallory McCaskill and Laura Rossi.\n  I would like to give special thanks for the hard work and consummate \nprofessionalism of Jeri Thomson, the executive assistant for the \nminority, who has provided invaluable assistance to my Democratic \ncolleagues and to me.\n  I would also like to thank the staff of our Capitol Facilities \noffice, directed by Roy Banks, who keep this building and our offices \nclean and are always available, often on very short notice, to provide \nlogistical support for the numerous meetings and gatherings we hold in \nthe Capitol.\n  All Senators, I am sure, are grateful for the counsel and support \nthey receive from the staff who work the Senate floor and cloakrooms. \nThat assistance has become even more valuable to me since I became \nDemocratic Leader.\n  Our Democratic floor staff works under the excellent leadership of \nMarty Paone, the Secretary for the Minority. Under great pressure, \noften with little time and with little margin for error, Marty has time \nand again provided wise counsel to all Senate Democrats--and even \nRepublican Senators, on occasion. Despite the pressures, Marty always \nfinds time to respond to questions from Senators and staff alike--\neverything from the routine questions about timing of votes to the most \ncomplex analysis of parliamentary procedure. The rare combination of a \nsharp mind,\n\n[[Page S12845]]\n\neven temperament, and in-depth experience make Marty one of the most \nvaluable officers of the Senate, and I want to thank him and recognize \nhim for that. In the Secretary's office, Marty is ably assisted by Sue \nSpatz and Nancy Iacomini.\n  Day-to-day management of the floor operation is in the capable and \nenergetic hands of Lula Davis, the Assistant Secretary to the Minority. \nLula's ability to juggle multiple tasks--from negotiations over bills \nthat we seek to clear by unanimous consent, to advising Senators and \nstaff on legislative strategy, to acting as informal fashion adviser to \nmany of my colleagues--demonstrates her tireless dedication to making \nthings work around here. Marty and Lula are joined by Democratic Floor \nAssistants, Gary Myrick and Paul Brown, who have done a wonderful job \nhelping to move legislation and protect Senators' interests. I am \nprofoundly grateful for their dedication, their vigilance and their \nintellect. They are all ably assisted by Alice Aughtry.\n  Our Democratic Cloakroom staff, Paul Cloutier, Brian Griffin, Brian \nErwin and Tricia Engle also provide invaluable assistance in many \naspects of our Senate life. Among other things, they field countless \nqueries about what the Senate is doing and when votes will occur, \nincluding that age-old question, ``Will there be any more roll call \nvotes tonight?''. They help us stay on schedule and where we are \nsupposed to be, all the while keeping track of the flurry of \nlegislation that moves through here, and keeping most of us \nentertained. I salute them for their hard work and good humor and thank \nthem for their assistance.\n  It is no exaggeration to say that our ability to navigate the \ncomplexities of Senate rules and procedures would be impossible without \nthe assistance of our Parliamentarians. Senate Parliamentarian Bob \nDove, with the outstanding assistance of Senior Assistant \nParliamentarian Alan Frumin, Assistant Parliamentarian Kevin Kayes, and \nParliamentary Assistant Sally Goffinet, provides essential expertise \nand understanding of Senate procedure.\n  Our growing C-SPAN audience has no doubt become familiar with the \ncommanding voice of Legislative Clerk Scott Bates and his assistant \nDavid Tinsley; Bill Clerk Kathie Alvarez has also become a notable \npresence. Kathie is assisted in her duties as Bill Clerk by Mary Anne \nClarkson and John Burnham. Our legislative and bill clerks deserve the \nthanks and respect of all Senators for their keen attention to detail \nand their patient professionalism.\n  Journal Clerk William Lackey and his assistants Patrick Keating and \nScott Sanborn; Enrolling Clerk Tom Lundregan and his assistant Charlene \nMcDevitt; Executive Clerk David Marcos, 1st Assistant Executive Clerk, \nMichelle Haynes and assistants Ken Dean and Terry Sauvain; Daily Digest \nEditor Thomas Pellikaan, Assistant Editor Linda Sebold, and Staff \nAssistant Kimberly Longsworth, all have my gratitude for their long \nhours and hard work.\n  I also would like to thank and commend again our official Reporters \nof Debates for their hard work: Chief Reporter Ronald Kavulick and \nCoordinator of the Congressional Record, Eileen Milton; Morning \nBusiness Editor Lee Brown and Assistant Editor John Merlino; Expert \nTranscribers Angela Gallacher, Alma Kristoffersen and Bernita Parker; \nand the Official Reporters of Debates: Jerald Linnell, Raleigh Milton, \nJoel Breitner, Mary Jane McCarthy, Paul Nelson, Katie-Jane Teel, and \nPatrick Renzi.\n  I also want to thank our Senate Doorkeepers, directed by Myron \nFleming and Krista Beal for the friendly and helpful attitude they \nbring to their jobs, often in the face of long and uncertain hours. \nWithout their assistance and that of all of our Senate support staff, \nour work simply could not get done.\n  Last, but certainly not least, Mr. President, I want to thank my own \nstaff--in South Dakota and in Washington--and the staff of the \nDemocratic Leadership Committees, whom I share with Senators Reid, \nRockefeller, and Kerry. These bright, talented people are dedicated to \nthe effort to serve the people of South Dakota and the Nation, as well \nas every Democratic Senator and their staffs. They do a tremendous job, \nand I owe each of them a debt of gratitude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12844-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THANKS TO ERSKINE BOWLES\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Erskine Bowles will soon leave his post \nas White House Chief of Staff. He will return to his beloved North \nCarolina. He returns to his family; his remarkable wife, Crandall, and \nhis exceptional children, Sam, Annie and Bill. If you know Erskine \nBowles, you know that his heart has never left them through all his \ntime in Washington. His home and his family are the pride of his life.\n  But as Erskine prepares to leave his post, he has a right to feel \ndeeply proud of all he has accomplished here, as well. In so much of \nthe progress made during President Clinton's Administration, you see \nthe steady hand and clear vision of Erskine Bowles.\n  He came to the Capital little known to most of us. He had no \nexperience in the so-called ``ways'' of Washington. Yet before long, \nthe President realized Erskine was the man for the toughest job in \ntown.\n  The President's confidence in this choice has been soundly ratified. \nErskine leaves here a true friend to every one of us in the Democratic \nCaucus. He has earned the respect and admiration of Senators on both \nsides of the aisle. Most importantly, he has put the interests of the \ncountry ahead of the problems and politics of public life. By giving of \nhimself--his time and his talents--millions of American families are \nbetter off today than they would have been had Erskine never come to \nWashington.\n  Jobless men and women now support growing families. Those workers \nhave higher wages. Those wages have helped fuel a roaring economy. \nThose families can afford to buy their own homes. Those parents can \nsend their children to college. Those children can share in the \npromising future that Erskine Bowles helped build.\n  Mr. President, earlier today, we passed a massive budget bill. Some \nhave found fault with that bill in both substance and process. Some of \nthat criticism is justified. But, I, for one, am relieved that during \nthis unfortunate process, the country had Erskine Bowles negotiating \nthe substance. Due in large part to Erskine Bowles, there will be \n100,000 new, qualified teachers helping our children get the education \nthey deserve.\n  There is another important provision in the bill worth noting. For \ntucked in that $500 billion package, there is funding for the \noperations of the White House. And from the money dedicated to the \nsalaries of the White House staff, Erskine Bowles takes one dollar a \nyear.\n  So as we send that bill to the President for his signature, I will \ntake pride in its support for 100,000 teachers; in its protections for \nour environment; and for the emergency relief it will bring to our farm \nfamilies.\n  I will also support it for what it represents: Erskine Bowles' \nsalary--probably the smartest single dollar this government has ever \nspent.\n  On behalf of all my colleagues, we honor the service of Erskine \nBowles, and wish him and his family the very best in the good days that \nlie ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12845-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12845-S12846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO CHAIRMAN XAVIER BECERRA\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as we bring our legislative session to an \nend, it is appropriate that we pay tribute to an American leader, the \noutgoing Chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus for the 105th \nCongress, and my friend, Xavier Becerra.\n  Our Nation is fortunate to have an actively engaged Congressional \nHispanic Caucus to ensure that more Americans have the opportunity to \nenjoy the rewards and responsibilities of American citizenship. Their \nefforts have succeeded in increasing educational opportunities for \nHispanic Americans, promoting fairness in our judicial system, and \nprotecting political participation vital to our democracy. Millions of \npeople have benefited from effective leadership provided by the \nCongressional Hispanic Caucus, and in particular, by Mr. Becerra.\n  Xavier Becerra was first elected to represent the 30th District of \nCalifornia in November 1992. In 1997, Representative Becerra was \nelected to serve as Chairman of the Congressional\n\n[[Page S12846]]\n\nHispanic Caucus. Under his chairmanship, educational opportunities for \nHispanic Americans have grown considerably: Hispanic Serving \nInstitutions have received record-level funding, bilingual education \nprograms once threatened have been strengthened, nearly $500 million \nhas been allocated for the President's Latino Education Plan, and equal \naccess to technology for students in rural and urban centers has been \nenhanced through the e-rate program.\n  Chairman Becerra has demonstrated great leadership and distinguished \nhimself as powerful legislative voice in pushing for a positive agenda \nthat includes expanding health care, reducing the naturalization \nbacklog at the INS, promoting fairness in our judicial system, ensuring \na fair and accurate census, and protecting voting rights.\n  It has been a privilege for the Democratic Caucus to work with \nChairman Becerra and his fellow members of the Congressional Hispanic \nCaucus. I am going to miss the leadership of Chairman Xavier Becerra, \nbut I look forward to his continuing friendship and to developing a \nstrong working relationship with the next Chair of the Congressional \nHispanic Caucus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12845-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             COMMUNITY BROADCASTERS PROTECTION ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, the 105th Congress is likely to adjourn \nwithout enacting S. 1427, the Community Broadcasters Protection Act of \n1998. Even so, I want to provide my colleagues a status report on the \nbill and advise them of the prospects for passage next year.\n  The principal purpose of S. 1427 is to provide permanent ``Class A \nlicenses'' for low-power broadcasters. Currently these broadcasters \nhave secondary status, which means that they can be bumped from their \nplace on the spectrum by a full-power station. Without permanent \nstatus, these broadcasters have a hard time obtaining long-term \ncapital.\n  After introducing this legislation last year, I worked with the staff \nof the Federal Communications Committee to refine the bill. In pursuing \nthis matter, I have sought to provide a degree of certainty for low \npower broadcasters without creating any unintended consequences for \nother users of the spectrum. The result, which was reported from the \nSenate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation on October 1, \nhas achieved that goal.\n  The core mission of low power broadcasters is to provide programming \nfor local communities that are not served by full power stations. These \nunder-served communities may be in rural areas or in large metropolitan \nareas. In my state, we have a low-power station that provides \nprogramming that is geared to the interests of rural Kentuckians. \nHowever, in Washington, D.C., low power broadcasters provide Spanish \nlanguage programming to meet the needs of the Hispanic population in \nthis area.\n  The FCC has recognized the unique role that community broadcasters \nplay in providing programming to under-served audiences. Earlier this \nyear, when I asked Chairman Kennard for his comments on the \nlegislation, he responded favorably. Chairman Kennard said, ``Having \nreviewed the legislation, I have no major concerns with the bill.''\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator McCain, the chairman of \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Senator \nHollings, the ranking Democrat on the committee, and my other \ncolleagues on the committee for their support of this legislation. As \nof today, 13 members of the Commerce Committee have joined as \ncosponsors. Also I want to express my appreciation to Senator Burns, \nthe chairman of the Communications Subcommittee. Senator Burns has \ncosponsored S. 1427, and he has advised that he will introduce this \nlegislation when the 106th Congress convenes next year. I thank my \ncolleague for his continued interest in and support for community \nbroadcasters. I am very pleased to leave this legislation in the \ncapable hands of the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for his \nremarks and want to confirm that I plan to introduce this legislation \nnext year. Also, I want to congratulate Senator Ford on his efforts on \nthis legislation. Due to his persistence, much of the preliminary work \non this bill has been done. While we will miss his presence on the \nCommerce Committee next year, we will continue to benefit from his work \nas a member of this body.\n  Mr. FORD. Again, I thank the Senator from Montana and wish him luck \nin this effort next year. The community broadcasters of the nation have \nearned a permanent place on the broadcast spectrum.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12846-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE SENATE SAYS GOODBYE TO SENATOR DIRK KEMPTHORNE\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, when one speaks of the State of Idaho, we \nthink of her glorious and rugged landscape, her fertile valleys, her \nwaters ideal for fishing, her world-class ski resorts, her national \nparks and forests, with land fit for hiking, or biking, and, of course, \nher reputation as the potato capital of the world. Following the end of \nthe 105th Congress, I daresay that our associations to the State of \nIdaho will also include the name of Dirk Kempthorne, the state's junior \nSenator and one of this body's most respected Members. Although our \nfriend from the west is leaving the Senate after only one six-year \nterm, I, for one, will remember him fondly for years to come.\n  Senator Kempthorne and I formerly served together as Chairman and \nRanking Member, respectively, of the Personnel Subcommittee of the \nArmed Services Committee. We worked together to introduce legislation \nrequiring the study of gender integrated training in the military. That \nassociation has been pleasant, and, I believe, productive. To be sure, \nI have not always agreed with his policy proposals, or he with mine. On \nmany issues, including the balanced budget constitutional amendment and \nthe unfunded mandates legislation, we have held opposing views.\n  Throughout the lengthy debate on the unfunded mandates bill in early \n1995, the Senator was conscientious, thorough, and fair. His grace and \ncourtesy in managing that bill were impressive, particularly for \nsomeone so new to the Senate. And, as we all know, his efforts paid off \nafter deliberate consideration and compromise. Moreover, with passage \nof the unfunded mandates bill, Senator Kempthorne holds the honor of \nbeing the most junior member of the Senate since World War II to \nauthor, manage, and win passage of a bill numbered Senate Bill One.\n  When he leaves these hallowed halls, Senator Kempthorne will return \nto his home state. Boise, of course, is familiar ground for Senator \nKempthorne, serving as that city's forty-third Mayor, from 1985 until \n1992, when the people of Idaho elected him to his present seat in the \nSenate. Incidentally, he became so popular during his first term as \nMayor that he faced no opposition in his bid for a second term! How \nmany of our colleagues would like to be in that situation? How many of \nus would like to be so universally popular, and be held in such high \nrespect by our constituents, that such popularity and respect would \nforeclose potential challengers?\n  I congratulate Senator Kempthorne on his fine service here, and I \nwish him and his nice family happiness in future years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12846-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12846-S12847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         DRUG PRICE COMPETITION AND PATENT TERM RESTORATION ACT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, 14 years ago, when I served as Chairman of \nthe Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee, I teamed up with \nRepresentative Henry Waxman, Chairman of the Subcommittee on Health and \nthe Environment of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, to lead \npassage of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act \nof 1984.\n  The bottom line of this law was to improve the health of the American \npeople. The statute accomplishes this in two primary ways: First, it \nessentially created the market for more moderately priced generic drugs \nby allowing generic manufacturers to demonstrate their equivalence to \npioneer products without duplicating all of the original safety and \nefficacy data. Relieved of this costly burden, generic drug firms can \nprovide their products at competitive prices which are attractive to \nmany consumers.\n  Second, pioneer drug firms became eligible for restoration of some of \nthe patent term lost due to the extensive\n\n[[Page S12847]]\n\nFDA review of safety and efficacy that all new drugs must undergo. This \npartial restoration of patent term--up to five years in certain \ncircumstances when such restoration would not result in a greater than \n14 year effective patent life--allowed pioneer drug firms additional \ntime to recoup the enormous investments required to bring a new drug to \nmarket. This helped attract the investment capital that pioneer firms \nneed to develop the next generation of life-saving drugs.\n  Consumers benefit from this win-win dynamic because the American \npublic gets both new drugs and competitively priced off-patent \nmedications.\n  As we start the 15th year since the enactment of this important \nhealth and consumer law, we have a generic pharmaceutical sector that \nhas developed into an integral part of the health care system, which \ntogether with innovator pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies lead \nthe world in the development and marketing of new health care products.\n  While I think that the track record of the Hatch-Waxman Act is \nenviable, I hope that we can even do better for the American public in \nthe future.\n  Accordingly, I intend to devote time during the next Congress to \nbegin the necessary examination into how we can make changes in the law \nthat will increase our ability to produce both the innovative products \nthat we have come to expect and the lower priced generic products that \nare so attractive to the family budget.\n  I intend for this examination to include a serious study of how well \nthe Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Extension Act has functioned \nover the past 14 years, whether the Act has fulfilled its initial \npromise, how the courts have interpreted the Act, and indeed, how it \nhas been implemented. I hope to work closely in this endeavor with my \ngood friend and colleague Senator Jim Jeffords, Chairman of the Labor \nand Human Resources Committee, which shares jurisdiction over the Act \nwith the Judiciary Committee.\n  A major test of such a review will be to assemble a package of \ninitiatives that will retain the delicate but essential balance between \nthe innovator and generic sectors of the industry. This will be a \ndifficult task but it is a worthwhile endeavor for the American people.\n  Even during this session of Congress, some have proposed changes to \nour nation's drug discovery laws. There has, for example, been some \ndiscussion about changing one of the most controversial provisions of \nthe 1984 law--the so-called Bolar Amendment. Section 271(e) of the \nTitle 35, contains language to overturn a 1984 Federal Circuit Court of \nAppeals ruling in the case of Roche v. Bolar Pharmaceutical Co., which \nheld that conducting the tests required to secure approval of generic \ncopies of pioneer drugs constituted patent infringement. Section \n271(e)(1) establishes an exception to patent infringement laws to \nauthorize generic pharmaceutical companies to conduct testing on patent \napproved pharmaceutical products for purpose of filing an abbreviated \nnew drug application.\n  Recently, the application of section 271(e)(1) has been a matter of \nsome controversy in an on-going legal battle between two pioneer drug \nfirms, one company holding existing patent protection and FDA product \napproval and the other company asserting its own patent rights and \nseeking pioneer rather than generic approval from FDA. While ultimately \nthe courts must decide whether this is a case of patent infringement, \nit is clear that this is not merely a simple, garden variety patent \ninfringement case because it also raises the question of precisely what \ntype activities that section 271(e)(1) should allow, and should not \nallow, in the context of developing not only generic drugs but new \ndrugs and biologicals that they potentially compete directly with.\n  While I do not take a position on the merits of the actual patent \nrights in dispute in the current Amgen v. Hoechst Marion Roussel \nlitigation, I must say this case is of some concern to me, especially \nwith regard to court's initial findings which are not consistent with, \nand broaden, Congress' intent in enacting 271(e).\n  I do believe Congress would be wise to reassess the breadth of \nsection 271(e)(1) in light of this and a number of court decisions \nsince 1984 that have tended to expand the scope of this provision. One \ncase in particular is the 1990 Supreme Court decision in Lilly v. \nMedtronic.\n  My position on these questionable decisions has been clear for some \ntime. I was, in fact, a signatory to an amicus brief in the Lilly case \nthat argued for a somewhat narrower interpretation of 271(e)(1) than \nhas evolved in the courts.\n  One proposal worthy of serious consideration is to more clearly limit \nthe applicability of 271(e)(1) to exclude testing and other activities \nnecessary for approval of NDAs and BLAs from the patent infringement \nexemption. Of course, the 271(e)(1) question is only one of many issues \nthat will undoubtedly be proper for further discussion in the next \nCongress.\n  Some are concerned about whether drugs that were already in FDA \nreview at the time of enactment of Hatch-Waxman (the ``pipeline \ndrugs'') have received adequate and fair patent protections in view of \nsubsequent delays that were encountered. Congress should undertake \ncomplete review of this proposal during our study of Waxman-Hatch next \nyear, as I believe the evidence will show that there are inequalities \nwe should take steps to remediate.\n  Others are concerned about the application of the 180 day generic \ndrug exclusivity rule in the aftermath of the Mova decision. Indeed, \nsome are advocating report language that will give FDA new leeway to \nadopt a ``first-to-succeed'' in patent litigation approach rather than \nthe ``first-to-file'' an ANDA that the courts have found.\n  Frankly, I have concerns about the current outcome whereby some ANDA \napplicants appear to be handsomely rewarded by pioneer firms for not \nselling generic competitors.\n  Still others advocate in the spirit of international harmonization \nadopting the European rule of a 10 year marketing exclusivity period \nfor all new drugs. And others point out that the advent of the new \nGATT-required 20 year from filing patent term may change the \ntraditional incentives in coordinating PTO and FDA approvals.\n  It is time, some argue, to do away completely with current rule by \nwhich only 5 years of patent life may be restored to compensate time \nlost at FDA and only if the effective patent term does not exceed 14 \nyears. Some would also like to revise the rule that limits patent \nrestoration for time lost during the IND phase in a for each 2-days \nlost, 1-day restored ratio.\n  On the generic side of the industry, there is concern that as NDA \napprovals speed up due to user fees, generic approvals continue to lag \nand take much longer than NDAs. There is also great frustration about \nwhat some describe as challenges to the bioequivalence of generic \nproducts that are more a delaying and harassing tactic than a bona fide \nscientific dispute.\n  And then, there are those in the generic industry who believe that \nFDA's Orange Book, which records the patents in effect for FDA approved \ndrugs, should be renamed as the ``Evergreen Book''!\n  So there are many issues that merit consideration as we reassess the \nadequacy of the laws pertaining to the generic and pioneer sectors of \nthe pharmaceutical industry.\n  Our focus should be on ascertaining what steps we can take that will \nmost benefit the American people in terms of providing incentives both \nfor the development of new drugs and the production of competitively \npriced generic products. This has and will continue to require a \ndelicate balance. There is an inherent tension between the twin goals \ndiscovering the next generation of drugs while at the same time \nproviding generic versions of today's medications.\n  My goal is to reconcile these somewhat conflicting but wholly \nmeritorious goals in the interest of the American people, and I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in the House and Senate on this \ncomplex issue next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12846-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12847-S12848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ALLEN GARTNER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Allen Gartner is one of Vermont's real \ncitizen treasures. He was recently honored by the Rutland Region \nChamber of Commerce on their 100th anniversary. I ask unanimous consent \nthat a letter I\n\n[[Page S12848]]\n\nwrote and an article about this honor be printed in the Record.\n  The whole Gartner family represent the best of Vermont and Marcelle \nand I value their friendship.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    Patrick Leahy,\n\n\n                                                 U.S. Senator,\n\n                                                  October 1, 1998.\n     Rutland Region Chamber of Commerce,\n     North Main Street,\n     Rutland, VT\n       Dear Friends: My mother was wrong.\n       She always told me that if I wanted something done right, I \n     should do it myself.\n       What I learned a little later in life was that if I REALLY \n     wanted something done right, I needed to ask Allen Gartner to \n     do it.\n       Allen personifies Rutland--his love of his family, his \n     sense of the broader community, his deep spirituality, and \n     his sense of the broader community of which we are all a \n     part. Most important for his friends in Rutland and all over \n     Vermont is an indomitable sense that if you work hard enough, \n     and if your cause is just, anything is possible.\n       It is fitting that Allen is honored by a group as respected \n     as the Rutland Region Chamber of Commerce. But Allen, by the \n     life he leads, the work he does and the joy he brings to \n     others, honors all of us every single day.\n           Sincerely,\n     Pat.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Rutland Daily Herald, October 5, 1998]\n\n         Allen Gartner, Business Leader With a Sense of Charity\n\n                       (By Laurie Lynn Strasser)\n\n       ``Tzedaka'' is the most important word in the Hebrew \n     language, Mintzer Brothers co-owner Allen S. Gartner said \n     last Thursday after receiving the 1998 Business Person of the \n     Year award from the Rutland Region Chamber of Commerce.\n       It means ``charity.''\n       ``I was raised that this is the greatest country in the \n     world, by a long shot,'' said Gartner. ``It was our \n     obligation to give back to the community. My parents not only \n     spoke those words, but they lived by those words.''\n       In conferring the honor, Rutland Chamber of Commerce \n     Executive Vice President Tom Donahue rattled off a litany of \n     boards that Gartner has served on. Donahue added that if he \n     listed all the extracurriculars and charities Gartner had \n     helped, ``this luncheon might turn into a dinner meeting.''\n       In an interview afterward, Gartner said he felt honored by \n     the award, but that recognition was not the point.\n       ``Whatever I'm doing, I need to do because that's what \n     people should do,'' he said. ``The bottom line of business is \n     not what's important. That's not what we're on this planet \n     for. We're only here a speck anyway. Really, it's just a \n     blip. What's important is the welfare of the community.'' His \n     father, the late Walter Gartner, used to say that the best \n     form of giving is anonymous. His father made it out of Nazi \n     Germany in the nick of time, but lost the rest of his family \n     to the Holocaust. After World War II, he married and bought \n     Mintzer Bros., a fuel oil and grain business that had been \n     founded in 1926.\n       Walter Gartner's wife, Margot, gave birth to Edward in 1945 \n     and Allen in 1949.\n       The younger Gartner still recalls the days when customers \n     bought berry baskets, syrup cans and laying mash. By the \n     early 1960's, the emphasis had switched to building supplies.\n       Gartner worked at the Strongs Avenue store in the summers \n     between his graduation from Rutland High School in 1967 and \n     Union College in 1971.\n       He spent his junior year abroad in France. Just last year, \n     he returned to Paris for an emotional reunion with his host \n     family. The people he last saw as teenagers are now in their \n     40s, he noted.\n       Gartner earned a bachelor's degree in political science and \n     modern languages.\n       ``I have a passion for politics,'' he said. ``To me, \n     politics is conflict and compromise.''\n       He went on to pursue an advanced degree at New York \n     University Law School, although he never intended to become a \n     practicing attorney.\n       ``I spent the first 20 years of my life trying to be a \n     peace-maker,'' he said. ``The first day of law school, the \n     professor's asking, ``What would your argument be? It was \n     always anti-thetical to what I believed, but it was good \n     education. I refer to my law school education almost every \n     day of the week.''\n       It wound up taking him seven years to finish at NYU because \n     his father had suffered a stroke. Living with relatives on \n     Manhattan's Upper West Side, he would attend graduate school \n     then work for one semester each year.\n       ``I'd go down to the pay phone in the basement of the law \n     school library and make phone calls for the business,'' he \n     recalled. ``I'd do this every day, buying and selling lumber, \n     calling customers.''\n       Gradually, he and his brother, Edward, took the reins from \n     their father. Walter Gartner died in 1983.\n       The brothers opened another Mintzer branch in Ludlow in the \n     early 1980s. Three years ago they expanded again into the \n     Route 7 south space vacated by Grossman's after it went out \n     of business.\n       In the coming year, Mintzer Bros. may face its toughest \n     challenge in 70 years. Home Depot, the largest hardware chain \n     in the world, has indicated an interest in opening a large \n     store in Rutland.\n       ``Big orange is a dose of reality,'' he said referring to \n     Home Depot's theme color. ``You've got to fight the good \n     fight, fight it as best as you can. Business today is war. \n     I'm not sure I'm cut out for war.''\n       Gartner was instrumental in recruiting area merchants to \n     form Rutland Region First, a grassroots organization whose \n     goal is to stop Home Depot from locating in the area.\n       No matter what happens with the business, it is important \n     to keep perspective, said Gartner. He has faced worse \n     hardships, including the loss of his firstborn daughter when \n     she was six days old and chronic back pain for the past 17 \n     years. Financial challenges are not as important as keeping \n     his family intact, Gartner said.\n       Just like when he was growing up, Gartner still plays the \n     role of peaceseeker, but these days he has taken the quest to \n     an international level.\n       Last week, he met Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who was \n     in Washington, DC, to parley with Israeli Prime Minister \n     Benjamin Netanyahu.\n       ``It pains me to see Palestinians mistreated,'' he said. \n     ``I'm a Zionist, but I think we've got to live together.''\n       Committed to the Middle East peace process for the past \n     decade, he shaved off his beard when he learned of the \n     historic 1979 accord between Israel and Egypt. When Yasser \n     Arafat signed a treaty with the late Isaac Rabin in 1993, \n     Gartner was there on the south lawn of the White House.\n       ``It was a most emotional moment for me,'' he recalled, \n     describing weeping Jewish and Arab Americans throwing their \n     arms around each other.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12847-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF MARY LOUISE SINCLAIR\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, before we adjourn, Senator Moynihan and I \nwould like to speak to an issue that has yet been unable to be \nresolved--the funding for the Conservation Trust Fund of Puerto Rico. \nThe Conservation Trust was created in 1968 for the protection of the \nnatural resources and environmental beauty of Puerto Rico.\n  The Trust lost much of its funding as a consequence of the decisions \nto phase-out section 936 and eliminate the Qualified Possession Source \nInvestment Income (also known as ``QPSII'') provision in the tax code. \nI hope that Congress and the Administration will continue to work \ntogether to find an equitable solution that will permit the Trust to \ncontinue its protection of the environment in Puerto Rico.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I agree with the distinguished Chairman of the Finance \nCommittee. I would also point out that both the funding for the \nConservation Trust and the opportunity to provide much needed monies to \nPuerto Rico and the Virgin Islands could have been accomplished by \nincluding the Administration's rum ``cover over'' proposal as part of \nthe tax extenders package in the omnibus appropriations measure.\n  The needs of Puerto Rico, and the importance of this provision, were \nmagnified by the devastation recently caused by Hurricane Georges. \nDespite significant bipartisan support in the Senate and the House, and \na strong push from the Administration, for some reason the House \nrefused to include this provision in the bill. I thank the Chairman for \nthe opportunity to work with him next year to address this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12849-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL SECURITY PLANNING\n\n  Mr. WARNER. During the past two weeks, the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee has conducted hearings on the readiness of the armed forces. \nThrough testimony from the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, and the service secretaries, it has been \nrevealed that the military is trained and being asked to perform beyond \ncapacity. The readiness of the armed forces is clearly and unmistakably \nsuffering. For the past several years, this has been the concern of \nmany of the committee and in the Senate, myself included, and we have \nmade every argument during this precipitous decade-plus decrease in \ndefense budgeting to reduce the cuts, arguing that we've cut well \nbeyond the fat and the flesh, and have long been cutting into the bone.\n  This situation is now receiving the priority so long overdue. \nApproximately $7 billion of the emergency spending supplemental \ncurrently being debated is for immediate defense readiness funding \nshortfalls. This is, however, only a stop gap measure, and must be the \nfirst step in a long journey to ensure the military is properly \nexercised and outfitted to defend U.S. national security interests.\n  If we are to responsibly correct this readiness shortcoming, then we \nmust look to the root cause or causes. I believe, as do several of my \ncolleagues on the armed services committee, and others in the Senate, \nthat the primary and foremost reason for the readiness shortfall is an \nincongruity between the foreign policy goals of this administration, \nthe strategy, and the resources to achieve those goals.\n  While defense spending is at an historical low, the armed forces are \nbeing exercised and deployed in ever increasing frequency and with less \nand less direction. Earlier this year, for example, Admiral Conrad \nLautenbacher gave the remarkable statistic that since the demise of the \nSoviet Union and the end of the Cold War, the Navy-Marine Corps team \nalone has been involved in 93 naval contingencies in 96 months. That is \nan average of almost once a month that the Navy-Marine Corps team has \nbeen involved in a contingency of importance to our national security.\n  As the Congress prepares to adjourn, we do so in a world laden with \ninstability, one which will demand U.S. leadership and engagement. In \nKosovo, refugees--numbering nearly a quarter of a million--are fleeing \nfrom Kilosevic's forces. They are cowering in the mountains where the \nharsh winter of the Balkan mountains will kill thousands more, or they \nare flooding neighboring countries for relief--but finding those \ncountries ill-equipped to support them. I am confident NATO, under U.S. \nleadership, will soon take action to end the strife action which will \nrequire the deployment of a ground forces in Kosovo--with some U.S. \nparticipants in view of having an American commander of NATO.\n  Israel remains the flashpoint in the Middle East, but others come and \ngo. Turkish troops are massing on the Syrian border, preparing to \ndefend a pre-World War II territory claim and retaliate to any Syrian \nopposition in force. The Taliban, having secured a religious revolution \nin Afghanistan, have engaged Iranian forces along their common border \nin an escalating war between two sects of Islam.\n  While the Gulf War has been over for seven years, Iraq, in defiance \nof the world community, continues to remain armed. Two months have \npassed since Saddam Hussein prohibited officials from the United \nNations Special Commission on Iraq from conducting inspections. \nFurther, the testing of Vx gas by Iraq has been corroborated by \nindependent tests in France. Questions, credible ones, still arise over \ntheir nuclear posture.\n  Worldwide, a proliferation of nuclear technology and the \nproliferation of the means to deliver weapons of mass destruction is \nunnevering. India and Pakistan now have the bomb, and unfortunately, \nlike so many other neighbors in the world community, they also have the \nmotive to use it against each other. The launch of the Taepo Dong 1 by \nNorth Korea was a clear and unmistakable ``shot heard round the \nworld.'' Such an action by a militarized, secretive, isolated, country \nin the throws of an overwhelming economic depression, by a people \nincreasingly in despair, is a harbinger of catastrophe.\n  This is but a brief summary--a few examples to illustrate where I see \ncontinuing and emerging challenges to United States national security \ninterests. Clearly, the end of the Cold War was not peace, but a \ntransformation of the world's politico-military order with unsettled \nancient conflicts based on ethnic, religious or tribal differences and \ninterests against emerging. These threats require our continued \nvigilance and must be our highest concerns.\n  It is in this context that former Secretary of Defense, Dr. James \nSchlesinger, examines the current administrations ability to meet these \nthreats given current U.S. force structure and the resources accorded \nto achieving foreign and defense goals. In his article, ``Raise the \nAnchor or Lower the Ship, Defense Budgeting and Planning,'' published \nin the Fall of 1998 edition of The National Interest, Dr. Schlesinger \narticulates the dilemma with which we find ourselves in recouping the \npeace dividend in an unstable world that demands U.S. presence and \nleadership.\n  Dr. Schlesinger is far too modest to observe that his insights were \npart of the foundation that led to the increase in military funding \nthat occurs in legislation to be adopted by Congress this week; I \nencourage each of my colleagues to take a moment to review the article. \nHis forthright, candid discussion of the mismatch between the ends of \nU.S. foreign and defense policy and the means with which to realize \nthose ends will be a prominent reference for the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and this body as we deliberate this emergency defense \nappropriations supplemental and future defense funding issues in the \ncoming congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12849-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12849-S12850]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              DALE BUMPERS\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, as we approach the end of another Congress, \nwe bid farewell to those Senators who will not be returning in January. \nToday I wish to say farewell to a good friend and one of the most \nhonorable and respected members of this body--Dale Bumpers.\n  Dale Bumpers is the epitome of what a Senator should be. He entered \npublic service because he believed that it was a noble profession, and \nthroughout his political career he has performed his duties with the \nhighest levels of integrity and decency. He has always been\n\n[[Page S12850]]\n\nguided by his heart and his mind, not by any polls.\n  He almost seems like a character from a Frank Capra film. He was a \nWorld War II veteran from a small town who attended college and law \nschool on the G.I. Bill. After practicing law for 20 years in his home \ntown, he earned a reputation as a political giant-killer on his way to \nthe Governor's mansion and eventually the Senate. Even his home address \nseems straight out of Hollywood. Believe it or not, he actually lives \non a street named Honesty Way.\n  Oftentimes when you're watching Dale Bumpers speak from the Senate \nfloor, you can't help but think of the character made famous by Jimmy \nStewart--Senator Jefferson Smith--whose political philosophy was ``the \nonly causes worth fighting for are lost causes,'' and whose most famous \nline was, ``Either I'm dead right, or I'm crazy.''\n  As Senator Bumpers said just the other day on this floor, he's \nprobably fought more losing battles than any other Senator. I can \npicture Senator Bumpers right now, speaking from the heart on some \nissue about which he cares very deeply. He knows that he's right, but \nwhatever he says, he can't seem to sway a majority of his colleagues. \nBut no matter what, he won't give up. He won't back down. And in 18 \nyears of serving with Dale Bumpers, I can honestly say that I never saw \nhim waver in his beliefs or back down from a good, honest debate.\n  Two years ago, when Dale Bumpers was speaking on the retirement of \nhis former colleague from Arkansas, David Pryor, he said, and I quote, \n``I am not a terribly effective legislator because I have a very \ndifficult time compromising. I have strong beliefs, and sometimes \ncompromise is just out of the question for me.''\n  Maybe there is some truth to that statement. Maybe Dale Bumpers could \nhave scored a few more political victories if he had been more willing \nto compromise.\n  But I think that my friend from Arkansas is being a little hard on \nhimself in his self-assessment. I think that he is an excellent \nlegislator, and it was his candor and his devotion to his convictions \nthat made him effective. Obviously, compromise is often essential to \ngetting things done around here. But equally essential is having people \naround here who are passionate about issues and willing to fight for \ntheir beliefs in the face of opposition.\n  Dale Bumpers is not only thought of highly by his colleagues, but I \nthink that everyone in the entire Senate family thinks fondly of this \nman. And I know for a fact that many members of my staff share a deep \nadmiration for Senator Bumpers.\n  The past few weeks, there has actually been a ``Dale Bumpers watch'' \nin the L.A. room in my office, much like the Mark McGwire watch that \ncaptivated the country during the baseball season. Every time Senator \nBumpers has come to the floor, hands have pulled back from keyboards \nand the volumes on television sets have been turned up, as my staffers \nhave watched and wondered if this would be the last time that Dale \nBumpers will speak on the Senate floor. I only hope that they were \nwatching C-SPAN on the afternoon of Saturday, October 10.\n  Of course, Dale Bumpers will most likely be remembered for his \nunsurpassed oratory skills. One thing that made our friend from \nArkansas such an effective speaker was that his positions were always \nbased on common sense. Whether or not you agreed with Dale Bumpers, you \ncould always understand the logic behind his argument. But what set him \napart was his passion. Not many people can get excited over a 120 year-\nold mining law, but Dale Bumpers could speak on this issue and convince \nyou that this was the defining issue of the decade.\n  I only regret that he was never elected Majority Leader so that he \nmay one day come back to speak as a part of the Leaders' Speaker \nSeries. Maybe we can come up with a waiver provision to let certain \ncolleagues who were never Majority Leader speak--and call it the \n``Bumpers Rule.''\n  For Dale Bumpers the final judgement on the merit of his arguments \nwill not be rendered by the yeas and nays of his colleagues. It will \nrather be rendered by the illuminating perspective of time. And I have \nlittle doubt that time will rule in favor of the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Just the other day, Senator Bumpers was on the floor talking about a \nspeech he gave about the ozone layer in the mid 1970s. Most of his \nstatements were considered alarmist at the time, but more than a decade \nlater, an exhaustive study by the National Academy of Sciences \nconfirmed that everything he said has in fact been proven true. And I \nam confident that time will ultimately prove that Dale Bumpers was \nright far more often than he was wrong.\n  I also think that time will reveal that our friend from Arkansas was \none of the most capable, intelligent, and principled legislators that \nthis body has ever known. I can honestly say that it has been an honor \nto serve alongside Dale Bumpers for the past 18 years. I will truly \nmiss his friendship, and I wish him and his wife Betty only the best in \nall their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12849-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12850-S12851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               JOHN GLENN\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I've been fortunate to be a member of the \nUnited States Senate for nearly 18 years, and I have seen a lot of \nmembers come and go. But I must admit that I have never seen anyone \nmake a more dramatic exit than our colleague from Ohio. Then again, who \nin this Chamber would expect anything less?\n  John Glenn is a man who has served his nation as a Marine fighter \npilot in World War II and Korea, flying a total of 149 combat missions.\n  He has served as a test pilot in the first era of supersonic jets--an \noccupation where attending a colleague's funeral was as common as a new \nspeed record.\n  Then of course, John Glenn became a part of our national \nconsciousness when he was chosen to be one of the seven Mercury \nAstronauts. As much as any event since World War II, his historic \nflight aboard Friendship 7 on February 20, 1962 united this Nation and \nmade us believe that there are no limits on what we as humans and as \nAmericans can accomplish.\n  For the past 24 years, John Glenn has served the people of Ohio and \nthis country as a United States Senator. He has performed his duties \nwith an uncommon grace and dignity. He is a credit to this institution \nand I am proud to call him a friend.\n  And now, on October 29th, in perhaps his last act as a U.S. Senator, \nJohn Glenn will return to the heavens aboard the space shuttle \nDiscovery, becoming the oldest man to ever travel in outer space.\n  It is very common in this body to feel emotions of deep admiration \nand respect for one's colleagues, but John Glenn is the rare Senator \nwho inspires feelings of sheer awe.\n  I was trying to think of what would be an appropriate way to pay \ntribute to my friend from Ohio, and to put into perspective how \nremarkable and inspiring is his impending voyage aboard Discovery. And \nI was reminded of the famous farewell of another American hero to whom \nSenator Glenn is linked historically.\n  I'm sure all of my colleagues remember Ted Williams--and those of us \nfrom New England remember him quite fondly. The Boston Red Sox left-\nfielder is considered by many to be the greatest hitter who ever lived. \nThe last man to ever hit .400 and the winner of two Triple Crowns, Ted \nWilliams' ability to hit for both power and average has never been \nmatched.\n  One fact most people don't know about Ted Williams is that he served \nin the same squadron with John Glenn during the Korean War. Our friend \nfrom Ohio was the squadron commander, and the Mr. Williams was his \nwing-man. People talk about Ruth and Gehrig as the best one-two punch \nin history, but John Glenn and Ted Williams isn't half bad.\n  As the story is told, when Ted Williams went to Korea, he knew he \nwould be going into combat. Therefore, he was going to pick the best \nperson to fly alongside him. He had been told that John Glenn was one \nof the best test pilots in the world, so he sought out our colleague in \nthe reception center before shipping out. And while Ted Williams sought \nout John Glenn, in tapping Ted Williams to be his wing-man, John Glenn \nwas saying that Williams was the best and sharpest pilot he had in his \nsquadron.\n\n[[Page S12851]]\n\n  Ted Williams had many great moments on the baseball diamond, but no \nmoment more perfectly encapsulates his career than his last major \nleague at-bat on September 28, 1960. And as John Glenn prepares for his \nDiscovery mission, I cannot help but be reminded of that crisp autumn \nafternoon at Fenway Park.\n  The game was meaningless in the standings, with the Red Sox limping \nto the end of their worst season in 27 years. But the day was \nsignificant for it was the last time that Hub fans would ever get a \nglimpse of Number Nine's classic swing. After going 0 for 2 with two \nfly outs and a walk, Ted Williams came to the plate in the bottom of \nthe eighth inning for what was sure to be his last at-bat. Writer John \nUpdike was at the game, and his accounts of that day are considered \nscripture by baseball fans everywhere.\n  As Updike wrote: ``Understand that we were a crowd of rational \npeople. We knew that a home run cannot be produced at will; the right \npitch must be perfectly met and luck must ride with the ball. Three \ninnings before, we had seen a brave effort fail. The air was soggy, the \nseason was exhausted. Nevertheless, there will always lurk, around the \ncorner in a pocket of our knowledge of the odds, an indefensible hope, \nand this was one of the times, which you now and then find in sports, \nwhen a density of expectation hangs in the air and plucks an event out \nof the future.''\n  As many of my colleagues already know, Ted Williams did not \ndisappoint. In his final swing, he hit a one-one pitch that soared \nmajestically through the air before disappearing into the right-field \nbullpen.\n  As John Updike wrote, ``Ted Williams' last word had been so \nexquisitely chosen, such a perfect fusion of expectation, intention, \nand execution.'' Well, I feel that Senator John Glenn's final word has \nbeen just as exquisitely chosen.\n  Here is a man whose career of service to this country is \nunparalleled. Taken separately, his service as a Marine pilot, as an \nastronaut, and as a Senator are extraordinary. Put together, they are \nmythic.\n  Thirty-six years ago, John Glenn convinced a nation that there are no \nlimits to human potential. At the end of this month, he will once more \nextend the envelope of human accomplishment. John Glenn's mission on \nthe Discovery is his home run in his last at bat. I only wish that they \ncould find a seat on the Discovery for John Updike.\n  Ted Williams' last home run reminds me of John Glenn, not simply \nbecause it shows that both men know how to go out in style. It does so \nbecause the emotions that were stirred in this fabled at-bat are the \nvery same emotions that have made John Glenn an American hero.\n  It is that feeling of indefensible hope, our desire to believe in \nsomething that is bigger than ourselves. Simply put, it is our belief \nin heroes.\n  Life will always be full of disappointment and tribulations. But it \nhelps us to conquer the everyday battles in our own lives when we see \nsomeone whom we admire accomplish great things. And we cheer for those \npersons, because in them, we see the best in ourselves. By believing in \nthem, we believe in ourselves.\n  When you read John Updike's description of the mood in Fenway Park \nbefore that last at bat, it could just as easily be a description of \nthe mood in the Grandstands watching Senator Glenn's launch from Cape \nCanaveral later this month, or in every American living room when John \nGlenn boarded Friendship 7 thirty-six years ago.\n  Reason insists that we be practical. That we accept our limitations. \nYet we hold out hope that we can achieve things once unimaginable, that \nwe can do better. And John Glenn has shown us time and again, as an \nastronaut, as a test pilot, as a Marine, and as a Senator that we can \ndo better.\n  Surprisingly, the fact that John Glenn and Ted Williams served \ntogether in Korea remained largely a secret until 10 years ago, when \nSenator Glenn appeared at a reception to honor Ted Williams on his 70th \nbirthday. At the end of the evening, Ted Williams, a man not known for \nlavishing praise on others, spoke about his former commander. He said, \nand I quote: ``I was so happy and proud of the fact that I knew him. \nJohn Glenn is an extraordinarily talented, brave hero. He's a hell of a \nman. It's just too bad that he's a Democrat.''\n  When Ted Williams is singing your praises, you must be doing \nsomething right, and aside from his comments about Senator Glenn's \npolitics, I couldn't agree more with Mr. Williams' statement.\n  What we seem to forget about Senator Glenn's departure is that, while \nhe is going into space at the end of the month, he is also coming back. \nI understand that he plans to set up an institute at Ohio State to \nencourage young people to become involved in politics and public \nservice. In today's climate, it may be harder to turn young people on \nto politics than it was to put a man into orbit in 1962. But as a \npublic servant, I cannot imagine a better advocate for the profession \nof public service than John Glenn. He reminds all of us, young and old, \nthat there is honor in service to others and to your country.\n  While I am certain that he will keep busy, I hope that he and Annie \nwill have a chance to relax and enjoy his retirement. They have \ncertainly earned it.\n  So as I bid my friend farewell and good luck in his future years, and \nin particular his mission, I will repeat those words made famous by \nScott Carpenter 37 years ago: ``Godspeed, John Glenn.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12850-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ENCRYPTION CHALLENGE IN THE NEXT CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, we have made some important advances on \nthe encryption issue during this Congress. We held a hearing in the \nSenate Constitution Subcommittee, which pointed out the constitutional \nproblems with the Administration's proposed domestic encryption policy \nand put individual privacy rights back into the discussion. More \nrecently, as everyone is aware, the Administration has taken a few \nmodest steps toward liberalizing its export policy.\n  However, we have to be wary of piecemeal approaches to the problem. \nThe Administration's decision to relax its export policy helps out big \nbusinesses with subsidiaries in certain selected countries, but it \nleaves most ordinary consumers out in the cold.\n  In the Judiciary Committee, I resisted another piecemeal approach--\nmaking the use of encryption in furtherance of a felony a separate \ncrime, without addressing the broader encryption issue. As a former \nAttorney General of Missouri, I am keenly aware of the interests of law \nenforcement in not having encryption unduly hinder law enforcement. On \nthe other hand, in my work on the encryption issue, I have come to \nappreciate the concerns of privacy groups who are opposed to this \nproposal. I explored some ways of working this issue out with my \ncolleagues in this Congress, but we could not work out an acceptable \ncompromise. In the next Congress, I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues--on and off the Judiciary Committee--to fashion a \ncomprehensive resolution of the encryption issues that balances the \nneeds of law enforcement and law-abiding citizens.\n  In the next Congress, our goal must be to move beyond such piecemeal \napproaches to find a comprehensive solution to computer privacy issues. \nThis will not be easy.\n  Twice recently, President Clinton has told high-tech audiences that \n``we've reached broad agreement on encryption policy.'' Unfortunately, \nthat is just not true--at least not yet. The Administration's water \ntorture approach to encryption--liberalizing export policy drip by \ndrip--demonstrates that they do not understand two fundamental \nprinciples: (1) that robust and reliable encryption is available on the \nworld market, and (2) that ordinary Americans should have access to the \nbest available encryption to protect their privacy.\n  In short, it does us no good to talk about ``broad agreement'' that \ndoes not actually exist. Instead, we need to work hard to make such \nbroad agreement a reality. That is the task for the next Congress, and \nI look forward to working with my colleagues to get the job done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12851-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12851-S12852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SENATOR WENDELL FORD\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to bid a fond\n\n[[Page S12852]]\n\nfarewell to one of our most senior senators, Senator Wendell Ford, who, \ndespite my objections, is leaving the Senate this year. I think that \nall members will agree that his departure will be a loss for the Senate \nand nation, as we are losing one of our most respected and well-liked \nSenators.\n  Senator Ford and I began our careers in the United States Senate \ntogether--24 years ago. It seeks like just yesterday we were the new \nkids on the block, trying to get the hang of the Senate. A lot has \nchanged from those early days, as Senator Ford has proudly served the \npeople of Kentucky while serving on the Committees on Rules and \nAdministration (where he is ranking member), Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, Energy and Natural Resources, and the Joint Committee \non Printing (where he was formerly Chairman).\n  Hailing from Thurston, Kentucky, Senator Ford has brought to the \nSenate a long and distinguished career as well as the down-home common \nsense for which he is known. A graduate of the University of Kentucky, \nWendell went on to serve in the United States Army in 1944-1946 and in \nthe Kentucky Army National Guard for 13 years. Senator Ford has long \nbeen associated with public service, as he served as a Kentucky state \nsenator, lieutenant governor and as Kentucky's 49th Governor.\n  Senator Ford has come a long way from being a new kid on the U.S. \nSenate block in 1974 to becoming the longest serving Senator from \nKentucky today. And, I might add, he is now one of the most senior \nmembers of the entire Senate and one who follows the old traditions of \nthe Senate as one who always keeps his word.\n  Throughout his tenure in the U.S. Senate, Wendell has been recognized \nas a national leader in campaign-finance reform, energy issues, and, of \ncourse, looking out for our nation's tobacco farmers. That has never \nbeen as much as an issue as it has this past year, with Congress' \nattempts at passing tobacco legislation.\n  A friend to the environment, Senator Ford was the first to introduce \nand pass a program instructing the federal government to be a model for \nthe country and use recycled printed paper. This program is now the \nrule rather than the exception in the federal government, as well as \nschools and businesses throughout the United States.\n  It is with much regret that I say goodbye to Senator Ford. He has \nbeen a great friend all of these years in the Senate, and I will miss \nhim greatly. I hope that retirement brings him plenty of time to spend \nwith his wife, Jean, and their five grandchildren. Knowing Wendell, \nhowever, I have no doubt that retirement will be neither quiet nor slow \nhim down.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12851-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SENATOR DALE BUMPERS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know we are all going to greatly miss our \nfriend Senator Bumpers. He is certainly one of the finest orators this \nbody has enjoyed since Daniel Webster. But I want to take a moment to \npersonally thank Senator Bumpers.\n  Senator Bumpers and I came to the Senate as part of the class of \n1974. So I had very mixed feelings last year when I heard that my good \nfriend would be leaving this Chamber. He and I have shared many battles \nover the twenty-four years that we have spent in these halls and on \nthis floor. And, as my good friend pointed out just a few days ago, I \nam not even half as entertaining as him, so his shoes will be hard to \nfill.\n  However, as Senator Bumpers has often remarked, he has probably \nfought more losing battles in this Chamber than any other Member. He is \nleaving those battles for the rest of us to fight. He has laid down a \nmarker for where our country must go in the next century. His challenge \nto us who remain in this Chamber is to frame laws that show respect to \nour country's founders and to our country's future.\n  He has fought tirelessly to defend our Bill of Rights and only \nyesterday warned this Chamber against of the temptation of amending \nwhat he has often called ``our sacred document.'' Senator Bumpers has \nshown great courage over the years in his steadfast protection of our \nConstitution.\n  As he has pointed out many times, he has taken a lot of political \nheat for voting against popular issues like school prayer, flag burning \nand the balanced budget amendment. But even though he has voted against \nall of these things and voted for our Constitution, he is walking out \nof this Chamber by his own choice. His courage should guide us all in \nour choices between Popular issues of the day and protecting our \nConstitution.\n  His legacy will also be marked by an intense desire to pass on to his \ngrandchildren and to all of our grandchildren a world where you can \nstill find places of solitude and beauty, streams where you can still \ncatch trout and salmon and forests where you can still find trees older \nthan your grandparents.\n  That is why it is only fitting that in the last few days of this \nCongress we are able to honor Senator Bumpers by dedicating wilderness \nareas within the Ozark and Ouachita National Forests to his long, and \noften lonely, fight to protect our nation's most precious natural \nresources.\n  His marker also represents a world where children are free from \ndisease and free from debt. Dale and his wife Betty have not only made \na professional commitment to protecting the health of our children, but \nthey have made this a personal commitment.\n  Even if Dale was still a Main Street merchant or a jackleg merchant, \nas he described himself, Betty would still be dragging him into these \nfights to protect our children's health. Although I know that she has \nnever had to pull very hard, because his commitment comes from the \nheart.\n  Many of us will remember the Senator Bumpers not only for a keeper of \nour national treasures, but also as a chaser of boondoggles. Whether it \nbe reining in government subsidies for mining companies or chemical \ncompanies, he is never one to pull punches or mince words.\n  In fact, one of the only reasons I can come up with for Congress \nstill not passing mining reform is that we all so love to see Dale take \nover the aisles of this Chamber and entertain us with his now re-known \n``Bumperisms.'' Who else would think to compare the attraction between \nour mining companies and government subsidies to a ``duck on a June \nbug.''\n  Of course, Dale certainly would not be one to limit his battles to \nplanet Earth. He has also taken on the black holes we've tried build in \nouter space. I will not be surprised at all if we start receiving \nBumper-Grams from Arkansas each week telling us how many millions we \nhave spent in the last seven days on the International Space Station. \nAlthough this fight is not over, Senator Bumpers can leave here knowing \nhe helped stop the ill-conceived ``Star Wars'' to make our heavens a \nbattlefield.\n  Although we will certainly miss Senator Bumpers for all his one-\nliners, impassioned speeches, and frank critiques, we will also miss \nhis wonderful wife, Betty. As we leave here this week, I will look \nfondly on Senator Bumpers future--spending his days with Betty, his \nthree children, Brent, Bill, and Brooke and their five grandchildren.\n  Finally, Mr. President, let me help send our dear friend by quoting \nfrom another highly-esteemed Arkansan, Johnny Cash, ``ask that engineer \nif he will blow his whistle please, `Cause I smell frost on cotton \nleaves. . . . And I smell that Southern breeze. Hey, Porter! Hey, \nPorter! Please get my bags for me, I need nobody to tell me now that \nwe're in Tennessee. . . . Hey Porter! Hey Porter! Please open up my \ndoor. When they stop this train I'm gonna get off first `Cause I can't \nwait no more. Tell that engineer I say, ``Thanks a lot. I didn't mind \nthe fare. I'm gonna set my feet on Southern soil. . . . And breathe \nthat Southern air.''\n  We all hope that Southern air treats you and Betty well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12852-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12852-S12859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PASSAGE OF CERTAIN ANTI-CRIME LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as this Congress draws to a close, much has \nbeen and will be said about what has and has not been accomplished. \nThere is no getting away from the fact that Congress has dropped the \nball on too many issues of vital importance to the American people. I \nneed only mention campaign finance reform, a patients' bill of rights, \nand the failure to pass tough legislation on youth smoking. I have \nspoken often about the failure of\n\n[[Page S12853]]\n\nthis Congress to live up to its constitutional advice and consent \nresponsibilities with respect to nominations. In addition, this is the \nfirst year since enactment of the Congressional Budget Act that \nCongress has failed to pass a budget. There is much about the record of \nthe 105th Congress with which I have been disappointed and with which \nthe American people should find fault.\n  In the area of criminal justice, I particularly regret Congress' \nfailure to pass balanced juvenile crime legislation, the Democratic \ncrime bills, S. 15 and S. 2484, or comprehensive legislation on behalf \nof crime victims. At the same time, I would like to highlight those \nimportant measures that we have been able to pass.\n\n\n   The Bulletproof Vests Partnership Grant Act, The Care for Police \n Survivors Act and The Public Safety Officer Educational Assistance Act\n\n  These three bills, which I cosponsored, became law this year. \nTogether these measures make a significant package of legislation to \nbenefit the families of those who serve in law enforcement. This past \nMay, I had the privilege of speaking during National Police Week and \nthe annual memorial activities for law enforcement officers and called \nfor Congress to pass this legislation.\n  We were able to complete action earlier this year on the Bulletproof \nVest Partnership Grant Act, which I introduced with Senator Hatch and \nSenator Campbell last January. Our bipartisan legislation is intended \nto save the lives of law enforcement officers across the country by \nhelping State and local law enforcement agencies provide their officers \nwith body armor.\n  Congress should do all that it can to protect our law enforcement \nofficers. Far too many police officers are needlessly killed each year \nwhile serving to protect our citizens. According to the Federal Bureau \nof Investigation, more than 40 percent of the 1,182 officers killed by \na firearm in the line of duty since 1980 could have been saved if they \nhad been wearing body armor. Indeed, the FBI estimates that the risk of \nfatality to officers while not wearing body armor is 14 times higher \nthan for officers wearing it.\n  Unfortunately, far too many state and local law enforcement agencies \ncannot afford to provide every officer in their jurisdictions with the \nprotection of body armor. In fact, the Department of Justice estimates \nthat approximately 150,000 State and local law enforcement officers, \nnearly 25 percent, are not issued body armor.\n  A recent incident along the Vermont and New Hampshire border \nunderscores the need for the quick passage of this legislation to \nprovide maximum protection to those who protect us. On August 19, 1997, \nFederal, State and local law enforcement authorities in Vermont and New \nHampshire had cornered Carl Drega, after hours of hot pursuit. This \nmadman had just shot to death two New Hampshire state troopers and two \nother victims earlier in the day. In a massive exchange of gunfire with \nthe authorities, Drega lost his life.\n  During that shootout, all Federal law enforcement officers wore \nbulletproof vests, while some state and local officers did not. For \nexample, Federal Border Patrol Officer John Pfeifer, a Vermonter, was \nseriously wounded in the incident. If it was not for his bulletproof \nvest, I would have been attending Officer Pfeifer's wake instead of \nvisiting him, and meeting his wife and young daughter in the hospital a \nfew days later.\n  The two New Hampshire state troopers who were killed by Carl Drega \nwere not so lucky. They were not wearing bulletproof vests. Protective \nvests might not have been able to save the lives of those courageous \nofficers because of the high-powered assault weapons used by this \nmadman. But the tragedy underscores the point that all of our law \nenforcement officers, whether Federal, state or local, deserve the \nprotection of a bulletproof vest.\n  I am relieved that Officer John Pfeifer is doing well and is back on \nduty. We all grieve for the two New Hampshire officers who were killed. \nWith that and lesser-known incidents as constant reminders, I will \ncontinue to do all I can to help prevent loss of life among our law \nenforcement officers.\n  The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act creates a new partnership \nbetween the Federal Government and State and local law enforcement \nagencies to help save the lives of police officers by providing the \nresources for each and every law enforcement officer to have a \nbulletproof vest. Our bipartisan law created a $25 million matching \ngrant program within the Department of Justice dedicated to helping \nState and local law enforcement agencies purchase body armor. I am \nproud to have been able to work with the Appropriations Committees to \nfund these grants this coming year.\n  I was also glad that Congress passed the Care for Police Survivors \nAct, a measure I cosponsored with Senators Hatch. This bill authorizes \nadditional counseling services under the Public Safety Officers \nBenefits program for families of law enforcement officers harmed in the \nline of duty.\n  I am proud to have cosponsored the Federal Law Enforcement Dependents \nAssistance Act of 1996 and the extension of those educational benefits \nto the families of State and local public safety officials who die or \nare disabled in the line of duty with passage of the Public Safety \nOfficers Educational Benefits Assistance Act this year. I would have \npreferred to send the President the original text of our legislation \nsince it provided full assistance to these families, but the House of \nRepresentatives decided to impose a sliding scale means test to our \nbill. I am glad that we were finally able to pass some educational \nbenefits this year.\n\n\n             Crime Victims with Disabilities Awareness Act\n\n  I was delighted to join with Senator DeWine during National Crime \nVictims Rights Week in April to introduce S. 1976, The Crime Victims \nwith Disabilities Awareness Act. I welcomed the positive response and \nbroad support that our bill received, including the active support of \nmore than 50 groups, including the National Association of \nDevelopmental Disabilities Councils, the National Alliance for the \nMentally Ill, the National Association of State Directors of Special \nEducation, the National Center for Hearing Disabilities, the American \nAssociation on Health and Disability, and many others.\n  This Act, which was finally approved by the House in September, \ndirects the Department of Justice to conduct research that will \nincrease public awareness of the victimization of individuals with \ndevelopmental disabilities and understanding of the nature and extent \nof such crimes. In addition, the Department must examine the means by \nwhich States may establish and maintain a database on the incidence of \ncrime against individuals with disabilities.\n\n  The need for this research is abundantly clear. Studies conducted \nabroad have found that individuals with disabilities are four to 10 \ntimes more likely to be a victim than individuals without disabilities. \nOne Canadian study found that 67 percent of women with disabilities \nwere physically or sexually assaulted as children.\n  My own involvement with crime victims rights began more than three \ndecades ago when I served as State's Attorney for Chittenden County, \nVermont, and witnessed first-hand the devastation of crime. I have \nworked ever since to ensure that the criminal justice system is one \nthat respects the rights and dignity of victims of crime and domestic \nviolence, rather than presents additional ordeals for those already \nvictimized. This bill deals with a group of victims that we should not \nignore.\n  Over the last 20 years we have made strides in recognizing crime \nvictims' rights and providing much needed assistance. I am proud to \nhave played a role in passage of the Victims and Witness Protection Act \nof 1982, the Victims of Crime Act of 1984, and the Victims' Rights and \nRestitution Act of 1990, the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994, the \nVictims of Terrorism Act of 1996, and the Victim Rights Clarification \nAct of 1997. This bill is another step to assure recognition of the \nrights of, and assistance for, victims of crime.\n  We could have done more. I regret that we were unable to achieve \npassage of the Crime Victims Assistance Act, S.1081, which I introduced \nlast July with Senator Kennedy. This bill would provide crime victims \nwith a comprehensive Bill of Rights: an enhanced right to be heard on \nthe issue of pretrial detention and plea bargains, an enhanced right to \na speedy trial and to\n\n[[Page S12854]]\n\nbe present in the courtroom throughout a trial, an enhanced right to be \nheard on probation revocation and to give a statement at sentencing, \nand the right to be notified of a defendant's escape or release from \nprison. The Crime Victims Assistance Act would also strengthen victims' \nservices by increasing Federal victim assistance personnel, enhancing \ntraining for State and local law enforcement and Officers of the Court, \nand establishing an ombudsman program for crime victims.\n\n\n           Identification Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act\n\n  I am pleased that we passed the Identity Theft and Assumption \nDeterrence Act, in the form I developed with Senator Kyl as the Kyl-\nLeahy substitute to S.512. This bill penalizes the theft of personal \nidentification information that results in harm to the person whose \nidentification is stolen and then used for false credit cards, \nfraudulent loans or for other illegal purposes. It also sets up a \n``clearinghouse'' at the Federal Trade Commission to keep track of \nconsumer complaints of identity theft and provide information to \nvictims of this crime on how to deal with its aftermath.\n  Protecting the privacy of our personal information is a challenge, \nespecially in this information age. Every time we obtain or use a \ncredit card, place a toll-free phone call, surf the Internet, get a \ndriver's license or are featured in Who's Who, we are leaving virtual \npieces of ourselves in the form of personal information, which can be \nused without our consent or even our knowledge. Too frequently, \ncriminals are getting hold of this information and using the personal \ninformation of innocent individuals to carry out other crimes. Indeed, \nU.S. News & World Report has called identity theft ``a crime of the \n90's''.\n  The consequences for the victims of identity theft can be severe. \nThey can have their credit ratings ruined and be unable to get credit \ncards, student loans, or mortgages. They can be hounded by creditors or \ncollection agencies to repay debts they never incurred, but were \nobtained in their name, at their address, with their social security \nnumber or driver's license number. It can take months or even years, \nand agonizing effort, to clear their good names and correct their \ncredit histories. I understand that, in some instances, victims of \nidentity theft have even been arrested for crimes they never committed \nwhen the actual perpetrators provided law enforcement officials with \nassumed names.\n  Just last week, a woman accused of stealing the identity of a \nBurlington, Vermont woman was arrested in another Vermont town. \nApparently, she used her victim's birth certificate and marriage \nlicense to access money in her victim's bank accounts. Now, her victim \nis left trying to clear their credit records.\n  Our legislation provides important remedies for such victims of \nidentity theft. Specifically, it makes clear that these victims are \nentitled to restitution, including payment for any costs and attorney's \nfees in clearing up their credit histories and having to engage in any \ncivil or administrative proceedings to satisfy debts, liens or other \nobligations resulting from a defendant's theft of their identity. In \naddition, the bill directs the Federal Trade Commission to keep track \nof consumer complaints of identity theft and provide information to \nvictims of this crime on how to deal with its aftermath.\n  This is an important bill on an issue that has caused harm to many \nAmericans. I am glad that Senator Kyl and I were able to join forces to \ncraft legislation that both punishes the perpetrators of identity theft \nand helps the victims of this crime.\n  Finally, an amendment added in the House, at the joint request of \nSenator Hatch and myself, gives the United States Judicial Conference \nlimited authority to withhold personal and sensitive information about \njudicial officers and employees whose lives have been threatened. \nApparently, sophisticated criminals are able to use information set \nforth in publicly available financial disclosure forms to collect more \ndetailed personal information then used in carrying out threats against \nour judicial officers. This amendment is an important step to protect \nthe lives of judges, and I am glad that we were able to accomplish \nthis.\n\n\n          The Protection of Children from Sexual Predators Act\n\n  We were also able to pass a bill, H.R. 3494, to help protect children \nfrom sexual predators. Senator Hatch, Senator DeWine and I joined \ntogether to bring forward a bill that was both strong and sensible. The \ngoal of H.R. 3494, and of the Hatch-Leahy-DeWine substitute, which \npassed both houses of Congress, is to provide stronger protections for \nchildren from those who would prey upon them. Concerns over protecting \nour children have only intensified in recent years with the growing \npopularity of the Internet and the World Wide Web. Cyberspace gives \nusers access to a wealth of information; it connects people from around \nthe world. But it also creates new opportunities for sexual predators \nand child pornographers to ply their trade.\n  The challenge is to protect children from exploitation in cyberspace \nwhile ensuring that the vast democratic forum of the Internet remains \nan engine for the free exchange of ideas and information. The Hatch-\nLeahy-DeWine version of the bill meets this challenge. While no bill \nis a cure-all for the scourge of child pornography, our substitute is a \nuseful step toward limiting the ability of cyber-pornographers and \npredators from harming children.\n\n\n                The Crime Identification Technology Act\n\n  Senator DeWine and I again joined forces to introduce the ``Crime \nIdentification Technology Act,'' which was signed by the President on \nOctober 9, 1998. Our legislation authorizes comprehensive Department of \nJustice grants to every State for criminal justice identification, \ninformation and communications technologies and systems.\n  I know from my experience in law enforcement in Vermont over the last \n30 years that access to quality, accurate information in a timely \nfashion is of vital importance. As we prepare to enter the 21st \nCentury, we must provide our State and local law enforcement officers \nwith the resources to develop the latest technological tools and \ncommunications systems to solve and prevent crime. I believe this bill \naccomplishes that goal.\n  The Crime Identification Technology Act authorizes $250 million for \neach of the next five years in grants to States for crime information \nand identification systems. The Attorney General is directed to make \ngrants to each State to be used in conjunction with units of local \ngovernment, and other States, to use information and identification \ntechnologies and systems to upgrade criminal history and criminal \njustice record systems.\n  Grants made under our legislation may include programs to establish, \ndevelop, update or upgrade--\n  State, centralized, automated criminal history record information \nsystems, including arrest and disposition reporting;\n  Automated fingerprint identification systems that are compatible with \nthe Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) of \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation;\n  Finger imaging, live scan and other automated systems to digitize \nfingerprints and to communicate prints in a manner that is compatible \nwith systems operated by states and the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation;\n  Systems to facilitate full participation in the Interstate \nIdentification Index (III);\n  Programs and systems to facilitate full participation in the \nInterstate Identification Index National Crime Prevention and Privacy \nCompact;\n  Systems to facilitate full participation in the National Instant \nCriminal Background Check System (NICS) for firearms eligibility \ndeterminations;\n  Integrated criminal justice information systems to manage and \ncommunicate criminal justice information among law enforcement, courts, \nprosecution, and corrections;\n  Non-criminal history record information systems relevant to firearms \neligibility determinations for availability and accessibility to the \nNICS;\n  Court-based criminal justice information systems to promote reporting \nof dispositions to central state repositories and to the FBI and to \npromote the compatibility with, and integration of, court systems with \nother criminal justice information systems;\n  Ballistics identification programs that are compatible and integrated \nwith the ballistics programs of the National Integrated Ballistics \nNetwork (NIBN);\n\n[[Page S12855]]\n\n  Information, identification and communications programs for forensic \npurposes;\n  DNA programs for forensic and identification purposes;\n  Sexual offender identification and registration systems;\n  Domestic violence offender identification and information systems;\n  Programs for fingerprint-supported background checks for non-criminal \njustice purposes including youth service employees and volunteers and \nother individuals in positions of trust, if authorized by Federal or \nState law and administered by a government agency;\n  Criminal justice information systems with a capacity to provide \nstatistical and research products including incident-based reporting \nsystems and uniform crime reports;\n  Online and other state-of-the-art communications technologies and \nprograms; and\n  Multi-agency, multi-jurisdictional communications systems to share \nroutine and emergency information among Federal, State and local law \nenforcement agencies.\n  The future effectiveness of law enforcement depends on all levels of \nlaw enforcement agencies working together and harnessing the power of \ntoday's information age to prevent crime and catch criminals. One way \nto work together is for State and local law enforcement agencies to \nband together to create efficiencies of scale. For example, together \nwith New Hampshire and Maine, the State of Vermont has pooled its \nresources to build a tri-state IAFIS system to identify fingerprints. \nOur bipartisan legislation would foster these partnerships by allowing \ngroups of States to apply together for grants.\n  Another challenge for law enforcement agencies across the country is \ncommunication difficulties between Federal, State and local law \nenforcement officials. In a recent report, the Department of Justice's \nNational Institute of Justice concluded that law enforcement agencies \nthroughout the nation lack adequate communications systems to respond \nto crimes that cross State and local jurisdictions.\n  A 1997 incident along the Vermont and New Hampshire border \nunderscored this problem. During a cross border shooting spree that \nleft four people dead including two New Hampshire State troopers, \nVermont and New Hampshire officers were forced to park two police \ncruisers next to one another to coordinate activities between Federal, \nState and local law enforcement officers because the two States' police \nradios could not communicate with one another.\n  The Vermont Department of Public Safety, the Vermont U.S. Attorney's \nOffice and others have reacted to these communication problems by \ndeveloping the Northern Lights proposal. This project will allow the \nnorthern borders States of Vermont, New York, New Hampshire and Maine \nto integrate their law enforcement communications systems to better \ncoordinate interdiction efforts and share intelligence data seamlessly. \nOur legislation would provide grants for the development of integrated \nFederal, State and local law enforcement communications systems to \nfoster cutting edge efforts like the Northern Lights project.\n  In addition, our bipartisan legislation will help each of our States \nmeet its obligations under national anti-crime initiatives. For \ninstance, the FBI will soon bring online NCIC 2000 and IAFIS which will \nrequire states to update their criminal justice systems for the country \nto benefit. States are also being asked to participate in several other \nnational programs such as sexual offender registries, national domestic \nviolence legislation, Brady Act, and National Child Protection Act. \nCurrently, there are no comprehensive programs to support these \nnational crime-fighting systems. Our legislation will fill this void by \nhelping each State meet its obligations under these Federal laws.\n  The Crime Identification Technology Act provides a helping hand \nwithout the heavy hand of a top-down, Washington-knows-best approach. \nUnfortunately, some in Congress have pushed legislation mandating \nminute detail changes that States must make in their laws to qualify \nfor Federal funds. Our bill rejects this approach. Instead, we provide \nthe States with Federal support to improve their criminal justice \nidentification, information and communication systems without \nprescribing new Federal mandates.\n\n\n             Interstate Identification Index (III) Compact\n\n  I am also pleased that Congress finally passed the ``National Crime \nPrevention and Privacy Compact,'' or Federal-State Interstate \nIdentification Index ``III'') Compact, for exchange of criminal history \nrecords for noncriminal justice purposes. This Compact is the product \nof a decade-long effort by Federal and State law enforcement officials \nto establish a legal framework for the exchange of criminal history \nrecords for authorized noncriminal justice purposes, such as security \nclearances, employment or licensing background checks.\n  Since 1924, the FBI has collected and maintained duplicate State and \nlocal fingerprint cards, along with arrest and disposition records. \nToday, the FBI has more than 200 million fingerprint cards in its \nsystem. These FBI records are accessible to authorized government \nentities for both criminal and authorized noncriminal justice purposes.\n  Maintaining duplicate files at the FBI is costly and leads to \ninaccuracies in the criminal history records, since follow-up \ndisposition information from the States is often incomplete. Such a \nhuge central database of routinely incomplete criminal history records \nraises significant privacy concerns. In addition, the FBI releases \nthese records for noncriminal justice purposes (as authorized by \nFederal law), to State agencies upon request, even if the State from \nwhich the records originated or the receiving State more narrowly \nrestricts the dissemination of such records for noncriminal justice \npurposes.\n  The Compact is an effort to get the FBI out of the business of \nholding a duplicate copy of every State and local criminal history \nrecord, and instead to keep those records at the State level. Once \nfully implemented, the FBI will only need to hold the Interstate \nIdentification Index (III), consisting of the national fingerprint file \nand a pointer index to direct the requestor to the correct State \nrecords repository. The Compact would eliminate the necessity for \nduplicate records at the FBI for those States participating in the \nCompact.\n  Eventually, when all the States become full participants in the \nCompact, the FBI's centralized files of state offender records will be \ndiscontinued and users of such records will obtain those records from \nthe appropriate State's central repository (or from the FBI if the \noffender has a Federal record). The Compact would establish both a \nframework for this cooperative exchange of criminal history records for \nnoncriminal justice purposes, and create a Compact Council with \nrepresentatives from the FBI and the States to monitor system \noperations and issue necessary rules and procedures for the integrity \nand accuracy of the records and compliance with privacy standards. \nImportantly, this Compact would not in any way expand or diminish \nnoncriminal justice purposes for which criminal history records may be \nused under existing State or Federal law.\n  Overall, I believe that the Compact should increase the accuracy, \ncompleteness and privacy protection for criminal history records. In \naddition, the Compact would result in important cost savings from \nestablishing a decentralized system. Under the system envisioned by the \nCompact, the FBI would hold only an ``index and pointer'' to the \nrecords maintained at the originating State. The FBI would no longer \nhave to maintain duplicate State records. Moreover, States would no \nlonger have the burden and costs of submitting arrest fingerprints and \ncharge/disposition data to the FBI for all arrests. Instead, the State \nwould only have to submit to the FBI the fingerprints and textual \nidentification data for a person's first arrest.\n\n  With this system, criminal history records would be more up-to-date, \nor complete, because a decentralized system will keep the records \ncloser to their point of origin in State repositories, eliminating the \nneed for the States to keep sending updated disposition information to \nthe FBI. To ensure further accuracy, the Compact would require requests \nfor criminal history checks for noncriminal justice purposes to be \nsubmitted with fingerprints or some other form of positive \nidentification, to avoid mistaken release of records.\n\n[[Page S12856]]\n\n  Furthermore, under the Compact, the newly-created Council must \nestablish procedures to require that the most current records are \nrequested and that when a new need arises, a new record check is \nconducted.\n  Significantly, the newly-created Council must establish privacy \nenhancing procedures to ensure that requested criminal history records \nare only used by authorized officials for authorized purposes. \nFurthermore, the Compact makes clear that only the FBI and authorized \nrepresentatives from the State repository may have direct access to the \nFBI index.\n  The Council must also ensure that only legally appropriate \ninformation is released and, specifically, that record entries that may \nnot be used for noncriminal justice purposes are deleted from the \nresponse.\n  Thus, while the Compact would require the release of arrest records \nto a requesting State, the Compact would also ensure that if \ndisposition records are available that the complete record be released. \nAlso, the Compact would require States receiving records under the \nCompact to ensure that the records are disseminated in compliance with \nthe authorized uses in that State. Consequently, under the Compact, a \nState that receives arrest-only information would have to give effect \nto disposition-only policies in that State and not release that \ninformation for noncriminal justice purposes. Thus, in my view, the \nimpact of the Compact for the privacy and accuracy of the records would \nbe positive.\n  I am pleased to have joined with Senators Hatch and DeWine to make a \nnumber of refinements to the Compact as transmitted by to us by the \nAdministration. Specifically, we have worked to clarify that (1) the \nwork of the Council includes establishing standards to protect the \nprivacy of the records; (2) sealed criminal history records are not \ncovered or subject to release for noncriminal justice purposes under \nthe Compact; (3) the meetings of the Council are open to the public, \nand (4) the Council's decisions, rules and procedures are available for \npublic inspection and copying and published in the Federal Register.\n  Commissioner Walton of the Vermont Department of Public Safety \nsupports this Compact. He hopes that passage of the Compact will \nencourage Vermont to become a full participant in III for both criminal \nand noncriminal justice purposes, so that Vermont can ``reap the \nbenefits of cost savings and improved data quality.'' The Compact is \nalso strongly supported by the FBI and SEARCH.\n  We all have an interest in making sure that the criminal history \nrecords maintained by our law enforcement agencies at the local, State \nand Federal levels, are complete, accurate and accessible only to \nauthorized personnel for legally authorized purposes. This Compact is a \nsignificant step in the process of achieving that goal.\n  I know that the Justice Department, under Attorney General Reno's \nleadership, has made it a priority to modernize and automate criminal \nhistory records. Our legislation will continue that leadership by \nproviding each State with the necessary resources to continue to make \nimportant efforts to bring their criminal justice systems up to date.\n\n\n                        school resource officers\n\n  Congress also recently passed a provision originally introduced by \nRepresentative Mahoney of Connecticut and which we later included in S. \n2484, the Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act of 1998, a \ncomprehensive anti-crime bill cosponsored by Senators Daschle, Biden, \nMoseley-Braun, Kennedy, Kerry, Lautenberg, Mikulski, Reid, Bingaman, \nDorgan, Murray, Dodd and Torricelli. This bill authorizes use of COPS \nfunds for school-based partnerships between local schools and local law \nenforcement, and for School Resource Officers.\n  These are career police officers with full police authority who are \ndeployed in and around elementary schools, middle schools and high \nschools to identify and combat school-related crime and disorder \nproblems. The police and the schools work together. They combat gangs \nand drugs, and perhaps more important, they are there to know and be \nknown by the kids. With their training, the police officers can often \nspot the initial warning signs so that problems can be stopped before \nthey even start. They can give real-life lessons to likely victims and \nto kids who are starting down the wrong path. And they can help in \ndeveloping community justice initiatives and in training students in \nconflict resolution and other means of preventing crime.\n  When local communities come up with ideas that work, we in the \nCongress should assist the rest of the country in putting their own \nprograms in place. The more that we can do to head off crime at an \nearly stage, the more money we will save, and the safer we will make \nour communities. This is a small but a significant step.\n  It was not long ago that Republicans fought hard to prevent the COPS \nprogram from being adopted and when they tried to keep the President \nfrom putting 100,000 additional police officers on the street. It is a \nreal pleasure to see them come around and join with us in expanding \nwhat has proved to be a good program that really works.\n\n\n           International Crime and Anti-Terrorism Amendments\n\n  I am pleased that the Senate passed our Improvements to International \nCrime and Anti-Terrorism Amendments of 1998, and I am hopeful the House \nwill do the same today so that this bill can be signed into law this \nyear. This bill reflects the top international law enforcement \npriorities of the Departments of Justice, Treasury and State.\n  Crime and terrorism directed at Americans and American interests \nabroad are part of our modern reality. The bombings of U.S. embassies \nin Kenya and Tanzania are just the most recent reminders of how \nvulnerable American citizens and interests are to terrorist attacks.\n  Not all of these attacks are with bombs. As a result of improvements \nin technology, criminals now can transfer funds with a push of a \nbutton, or use computers and credit card numbers to steal from American \ncitizens and businesses from any spot on the globe. They can strike at \nAmericans here and abroad. The playing field keeps changing, and we \nneed to change with it. This bill does exactly that by giving our law \nenforcement agencies new tools to fight international crime and \nterrorism.\n  I initially introduced certain provisions of this bill on April 30, \n1998, in the ``Money Laundering Enforcement and Combating Drugs in \nPrisons Act of 1998,'' S. 2011, with Senators Daschle, Kohl, Feinstein \nand Cleland. Again, on July 14, 1998, I introduced with Senator Biden, \non behalf of the Administration, the ``International Crime Control Act \nof 1998,'' S. 2303, which contains many of the provisions set forth in \nthis bill. Virtually all of the provisions in the bill were included in \nanother major Democratic anti-crime bill, the ``Safe Schools, Safe \nStreets, and Secure Borders Act,'' that I introduced last month.\n\n  The International Crime and Anti-Terrorism Amendments bill provides \ndiscretionary authority for investigations and prosecutions of \norganized crime groups that kill or threaten violence against Americans \nabroad, when in the view of the Attorney General, the organized crime \ngroup was trying to further its objectives. This should not be viewed \nas an invitation for American law enforcement officers to start \ninvestigating organized crime around the world, but when such groups \nare targeting Americans abroad for physical violence and the Attorney \nGeneral believes it is necessary, we must act.\n  The bill also expands current law to criminalize murder and other \nserious crimes committed against state and local officials who are \nworking abroad with Federal authorities on joint projects or \noperations. The penalties for murder against such state or local \nofficials, who are acting abroad under the auspices of the Federal \nGovernment, are the same as for Federal officers, under section 1119 of \ntitle 18, United States Code, and would therefore authorize imposition \nof the death penalty. While I oppose the death penalty, I also oppose \narbitrary distinctions in its operation, and there is no principled \nbasis to distinguish between penalties for murder of Federal versus \nnon-Federal officials, who are both acting under the auspices of the \nFederal Government.\n  These provisions are crafted to avoid an unwarranted intrusion into \nforeign affairs. The authority of the Attorney\n\n[[Page S12857]]\n\nGeneral to bring these prosecutions is limited so as not to interfere \nwith the criminal jurisdiction of the foreign nation where the murder \noccurred. Thus, this authority will be exercised only in the rare \ncircumstance in which the Attorney General believes the foreign country \nis not adequately addressing the crime, and where we must take action.\n  The bill contains provisions to protect our maritime borders by \nproviding realistic sanctions for vessels that fail to ``heave to'' or \notherwise obstruct the Coast Guard. No longer will drug-runners be able \nto stall or resist Coast Guard commands with impunity. The provision \nincludes additional sanctions for resisting ``heave to'' orders and for \nlying to law enforcement officers about a boat's destination, origin \nand other pertinent matters. The Coast Guard tells me this provision \nwill be a tremendous help in protecting our shores from illegal drugs \nand other contraband.\n  The bill also makes sure that drug kingpins and terrorists criminals \nwill not be able to come and go as they please and use the United \nStates as a marketplace or recruiting ground. It provides specific \nauthority to exclude from entry into our country international \ncriminals and terrorists, including those engaged in flight to avoid \nforeign prosecution, alien smuggling, or arms or drug trafficking under \nspecific circumstances. While it would block such criminals, the bill \nis carefully crafted to ensure that the Attorney General has full \nauthority to make exceptions for humanitarian and similar reasons.\n  The bill has two important provisions aimed at computer crimes: it \nprovides expanded wiretap authority, subject to court order, to cover \ncomputer crimes, and also gives us extraterritorial jurisdiction over \naccess device fraud, such as stealing telephone credit card numbers, \nwhere the victim of the fraud is within our borders.\n  We cannot stop international crime without international cooperation, \nhowever. This bill facilitates such cooperation by allowing our country \nto share the proceeds of joint forfeiture operations, to encourage \nparticipation by foreign countries. It streamlines procedures for \nexecuting MLAT requests that apply to multiple judicial districts. \nFurthermore, the bill addresses the essential but often overlooked role \nof state and local law enforcement in combating international crime, \nand authorizes reimbursement of state and local authorities for their \ncooperation in international crime cases. The bill helps our \nprosecutors in international crime cases by facilitating the admission \nof foreign records in U.S. courts. Finally, it will speed the wheels of \njustice by prohibiting international criminals from being credited with \nany time they serve abroad while they fight extradition to face charges \nin our country.\n  These are important provisions that I have advocated for some time. \nThey are helpful, solid law enforcement provisions. Working together \nwith Senator Hatch, we were able to craft a bipartisan bill that will \naccomplish what all of us want, to make America a safer and more secure \nplace.\n\n\n Authorization of the Department of Justice and Implementation of the \n           Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act\n\n  I was pleased to work with Senator Hatch on the Hatch-Leahy \nsubstitute amendment to H.R. 3303, the Department of Justice \nAppropriation Authorization Act for fiscal years 1999, 2000, and 2001, \nthat the Senate Judiciary Committee reported favorably and that I had \nhoped would be enacted before the end of this Congress.\n  The last time Congress properly authorized spending for the entire \nDepartment of Justice was in 1979. This 19-year failure to properly \nreauthorize the Department has forced the appropriations committees in \nboth houses to do both jobs of reauthorizing and appropriating money \nfor the Department. This bill reaffirms the authorizing jurisdiction \nand responsibility of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees. I \ncommend Senator Hatch and Congressman Hyde for working in a bipartisan \nmanner to bring the important business of re-authorizing the Department \nback before the Judiciary Committees. Regular reauthorization of the \nDepartment should be part and parcel of the Committees' traditional \nrole in overseeing the Department's activities.\n  One of the provisions that the Hatch-Leahy substitute removed from \nthe House-passed version of the bill relates to the compliance date and \nso-called ``grandfather date'' in the Communications Assistance For Law \nEnforcement Act (CALEA), commonly called the ``digital telephony law.'' \nAs part of H.R. 3303, the House extended the compliance date for two \nyears and the ``grandfather date'' for almost six years, until October \n2000.\n  I have long resisted the efforts and urging of many to tamper with \nthe provisions of CALEA. This law was carefully crafted, after months \nof negotiation, to balance privacy rights and interests, law \nenforcement needs, and the desire of business and consumers for \ninnovation in the telecommunications industry. I have so far resisted \nlegislative modifications not because implementation of this law has \nbeen problem-free. Far from it. Implementation of this important law \nhas certainly been slower than any of us anticipated. For example, the \nDepartment of Justice issued its final notice of capacity in March \n1998, over two years late. Capacity requirements are integrally \ninvolved with setting appropriate capability standards and building \nCALEA-compliant equipment. Thus, the delay in release of the final \ncapacity notice has also delayed the ability of telecommunications \ncarriers to achieve compliance with the capability assistance \nrequirements.\n  In addition to significant delays, implementation of CALEA has been \nfraught with controversy and debate. Currently pending before the FCC, \nfor example, are proceedings to determine the sufficiency of an interim \nstandard adopted in December 1997 by industry for wireline, cellular \nand broadband PCS carriers to comply with the four general capability \nassistance requirements of the law. This interim standard was developed \nin accordance with CALEA's direction that the telecommunications \nindustry take the lead on figuring out technical solutions for \nimplementing the law. Such industry standards provide ``safe harbors'' \nunder the law.\n  While the FBI criticizes the interim standard for failing to include \ncertain surveillance functions (referred to as the ``punch list'' \nitems), civil liberties groups criticize the interim standard for \nfailing to protect privacy by including surveillance functions for \nlocation information and packet-mode call content information. We \nrecognized in CALEA that these are complicated issues, which require \nintensive time and technical expertise to resolve. The law consequently \nauthorizes the FCC to review alleged deficiencies in, or establish \nunder certain circumstances, technical requirements or standards for \ncompliance with the CALEA capability assistance requirements.\n  Uncertainty over the outcome of the disputed interim standard has \nresulted in further delays in developing technical solutions. Indeed, \nbecause of the delays in implementation of CALEA, neither the House or \nthe Senate provided any new direct appropriations into the \nTelecommunications Carrier Compliance Fund. The Explanation of Managers \nfor the Omnibus Appropriations bill makes clear that should funding be \nnecessary in the upcoming fiscal year, the Attorney General is expected \nto spend the unobligated funds currently available in the fund.\n  Even if the FCC were to issue its decision and settle the disputes \ntoday, compliance with the interim standard would not be achievable for \nsome time because of the development cycle for standardized products \nand services after promulgation of standards. Therefore, the conferees \nfor the Omnibus Appropriations bill urged the FCC ``to act quickly to \nresolve this issue.'' I join in this direction and also urge the FCC to \nresolve the pending petitions regarding the interim standard promptly.\n  Should the FCC determine that the FBI is correct and that all, or \nsubstantially all, the punch list items are required to be incorporated \ninto the compliance standard, the FBI may have won a battle but in the \nlong run--given the potential costs associated with the punch list \nitems--lost the proverbial war. Carriers would bear the costs of \ncomplying with those punch list items for equipment, facilities, and \nservices\n\n[[Page S12858]]\n\ndeployed or installed after January 1995, unless the cost is so high, \ncompliance is not reasonably achievable. Then the Government would have \nto pay for retrofitting, subject to available appropriations and \nprioritization by law enforcement. Absent such Government payment, \nwhich would make compliance ``reasonably achievable,'' CALEA directs \nthat the equipment, facilities, and services at issue will be ``deemed \nto be in compliance with such capability requirements.'' 47 U.S.C. \n1008(b)(2)(B).\n  I therefore strongly urge carriers to provide the FCC with all \nnecessary cost information associated with the punch list items so that \nthe agency is able to make determinations on whether compliance is \nreasonably achievable.\n  We anticipated when we passed CALEA that debates and delays over \nimplementation issues would occur. Congress therefore established \nprocesses at the FCC and in the courts to hear all sides, resolve \ndifferences, and grant extensions where necessary and warranted.\n\n  CALEA expressly authorizes the FCC to extend the compliance date of \nOctober 1998, one of the dates extended by the House in its version of \nH.R. 3303. On September 11, 1998, the FCC released a decision \nexercising its authority and extending the CALEA compliance date until \nJune 30, 2000. This is a few months shy of the extension approved by \nthe House. This action shows that the FCC process we set up in CALEA to \nresolve problems that may arise with the law's implementation works. \nThe agency's decision on extension of the compliance date has given me \nrenewed confidence in its ability to carry out the responsibilities we \ngave the agency under CALEA.\n  The House-passed version of H.R. 3303 also extended the ``grandfather \ndate.'' Let me explain the significance of this date. CALEA authorizes \n$500 million for the Federal Government to pay telecommunications \ncarriers for the reasonable costs of retrofitting equipment, facilities \nor services deployed by January 1, 1995 to comply with the capability \nrequirements. Any such equipment not retrofitted at Government expense \nis deemed to be compliant, or ``grandfathered,'' until the equipment is \nreplaced or undergoes significant upgrade in the ordinary course of \nbusiness.\n  Carriers have raised concerns that due to significant changes in the \ntelecommunications infrastructure as well as the deployment of new \nequipment and services since 1995, they may be ineligible for any \nreimbursement under this ``grandfather'' clause. Carriers have sought \nan extension of the ``grandfather date'' until 2000. Before we take \nsuch a step and extend the grandfather date, we should fully consider \nthe possible unintended consequences.\n  The ``grandfather date'' was set at a time earlier than the \ncompliance date in order to give telecommunications carriers every \nincentive to find and implement the most efficient and cost-effective \nsolutions to ensure the requisite law enforcement access. In addition, \nCongress fully contemplated that at some point carriers--not the \nGovernment--would bear the costs of CALEA compliance. Setting the \ngrandfather date at January 1995 was intended to be a privacy-enhancing \nmechanism by giving carriers the additional incentive to interpret the \ncapability assistance requirements narrowly since compliance with non-\ngrandfathered equipment or services was on their ``dime.'' Extending \nthe grandfather date by almost six years to the year 200 may have the \nunintended consequence of undercutting these important policy \nconsiderations.\n  While CALEA requires that equipment, facilities or services deployed \nafter January 1995 comply with capability assistance standards at the \ncarriers' expense, to ensure fairness and promote innovation, the law \nprovides a ``relief valve.'' Specifically, carriers are authorized to \npetition the FCC to determine whether compliance for such non-\ngrandfathered equipment, facilities or services is ``reasonably \nachievable'' or whether compliance would impose significant difficulty \nor expense on the carrier or users of the carrier's systems. As I noted \nabove, if the FCC decides compliance is not reasonably achievable, \nunder 47 U.S.C. 1008(b)(2)B), the carrier is ``deemed to be in \ncompliance'' unless the Attorney General prioritizes its needs, \nevaluates the importance of the surveillance feature to laws \nenforcement's mission, and determines that reimbursement is justified.\n  I appreciate the circumstances under which telecommunications \ncarriers are seeking extension of the grandfather date and their \nconcern over the costs of CALEA compliance for individual companies and \nratepayers. As I have already noted, the cost implications of the \npunch list are significant in evaluating whether compliance is \n``reasonably achievable,'' regardless of the specific grandfather date. \nShould the cost of CALEA compliance and of the punch list become \nexcessive, I urge the industry not to assume that extension of the \ngrandfather date is the only means to achieve a fair resolution of the \ncosts of CALEA compliance.\n\n  I look forward to a continued dialogue with the telecommunications \nindustry and the Department of Justice to ensure that the \nimplementation of CALEA is fair and maintains the careful balance of \nprivacy, innovation and law enforcement interests that we intended.\n\n\n                  important crime issues not addressed\n\n  Despite the passage of these important bills, we could have done \nbetter. When you look at the Democrat-supported ``Safe Schools, Safe \nStreets and Secure Borders Act,'' for example, you see too much \nunfinished work. You see comprehensive reform of the juvenile justice \nsystem, including sensible provisions dealing with youth and guns, \ngrants for youth violence courts and other innovative programs for \nyouth. You see comprehensive anti-gang provisions, from stopping the \n``franchising'' of youth gang to penalties for witness intimidation and \nthe use of body armor or laser sighting devices by criminals. You see \ncomprehensive assistance to State and local law enforcement, from more \ncops on the beat to improved funding to stop violence against women to \nfunds and technology for rural areas. You see weapons against the hate \ncrimes that shock the conscience of the Nation, against the growing \nproblem of cargo theft, against violence and intimidation of judges and \nothers in the law enforcement community, against involving minors in \nillegal drugs. You see tough money laundering provisions that recently \nwere praised by FBI Director Freeh as excellent tools against not only \nthe drug kingpins, but also international terrorists like Usama bin \nLaden, the man believed to be responsible for the bombings of our \nembassies in Kenya and Tanzania. You see an arsenal of other weapons \nagainst criminals both here and abroad. And lest we lose sight of the \nvictims of crime, you see a Bill of Rights for the victims of crime, \nbacked by the money, personnel and technology necessary to make those \nrights a reality.\n  In the end, of the ten titles in the Safe Schools, Safe Streets and \nSecure Borders Act, which I proposed with a number of other Democrats, \nCongress managed to adopt only the title on Criminal History Records in \nits entirety, along with bits and pieces of others. The list of titles \nnot adopted largely defines the work that remains for a more productive \nCongress. I have put these important provisions squarely on the table \nand stand ready, as always, to work with Senators on both sides of the \naisle to fine-tune them and to do as much as we can for the American \npeople.\n\n\n                        citizens protection act\n\n  While Congress failed to enact many provisions outlined in the Safe \nSchools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act that would have done much \nto assist the work of law enforcement officers, Congress was placing \nunnecessary and ill-advised obstacles in the path of effective \ninterstate and international prosecutions, just the type of prosecution \nthat is most difficult, most complex, and most important to the safety \nand welfare of the American people. This unfortunate bill, the Citizens \nProtection Act, H.R. 3396, was added by the House to the Commerce, \nJustice, State and the Judiciary appropriations bill, H.R. 4276. \nAlthough its most offensive provisions have been trimmed off, a version \nof this bill, with a delayed effective date, is now in the Omnibus \nAppropriations measure at the insistence of the House Republican \nleadership over the protests not only of the Department of Justice, but \nalso the President and senior Members of both parties in the Senate. As \nthe Washington Post noted in an October 18 editorial:\n\n\n[[Page S12859]]\n\n\n       One might expect that criminal justice legislation that is \n     opposed by the president, the attorney general and the \n     chairman and ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee \n     would not be blithely slipped into the statute books. But \n     prudence was long ago a casualty of this budget process.\n\n  I hope that the next Congress will show more wisdom and turn away \nfrom such mischief to serious work on the unfinished work of the Safe \nSchools, Safe Streets and Secure Borders Act, and other nonpartisan, \npro-law enforcement legislation.\n  The criminal justice legislation that I have summarized represents a \nnumber of good, solid measures. Enactment of these provisions will have \na real effect on the lives of Americans. Even amid the debris of a \nCongress that has botched so many opportunities to help the American \npeople, I am glad to have squeezed through these significant criminal \njustice measures in the logjam of the last weeks of the session. Far \nmore than satisfaction, however, I feel a determination that we in \nCongress can, should and must do better next time. We owe it to the \npeople who sent us here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12852-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CHEMICAL WEAPONS CONVENTION IMPLEMENTATION ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am glad that the House of Representatives \nhas, at long last, taken up and passed the Chemical Weapons Convention \nImplementation Act, S. 610, that the Senate had passed and sent to the \nHouse more than a years ago. This measure was included in the omnibus \nspending bill passed by the House last night and by the Senate today.\n  Over 10 years ago, in May 1988, as chairman of the then Judiciary \nSubcommittee on Technology and the Law, I convened hearings on High \nTech Terrorism, including terrorism with chemical and biological \nweapons and terrorist attacks on computer infrastructure. We have made \nprogress in those 10 years, but we need to do more. I was proud to have \nplayed a role in Senate ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention \nlast year. This was a matter initiated under President Reagan, \nnegotiated by President Bush, and signed on behalf of the United States \nby President Clinton.\n  We also proceeded to pass implementing legislation, which addressed \ncomplex technical and constitutional issues and about which there was \ngreat potential for delay. We were able to overcome that delay, \nhowever, and reach a sound consensus with admirable speed. The bill was \nreferred to the Judiciary Committee on April 17, 1997, and we held \nhearings and reported out the bill in just over a month. That bill \npassed the Senate on May 23, 1997. That shows what we can do here when \nwe put our minds to it.\n  I am gratified that the stall in House consideration of this \nimportant implementing legislation for the Chemical and Biological \nWeapons Treaty has finally ended. Further delay and a failure to act on \nthe part of the House on what is so obviously a pressing national \npriority, would have been a great blow to the Nation and to the \nnational security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12859-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO KYLE AND ALISON McSLARROW\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, there is an important part of the \nlegislative process that the public rarely gets a chance to see. I am \ntalking about the many dedicated staff people, on both sides of the \naisle, who work tirelessly to help the Senate conduct the Nation's \nbusiness. They work hard. They are dedicated. They provide invaluble \nadvice and counsel on a daily basis.\n  Today, I rise to pay tribute to one of these remarkable people. Kyle \nMcSlarrow, my Chief of Staff in the Republican Conference Secretary's \noffice, will be leaving my office to run Vice President Dan Quayle's \npresidential campaign in Arizona. While I couldn't be happier about \nKyle's new opportunity to shape the politics of a presidential \ncampaign, I am sad to lose such a talented individual. But most of all, \nI am sad that such a good friend will be leaving.\n  For the last several years, Kyle has been an integral part of the \nSenate Republican leadership team. He provided his counsel to two \nMajority Leaders--Senator Dole and Senator Lott--before coming to work \nas my Chief of Staff in the Conference Secretary's office. Kyle has \nhelped set the strategy for all the major legislative issues we have \nbrought to the Senate floor. He has provided his insight not only to \nour leadership, but also to many other Senators in our conference who \nhave come to rely on his good judgement.\n  Kyle McSlarrow is a conservative with the strongest of convictions. \nHe has always been able to get the job done, while holding steadfast to \nthese principles. Kyle has a great deal to be proud of in the years he \nhas worked on Capitol Hill: helping to rein in the IRS, working to \nreduce illegal drugs in our communities and helping to craft a \nblueprint for education reform that will one day be the law of this \nland. But most importantly, Capitol Hill is where Kyle met his wife \nAlison.\n  Kyle's better half, Alison McSlarrow, will be leaving the majority \nleader's office where she has served with great distinction for the \npast few years as Deputy Chief of Staff. Alison is one of the brightest \nstaffers I have met in Washington. Her intricate knowledge of Senate \nparliamentary procedure and legislative issues will be sorely missed. I \ngreatly appreciate all the help she has been to me over the years and \nwill miss her dearly, as well.\n  So I say to my friends Kyle and Alison, best of luck in Arizona. You \nhave made a difference here. You will make a difference wherever you \nmay be. The Nation needs caring and dedicated people like you to always \nbe involved in the process. God speed. The best for you both is yet to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12859-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12859-S12860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO RETIRING CONGRESSMAN DAN SCHAEFER\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to may good friend \nand colleague from Colorado, Congressman Dan Schaefer.\n  Congressman Dan Schaefer is retiring from the House of \nRepresentatives after 15 years of service to the people of Colorado's \n6th Congressional District and the United States. I would like to take \nthis opportunity to share a few reflections on Dan Schaefer's many \naccomplishments as a Congressman.\n  Not only did Congressman Dan Schaefer ably step into the void left \nwhen Congressman Jack Swigert died shortly after being elected, but he \nalso successfully led the charge in Congress to have a statute \ndepicting Jack Swigert as a young and daring astronaut of Apollo XIII \nfame added to Congress' statuary collection as Colorado's second and \nfinal contribution. With its wonderful combination of bronze and a \ncolorful space suit, the statue is both visually striking and proud. \nThe Jack Swigert statue is perhaps one of the most popular in the halls \nof Congress for visitors from all over the world. I know it is one of \nmine.\n  Over the years Congressman Dan Schaefer has been a leader in the \nfight to balance our nation's budget. In fact, Dan Schaefer is the one \nwho introduced H.J. Res. 1, a joint resolution calling for an amendment \nto the Constitution to provide for a balanced budget for the U.S. \nfederal government and for greater accountability in the enactment of \ntax legislation in the 105th Congress. H.J. Res. 1 clearly merits the \ncosponsorships of the 229 of his colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives who joined in support of Congressman Schaefer's \nresolution.\n  I am an original cosponsor of S.J. Res. 1, the companion legislation \nin the Senate to H.J. Res. 1. While this worthy legislation fell just \none vote short of passage in the Senate in the 105th Congress, this \nCongress also just passed the first balanced budget in many, many \nyears. Dan Schaefer is retiring from Congress with its books balanced \nfor the first time in generations. His role in achieving this important \nhistoric victory for the American people will be remembered.\n  Congressman Dan Schaefer has also been a national leader in energy \nissues. In the 105th Congress he led the drive for Public Law 105-28, a \nlaw that amends and updates sections of the Department of Energy \nOrganization Act. He has also been a ground breaker in the quest to \nderegulate American electricity. Even the exceeding complexities and \ndeep vested interests involved in our nation's electricity markets and \nmonopolies did not deter Dan Schaefer from introducing H.R. 655. This \nbill's goal was to give all American\n\n[[Page S12860]]\n\nconsumers the right to choose among competitive providers of \nelectricity in order to achieve lower prices and better service. His \nsteadfast work on this complex issue has made valuable progress that \ncan be built upon in years to come.\n  Finally, as the Coach of the Republican Congressional Baseball Team, \nDan Schaefer has established a winning record, batting 60% as the \nRepublican team has won 3 out of 5 games under his leadership, \nincluding winning for the last two years, in 1997 and 1998. Dan has \nalso been selected as the team's Most Valuable Player twice. It is \nclear that Congressman Schaefer's leadership will be missed both in the \nhalls of Congress as well as on the Congressional baseball diamond.\n  As he retires from the House, Congressman Dan Schaefer has a record \nof accomplishment to be proud of. He is the undisputed Dean of the \nColorado delegation. He will be missed. I wish him well and best of \nluck in all of his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12859-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO CHRISTOPHER GEORGES\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I was stunned and saddened to learn this \nmorning of the death of Christopher Georges.\n  For much of the last four years, Chris reported on Congress for the \nWall Street Journal. He died yesterday from complications of lupus.\n  He was not given much time in this world--only 33 years. But he used \nevery minute he was given, and achieved a remarkable amount.\n  He graduated magna cum laude from Harvard University in 1987 with a \ndegree in government. At Harvard, he was the executive editor of the \nHarvard Crimson and was named Harvard Journalist of the Year for 1986-\n87.\n  He began his journalism career in 1987 as an intern with the \nWashington Post. He worked on the issues staff of the Dukakis for \nPresident campaign in 1987 and 1988. He returned to newspapers, as a \nclerk for the New York Times. From the Times, Chris moved to CNN's \nfirst special investigative unit.\n  After CNN, he was named editor of Washington Monthly magazine. A \nstory he wrote on investigative journalism for Washington Monthly was \nnamed one of the ``10 Best of 1992'' by the 1993 Forbes Media Guide.\n  In 1994, he joined the staff of the Wall Street Journal in Washington \ncovering politics, the budget and economic issues. He was nominated for \na Pulitzer Prize last year for a series of stories he wrote examining \nthe effects of the new welfare reform laws.\n  It was during his time at the Journal that I got to know Chris. He \nwas a brilliant and fair reporter. He understood public policy as well \nas anyone in this building. He also had a rare ability to see how what \nwe do in this building affects people outside it.\n  His stories on welfare reform were a case in point. For months, Chris \npractically lived at housing projects in the Washington area to see how \nthe new laws affected four women as they struggled to make the \ntransition from welfare to work.\n  Chris loved everything about newspapering--the reporting, the \nstorytelling. His abilities, and his fundamental sense of fairness, \nearned him the respect of people on both sides of the aisle.\n  Chris was brilliant, funny, modest, gentle. He was also incredibly \nbrave.\n  Like many of us, I had no idea how sick Chris was, how savage and \ndebilitating his disease was. He almost never spoke about it. I now \nknow that Chris struggled with his disease for more than half his life, \nsince he was 15 years old.\n  A good friend of Chris's, Gene Sperling, director of the President's \nNational Economic Council, first met Chris when he was 22. He said the \nfirst time they stayed up all night working on a project, Chris \nconfided to Gene about his disease.\n  Gene asked Chris what it meant to have lupus. Chris was quiet for a \nmoment, then he said, ``It means I could die young.''\n  As a teenager, Chris had been a fierce wrestler. He was just as \nferocious in his efforts to wrestle his disease into submission. He did \nnot allow it to defeat him.\n  Perhaps because he knew what it meant to suffer, Chris was an \nunusually compassionate man. He leaves behind an incredible number of \nfriends. I want to extend my condolences to them.\n  I also want to extend my prayers and heartfelt sympathy to Chris's \nparents, Mary and Jerry Georges of New York City; his sisters, Gigi \nGeorges of Washington; Stephanie Georges Comfort and her husband Chris \nComfort of Denver, Colorado and their daughter Katherine.\n  In the last year of his life, Chris Georges got to do the kind of \nreporting he really wanted to do. It was smart and important, and it \nilluminated what we do here. Had he lived longer, I'm sure we would \nhave seen more of it.\n  I will miss reading Chris's stories. More than that, I will miss \nseeing him and talking to him. He was an extraordinary man.\n  In closing, President Clinton this morning also talked about Chris's \nlife and his work. I ask unanimous consent that the President's remarks \nbe printed in the Record as well. Thank you.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Statement by the President\n\n       Chris Georges was a reporter's reporter. Whether he was \n     writing about the budget, Medicare or welfare, Chris' \n     journalistic integrity, attention to detail, and focus on the \n     human side of policy earned him the respect of both his \n     fellow reporters and those who work in the Congress and the \n     White House. It was only fitting that his nomination for a \n     Pulitzer Prize was for a story about welfare and HIV-positive \n     children. Chris's friends and colleagues most remember his \n     decency, integrity, wit, and sense of fairness. He will be \n     deeply missed by his parents, sisters, and many friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12860-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12860-S12861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AFRICA: SEEDS OF HOPE ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I am pleased to note that yesterday both \nHouses of Congress passed the ``Africa: Seeds of Hope Act of 1998,'' \nclearing the measure for signature by the President. This legislation, \nwhich I introduced together with my colleague from Ohio, Senator \nDeWine, in July, is designed to prevent hunger and malnutrition in \nAfrica while at the same time helping American farmers and developing \nlasting and mutually beneficial ties between our peoples.\n  Food security is critical to establishing the basis for long-term \npeace, democracy and prosperity in Africa. By redirecting existing \nbilateral aid and investment programs toward small-scale farming and \nrural development, the ``Seeds of Hope Act'' will promote sustainable \nagricultural development and food security in sub-Saharan Africa. \nFurther, this initiative will foster research and extension activities \nand help to build local markets, providing important opportunities for \nmutual cooperation between U.S. and African farmers, educators, \nscientists and entrepreneurs.\n  The bill, as adopted, is intended to accomplish several important \nobjectives. First, it aims at providing new opportunities for the \npoorest of the poor, especially women, by expanding access to credit \nand technology, improving information and farming techniques, and \ncreating more efficient market mechanisms.\n  Second, it is designed to maximize the efficiency of current aid \nprograms. It directs the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment (USAID) to focus more of its efforts on projects that \nimprove food security and meet the needs of the rural poor, and \nrequires the participation of affected communities in all phases of \nproject planning and development. The initiative strengthens \ncoordination with non-governmental organizations, cooperatives, \neducational institutions and local marketing associations that have \nrelevant expertise. In this way, it encourages the latest agricultural \nmethods and most successful business practices, while ensuring they are \nappropriate to local conditions and adapted to specific climates.\n  Third, this legislation mobilizes new resources for investment in \nAfrican agriculture and rural development through the Overseas Private \nInvestment Corporation (OPIC), working with small businesses and other \nU.S. entities to develop the capacities of small-scale farmers and \nrural entrepreneurs. Particularly in this budgetary environment, it is \nessential to expand the public-private partnership in this area.\n\n[[Page S12861]]\n\n  Finally, the ``Africa: Seeds of Hope Act'' establishes a new and more \nreliable mechanism for providing emergency food aid overseas. Rather \nthan waiting until emergencies arise to purchase food for donation, the \nbill establishes a humanitarian trust that buys commodities when they \nare in surplus and distributes them immediately when they are needed. \nThis mechanism will allow for more timely and cost-effective responses \nto humanitarian crises.\n  Mr. President, a great deal of planning and hard work went into the \npassage of this legislation, not only by my colleagues and their staff \nmembers but especially by the private, voluntary organizations involved \nin sustainable development, such as Catholic Relief Services and Bread \nfor the World. These organizations work directly with the African \ncommunities most affected by hunger and famine, and their input into \nthis process was quite valuable. I commend them for their efforts, and \nI know they join me in welcoming the passage of this important piece of \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12860-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          VACANCIES REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I want to add my voice to those \nsupporting the passage of the Vacancies Reform Act as part of this \nbill. The Vacancies Reform Act addresses an enormously important issue: \nthe need to protect the Senate's constitutional role in the appointment \nof Federal officers. The Constitution provides that the President's \npower to appoint officers of the United States is to be exercised ``by \nand with the Advice and Consent of the Senate.'' Unfortunately, in too \nmany cases, over the course of the past several Administrations, the \nSenate's constitutional prerogatives have been ignored, through the \nExecutive's far too common practice of appointing acting officials to \nserve lengthy periods in positions that are supposed to be filled with \nindividuals confirmed by the Senate.\n  With the leadership of Senators Byrd and Thompson, we in the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee have worked for a large part of this \nsession to try to find a solution to this problem that reasserted the \nSenate's constitutional rights while at the same time avoided creating \nan unwarranted risk to the Government's good functioning. As noted in \nthe Additional Views I and others signed to the committee's report, the \nbill the committee reported in July and the Senate considered in \nSeptember went most of the way toward achieving these goals. \nNevertheless, because it still contained a number of troubling \nprovisions that, in my view, could have hindered the ability of the \nexecutive branch to carry out its duties, I could not in the end \nsupport that version of the bill.\n  Since the bill's floor consideration in September, all of the \ninterested parties have worked hard and in good faith to address the \nconcerns that remained about the bill, with the result that we now have \na good bill, one that offers a measured and appropriate response to the \nExecutive's longstanding unwillingness to comply with the dictates of \nthe Vacancies Act. I am particularly pleased that the final version of \nthe bill resolves one of my biggest concerns--that we not define who \nmay serve as an acting official in a manner that, in some cases, \neffectively precludes anyone from serving in an acting capacity. The \nfinal version of the bill well addresses this problem by offering the \nPresident the option to choose any senior agency staff who has worked \nat the agency for at least 90 days to serve as the acting official.\n  So, Mr. President, let me once again thank Senator Byrd, Senator \nThompson, and the others who have worked so hard on this bill. I am \npleased that it soon will become law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12861-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12861-S12867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNUCLEAR PROLIFERATION CONCERNS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY'S PLANS TO \n  USE A COMMERCIAL LIGHT WATER REACTOR TO PRODUCE TRITIUM FOR DEFENSE \n                                PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue of the \nutmost importance to the safety and security of every American--the \ntimely restoration of tritium production to maintain our nuclear \ndeterrent. Some have attempted to focus this debate on cost. Mr. \nPresident, the most significant issue in this debate is not cost--it is \nthe National Security of the United States.\n  For those who do not know, tritium is a radioactive gas and is an \nessential component of modern nuclear weapons. It decays at a rate of \nfive-and-a-half percent per year, so in order to maintain our nuclear \ndeterrent the tritium must be continually replaced. We have not \nproduced tritium in this country since 1988, when the reactors at the \nSavannah River Site in South Carolina were shut down. Since that time \nthe Department of Energy has examined countless options and \ntechnologies, but has not yet selected a new source. The end result of \nalmost a decade of stalling is millions in wasted taxpayer dollars and \nno progress in meeting the requirements of the Department of Defense. \nIf the Department of Energy is unable to begin the production of \ntritium before 2007, the impact will be unilateral U.S. nuclear \ndisarmament. Mr. President, given the perilous international security \nenvironment that exists, we cannot afford to allow this to happen. The \nNational Security interests of our Nation demand that we have a \nreliable source of tritium.\n  For a variety of reasons, the Clinton Administration has mismanaged \nthis program by delaying implementation, issuing torrents of \nmisinformation, and failing to acknowledge the true liabilities of the \ncommercial light water reactor option. Make no mistake, through its \nactions, and inaction, this Administration has put our nuclear \ndeterrent in jeopardy. This matter is of the utmost importance to the \nNation and I feel compelled to raise my concerns with my colleagues \nhere today.\n  The Department has narrowed its choices down to two options--the use \nof a commercial light water reactor at the Tennessee Valley Authority \n(TVA) or the use of a defense linear accelerator at a dedicated defense \nsite. In my opinion, the only viable option, in terms of cost, \nreliability, ability to meet Defense Department needs, and maintain a \nhigh non-proliferation stance, is the Accelerator for the Production of \nTritium (APT).\n  Over the past three months, a variety of inaccurate and misleading \nclaims have been made regarding the APT option. To date, I have not \ncome to the floor to correct these inaccuracies because my efforts were \nfocused on completing work on the National Defense Authorization Act \nConference Report. The enactment of this bill is essential to the armed \nforces of the United States. It provides the men and women who wear the \nuniform of our Nation with a much needed pay raise, it includes many \nvital readiness enhancements, and provides for the long-term \nmodernization of our military. However, now that the Conference Report \nhas been signed by the President and is law, I wish to take a few \nmoments to voice my concerns with the Department of Energy's tritium \nproduction program.\n  Despite the flood of misinformation, one fact remains abundantly \nclear and irrefutable--that we must have new tritium production source \nvery soon or leave our Nation without the nuclear deterrent that has \nkept the peace so well for the past 50 years. Mr. President, let me \nstate this plainly. My fear is that the commercial light water reactor \noption may never yield the tritium needed to maintain our defense \nnuclear stockpile. The regulations of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nmake a commercial reactor vulnerable to third party intervenor lawsuits \nand as a result, that litigation could easily block that facility from \ncoming on-line before it ever produces the first kilogram of tritium \nfor defense purposes. Only tritium produced in an accelerator, at a \ndedicated defense site, will assure that we have the tritium we need \nwhen we need it.\n  Mr. President, the cold war is over, but many dangers remain. In \nfact, the world may be a much more uncertain place today than it was \nduring the height of the cold war. Despite President Clinton's rhetoric \non stemming the proliferation of nuclear weapons and other weapons of \nmass destruction, we continue to see new and troubling proliferation \ntrends. Recently, we learned that Iraq's nuclear program is much more \nadvanced than previously thought. Earlier this year we witnessed the \nvery public entry of two new nations--India and Pakistan--into the\n\n[[Page S12862]]\n\nnuclear weapons club. In the last few months we have witnessed other \nnations boldly demonstrate their ability to deploy missile systems \ncapable of delivering nuclear or chemical/biological warheads onto U.S. \nsoil.\n  Mr. President, these are very troubling developments indeed. All of \nthese events demonstrate the need for the United States to maintain a \nviable nuclear deterrent. They also require consistent leadership on \nthe part of the United States. Our policies on non-proliferation must \nbe, as Secretary of State Albright said, ``unambiguous, decisive and \nclear.'' Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration's actions do not \nmatch up with its rhetoric. One prime example is in the area of tritium \nproduction.\n  By the end of this year, the Clinton Administration is required to \nidentify its preferred method to produce new tritium. One of the \noptions being considered is the use of a civilian nuclear reactor to \nproduce tritium for use in U.S. nuclear weapons. Such a decision would \nend a five-decade-long U.S. policy which has been upheld by every \nPresident since Harry Truman. That policy states very clearly and \nunquestionably that the separation of civilian and military nuclear \nenergy programs is in the best interests of the United States. It \nstates that we should not try to turn civilian nuclear power plants \ninto nuclear bomb plants.\n  Some are claiming that because the Tennessee Valley Authority is a \ngovernment agency that producing nuclear weapons materials in their \nreactors is consistent with U.S. policy. I can tell you that it is not. \nThe Atomic Energy Act, which governs this policy, was never intended to \ncondone the use of commercial-use facilities to produce nuclear weapons \nmaterials. Additionally, the reactors that present the greatest threat \nto U.S. national security interests are, in fact, owned by the \ngovernments of Korea, Iran, Iraq, India, and Pakistan. The implications \nof changing our policy concerning civilian-use nuclear power reactors, \ndespite whether they are owned by a government or a commercial entity, \nare far-reaching and potentially disastrous.\n  Anyone who is concerned about National Security and nonproliferation \nmust acknowledge that designating a commercial-use reactor as the new \ntritium production source would signal to the world that it is now \nacceptable to use commercial-use reactors to produce materials for \nnuclear weapons. Let me say that one more time--it would tell the rest \nof the world that we believe there should be no distinction between \ncivilian and military nuclear facilities.\n  Sending that message would also signal the end of commercial nuclear \nsales overseas. Now, every time a U.S. vendor attempted to sell a \nreactor to a foreign government, we would have to assess the potential \nof that plant becoming a nuclear weapons production site. The National \nSecurity of the United States demands that we operate at a higher \nstandard--setting ourselves apart as a World Leader.\n  I am a proponent of nuclear power and I support finding alternative \nmissions for nuclear reactors, but using a commercial reactor to create \nnuclear weapons materials would be devastating to the nuclear industry. \nIf we allow this ill-conceived Clinton Administration proposal to go \nforward, we will no longer be able to preach from the bully pulpit on \nnon-proliferation. We will no longer be able to tell other nations that \nit is unacceptable to forgo the use of their commercial reactors for \nmilitary purposes. We will have crossed that formerly well defined \nboundary that every President knew should never be violated since the \ndawn of the nuclear age. This President, however, seems to feel that it \nis perfectly acceptable to say to the rest of the world, ``do as we \nsay, not as we do.'' Mr. President, we cannot allow this Administration \nto take such an action without the intense scrutiny of Congress.\n\n  How could we go to the United Nations or the G-8 Summit and condemn \nnations like Iraq, Libya, Iran, North Korea, or any other nation that \nis so eager to establish a nuclear weapons program if we are not living \nup to our own standards? The simple answer is that we will not be able \nto do so, because civilian workers in a Tennessee Valley Authority \ncommercial nuclear power plant will be producing weapons grade \nmaterials. Our moral authority will be lost in a cloud of hypocrisy.\n  Because this issue is essential to our National Security, I have \nasked the Secretary of Energy to re-examine the non-proliferation \nconcerns associated with the commercial light water reactor option. I \nhave asked him to personally confer with the Secretaries of Defense and \nState and with the President's National Security Advisor. I have also \nwritten Secretary of State Albright asking her to personally evaluate \nthis issue and provide her assessments to Congress. I ask unanimous \nconsent that this letter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. THURMOND. For the past two years, I have expressed my concern \nwith the Administration's plans to turn civilian reactors into \nmaterials production plants. I have communicated that concern to the \nSecretaries of Energy and Defense. As a part of last year's Defense \nAuthorization Act, we included a provision that required the \nAdministration to clearly state what proliferation risks were entailed \nin the commercial light water reactor option. That report was not \ndelivered until well after both the House and Senate Defense \nAuthorization bills were completed. It stated, however, that there were \nnon-proliferation concerns with the use of commercial light water \nreactor for tritium production, but indicated that such concerns were \n``manageable.'' Mr. President, given the volatile proliferation risks \nwere are facing in South Asia, the Middle East, and other quarters of \nthe globe, do we want to settle for a ``manageable'' non-proliferation \npolicy? This finding is hardly a glowing endorsement of the reactor \noption being considered by the Clinton Administration. I suggest that \ntoday's international security environment requires U.S. non-\nproliferation policies to be absolutely unquestionable.\n  To establish any other policy for the United States will not go \nwithout consequences. The series of nuclear tests carried out by the \nGovernments of India and Pakistan is clear evidence that the Clinton \nAdministration's credibility with the rest of the world is being \nquestioned when it comes to non-proliferation matters. This Congress \nhas to step up to this issue and state that civilian and military \nnuclear programs cannot and will not be mixed.\n  In addition to claiming that there is no problem with producing \ntritium in a non-defense facility some proponents of the reactor option \nhave made many false statements concerning the costs of the different \noptions.\n  First, many point to a review of the United States nuclear weapons \nprogram conducted by the Congressional Budget Office at the request of \nthe Clinton Administration as proof positive of the lower cost of the \nreactor option. This initial review, conducted over a year and a half \nago, included an assessment of DOE's tritium program only as a cursory \nfootnote in the larger report. The CBO did not assess the current \nmodular accelerator design, which everyone agrees is dramatically \ncheaper, nor did the CBO conduct any assessment of the proposed cost to \ncomplete the reactor option.\n  Several months ago, the CBO attempted to justify its earlier report \nby updating its findings. The result was an even more inaccurate \ndepiction of the two tritium production options. This report was \nriddled with inaccuracies. In my response to this flawed report, I \nidentified a number of deficiencies in the CBO analysis. I ask \nunanimous consent that my letter of September 2 be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. THURMOND. Here are just a few of the glaring errors. CBO did not \nconsider the independent cost evaluations conducted on the accelerator \ndesign and construction estimates. CBO did not even mention the \nsignificantly lower cost modular accelerator design, which is the \ndesign currently being considered by DOE. Their report made no mention \nof the ancillary benefits of the accelerator that could help lower its \noperating cost. There was no contingency cost assessed for the reactor-\nbased options, yet the estimated cost\n\n[[Page S12863]]\n\nfor the accelerator was increased an astounding $500 million without \nany justification. There was no consideration of TVA's sizable debt \nservice costs in the reactor option. The Tennessee Valley Authority \ncurrently has an outstanding $4.6 billion debt on the incomplete \nreactor that would have to be recovered over the life of the reactor \noption. This would dramatically reduce the revenue stream projected for \nthe reactor option. Current law requires that TVA recuperate such costs \non a schedule and basis that advantages the ratepayers. In short, if \nthe gross revenues projected by TVA fall short or operating expenses \ncost more, TVA would face a legal conflict--fulfill its contractual \nobligation to pay DOE a share of gross revenues or fulfill its legal \nobligation to recover the costs. CBO did not account for this \nliability. There were no management and support or startup cost \nincluded in the reactor option.\n  The CBO analysis also ignored many programmatic requirements found in \nthe Department's August 1998 Draft Environmental Impact Statement for \nthe Production of Tritium in a Commercial Light Water Reactor (EIS). \nThe EIS states that ``at least two reactors would be needed'' and \nfurther states that ``DOE could use as many as 3 reactors.'' The CBO \nreport should have included additional costs in the reactor option to \naccount for the requirement to operate at least two reactors if a \nreactor-based option were selected. The entire reactor-based option \nrests on whether or not it can meet our nuclear defense needs for \ntritium. The CBO failed to address this fact. It should not have been \nignored and therefore undermines the credibility of the entire analysis \nof the commercial reactor option.\n  The CBO report failed to include any contingency costs in the reactor \noption to account for TVA's poor record in completing large reactor \nprojects. The average TVA cost overrun on reactor construction projects \nis well over 150 percent. This fact was also ignored by the CBO \nanalysis.\n  These are but a few of the deficiencies in the CBO cost analysis. \nYet, this is the report that some are relying on when they tell you \nthat the reactor is the lowest cost option. Well, I don't buy that. I \nalso don't put much stock in the argument that says the reactor option \ncan't cost more, because it is a fixed price contract. Given the \nDepartment's recent setbacks in fixed price contracting, it is \ninconceivable that DOE or CBO would simply accept a ``fixed price'' \noffer at face value and not consider the issues I have just raised. \nMany are aware of the fixed price contract that DOE signed at the Idaho \nPit 9 facility. Those who are aware of this contract know that DOE \nspent several hundreds of millions of dollars on this cleanup project \nand not one square inch of that facility has been cleaned up. Three \nyears later, that matter is still in dispute. We cannot afford to allow \nsuch delays to threaten an activity as vital as tritium production.\n  I have asked the CBO to re-examine this matter and provide a thorough \nand complete assessment to Congress by early 1999. In addition, I have \nrequested that the GAO provide a complete and independent review of the \ncompeting tritium production options. I ask unanimous consent that my \nletters of August 26 and September 4, 1998, be printed at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibits 3 and 4.)\n  Mr. THURMOND. I have just told you about the CBO review. Now let me \ntell you about an analysis conducted by the Congressional Research \nService which was an exhaustive and complete examination of both the \nreactor and accelerator options. This assessment was released June 18, \n1998, by the defense staff at the Congressional Research Service. This \nreport found that the reactor and the accelerator options are \n``competitive on a cost basis.'' The CRS report states that the cost of \nthe reactor option ranges from $2.5 billion to $3.7 billion, while the \ncost of the accelerator ranges from $2.5 to $2.9 billion. In other \nwords the accelerator could cost less than the reactor.\n\n  The CRS assessment is the most in depth assessment conducted on the \ncosts of the two tritium options to date. It represents the most recent \ninformation available and it says the costs of the reactor and the \naccelerator are comparable, that there are no technical risks \nassociated with the accelerator, and that the accelerator actually has \na greater chance of returning revenue to the U.S. Treasury than the \nreactor.\n  The revenue producing potential of the accelerator is one of the many \nthings that the CBO assessment failed to account for fully. Because the \naccelerator will operate on a continuous basis, it is possible to use a \nportion of the accelerator beam to produce much needed medical isotopes \nwhich can be used to treat prostate, breast, and many other types of \ncancers. The production of these isotopes will have no impact on the \nfacility's tritium production. This ``swords to plowshares'' approach \ncould, conservatively, raise $100 or $500 million per year in revenue \nfor the Federal government. This compares with the $25 to $100 million \nannual revenue projected to be available from the reactor option, and \nthe accelerator produces no hazardous legacy materials like spent \nnuclear fuel while at the same time maintaining our strong non-\nproliferation policies.\n  It is critical that the facts about the options for producing tritium \nare known. Choosing to produce this nuclear defense material in a \ncommercial light water reactor will sacrifice our position as the world \nleader on this issue. The accelerator is the right option for our \nNation.\n  I have mentioned a few of the advantages of the accelerator, but the \nreal advantage is that it is the technology of the future. Unlike the \nreactor option, the accelerator generates no nuclear waste, cannot \nthreaten surrounding communities, and requires no hazardous materials \nto be shipped across the country.\n  In fact, the accelerator may actually help destroy the ever growing \nvolumes of spent nuclear fuel and other nuclear wastes. The accelerator \ncould be used in a full-scale demonstration of a process known as the \naccelerator for the transmutation of waste (ATW). This innovative new \nprocess could reduce by 95 percent the volume of high level nuclear \nwaste currently planned to be buried in a repository in the Nevada \ndesert. The ATW would also generate electricity in the process.\n  As I previously stated, the accelerator could be used to create \nmedical isotopes. The U.S. has very little indigenous isotope \nproduction capability. The accelerator will make it possible to create \nrevolutionary new medical treatements to treat a wide variety of \ncancers. For example, one isotope that can be created in the \naccelerator would allow victims of prostrate cancer to be fully treated \nwithout any surgery. The radioactive medicines created in the \naccelerator could be designed specifically to attack only cancerous \ncells, obviating the need for surgery or radical, whole body radiation \ntreatments. New treatments could also be developed for breast and other \nterminal cancers. In addition to medical isotopes, industrial isotopes \ncan be created which have important and beneficial applications for \nboth our National Defense and NASA.\n  There are many other uses for the accelerator that could enhance the \nlives of citizens throughout the country. These ancillary benefits are \nachieved without the generation of a single cask of spent nuclear fuel, \nwithout any compromise in our stance against the proliferation of \nnuclear weapons, and without any added cost to the Department of Energy \nor Department of Defense.\n  It is because of these concerns that I rise to express my opposition \nto the use of a commercial facility to produce tritium for defense \npurposes and wholeheartedly endorse the APT as the preferable choice to \nprotect the National Security interests of the United States.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 23, 1998.\n     Hon. Madeleine K. Albright,\n     Secretary of State, Department of State, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Albright: The recent nuclear arms race in \n     India and Pakistan has underscored the need to maintain the \n     most vigilant nuclear nonproliferation programs and policies. \n     You validated that sentiment on June 3, 1998, when you \n     stated, ``American leadership should be unambiguous, \n     decisive, and clear.'' In light of your strong stance against \n     nuclear proliferation, I would appreciate your personal \n     position on this important National Security issue.\n       A cornerstone of our nonproliferation policy for the past \n     50 years has been the strict\n\n[[Page S12864]]\n\n     separation of the commercial and defense nuclear programs in \n     the United States. As the Atomic Energy Act, Section 57e \n     confirms, materials made for ``nuclear explosive purposes'' \n     may not be produced in a commercial facility.\n       The policy of separating commercial and defense facilities \n     in the production of nuclear weapons materials is now being \n     jeopardized. As you may know, tritium gas is a radioactive \n     material used to boost the explosiveness of a nuclear weapon. \n     The United States produced tritium at a defense-only facility \n     for over 40 years. We have not produced any tritium since \n     1988, relying on a large stored quantity. Because tritium \n     decays over time, the United States will need a new source of \n     tritium by 2005, in order to meet the level allowed by the \n     START I treaty. Without this material the weapons of our \n     Nation's nuclear arsenal are useless.\n       During the FY 1993 budget process, Congress directed the \n     Department of Energy (DOE) to examine possibilities of a new \n     source for tritium. DOE has since adopted a dual-track \n     strategy to investigate a Commercial Light Water Reactor \n     option and an Accelerator for the Production of Tritium \n     option. The Commercial Light Water Reactor option being \n     considered is the completion of the Bellefonte reactor owned \n     by the Tennessee Valley Authority. The Accelerator would be \n     built at a DOE facility, the Savannah River Site--the site \n     which produced tritium until 1988.\n       In the FY 1998 Defense Authorization Act, Congress \n     requested that the Department of Energy take the lead to \n     identify and assess any policy issues associated with the \n     various reactor options for the production of tritium for \n     national security purposes. In July 1998, in conjuction with \n     the Department of State Arms Control Office, the Department \n     of Defense, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the DOE \n     issued a report entitled ``Interagency Review of the \n     Nonproliferation Implications of Alternative Tritium \n     Production Technologies Under Consideration by the DOE.'' \n     This report assessed the proliferation risks associated \n     with producing tritium in a commercial light water reactor \n     and concluded that these risks were ``manageable.'' \n     Further, the report cites a number of examples in an \n     attempt to show that the separation of civilian and \n     military facilities has not been strictly upheld.\n       First, I believe that any new policy which could \n     inadvertently result in the proliferation of fissile \n     materials cannot be classified as ``manageable.'' Second, all \n     of the examples of dual-use facilities described in the \n     report involved deriving a civilian benefit from a defense \n     facility. Using facilities developed initially for military \n     purposes and then converting them to civilian use has found \n     ready acceptance in the past. I embrace the concept of peace \n     coming from war, but not the reverse.\n       Given today's international security environment, would you \n     please outline how the United States would defend a \n     ``manageable'' proliferation risk?\n       Do you believe that abandoning the 50 year separation \n     between commercial and defense nuclear facilities in regards \n     to producing nuclear weapons material and implementing the \n     new policy of producing nuclear weapons materials in a \n     commercial light water reactor will undermine our moral \n     authority to press for the strongest possible \n     nonproliferation regime?\n       As you know, India claims to have detonated a boosted \n     nuclear weapon, which would require the use of tritium. This \n     claim raises the question, did India produce tritium in its \n     government owned, commercial reactors? Moreover, if India is \n     able to produce tritium in a commercial reactor, supposedly \n     under IAEA inspection, could they also have successfully \n     diverted fissile material from the same reactor? Do you \n     believe that changing the existing United States policy of \n     separating civilian and military nuclear facilities in \n     regards to producing nuclear weapons material will validate \n     the India weapons program and send a signal to other nations \n     that the United States is not opposed to the use of \n     government owned, commercial reactors for the production of \n     nuclear weapons materials?\n       The United States has spent hundreds of millions of dollars \n     to prevent the production and spread of weapons-usable \n     materials such as plutonium and highly enriched uranium. Do \n     you believe we would lose this important investment if we \n     initiate a new policy which could embolden threshold nuclear \n     states to embark on new fissile material production programs \n     in commercial nuclear plants?\n       I contend that relying on commercial nuclear reactors to \n     supply nuclear materials for our warheads will cross a \n     boundary that all U.S. Presidents from Harry Truman to George \n     Bush knew should never be violated. Furthermore, I suggest \n     that given the international security environment we live in \n     today, our Nation's nonproliferation policy should be \n     absolutely unquestionable. Our leadership in the area of \n     nuclear non-proliferation will be emulated around the World. \n     The consequences of our example will be solely ours to bear.\n       I have worked to preserve the security of our Nation \n     throughout my career as a United States Senator. As Chairman \n     of the Senate Armed Services Committee one of my top \n     priorities has been the timely resumption of tritium \n     production at a facility that is both cost-effective and \n     politically defensible. I believe the National Security of \n     the United States and our leadership in the international \n     community depends upon maintaining the 50 year policy which \n     separates commercial and defense facilities for the \n     production of vital nuclear materials.\n       Due to the many sensitive foreign policy issues facing the \n     United States, such as the nuclear reactor project in North \n     Korea for peaceful purposes, I believe we need to be very \n     cautious in changing an established United States policy \n     which might send mixed signals to countries who depend upon \n     our consistent leadership. Again, I would appreciate your \n     personal position on this matter as well as your response to \n     the specific questions I have raised in this letter. I look \n     forward to hearing from you soon.\n       With kindest regards and best wishes,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Strom Thurmond.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 2, 1998.\n     Ms. June E. O'Neill,\n     Director, Congressional Budget Office, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ms. O'Neill: I am writing to respond to your August \n     27, 1998 report on the Department of Energy's (DOE) tritium \n     production options. I have reviewed the report and find it to \n     be incomplete and based on preliminary, unverifiable \n     information. As such, I consider the conclusions of the \n     report to be inaccurate. I am disappointed that the \n     Congressional Budget Office appears to have fallen far short \n     of its customary high quality work.\n       First, let me say that the cost figures presented for the \n     Commercial Light Water Reactor (CLWR) options have not been \n     validated by the Department of Energy's Chief Financial \n     Officer and are based solely on preliminary contractual \n     discussions between DOE and a potential vendor. Additionally, \n     while the Accelerator for the Production of Tritium (APT) \n     option has been subjected to numerous independent cost \n     evaluations (ICE) for all design and construction costs, none \n     of the reactor-based options have been subjected to an ICE \n     review. Your report failed to note the tentative nature of \n     the CLWR cost figures. In the case of the irradiation \n     services option, there is not even a valid proposal. The \n     potential vendor for that option, the Tennessee Valley \n     Authority (TVA), withdrew its proposal to provide such \n     services many months ago. Your report failed to note this \n     fact as well.\n       Second, your report left out many critical pieces of \n     information, including the following:\n       1. Your report states, ``All of the options assume that DOE \n     must make enough tritium to support a nuclear stockpile of \n     the size allowed by the START I treaty.'' However, the \n     analysis ignored many programmatic requirements found in the \n     Department's August 1998 Draft Environmental Impact Statement \n     for the Production of Tritium in a Commercial Light Water \n     Reactor (EIS). The EIS states that ``at least two reactors \n     would be needed'' and further states that ``DOE could use as \n     many as 3 reactors,'' to produce the tritium required to \n     support a START I stockpile. The CBO report should have \n     included additional costs in the CLWR option to account for \n     the requirement to operate at least two and possibly three \n     reactors in order to satisfy the START I requirements. Your \n     failure to do so produced an invalid comparison.\n       2. There was no mention of the significantly lower cost of \n     the modular APT design currently being considered by DOE, nor \n     was the option of pursuing a modular APT even mentioned. The \n     cost of constructing the modular APT is equivalent to the \n     cost of completing the Bellefonte reactor and would still \n     allow the United States the option to meet a START I \n     production level in the future should START II not be \n     ratified.\n       3. There was no mention of the fact that the TVA option \n     assumes full up-front, block funding over a one or two year \n     period. It would be virtually impossible for the DOE Office \n     of Defense Programs to make two $1 billion payments to TVA in \n     fiscal years 2000 and 2001, therefore the cost assumptions on \n     the Bellefonte option are invalid.\n       4. There was no mention of any ancillary benefits of the \n     APT. The APT would be highly effective in conducting research \n     in high energy physics, medical treatments, and waste \n     management. It could also directly support DOE research or \n     transmutation of high level nuclear waste. Not only could \n     these programs be a source of additional revenue for the APT, \n     but such activities would also serve the larger public good.\n       5. There was no mention of the independent cost evaluations \n     that have been conducted for the APT design and construction \n     costs.\n       6. There was no consideration of TVA's sizable debt service \n     costs in the total estimated cost of the Bellefonte option. \n     Your report correctly asserts that TVA's $4.6 billion \n     outstanding debt on the Bellefonte plant must be recovered \n     through gross revenues at the plant. Ultimately, TVA rate \n     payers will pay the full cost of this debt and the associated \n     interest costs. Current law requires that TVA recuperate such \n     costs on a schedule and basis that advantages the rate \n     payers. In short, if the gross revenues projected by TVA fall \n     short or operating expenses cost more, TVA would face a legal \n     conflict. It would either have to fulfill its contractual \n     obligation to pay DOE a share of gross revenues or fulfill \n     its legal obligation to recover the costs on behalf of the \n     rate payers.\n       7. There were no management and support or startup costs \n     included in the Bellefonte\n\n[[Page S12865]]\n\n     cost projections despite TVA's poor facility start up record. \n     The report added $500 million to the APT cost to account for \n     such activities. It is clear that DOE will incur added \n     management, operations and startup costs for the CLWR. If \n     these costs are not included for the TVA option, they should \n     not be included for the APT project.\n       8. The CBO report assessed the APT option a 35% contingency \n     cost penalty to account for DOE's poor record in completing \n     large construction projects on time and within budget. The \n     report accurately states that the average overrun for large \n     DOE construction projects is 50%. However, the CBO report did \n     not include a similar contingency penalty in the TVA \n     Bellefonte cost estimate, despite the fact that according to \n     the 1995 Congressionally mandated TVA Integrated Resource \n     Plan, the average TVA cost overrun on reactor construction \n     projects ranged from 100 percent to 230 percent. In addition, \n     the cost estimates for the CLWR tritium extraction facility \n     and the target fabrication facilities should have included a \n     contingency cost penalty.\n       9. There was no mention of the regulatory and schedule \n     barriers which could slow or block licensing a new or \n     existing CLWR to produce tritium for defense purposes. \n     Licensing commercial nuclear facilities falls under the \n     jurisdiction of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). The \n     most recent attempts to build and license new CLWR's have \n     resulted in extraordinary challenges by anti-nuclear groups \n     and other intervenors. Numerous work stoppages have resulted \n     in massive time delays and cost overruns. The last TVA CLWR \n     to be licensed was the Watts-Barr I facility. That facility \n     received a construction permit on January 23, 1973 and \n     finally began operating on May 26, 1996--over 23 years later. \n     The Bellefonte Reactor would prove especially contentious due \n     to the obvious controversy of producing materials for nuclear \n     weapons in a commercial nuclear facility. I am greatly \n     concerned if the CLWR option is chosen, delays could occur \n     which would result in tritium being unavailable when the \n     current stored supply is exhausted and when a new source is \n     required.\n       The totality of these deficiencies in the CBO's cost \n     analysis of the tritium production options being considered \n     by DOE makes the report's findings highly speculative and not \n     entirely useful as a planning document. It does not appear as \n     though CBO held any discussions with the DOE, vendor, or \n     laboratory program leaders for the options under \n     consideration. Further, it does not appear that CBO \n     considered a wide variety of external reviews that have \n     already been conducted, such as the July 1998 Congressional \n     Research Service report which presented extensive \n     documentation for its findings. Given the Department's recent \n     setbacks in the Idaho Pit 9 fixed price contract, it is \n     inconceivable that DOE or CBO would simply accept a ``fixed \n     price'' offer at face value. A fixed price contract is only a \n     good deal if you believe the vendor can perform the work \n     described within the cost and schedule projections estimated.\n       The resumption of reliable tritium production that meets \n     the National security requirements of the United States is \n     one of the most difficult issues facing the Defense \n     Authorization process this year. Unfortunately, your analysis \n     of the costs of the various options is flawed and rather than \n     shedding light on the true potential costs, it has caused \n     further confusion. You are responsible for ensuring that the \n     parameters governing CBO assessments are not skewed to assure \n     a particular outcome and that the information used in \n     conducting such analyses is balanced and fully transparent. I \n     believe this report falls far short of the standard the CBO \n     has traditionally met, and given the inaccuracies and \n     deficiencies I have outlined in this letter, I am confident \n     that you will move forward with all due haste to review and \n     reconsider your incomplete findings. I look forward to \n     receiving your revised and accurate report as soon as \n     possible.\n       With kindest regards and best wishes,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Strom Thurmond.\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 26, 1998.\n     Mr. James Hinchman,\n     Acting Comptroller General, General Accounting Office, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Hinchman: Tritium gas is a critical element of \n     thermonuclear weapons and is used in every U.S. nuclear \n     warhead. Without this element the nuclear weapons of our \n     Nation's arsenal are useless. As the recent nuclear arms race \n     in India and Pakistan have underscored, and as rogue nations \n     such as North Korea, Iran and Iraq continue efforts to \n     acquire nuclear weapons capabilities, it is absolutely \n     essential that the United States maintain a nuclear stockpile \n     at the highest level of readiness.\n       Tritium has not been produced by the United States since \n     1988. Since this gas decays over time, identifying a new \n     source is clearly vital to our National Security. I have \n     consistently maintained that it is one of our highest \n     responsibilities to identify and develop a viable and secure \n     tritium production source.\n       During the FY 1993 budget process, Congress directed DOE to \n     examine possibilities for a new source of tritium. DOE has \n     since adopted a dual-track strategy to investigate the \n     Commercial Light Water Reactor (CLWR) option and the \n     Accelerator for the Production of Tritium (APT) option.\n       On August 25, 1998 while visiting the Savannah River Site, \n     Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson stated that, ``The \n     decision (on the tritium production source) will be made on \n     the bases of science and not politics.'' Unfortunately, it is \n     no secret that the Administration has been leaning heavily \n     toward the CLWR option, Recently, numerous allegations have \n     surfaced which suggest that senior level officials at DOE \n     have engaged in a systematic campaign to undermine the \n     validity of the APT option. These allegations are extremely \n     disturbing. The National Security of the United States \n     demands that the study of the two tritium production options \n     be approached with the utmost care and precision.\n       In light of the enormous implications of this decision and \n     the allegations which imply that the final selection may be \n     based on factors other than merit, I request you conduct an \n     in-depth analysis of the competing tritium production \n     options. This investigation should include, but not be \n     limited to, the following aspects:\n       Is the Dual Track Strategy Balanced?--Does the evidence \n     support the allegations that DOE principals and staff are \n     attempting to skew the outcome of the tritium selection \n     process to advance the CLWR option over the APT option? Has \n     Dr. William Bishop, the Director of the APT office, or any \n     other DOE employee been threatened, pressured, censured, \n     reprimanded, etc. because their actions might enhance the APT \n     option over the CLWR option? Have threats, pressures or \n     reprimands created an environment which would limit the \n     ability or desire of DOE employees to present balanced \n     information about the tritium source selection process? Have \n     key DOE employees, specifically Chief Financial Officer \n     Michael Telson and the Director of Nonproliferation and \n     National Security Rose E. Gottemoller, been excluded from \n     fully participating in the ``dual track'' process?\n       Proliferation Concerns--President Clinton recently \n     indicated in a July 24, 1998 press release that nuclear \n     nonproliferation is ``one of the nation's highest \n     priorities.'' A cornerstone of our nonproliferation policy \n     for the past fifty years has been the strict separation of \n     the commercial and defense nuclear programs of the United \n     States. DOE recently stated that the nonproliferation \n     involved in producing tritium in a CLWR are ``manageable.'' I \n     contend that relying on commercial nuclear reactors to supply \n     nuclear materials for our warheads will cross a boundary that \n     all U.S. Presidents from Harry Truman to George Bush knew \n     should never be violated. Furthermore, I suggest that given \n     the international security environment we live in today, our \n     Nation's nonproliferation policy should be absolutely \n     unquestionable.\n       Environmental and Safety Concerns--This issue has many \n     facets. Clearly one of the more contentious aspects of the \n     environmental issue is the storage and disposal of the legacy \n     materials and wastes from our defense programs and our \n     nuclear power generation industry. Your analysis should \n     examine the impact of the two options on this problem. I am \n     aware that the addition of one production reactor would not \n     greatly exacerbate the current situation. However, it is my \n     understanding that the APT option could actually serve to \n     reduce the storage of waste problem through the Accelerator \n     Transmutation of Waste process. DOE, which is responsible for \n     managing the significant nuclear waste we have produced, \n     appears to have ignored this ground breaking technology in \n     their considerations.\n       Regulatory and Schedule Concerns--Licensing a new CLWR \n     falls under the jurisdiction of the Nuclear Regulatory \n     Commission (NRC). The most recent attempts to build and \n     license new CLWR's have resulted in extraordinary challenges \n     by anti-nuclear groups and other intervenors. Numerous work \n     stoppages have resulted in massive time delays and cost \n     overruns. The last Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) CLWR to \n     be licensed was the Watts-Barr I facility. That facility \n     received a construction permit on January 23, 1973 and \n     finally began operating on May 26, 1996--over 23 years later. \n     The Bellefonte Reactor would prove especially contentious due \n     to the obvious controversy of producing materials for nuclear \n     weapons in a commercial nuclear facility. I am greatly \n     concerned if the CLWR option is chosen, delays could occur \n     which would result in tritium being unavailable when the \n     current stored supply is exhausted.\n       Cost--I have consistently maintained that the production of \n     tritium is not a cost issue, it is a National Security issue. \n     Therefore, ensuring the capacity to produce the material in a \n     manner which is consistent with our proven nonproliferation \n     policy is more important than cost considerations. However, \n     in this era of constrained spending it is essential that we \n     select a production technology which is fiscally responsible. \n     On July 21, 1998 then Acting Secretary of Energy, the \n     Honorable Elizabeth A. Moler, sent a letter to me in which \n     she cited DOE's ``official'' departmental cost estimates. In \n     my response, dated July 24, 1998, I outlined a number of \n     serious concerns I had regarding her ``official'' estimates. \n     I have included copies of both of these letters for your \n     review. As I indicated at that time, I was informed by DOE \n     Chief Financial Officer Michael Telson, that the numbers \n     cited as ``accurate'' and ``official'' for the CLWR option \n     were not validated by DOE, but were merely forwarded from the \n     Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) as the Bellefonte proposal. \n     DOE embraced these\n\n[[Page S12866]]\n\n     numbers and forwarded them to Congress as ``accurate'' and \n     ``official'' despite the fact that TVA's record of \n     forecasting the cost to complete nuclear plants is woeful. As \n     part of the Congressionally mandated TVA Integrated Resource \n     Plan, TVA reviewed the accuracy of estimates it has produced \n     since 1987. The review found that TVA's rate of error for \n     predicting future nuclear plant costs ranged from 100% to \n     230%. Furthermore, DOE allows TVA to claim that revenue from \n     selling electricity from Bellefonte would repay the costs the \n     American taxpayers would incur for completing the reactor. \n     Given that the Bellefonte reactor has a current debt of $4.5 \n     billion and that the cost of electricity is expected to \n     decline, the Congressional Research Service, in the recent \n     report ``the Department of Energy's Tritium Production \n     Program'', indicated that the likelihood that a completed \n     Bellefonte plant could sell electricity at a price high \n     enough to recover the taxpayer's investment is ``highly \n     uncertain.'' By contrast, when APT program officials \n     attempted to study the possibility of generating revenue \n     through the commercial leasing of the APT to produce medical \n     isotopes, they were instructed to ``cease any work''. Why \n     would DOE allow the ``official'' CLWR numbers to include \n     highly suspect revenue potential from power generation and \n     not consider revenue from a market which is projected to \n     exceed $5 billion by 2010? Your providing an accurate and \n     complete cost comparison of the two competing tritium \n     production options will finally clarify the costs and allow \n     the debate to be based on truly accurate information.\n       I firmly believe that this is one of the most important \n     issues facing the nation. The security of the United States \n     and the world depends on the maintenance of a credible U.S. \n     nuclear deterrent. Due to the extraordinary consequences of \n     the tritium production technology decision, I request you \n     begin this investigation as soon as possible. Thank you for \n     your attention and I look forward to hearing from you soon.\n       With kindest regards and best wishes,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Strom Thurmond.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                               Exhibit 4\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 4, 1998.\n     Mr. James Hinchman,\n     Acting Comptroller General, General Accounting Office, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Hinchman: I am writing to follow up my August 26, \n     1998 letter to you regarding tritium production. There are \n     additional issues that I would like your report to address \n     concerning this important National Security program.\n       On August 27, 1998, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \n     issued a report analyzing the two options for producing \n     tritium, the Commercial Light Water Reactor (CLWR) and the \n     Accelerator for the Production of Tritium (APT). After \n     reviewing the CBO report (Attachment I), I find it to be \n     incomplete and based on preliminary, unverifiable \n     information. As such, I consider the conclusions of the \n     report to be inaccurate. The fact that the Congressional \n     Budget Office appears to have fallen far short in their \n     analysis makes your investigation of the tritium program even \n     more important.\n       There are a number of problems with the CBO report which \n     you should be made aware of as you begin your own \n     investigation. First, the cost figures presented for the CLWR \n     option have not been validated by the Department of Energy's \n     Chief Financial Officer and are based solely on preliminary \n     contractual discussions between DOE and a potential vendor. \n     Additionally, while the APT option has been subjected to \n     numerous independent cost evaluations (ICE) for all design \n     and construction costs, none of the reactor-based options \n     have been subjected to an ICE review. The report failed to \n     note the tentative nature of the CLWR cost figures. In the \n     case of the irradiation services option, there is not even a \n     valid proposal. The potential vendor for that option, the \n     Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA), withdrew its proposal to \n     provide such services many months ago. The report failed to \n     note this fact as well.\n       Second, the report left out many critical pieces of \n     information, including the following:\n       1. The report failed to make a parallel comparison of the \n     options needed to make the required amount to tritium for our \n     Nation's nuclear stockpile. CBO states, ``All of the options \n     assume that DOE must make enough tritium to support a nuclear \n     stockpile of the size allowed by the START I treaty.'' \n     However, the analysis ignored the programmatic requirements \n     set forth in the Department's August 1998 Draft Environmental \n     Impact Statement (EIS) for the Production of Tritium in a \n     Commercial Light Water Reactor. The EIS states that ``at \n     least two reactors would be needed'' and further states \n     that ``DOE could use as many as 3 reactors,'' to produce \n     the tritium required to support a START I stockpile. \n     Solely estimating the cost to complete the Bellefonte \n     reactor as the CLWR option to produce tritium is not in \n     line with current DOE programmatic assessments because it \n     will not satisfy the stockpile needs at a Start I level. \n     Your report should analyze the costs associated with \n     producing tritium in an APT compared to producing tritium \n     in the required number of reactors to achieve a START I \n     level. A more accurate comparison would be to analyze the \n     costs of producing tritium in an APT versus producing \n     tritium at Bellefonte at a START II level, an amount that \n     could be achieved by a single reactor during an 18-month \n     refueling cycle.\n       2. Again, due to the unparalleled comparison by CBO, a more \n     appropriate comparison of the two options would be to analyze \n     the costs of a Stat II level. However, in the CBO report \n     there was no mention of the significantly lower cost for the \n     modular APT design currently being considered by DOE, which \n     would meet START II requirements. Furthermore, the option of \n     pursuing a modular APT was never mentioned. The cost of \n     constructing the modular APT is equivalent to the cost of \n     completing the Bellefonte reactor and would still allow the \n     U.S. to move to a START I production level in the future if \n     START II is not ratified.\n       3. There was no mention of the fact that the TVA option \n     assumes full up front, block funding over a one or two year \n     period. It would be virtually impossible for the DOE Office \n     of Defense Programs to make two one-billion dollar payments \n     to TVA in fiscal years 2000 and 2001; therefore, the cost \n     assumptions are invalid.\n       4. There was no mention of any ancillary benefits of the \n     APT. The APT would be highly effective in conducting research \n     in high energy physics, medical treatments, and waste \n     management. It could also directly support DOE research on \n     transmutation of high level nuclear waste. Not only could \n     these programs be a source of additional revenue for the APT, \n     but such activities could serve the larger public good.\n       5. There was no mention of the independent cost evaluations \n     that have been conducted for the APT design and construction \n     costs.\n       6. There was no consideration of TVA's sizable debt service \n     costs in the total estimated cost of the Bellefonte option. \n     The report correctly asserts that TVA's $4.6 billion \n     outstanding debt on the Bellefonte plant must be recovered \n     through gross revenues at the plant. However, the debt \n     service on $4.6 billion over 40 years averages well over $200 \n     million per year. Taking this into account, it would appear \n     that Bellefonte will operate at a significant loss every year \n     it produces tritium. Current law requires that TVA recuperate \n     such costs on a schedule and basis that advantages the \n     ratepayers, therefore TVA would face a legal conflict. It \n     must either fulfill its contractual obligation to pay DOE a \n     share of gross revenues or fulfill its legal obligation to \n     the ratepayers. In either scenario there will be significant \n     outstanding costs that will have to be assumed by either \n     TVA ratepayers or, in a more likely situation, the \n     American taxpayers.\n       7. There were no management and support or startup costs \n     included in the Bellefonte cost projections despite TVA's \n     poor facility start up record. The report added $500 million \n     to the APT cost to account for such activities. It is clear \n     that DOE will incur added management, operations and start up \n     costs for the CLWR. If these costs are not included for the \n     TVA option, they should not be included for the APT project.\n       8. The CBO report assessed the APT option a 35% contingency \n     cost penalty to account for DOE's poor record in completing \n     large construction projects on time and within budget. The \n     report accurately states that the average overrun for large \n     DOE construction projects is 50%. However, the CBO report did \n     not include a similar contingency penalty in the TVA \n     Bellefonte cost estimate, despite the fact that according to \n     the 1995 Congressionally mandated TVA Integrated Resource \n     Plan, the average TVA cost overrun on reactor construction \n     projects ranged from 100 percent to 230 percent. In addition, \n     the cost estimates for the CLWR tritium extraction facility \n     and the target fabrication facilities should have included a \n     contingency cost penalty.\n       9. There was no mention of the regulatory and schedule \n     barriers which could slow or block licensing a new or \n     existing CLWR to produce tritium for defense purposes. \n     Licencing commercial nuclear facilities falls under the \n     jurisdiction of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). The \n     most recent attempts to build and license new CLWR's have \n     resulted in extraordinary challenges by anti-nuclear groups \n     and other intervenors. Numerous work stoppages have resulted \n     in massive time delays and cost overruns. The last TVA CLWR \n     to be licenced was the Watts-Barr I facility. That facility \n     received a construction permit on January 23, 1973 and \n     finally began operating on May 26, 1996--over 23 years later. \n     The Bellefonte Reactor would prove especially contentious due \n     to the obvious controversy of producing materials for nuclear \n     weapons in a commercial nuclear facility. I am greatly \n     concerned if the CLWR option is chosen, our nation runs the \n     risk of subjecting the entire nuclear arsenal to lawsuits \n     from third-party intervenors. This delay would result in \n     tritium being unavailable when the current stored supply is \n     exhausted.\n       The totality of these deficiencies in the CBO's cost \n     analysis of the tritium production options being considered \n     by DOE makes the report's findings highly speculative and not \n     entirely useful as a planning document. It does not appear \n     that CBO considered a wide variety of external reviews that \n     have already been conducted, such as the July 1998 \n     Congressional Research Service report which presented \n     extensive documentation for its findings. Given the \n     Department's recent setbacks in the Idaho Pit 9 fixed price \n     contract, it is inconceivable that DOE or CBO would simply \n     accept a ``fixed price''\n\n[[Page S12867]]\n\n     offer at face value. A fixed price contract is only a good \n     deal if you believe the vendor can perform the work described \n     within the cost projections estimated.\n       Your investigation of the tritium program should \n     incorporate an analysis of the above issues as well as those \n     mentioned in my previous letter. While the CBO report could \n     have shed light on the pros and cons of each option to \n     produce tritium, it only clouded the matter further. The \n     General Accounting Office report should ensure a balanced \n     discussion of this issue that is so vital to the National \n     Security of our Nation.\n       With kindest regards and best wishes.\n           Sincerely,\n     Strom Thurmond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12861-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SENATOR DAN COATS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Mr. President, I would like to say a few words before the \nclose of the 105th Congress about my friend and colleague, Wendell \nFord, the very distinguished senior senator from the great state of \nKentucky. His retirement from the Senate this year leaves this body of \ngovernment missing a cornerstone that I am not sure we can replace \nanytime soon.\n  From the heartland of these United States, he is a strong, resonant \nvoice for the working people of this nation. This Senate chamber will \nsound a bit hollow without that gruff, but friendly voice crying out \nfor ``order'' in these chambers.\n  I have served for six years now with Senator Ford. During our time \ntogether I have known him as a stalwart ally in our party and a \nvaluable friend. As an indefatigable champion for Kentucky, he never \nbetrayed that trust that the people who elected him four times to the \nUnited States Senate bestowed upon him. That he has been able to keep \nhis feet firmly grounded in Kentucky's interests while extending his \nhelping hand to Senators from every region of this nation is a \ntestament to his skill, temperament and wisdom.\n  I cannot speak of Senator Ford without expressing my admiration for \nhis leadership on the Committee on Commerce, Science and \nTransportation, particularly his service as chairman and ranking member \nof the Subcommittee on Aviation. No issue is small to Senator Ford if \nit is a big issue to his colleague. I remember early in my tenure here \nthat he worked with me on an issue that I have struggled with every \nsince I came to House of Representatives and later as a Senator. We \nneeded the Federal Aviation Administration to work with other Federal \nagencies and clean up an abandoned radar site on Mt. Tamalpais in my \nhome county of Marin.\n  I had been here only a year or so before Senator Ford sliced through \nthe bureaucratic tangle and resolved this local problem at long last in \nthe 1994 FAA Reauthorization bill.\n  He was also there for the State of California when we were trying to \nget the California Cruise Ship Industry Revitalization Act accepted in \nconference. He stood in the door of that conference--refusing to call \nit complete--until our provision was accepted. This provision has \nprovided enormous benefits for our ports in California, and we are \ngrateful for his untiring assistance.\n  While helping on these local and State issues, he has been the \nstrongest advocate for our airports, particularly in using the Airport \ntrust fund for what it was intended modernizing and upgrading airports \nacross the country to keep them safe and competitive. I was proud to \nsee that we named the FAA reauthorization bill this year, the Wendell \nH. Ford National Air Transportation System Improvement Act. The truth \nis I feel like every time we have voted for the FAA reauthorization \nbill it has had his stamp upon it.\n  I wish the Senator from Kentucky a fond farewell--but not goodbye. He \nwill always be in my thoughts and in my heart. And I know his voice \nwill still echo throughout these hallowed halls--and in the halls of \nour memories, we will forever remember Wendell Ford's decency, \ncompassion, and plain old common sense.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12867-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12867-S12868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       JOHN GLENN--AMERICAN HERO\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in 1962, a few weeks before becoming the \nfirst American to orbit the Earth, John Glenn appeared on the cover of \nLife magazine under the header, ``Making of a Brave Man.'' John Glenn \nis indeed a brave man, but to those of us who have served with him in \nthe United States Senate, he is much more. He is a skilled legislator, \na good friend, and an honorable and decent person.\n  For the generation who remembers John Glenn's historic trip to space \n36 years ago, his return this month abroad the space shuttle is truly \nspecial. At that time, the United States was in the midst of the cold \nwar with the Soviet Union. The Soviets could boast many achievements in \nspace, including the launching of the first satellite. It was a tense \ntime, and ours hopes as a nation were with John Glenn and the U.S. \nspace program.\n  On February 20, 1962, America held it's collective breath as Glenn's \nFriendship 7 capsule circled the earth three times. During this \nmission, John Glenn showed us why he was our hero. When a faulty signal \nerroneously warned that the capsule's heat shields might come loose, he \nremained calm and cool, even as he watched fiery bits of spacecraft \nflash past him during reeintry into the Earth's atmosphere. The entire \ncountry beamed with pride at this heroic accomplishment.\n  President Kennedy called space ``a new ocean'', and John Glenn will \ngo down in history as one of it's first and most important explorers. \nHis flight opened the door to future missions, such as the Mercury \nprogram, Gemini program, and eventually the Apollo program that put man \non the moon.\n  In a few weeks, America will once again beam with pride when John \nGlenn lifts off from Kennedy Space Center abroad the Space Shuttle \nDiscovery. As opposed to his first mission, which lasted five hours, \nthis mission is scheduled to last nine days. During that time, Senator \nGlenn will participate in a number of experiments designed to find \nparallels between the physical stress of space flight and the natural \naging process.\n  Scientists are hopeful of finding out why astronauts and the elderly \nsuffer from similar ailments, such as bone and muscle loss, balance \ndisorders and sleep disturbances. Understanding these physiological \ncharacteristics\n\n[[Page S12868]]\n\nmay open the door to new and innovated treatments. I am sure Senator \nGlenn is as excited about these potential breakthroughs as he is about \nhis return to space.\n  As a Senator, John Glenn has been a wonderful advocate on many \nimportant issues. Along with his hard work on space, technology and \nscience issues, Senator Glenn has also been a strong voice on the need \nfor his country to increase it's investment in education. So many \ntimes, I have seen Senator Glenn with school children in the Hart \nSenate Office Building, and I know that he inspires our next generation \nof leaders as he does us.\n  So as Senator Glenn leaves the Senate, I want to give him my thanks \nfor all that he has done for this country. Like all Americans, my \nthoughts and prayers will be with him as he makes history yet again. I \nwish him well on this and all his future missions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12867-4", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SENATOR DALE BUMPERS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I understand that in his last campaign \nSenator Bumpers used the slogan: ``What a Senator Should Be.'' I \ncouldn't have summed it up better myself.\n  Throughout his 24 years in this body, Dale Bumpers has set new \nstandards for the office of Senator. He is sincere and compassionate. \nHe speaks with eloquence and clarity. He is an idealist and a realist. \nHe is courageous and principled. He can stimulate a debate and broker a \ndeal. He has a deep understanding of the issues and a quick wit that \namuses us all. He is a true populist whose dedication to improving the \nlives of Arkansans has benefited our nation as a whole.\n  I am deeply honored to have served with Senator Bumpers for six \nyears. I have learned a great deal from him. Because of him I have been \nfortunate to witness some of the Senate's most animated debates, on \nsuch issues as mining law reform, electric utility restructuring, \nprotecting small business, preserving our public lands, arms control \nand fighting the now infamous space station.\n  He has been a voice for our precious environment, champion of \nconsumer rights, and he has always been willing to stand up for the \n``little guy'', for the interests of regular folks.\n  Senator Bumpers' illustrious career began long before he was elected \nto the United States Senate. As a young lawyer in Charleston, Arkansas, \nDale Bumpers played a key role in the first integration of a public \nschool after the Brown vs. Board of Education decision.\n  He went on to serve as Governor of Arkansas for four years, and was \nrecently voted the ``Greatest Governor'' in the history of Arkansas by \nthe Arkansas Times.\n  Fortunately, it was not often that Senator Bumpers and I were on \nopposite sides of an issue. However, one of my most memorable moments \nin the Senate was one such occasion. We were debating an important \nagriculture issue and to emphasize my point, I brought a frozen chicken \non the Senate floor and slammed in on a desk. Senator Bumpers and \nSenator Pryor immediately raised a point of order and I had to remove \nthat chicken from the Senate floor.\n  Anyone who has had to face off against Senator Bumpers knows of the \npassion he feels for the issues he discusses and the people he \nrepresents. Even those who may oppose his views can't help but admire \nhis lively speeches and personal stories. I will miss hearing his \nfamiliar sayings about pigs squealing under gates and fights with \nBetty. I will miss his pointer flying as he paces up and down the \naisles of the floor. I will miss the passion in his voice. And most of \nall, I will miss my friend.\n  Senator Bumpers is someone on whom I have grown to depend, a man who \nhas always given a kind word, and a person who has been a true role \nmodel for us all.\n  I thank the senior Senator from Arkansas for all that he has shared \nwith us and all that he has taught us. No doubt there will be Senators \nwho will continue to promote the causes he cared for so deeply. But I \nassure you, the debates will never have the same enthusiasm, the same \npassion or the same flare, that Senator Bumpers brought to this August \nbody.\n  It is with reverence, awe and deep affection that I pay tribute to \nthe truly distinguished gentleman from Arkansas, Senator Dale Bumpers. \nI will miss him dearly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12868-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING RECESS\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 7, 1997, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on October 21, during the recess of the \nSenate, received a message from the House of Representatives announcing \nthat the House has passed the following bills and joint resolution, in \nwhich it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 4738.

A petition from a citizen of the State of Texas \n     relative to the Supreme Court of the United States; to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary.\n       POM-556. A petition from a citizen of the State of New York \n     relative to the Supreme Court of the United States; to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary.\n       POM-557. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Michigan; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 78\n\n       Whereas, in 1988, the EPA put into place regulations \n     requiring all underground storage tank systems to meet \n     stricter environmental protection standards. Tank systems \n     installed before 1998 must be upgraded by December 22, 1998, \n     or be removed; and\n       Whereas, Many tank owners and operators discovered leaks at \n     their sites when they began upgrading their tank systems. \n     Consequently, Michigan and other states have seen a dramatic \n     increase in the number of known leaking storage tank sites; \n     and\n       Whereas, While progress has been made in Michigan and \n     elsewhere on the job of cleaning up affected areas, the task \n     remaining is very large. It presents a serious challenge to \n     most of the states, including Michigan. The primary obstacle \n     to the completion of this endeavor is the high costs facing \n     tank owners and operators to clean up their leaking \n     underground storage tank sites; and\n       Whereas, A key element in the massive task of dealing with \n     leaking underground storage tanks is the trust fund created \n     through the Superfund Revenue Act of 1986. Funded by a .1 \n     cent per gallon tax on motor fuel, the LUST Trust Fund has a \n     current balance of approximately $1.2 billion. While the .1 \n     cent per gallon tax was discontinued for nearly two years, \n     the tax was reinstituted, beginning on October 1, 1997. The \n     fund will take in approximately $200 million annually; and\n       Whereas, In spite of the fund's size and in spite of the \n     pressing need for money by the states in order to comply with \n     the December 22, 1998, deadline for cleanup, the fund \n     releases a far lower amount each year than it could \n     distribute. It is estimated that only one-third of the \n     available money has been distributed to the states; and\n       Whereas, Accelerating distributions from the trust fund \n     would provide much needed help to the States in achieving the \n     goal of correcting one of our country's most significant \n     environmental problems now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring), That we memorialize the Congress of the United \n     States to increase the amount of money being distributed to \n     the states from the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust \n     Fund, and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n       Adopted by the House of Representatives, February 17, 1998.\n       Adopted by the Senate, September 15, 1998.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-558.

A bill to protect children with respect to the Internet, to \nincrease the criminal and civil penalties associated with certain \ncrimes relating to children, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n          keeping the internet decent and safe (k.i.d.s.) act\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today, I introduce the Keeping the \nInternet Decent and Safe (K.I.D.S.) Act. This legislation would give \nparents and educators tools to protect our children while they use the \nInternet. Moreover, this bill would give law enforcement officials the \nability to make the Internet a safer environment for everyone.\n  Unfortunately, while innocently ``surfing'' the web, many of our \nchildren are accidentally encountering graphic and sexually explicit \nimages. They type in search terms as innocuous as ``toys''--only to \nfind inappropriate images on their display terminal. According to Wired \nmagazine, there are currently some 28,000 web sites containing hard- \nand soft-core pornography on the Internet. And that number is growing \nat an alarming rate. It is estimated that more than 30 pornographic \nsites are added to the Internet each day.\n  In addition, the Internet now provides the ``strangers'' we have \nalways warned our children about with almost unlimited access to our \nchildren. Historically, sexual predators have sought children wherever \nthey gather--in school yards, playgrounds and malls. Today, children \nhang out in cyberspace. This provides the sexual predator with an \nalmost limitless number of opportunities to exploit children because \nthey can prowl from family room to classroom to bedroom with virtual \nanonymity. Clearly, this is a problem that is only going to grow worse \nunless we work aggressively to ensure that the Internet is a safe \nenvironment.\n  The bill I am introducing today would build upon provisions authored \nby Senator Coats and myself which were adopted as part of S. 442, the \nInternet Tax Freedom Act. The provisions are designed to provide some \nsafety for young people who are being exposed today to the alarming \namount of pornography on the Internet. Specifically, my amendment will \nrequire that Internet access providers make screening software \navailable--either for a fee or no charge--to customers purchasing \nInternet access services, and Senator Coats' amendment establishes \nspecific measures that commercial operators of sexually explicit sites \nmust take to restrict access to children under the age of 17.\n  I am pleased that these provisions of the Internet Tax Freedom Act \nwere passed yesterday and today by both houses of Congress as part of \nthe Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act \nof 1999, and look forward to the President signing them into law. Yet, \nit is clear that our work is not done.\n  I was very disturbed by a recent article in the The Washington Post \nwhich stated that law enforcement officials in the United States and \nabroad had uncovered an international child pornography ring in which \nhundreds of people were using the Internet to trade thousands of \nsexually explicit images of children. More than 200 ring members were \narrested in the United States and 13 other countries. The U.S. Customs \nService seized computers from American suspects in 22 states, including \nConnecticut.\n  That is why today I introduce the Keeping the Internet Decent and \nSafe (K.I.D.S.) Act. In this age of the Internet, our children have \nunprecedented access to educational materials via the computer. \nHowever, this wonderful technology has also brought with it a dark side \nfor our children, and we as a nation have an obligation to ensure that \nour children are able to learn, grow, and play in an environment free \nfrom harm. My bill would give parents, teachers and law enforcement \nofficers the tools they need to help protect and guide our children, as \nthey seek knowledge and wholesome entertainment on the Internet.\n  First, my bill would make it possible for law enforcement officials \nto detain\n\n[[Page S12872]]\n\nsomeone before trial who is arrested for a federal crime involving \nchild exploitation. Currently, there is a rebuttable presumption that \nan individual charged with a violent crime or certain drug-related \ncrimes should be detained. Pedophiles who exploit and prey upon \nchildren are at least as great a threat to our society as drug dealers \nand people involved with violent crimes, and federal law enforcement \nofficials should be able to detain them, as well.\n  Second, my bill would allow schools to make classroom computers safer \nby allowing them to use monies from such programs as Title VI and the \nSafe and Drug Free School Act to purchase screening software.\n  Finally, my bill would allow materials involved with crimes involving \nthe sexual victimization of children--such as computers, vehicles and \nclothing--to be permanently seized from sexual predators by law \nenforcement authorities. Currently, the government can seize such \nmaterials like if they belong to a convicted pornographer, but not if \nthey belong from a convicted child molester. Property used in crimes \ninvolving the sexual exploitation of children is equally harmful and \nshould also be able to be seized by the Government to help thwart \nfurther criminal activity involving our children.\n  As we head into the 21st century, we know that an increasing number--\nin fact a majority--of our children are going to use the Internet for \nboth educational and social activities. This is a positive development \nthat we should encourage. But with this progress comes new \nresponsibilities, not only for our young people, but also for adults. \nWe owe it to our children to make sure that they are safe when they go \non-line.\n  I believe that the KIDS Act will make significant strides to protect \nour children from harmful materials on the Internet and give law \nenforcement officials additional tools to clamp down on criminals who \nuse the Internet to prey on our children. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this effort to take reasonable steps to keep the Internet safe \nfor our youngest and most vulnerable citizens. I ask unanimous consent \nthat a copy of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2648\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to give gifted and talented students the opportunity \nto develop their capabilities; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n           gifted and talented students education act of 1998\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am introducing the Gifted and \nTalented Students Education Act of 1998. This legislation would provide \nblock grants to the states to provide educational programs that focus \non and are tailored to the needs of gifted and talented students.\n  The needs of gifted and talented students are often misunderstood. \nToo often we believe that all we need to do for gifted and talented \nstudents is to put them on an accelerated course of study. However, \nthat is not sufficient. Gifted and talented students think and look at \nthe world in a unique way. Therefore, their educational agenda must be \ntailored to the thought processes gifted and talented students employ. \nCurrently, our nation's education system does not do so. This is due in \npart, to a lack of resources available in schools across the country.\n  My legislation, which has been offered in the House of \nRepresentatives by Congressman Elton Gallegly of California would \nprovide block grants to state education agencies to identify gifted and \ntalented students from all economic, ethnic and racial backgrounds--\nincluding students of limited English proficiency and those with \ndisabilities. Funding would be based on each state's student \npopulation, but each state would receive at least $1 million.\n  This legislation would leave the decision on how best to serve these \nstudents to state and local officials. I have always believed that \nstate and local officials, working with parents, are in a much better \nposition than bureaucrats in Washington to know what their students \nneed to succeed. I have also always believed that the most effective \neducation spending is that which goes directly to the students. That's \nwhy this bill caps administrative costs at 10 percent.\n  So while the funds in this measure can't be used for bureaucracy, it \ncan be used for items such as professional development for teachers; \ncounselors and administrators; innovation of programs and services for \nhigh-ability students and for developing emerging technologies such as \ndistance learning and other initiatives. It is my hope this measure \nwill give educators the resources and the flexibility they need to meet \nthe needs of gifted and talented students.\n  Mr. President, our nation's gifted and talented are among our great \nuntapped resources. We must focus on the needs of these students so \nthat their particular gifts can flourish and be fully realized. I am \naware Mr. President that at this late date, this measure will not pass. \nHowever, I hope introduction of this bill will help shed some light on \nthe needs of the gifted and talented and force a much-needed national \nconversation about the tremendous potential that we are allowing to go \nundeveloped. While this measure will obviously not receive any further \naction before the end of the 105th Congress, it is my sincere hope that \nintroduction of this bill will be the beginning of a new era in \neducating the gifted and talented.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 2652. A bill to amend the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and \nRodenticide Act to improve the safety of exported pesticides, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n\n\n                circle of poison prevention act of 1998\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I first introduced this legislation \nover six years ago after the General Accounting Office concluded that \nU.S. policy to ensure imported food safety is inadequate and in need of \nreform. Changes have taken place since, but our policy of allowing \npesticides that are prohibited for use within the United States be \nexported to other countries remains.\n  The United States should be proud of the strict regulations that we \nhave on the production and use of pesticides. But we should be \nembarrassed that the loophole in current law allowing U.S. chemical \ncompanies to export dangerous pesticides--pesticides banned in the \nU.S.--has not been eliminated. This loophole must be eliminated to \nprotect the American consumer and American farmer and to halt the \nimmoral practice of sending dangerous pesticides overseas to be handled \nand applied by unsuspecting farmworkers.\n  My ``Circle of Poison'' bill is designed to protect the public from \npesticide residues on imported food. It is unreasonable to expect that, \nin these times\n\n[[Page S12875]]\n\nof tight budgets and limited resources, the Food and Drug \nAdministration (FDA) will be able to monitor each shipment of imported \nfood for each pesticide that a foreign farmer may use. FDA import \ninspections have declined dramatically in just the last four years, so \nthat now less than two percent of FDA-regulated imported food is \nsubject to any type of inspection.\n  It is possible, however, to aid FDA by limiting the number of \ndangerous pesticides which U.S. chemical companies supply to foreign \nfarmers. By banning the export of pesticides which EPA has not deemed \nsafe, the ``circle of poison'' legislation will reduce the availability \nof some of the most hazardous pesticides. By curtailing the supply, it \nis less likely that foreign farmers will use these pesticides, and \ntherefore, less likely that these pesticides will end up on food that \nAmericans consume.\n  In addition, this bill puts American farmers on an equal footing with \nforeign farmers. Under the bill, if a pesticide is not legal for \nAmerican farmers to use, it will not be legal for foreign farmers to \nuse on food that is exported to the U.S. A simple and reasonable \nconcept, but a concept which is not yet in place in the real world.\n  Finally, it is simply wrong to allow the export of illegal \npesticides. If the Environmental Protection Agency does not allow our \ncitizens and environment to be exposed to a pesticide, we should not \nsubject other countries to the hazards of the pesticide. A pesticide \nthat may endanger people and the environment in the U.S. does not \ndiminish in toxicity simply because it has been exported.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12871-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                S. 1529\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kennedy, the name of the Senator from Louisiana \n[Ms. Landrieu) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1529, a bill to enhance \nFederal enforcement of hate crimes, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 2121\n\n  At the request of Mr. Baucus, his name was added as a cosponsor of S. \n2121, a bill to encourage the development of more cost effective \ncommercial space launch industry in the United States, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                                S. 2180\n\n  At the request of Mr. Murkowski, his name was added as a cosponsor of \nS. 2180, a bill to amend the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \nCompensation, and Liability Act of 1980 to clarify liability under that \nAct for certain recycling transactions.\n\n\n                                S. 2356\n\n  At the request of Mr. Roberts, the name of the Senator from Kentucky \n[Mr. McConnell) was added as a cosponsor of S. 2356, a bill to amend \nthe Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to provide for uniform food \nsafety warning notification requirements, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 2576\n\n  At the request of Ms. Snowe, the name of the Senator from Utah [Mr. \nHatch) was added as a cosponsor of S. 2576, a bill to create a National \nMuseum of Women's History Advisory Committee.\n\n\n                                S. 2616\n\n  At the request of Mr. Roth, the name of the Senator from Pennsylvania \n[Mr. Santorum) was added as a cosponsor of S. 2616, A bill to amend \ntitle XVIII of the Social Security Act to make revisions in the per \nbeneficiary and per visit payment limits on payment for health services \nunder the medicare program.\n\n\n                    Senate Concurrent Resolution 128\n\n  At the request of Mr. Leahy, the names of the Senator from South \nDakota [Mr. Daschle), the Senator from New Jersey [Mr. Torricelli), and \nthe Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr. Specter) were added as cosponsors of \nSenate Concurrent Resolution 128, a concurrent resolution expressing \nthe sense of Congress regarding measures to achieve a peaceful \nresolution of the conflict in the state of Chiapas, Mexico, and for \nother purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12875-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 312--TO AMEND SENATE RESOLUTION 209 IN ORDER TO \n               PROVIDE BUDGET LEVELS FOR FISCAL YEAR 1999\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, today I introduce S. Res. 314 which \nexpresses the sense of the Senate regarding the authority of the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to make adjustments in payments \nmade to skilled nursing facilities under the Medicare program.\n  As my colleagues are aware, pursuant to the Balanced Budget Act of \n1997, Congress directed the Health Care Financing Administration to \ncreate a new prospective payment system, or PPS, for Medicare-certified \nskilled nursing facilities, or SNFs, as they are called.\n  Skilled nursing facilities are now in the process of moving from the \nhistorical cost-based reimbursement system to the new prospective \npayment system.\n  This new system combines costs associated with nursing services, \ncapital investment, and other medical services bundled together and \nthen adjusted to reflect the needs of the patients.\n  Congress rightly sought this new system as a way of getting skilled \nnursing facility operators to manage both the quality and costs of \nhealth care for seniors qualified under Medicare.\n  As this system has been developed quickly since the enactment of the \nBBA, there has been a problem identified with adjustments for services \nconsidered ``non-therapy'' services.\n  These include respiratory therapy, pharmaceutical products, \nparenteral and enteral products, laboratory and x-ray services, and \nother covered medical supplies.\n  While I believe that HCFA has done a remarkable job in getting this \nsystem in place over the past year, I am concerned that the adjustment \nin payment for these specific services has not yet been developed.\n  This is especially true for a patient who is very ill--those with \nmultiple disease conditions treated in a SNF. There is simply not \nadequate provisions for ensuring that the prospective payment made each \nday appropriately reflects the higher medical costs that these patients \nmay need.\n  As a result of this new system, many nursing homes cannot afford to \ntreat certain types of patients. That was never our intent.\n  HCFA officials have acknowledged that they needed more data to fix \nthe problem. They commissioned a study last year to assist them to make \ncorrections.\n  However, the data was not yet available in time for the first year to \nimplement some corrections. While I am certain that HCFA will correct \nthis system, I want to ensure that services to our most vulnerable \nseniors in nursing homes getting complex medical services will continue \nto get their care.\n  I do not want bureaucratic delays in any way to impede their care.\n  The PPS theory of paying according to average does not work when the \nrates are not based on solid data and the case-mix adjustment for non-\ntherapy ancillaries is based on very little data. This is obviously not \nwhat Congress intended with the BBA.\n  In March, the Medicare Payment Assessment Commission advised the \nCongress that ``the RUG-III system may not adequately differentiate \namong Medicare SNF patients . . . this may lead to significant \noverpayment and under payment for patients within a RUG group.''\n\n  In September, the Appropriations Committee report for the Department \nof Health and Human Services included the following:\n\n       The Committee has heard concerns regarding the equity of \n     the new Medicare SNF prospective payment system as it relates \n     to nontherapy ancillaries. The demonstration upon which the \n     new system was based did not include this class of items and \n     services. Due to the lack of sufficient data to make these \n     changes, the new system may provide a windfall for some \n     providers while seriously impairing the ability of others to \n     treat patients requiring more intensive care. Therefore, the \n     Committee urges HCFA to reexamine this policy and make \n     budget-neutral changes this year to assure continued access \n     to services for high cost patients pending the gathering of \n     sufficient data on which to base permanent reforms.\n\n  Mr. President, unless relief is provided and this anomaly in the \npayment system is corrected, a major impediment will remain for certain \npatients with high non-therapy ancillary costs to receive Medicare \nservices in nursing facilities.\n  An immediate transitional modification is needed before irreparable \nharm is done to quality care and access for high costs patients. Some \nfacilities have already begun PPS coverage although HCFA apparently \nwill not begin making actual PPS payments until December, or later. \nHowever, on January 1 about 60 percent of the SNFs will begin coverage \nunder the PPS.\n  We must, therefore, develop longer term solutions for these crucial \nservices, but first we must do no harm in the interim.\n  Providers can quickly change operations to maximize light care and \nminimize heavy care. Specialty staff, such as respiratory therapists, \nwill be let go; special physical plant and equipment, such as air flow \nequipment for ``clean room'' level infection control will be \ndismantled; and hospital referral arrangements will be changed.\n  Accordingly, I am submitting today S. Res. 314 expressing the sense \nof the Senate that the Secretary, pursuant to section 1888(e)(4)(G)(i), \nhas the authority to provide for an appropriate adjustment to account \nfor case mix which reflects a patient's medical needs requiring non-\ntherapy ancillary services.\n  HCFA has acknowledged the shortcomings of the current RUG-III system. \nThe RUG-III demonstration project had treated these costs as a pass-\nthrough because the system did not have the data available to include \nsuch costs.\n  My resolution will clarify and reaffirm Congressional intent that the \nSecretary has the administrative flexibility to make appropriate \nadjustments to the case-mix of SNFs to reflect the costs of these \nservices.\n  One approach, which accommodates HCFA's operational impediment of \nYear 2000 computer software problems, would be to make payment \nadjustments to reflect the relative resource utilization of non-therapy \nancillaries by different patient types based on a SNF's cost report for \nthe first year under the PPS.\n  The resolution calls upon the Secretary to gather sufficient data on \nthe provisions of non-therapy ancillaries in order to develop the \nappropriate adjustments. And, it also urges the Secretary to \nperiodically report to Congress on the development of the appropriate \nadjustment.\n  Mr. President, this issue is one of quality and access for America's \nseniors to community based skilled care.\n  And, while it was my hope that the Senate could pass this resolution \ntoday, I trust my remarks and the language of the resolution will serve \nto further define the complex issues associated with this important \nmatter.\n  I am encouraged that the distinguished Chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Roth, and the distinguished Minority Member, Senator\n\n[[Page S12877]]\n\nMoynihan, have indicated their interest, and look forward to working \nwith them early next year to address this issue in the Finance \nCommittee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12876-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n     RELATIVE TO THE ELECTIONS TO BE HELD IN GABON IN DECEMBER 1998\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        LUGAR AMENDMENT NO. 3834\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for Mr. Lugar) proposed an amendment to the resolution (S. \nRes. 285) expressing the sense of the Senate that all necessary steps \nshould be taken to ensure the elections to be held in Gabon in December \nof 1998 are free and fair;

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) El Camino Real de los Tejas (the Royal Road to the \n     Tejas), served as the primary route between the Spanish \n     viceregal capital of Mexico City and the Spanish provincial \n     capital of Tejas at Los Adaes (1721-1773) and San Antonio \n     (1773-1821);\n       (2) the seventeenth, eighteenth, and early nineteenth \n     century rivalries among the European colonial powers of \n     Spain, France, and England and after their independence, \n     Mexico and the United States, for dominion over lands \n     fronting the Gulf of Mexico, were played out along the \n     evolving travel routes in this immense area;\n       (3) the future of several American Indian nations, whose \n     prehistoric trails were later used by the Spaniards for \n     exploration and colonization, was tied to these larger forces \n     and events and the nations were fully involved in and \n     affected by the complex cultural interactions that ensued;\n       (4) the Old San Antonio Road was a series of routes \n     established in the early 19th century sharing the same \n     corridor and some routes of El Camino Real, and carried \n     American immigrants from the east, contributing to the \n     formation of the Republic of Texas, and its annexation to the \n     United States;\n       (5) the exploration, conquest, colonization, settlement, \n     migration, military occupation, religious conversion, and \n     cultural exchange that occurred in a large area of the \n     borderland was facilitated by El Camino Real de los Tejas as \n     it carried Spanish and Mexican influences northeastward, and \n     by its successor, the Old San Antonio Road, which carried \n     American influence westward, during a historic period which \n     extended from 1689 to 1850; and\n       (6) the portions of El Camino Real de los Tejas in what is \n     now the United States extended from the Rio Grande near Eagle \n     Pass and Laredo, Texas and involved routes that changed \n     through time, that total almost 2,600 miles in combined \n     length, generally coursing northeasterly through San Antonio, \n     Bastrop, Nacogdoches, and San Augustine in Texas to \n     Natchitoches, Louisiana, a general corridor distance of 550 \n     miles.\n\n     SEC. 1203.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that:\n       (1) Bandelier National Monument (hereinafter, the Monument) \n     was established by Presidential proclamation on February 11, \n     1916, to preserve the archeological resources of a ``vanished \n     people, with as much land as may be necessary for the proper \n     protection thereof. . .'' (No. 1322; 39 Stat. 1746).\n       (2) At various times since its establishment, the Congress \n     and the President have adjusted the Monument's boundaries and \n     purpose to further preservation of archeological and natural \n     resources within the Monument.\n       (A) On February 25, 1932, the Otowi Section of the Santa Fe \n     National Forest (some 4,699 acres of land) was transferred to \n     the Monument from the Santa Fe National Forest (Presidential \n     Proclamation No. 1191; 17 Stat. 2503).\n       (B) In December of 1959, 3,600 acres of Frijoles Mesa were \n     transferred to the National Park Service from the Atomic \n     Energy Committee (hereinafter, AEC) and subsequently added to \n     the Monument on January 9, 1991, because of ``pueblo-type \n     archeological ruins germane to those in the monument'' \n     (Presidential Proclamation No. 3388).\n       (C) On May 27, 1963, Upper Canyon, 2,882 acres of land \n     previously administered by the AEC, was added to the Monument \n     to preserve ``their unusual scenic character together with \n     geologic and topographic features, the preservation of which \n     would implement the purposes'' of the Monument (Presidential \n     Proclamation No. 3539).\n       (D) In 1976, concerned about upstream land management \n     activities that could result in flooding and erosion in the \n     Monument, Congress included the headwaters of the Rito de los \n     Frijoles and the Canada de Cochiti Grant (a total of 7,310 \n     acres) within the Monument's boundaries (Public Law 94-578; \n     90 Stat. 2732).\n       (E) In 1976, Congress created the Bandelier Wilderness, a \n     23,267 acres area that covers over 70 percent of the \n     Monument.\n       (3) The Monument still has potential threats from flooding, \n     erosion, and water quality deterioration because of the mixed \n     ownership of the upper watersheds, along its western border, \n     particularly in Alamo Canyon.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to modify the \n     boundary of the Monument to allow for acquisition and \n     enhanced protection of the lands within the Monument's upper \n     watershed.\n\n     SEC. 1503. BOUNDARY MODIFICATION.\n\n       Effective on the date of enactment of this title, the \n     boundaries of the Monument shall be modified to include \n     approximately 935 acres of land comprised of the Elk Meadows \n     subdivision, the Gardner parcel, the Clark parcel, and the \n     Baca Land & Cattle Co. lands within the Upper Alamo watershed \n     as depicted on the National Park Service map entitled \n     ``Proposed Boundary Expansion Map Bandlier National \n     Monument'' dated July, 1997.

ADMINISTRATION.\n\n       The Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director \n     of the National Park Service, shall manage the national \n     Monument, including lands added to the Monument by this \n     title, in accordance with this title and the provisions of \n     law generally applicable to units of National Park System, \n     including the Act of August 25, 1916, an Act to establish a \n     National Park Service (39 Stat. 535; 16 U.S.C. 1, 2-4), and \n     such specific legislation as heretofore has been enacted \n     regarding the Monument.\n\n     SEC. 1506.

Mr. President, earlier this year, this body mourned \nthe passing of a former colleague and a political pioneer: Terry \nSanford of North Carolina. Terry Sanford served honorably in the Senate \nfrom 1987 to 1993, but he is primarily remembered as the progressive \nGovernor who guided the state of North Carolina from the days of \nsegregation into the modern era of economic prosperity and racial \ntolerance.\n  Elected in 1960, four years before the Civil Rights Act, Terry \nSanford aggressively pursued an agenda of racial equality, creating a \nbiracial panel to work on solutions to end job discrimination against \nblacks. But as crucial as desegregation was to North Carolina's future, \nTerry Sanford realized that it would have a limited impact without \ninvestments in education.\n  As much as any figure in modern American politics, Terry Sanford \nrecognized that education was the key to opportunity and economic \ngrowth in this country. He established North Carolina's community \ncollege system, invested heavily in the public schools, founded the \nNorth Carolina School for the Arts, and set up a school for the state's \ngifted students. He also promoted the use of the research facilities at \nthe state's universities as the foundation of Research Triangle Park, \nwhich has become one of the nation's leading hubs of high-tech economic \nactivity.\n  After leaving the Governor's office, he went on to serve as the \nPresident of Duke University for 16 years, and he led this university \nto national prominence.\n  Many people have expressed their admiration for Terry Sanford in this \nchamber and in publications across the country, and, in my opinion, one \nof the most eloquent pieces honoring this Southern statesman actually \nappeared in a newspaper in Connecticut. Keith C. Burris of The Journal-\nInquirer did an excellent job of capturing the essence of this great \nman who forever changed the face of his state and our nation. His piece \nreminded me how fortunate I was to serve with Terry Sanford and to call \nhim a friend.\n  I ask that an article by Mr. Burris be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the Journal Inquirer, May 1, 1998]\n\n                    Terry Sanford, Sower and Builder\n\n                          (By Keith C. Burris)\n\n       Terry Sanford died last week at the age of 80. The New York \n     Times and other august publications noted his extraordinary \n     accomplishments: a Bronze Star and Purple Heart for \n     paratrooping into the Battle of the Bulge during World War \n     II; governor of North Carolina from 1961 to 1965; president \n     of Duke University from 1969 to 1985; and U.S. senator from \n     North Carolina from 1986 to 1992. But none of these facts or \n     titles quite captures the greatness or the goodness of the \n     man.\n       The greatness of the man was that, finding himself at odds \n     with the folkways of his homeland, he rose above them and \n     then changed them. It's a lot easier simply to be a rebel.\n       The goodness of Terry Sanford was that he found a way to \n     contribute wherever he was. He accepted the setbacks of his \n     life not only with grace but with valor. When one door shut, \n     he opened another, walked in, and started to build something. \n     It's a whole lot easier to sit on your resume and stew on \n     your defeats.\n       Sanford was a proud man and he had a politician's memory. \n     But his mind and his heart were as expansive as a Carolina \n     mountain vista. No matter what life dealt him, he kept on \n     trying to improve his state, region, and country.\n       As he fought his last battle--with cancer--Terry Sanford \n     was the principal fund-raiser for a new center for the arts \n     in the North Carolina ``research triangle,'' the North \n     Carolina Performing Arts Institute. He spent his last days on \n     his latest dream. His colleagues say they will need two \n     healthy men to match the dying man's energy.\n       Terry Sanford's first dream was Martin Luther King's: equal \n     opportunity, an end to Jim Crow, and an integrated society \n     where everyone is judged by the ``content of his character.''\n       In 1960 Sanford ran for governor of North Carolina on a \n     platform of racial progress and economic opportunity, making \n     good schools the core of his message. In 1998, big deal. But \n     in 1960, almost suicidal.\n       This was before the great crusades of King and the landmark \n     civil rights legislation of 1964 and 1965. Just to make \n     things a little more interesting, Sanford also endorsed John \n     F. Kennedy for president in 1960. Many people, in many parts \n     of America, knew one thing about Kennedy, and it wasn't that \n     he was young or liberal or rich; it was that he was Roman \n     Catholic. Endorsing Kennedy was not something that would help \n     Sanford carry the mountain towns.\n       But he won. And good and bad came of it.\n       The good was that Sanford was a superb governor--judged one \n     of the 10 best in the century by the people who vote on these \n     things up at Harvard. Those who are brave, and smart, and \n     prophetic in politics are seldom the ones who can keep the \n     streets clean too. But Sanford was the exception. As governor \n     he was efficient, effective, and innovative. He integrated \n     the parks; he built a community college system; he founded \n     the North Carolina School for the Arts in Winston-Salem and \n     the Governor's School for Gifted Students; he started his own \n     war on poverty before LBJ did. As Albert Hunt has written, \n     Sanford preached states' responsibilities when other \n     governors preached states' rights. And while George Wallace \n     stood in the schoolhouse door, Terry Sanford built \n     schoolhouses.\n       He also raised taxes. And for this, as well as his Southern \n     liberalism, Sanford was hated by many North Carolinians for \n     many years. Forced to leave office by a term limit in 1965, \n     he was not elected to anything again in North Carolina for \n     more than 20 years.\n       Sanford paid a huge price for his political courage. But in \n     the long run he reaped a proud harvest. In many ways Sanford \n     cut the path for the modern North Carolina: the great schools \n     and universities, the research base, the medical schools, the \n     educated and skilled work force, the social cohesion and \n     tolerance.\n\n\n                         creating the new south\n\n       Someday someone will write the modern version of W.J. \n     Cash's classic ``The Mind of the South'' and call it \n     something like ``The Rise of the New South.'' The New South \n     is not all sweetness and light. But it has provided economic \n     opportunity and education for the many, which Connecticut \n     cannot always say about itself, and it is the most racially \n     integrated and harmonious region of the nation.\n       Sanford and a few other progressive Southern governors--\n     like Leroy Collins of Florids--also paved the way for the New \n     South governors who changed the face of American politics--\n     governors like Jim Hunt, Lawton Chiles, Richard Riley, \n     Douglas Wilder, and Zel Miller. And two others: Jimmy Carter \n     and Bill Clinton.\n       What a shame that Sanford did not make it to the White \n     House--he tired in 1972 and 1976--instead of the president \n     who was crippled by his sense of morality and the president \n     who is crippled by his lack of morality. In 1972 Terry \n     Sanford's fellow Democrats in North Carolina voted not for \n     him but for George Wallace in their presidential primary.\n       The mark of the Southern progressive governor was and is \n     trashing ideology to do what works; fiscal sanity; and \n     emphasis on education. Two generations of these governors, \n     starting with Sanford, have moved the center of the \n     Democratic Party and saved it from national extinction. And \n     they have pushed politics, especially Democratic politics, \n     away from philosophy to nuts and bolts.\n       Not all of that has been good either. But when you project \n     Sanford's programs and positions in the 1960s into the 1990s, \n     you see that he was the prototype. His accomplishment as \n     president of Duke was no less important.\n       Higher learning is the Southern liberal's core value. And \n     just as Sanford was a precursor for others, Frank Porter \n     Graham was Sanford before Sanford. Graham led a generation of \n     Carolina progressives and had mixed success at the polls. But \n     his base and great accomplishment was the University of North \n     Carolina at Chapel Hill. Graham made it first-rate.\n       Sanford, who was a Chapel Hill graduate, in turn made Duke \n     first-rate. He did it through sheer energy and ambition: \n     hiring the best he could find; raising the money to afford \n     those hires; eliminating quotas; building new programs, \n     departments, and facilities; and bringing gifted and \n     controversial thinkers and writers to the campus for long and \n     short visits. Sanford was a big dreamer, but a practical one. \n     He wanted one of the state's best schools to be one of the \n     nation's best. And the dream came true. Today Duke is rated \n     one of the nation's top 10. Chapel Hill, only a few miles \n     away, is too. Their rivalry has not been bad for North \n     Carolina.\n\n\n                         the southern humanist\n\n       It is hard for Northerners and children of the 1990s to \n     comprehend the Southern liberal of the 1930s, 40s and 50s. \n     The Southern liberal had to have physical and moral courage. \n     He had to stay focused. He did not have the luxury of class \n     wars, race wars, rights talk that extends to trees and rocks, \n     and ideological fratricide. Properly, he is not called a \n     liberal\n\n[[Page S12886]]\n\n     or a progressive at all but a humanist. Terry Sanford was the \n     great Southern humanist of his generation in politics.\n       The Southern humanist never trivialized himself like the \n     Northern liberal, for two reasons. First, he was always so \n     much the underdog that he had to stay attuned to people who \n     didn't think a bit like him. This kept the Southern humanist \n     humble. Second, Southern humanism was based in gospel-\n     inspired neighborliness, as opposed to fads, modernism, and, \n     ultimately, rationalism.\n       It is also hard for the Northerner and the modern to \n     understand a guy like Sanford. What made him go?\n       It wasn't sheer ambition, because he did so much that hurt \n     his career and so much that was irrelevant to it. More than \n     one political reporter remarked that Sanford lacked the \n     ``killer instinct'' that Carter possessed and Clinton \n     possesses in spades.\n       The answer is that Sanford was a citizen--a public man in \n     the ancient Greek sense. Education and politics were one to \n     him; public life was citizenship, and it came before and \n     after office. It lasted all your life.\n       This sense of mission and duty is a much deeper thing than \n     the vanity that seeks and clings to office--any office--like \n     life's blood.\n       For a politician Sanford was wonderfully stoical. When he \n     ran for the Senate I was working in Winston-Salem as an \n     editorial writer. He came in for an endorsement interview \n     with the editorial board (an endorsement he did not receive) \n     and answered our questions for an hour or so. I thought him \n     every inch a senator--in fact, a president. But I was also \n     impressed by his lack of pretense.\n       Another writer asked him, as he was about to go: \n     ``Governor, aren't you taking a big risk? If you lose, you go \n     out as a loser and you'll be remembered as a loser.''\n       Sanford shrugged and smiled and skipped a beat as if \n     considering self-censoring and dismissing it. And then he \n     said: ``So what? Most folks don't remember you, win or lose. \n     You're just an old politician. . . . People don't remember \n     what little good I did. And that's fine. But I do, and I take \n     my satisfaction there.''\n\n\n                         the instinct to serve\n\n       Sanford did go out with a loss. His disastrous reelection \n     campaign for the Senate was sunk by a long hospital stay and \n     a roguish opponent--a former Democrat and Sanford protege--\n     who ran on the brave slogan that Sanford was too sick to \n     campaign.\n       I wrote to Sanford after that loss--just a one-liner to say \n     I was sorry. To my surprise he wrote back in his own hand. He \n     said that his defeat might be for the best. For now he'd be \n     home in North Carolina, he said, and could see his \n     grandchildren, do some teaching, and maybe pursue some \n     projects for the state--like the arts institute.\n       Yes, he did lack the killer instinct. Terry Sanford has the \n     serving instinct. It helped him to change a state, a region, \n     and a nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12885-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO VINCENT D'ACUTI ``MR. SOUTH BURLINGTON''\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ndear neighbor and lifetime friend. Vincent D'Acuti passed away on \nSeptember 23th. However, his sense of humor and his devotion to his \ncommunity will keep him in the hearts and minds of those who knew and \nloved him.\n  Often called ``Mr. South Burlington,'' Vincent served his community \nin a variety of ways. He was a selectman in South Burlington for 10 \nyears during the transition from town to city in the 1970's. While he \nwas on the board, the population doubled and numerous improvement \nprojects were undertaken. He was on the Burlington International \nAirport Commission, helped form the Burlington Boys and Girls Club, and \nwas an active member of the Kiwanis club for over fifty years. He was a \nfixture at the annual pancake breakfast and charity auction run by the \nKiwanis, served as their lieutenant governor for New England, and \nreceived a national Kiwanis award for 50 years of service.\n  He also served his country in the army, including a stint in \nNormandy. While stationed at Fort Ethan Allen in Colchester, he met his \nfuture wife, Lillian Langlois of South Burlington. After he was \ndischarged, he returned to the Burlington area to work and raise his \nfamily.\n  Vincent approached his service of both country and community with a \nsense of humor which endeared himself to everyone he met. As I read the \narticle in the September 34th edition of The Burlington Free Press, I \nwas struck at how many people mentioned this attribute. Frank Balch, a \nformer employer of Vincent said, ``He loved his life and enjoyed it to \nthe hilt. He was an unforgettable person.'' He loved to tell stories \nand most of them were about his wife and two daughters. The joy which \nVincent shared with others grew from the joy he found with his wife \ntheir daughters, Donna and Diane.\n  My wife Liz recalled a time when she was babysitting for his \nchildren. There was a huge storm, and as is typical in rural Vermont, \nthe power went out. Liz wasn't expecting Vince or Lillian to be home \nfor hours, so when she heard someone at the back door, she grabbed a \nvacuum cleaner and positioned herself by the door, ready to defend \nherself and Vince's two daughters. However, the mysterious noise she \nheard was Vince returning home early from his work as owner of the \nlocal Dairy Queen. Luckily, he said hello before my wife wacked him \nover the head with the Hoover!\n  Through his commitment to his community, his friends, and his family, \nhe showed us how one man can truly make a difference in the lives of \nothers. Through his humor and charisma he showed us all how to live \nlife to its fullest. Farewell Vincent. Your friendship meant a great \ndeal to me, and to so many others whose lives you touched.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12886-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12886-S12890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nUSDA'S INSPECTOR GENERAL REPORT DOCUMENTING MISMANAGEMENT PRACTICES IN \n                    THE FLUID MILK PROMOTION PROGRAM\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, a report issued by the Inspector \nGeneral of the U.S. Department of Agriculture raises very serious \nconcerns about the International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA), the \nMilk Industry Foundation (MIF) and the National Fluid Milk Processor \nPromotion Board (Board) in terms of the fluid milk promotion program.\n  The Inspector General (IG) report identifies: unapproved expenditures \nin violation of law, potential conflicts of interest, possible cover-up \nactivities, inaccurate financial statements, sole-source contracting, \ninadequate controls over contracting, excessive payments, failure to \nenforce contracts, property disputes over ownership of copyrights, and \nother serious violations by the Board or its agents IDFA and MIF.\n  The fluid milk promotion law contains penalties for violations \nincluding, on conviction, a fine of not more than $1,000 or \nimprisonment for not more than 1 year, or both. The law also provides \nthat ``nothing . . . shall authorize the Secretary to withhold \ninformation from a duly authorized committee or subcommittee of \nCongress.'' I serve on three committees and I have a keen interest in \nthis matter.\n  It is also a violation for funds collected under the law ``to be used \nin any manner for the purpose of influencing legislation or government \naction or policy.''\n  I will omit details, but as background note that the law allows the \nappointment of a Board which may enter into contracts, with the \napproval of the Secretary, to carry out milk promotion and research \nprograms. Funds are generated by a 20-cent per hundredweight assessment \non certain processors of milk. This assessment is imposed through an \norder which is binding on processors.\n  The Board is to ``keep minutes . . . and promptly report minutes of \neach Board meeting to the Secretary.'' The Board may pay for the \nadvertising of fluid milk if authorized by the Secretary. Programs or \nprojects can not become effective except ``on the approval of the \nSecretary.'' Also, the law provides that the Board is to ``administer \nthe order.''\n  The law does not provide for the involvement of IDFA or MIF \nspecifically. However, the Board is authorized, with approval of the \nSecretary, to enter into contracts or agreements and is authorized to \nemploy such persons as the Board considers necessary.\n  As background for those not familiar with these organizations, note \nthat IDFA's website says that ``IDFA serves as an umbrella organization \nfor three constituent groups: the Milk Industry Foundation, the \nNational Cheese Institute, and the International Ice Cream Association. \n. . .'' IDFA is an association for ``processors, manufacturers, \nmarketers, distributors and suppliers of dairy foods, including milk, \ncheese, and ice cream and frozen desserts.'' More than 800 companies \nare in IDFA. MIF has 185 member companies, the National Cheese \nInstitute has 95 member companies, and 150 companies are\n\n[[Page S12887]]\n\nmembers of the International Ice Cream Association.\n  Given the seriousness of the charges, I believe the Secretary of \nAgriculture should immediately terminate its support for the fluid milk \npromotion arrangement between the Board and MIF and IDFA, and \nimmediately begin searching for a replacement for those two \nassociations to continue fluid milk promotion efforts. I am sending a \nletter to the Secretary that contains this request and restates some of \nthe points that I am mentioning in this floor statement.\n  I believe that a lot of the violations identified by the IG could \nhave been eliminated if the Board had contracted directly with an \nadvertising agency to do the milk promotion campaign. This would have \navoided middlemen such as IDFA being able to skim money off the top in \na manner that does not efficiently implement the law.\n  I will highlight just some of the concerns raised by the Inspector \nGeneral's report. For example, it was not until three months after the \nBoard's first contract with MIF had expired, and after the IG audit was \nbegun, that the Agricultural Marketing Service of USDA approved that \ncontract. MIF and the Board even agreed that the contract would not be \neffective until approved by USDA. However, by the time it had been \napproved ``the Board had paid MIF over $3 million and MIF, in turn, had \ncontracted with an advertising firm which had spent over $123 \nmillion.''\n  The IG report continues:\n\n       Even though it did not have the authority to do so, MIF \n     entered into an agreement with a major advertising agency to \n     provide most of the Board's advertising, public relations, \n     and research.\n\n  Payments were made regarding 37 contracts which neither MIF, IDFA, \nthe Board, or AMS could find so as to provide copies to the IG.\n  Also, the IG's report says that ``the financial statement as of March \n31, 1995, and as of April 30, 1996, contained material omissions and \nquestionable statements that, in the aggregate, were significant enough \nto affect the decisions of its users, including the Secretary, members \nof the U.S. Congress, and milk processors.''\n  I want to send a clear message to the Board, to IDFA, or anyone else, \nthat Members of Congress do not like being misled. The IG report also \nnotes that the processor Board has ``allowed the payment of over $127 \nmillion in expenses that were not supported by AMS-approved \ncontracts,'' in violation of law.\n  $127 million is a lot of money but the situation is much worse. These \nfunds are being raised by a mandatory assessment of processors of 20 \ncents/cwt. Yet, IDFA has charged in letters to the Secretary that \nincreased assessments of processors will be passed through to \nconsumers. So, if IDFA is correct, these assessments were paid by \nconsumers but used to implement contracts that had not been approved.\n  I wish it were not the case that IDFA and its affiliated group, MIF, \nstrongly contend that these types of assessments on processors are \nborne by consumers.\n  The IG also called into question the ``independence of some of the \nkey contractor employees who have been assigned responsibility for \nBoard activities.'' Who are some of these key contractors? The Milk \nIndustry Foundation, the International Dairy Foods Association, \n``outside legal counsel'' and an unnamed ``Worldwide Advertising and \nPublic Relations Firm'' are key contractors.\n\n  On top of all the wrongdoing described in the Report, three key \ncontractors have in their employment persons who are registered with \nthe Congress as lobbyists. I am stunned that processor lobbyists who \noften work against the interests of dairy farmers, or support \nlitigation against the Secretary and against the interests of dairy \nfarmers, have some say over who gets this money.\n  I admit that it is natural that representatives of processors, \nwhether they are milk, peanut, sugar, or corn processors, want to buy \ninputs cheaply. However, low farm prices are not in the best interests \nof the farmers who produce those products. With just a few exceptions \nmost farm-state Senators support stronger prices for their farmers \ninstead of lower prices for their farmers.\n  Indeed, it would make most hardworking dairy farmers sick to hear the \nsalaries paid by the Board. An unnamed Board administrator had a \n``contract increased in February 1998 to $180,000 for 23 hours of work \nper week.'' That is pretty good work if you can get it, especially \nconsidering what the average dairy farmer nets in a year and how hard \nour farmers work.\n  I understand that MIF and IDFA are not registered as nonprofit \nentities. They may actually be for-profit organizations. Certainly \ntheir employees believe in big profits for themselves when you look at \ntheir salaries.\n  In a very bizarre and suspicious twist, the processor Board \ncontracted with MIF to appoint one of MIF's employees as Executive \nDirector of the Milk Processor Education Program. But the processor \nBoard was ``fully aware that MIF had no employees.'' MIF had to rely on \nIDFA for staff.\n  One of IDFA's senior employees was none other than the former head of \nthe dairy division at USDA, Charlie Shaw. One of IDFA's hired lobbyists \nwas a former high-level official at USDA, William Wasserman, now with M \n& R Associates. Another of IDFA's hired lobbyists is a former Senior \nVice President of Public Voice for Food and Health Policy, Alan \nRosenfeld. IDFA has also contributed lots of dough to Public Voice and \nPublic Voice events, as have huge food processors.\n  This is a very cozy arrangement. MIF, which is run by IDFA, sued to \nend a program that generates a lot of additional income to dairy \nfarmers in New England--the Northeast Dairy Compact. It generates this \nincome for farmers by making processors pay a stable and fair price for \nmilk. That was too much for MIF, so they sued the Secretary. This is an \nirony: MIF and IDFA oppose the Dairy Compact because of the small \npremiums assessed on dairy processors to help keep farmers in business \nand yet they support an assessment imposed on dairy processors when it \nbenefits processors.\n  To be consistent regarding assessments, MIF and IDFA would have to \noppose this program that they support. Also, Public Voice would have \nbite the IDFA hand that feeds it. But that will not happen since so \nmuch inside the beltway is based on ``show me the money.''\n  The IG found other interesting items. MIF is supposed to submit \nmonthly progress reports to the Department of Agriculture. ``MIF has \nnever submitted these reports,'' according to the IG's report. I would \nlike to know why these violations continued?\n  The IG report notes that:\n\n       It is clear that there was no meaningful competition for \n     the development and maintenance of the Board's WEB site. The \n     advertising agency assured that its subsidiary would be \n     selected as the contractor by providing insider information \n     to its subsidiary and accepting the bid proposal after the \n     due date.\n\n  I hope USDA can explain to me what this statement about ``providing \ninsider information'' means? I will ask USDA if they approved this \npayment for the WEB site. Any payments identified by the IG and in \nviolation of provisions of the law should be returned.\n  In yet another odd development, both IDFA and the Agricultural \nMarketing Service (AMS) provided the Inspector General with minutes of \nthe processors' Board meetings. However, ``there were material \ndifferences in the two sets of minutes provided.'' Here is the kicker. \nThe Board's administrator said he would reconstruct the minutes. But \nthe IG asks: ``We question how the Board's Administrator can \n`reconstruct' official minutes of Board meetings held since 1994, as he \nwas only appointed to the position in 1996.''\n  The next sentence in the IG's report is telling: ``Neither AMS nor \nthe Board ensured compliance with the [Fluid Milk Promotion] Act or the \nOrder.'' Why does Congress bother passing laws if they are just \nignored?\n  My biggest potential concern is this. IDFA officers and registered \nlobbyists get control over huge amounts of money from the assessments \nof processors under the milk order. How do they compartmentalize their \ntime? Do they work against dairy farmers' interests in terms of milk \nmarketing order reform, for example, only when those minutes are paid \nfor through dues and not assessments? When they implement or create \nstrategies to lobby against the dairy compact or Option 1A do they \npunch out on a time sheet and\n\n[[Page S12888]]\n\nstop getting paid by assessments under the order? How will we know if \nthe law was followed if the same people both lobby the Congress and \nUSDA and implement the promotion law which prohibits lobbying?\n  The law does not permit the use of any funds collected by the Board \n``in any manner for the purpose of influencing legislation or \ngovernment action or policy.''\n  Yet, IDFA is well-known for its continuing efforts to influence USDA \naction and policy. It is imperative that all IDFA contacts and phone \nconversations with USDA regarding legislation affecting the Northeast \nInterstate Dairy Compact, dairy compacts in other states, other dairy \npolicy, forward contracting, appropriations bills, and the decision of \nthe Secretary regarding Option 1B be identified.\n  IDFA's close work with Alan Rosenfeld of Public Voice, later a \nlobbyist for IDFA, on dairy issues is well known. Did any of the \nstrategy discussions with Public Voice take place while IDFA's time was \nbeing payed for by funds collected under the order? What about the \nsalary negotiations between M & R Associates and Alan Rosenfeld while \nhe was with Public Voice but trying to negotiate a job with IDFA and M \n& R Associates?\n  I will never understand how USDA could approve a contract with IDFA \nor MIF when the law specifically provides that no funds can be used to \ninfluence legislation or government action or policy.\n  Indeed, these industry associations are well known to Members of \nCongress and Hill staff because they give away truckloads of ice cream \nat the ice cream socials.\n  In light of the IG's Report, I am very concerned that money from the \nassessments under an order, used to benefit processors, may have \nsubsidized efforts to oppose over-order premiums benefiting dairy \nproducers under the dairy compact. In this event the only winners are \nthe middlemen, IDFA and MIF, and the firms making the ads. There is a \nsimple solution to this--get rid of these middlemen unless the \nSecretary can prevent all their activities trying to influence \ngovernment policy and legislation.\n  All these improper activities and violations are fully explained in \nthe IG Report. Let me present a few more of the highlights. The Report \nnotes that ``AMS allowed the Board to commit and/or expend Program \nfunds for 108 contracts, even though it had approved only 3 of these \ncontracts prior to the contracts' effective dates.'' Yet section \n1999H(c)(8) of the Fluid Milk Promotion Act requires the prior approval \nby AMS of all contracts prior to the ``expenditure of Program funds.''\n  I do not think IDFA and MIF should be above the law. Another \ninteresting point is that the ``Worldwide Advertising and Public \nRelations Agency'' that I cited earlier had spent $123 million before \nAMS approved the contract with MIF. Page 23 of the Report noted that \n``None of the $123 million paid to the advertising agency should have \nbeen paid until AMS approved the contracts.''\n  The IG says that MIF was aware that ``according to the Act and the \nOrder, no payments were permitted until AMS had approved the \ncontract.'' Did the advertising firm get lucrative contracts from IDFA, \nMIF, or their agents or members, to generate press and ads against the \nNortheast Compact which has greatly increased the income of dairy \nfarmers in New England? Was any of the money raised by the promotion \nassessments on processors included in donations to Public Voice?\n  This matter is especially troubling because the advertising campaign \nultimately developed, and the wonderful photos that were used to \npromote milk consumption, represent a great idea. This situation \nuncovered by the IG may be the classic example of unnecessary middlemen \nspoiling an otherwise good situation.\n  I support, as do I would think most of my colleagues, the advertising \ncampaign to promote milk sales. Indeed, I have supported legislation to \nrequire assessments to promote other agricultural products. I would \nlike the advertising campaign to continue but without the middlemen \ngetting their take. I did not understand why the Board can not just \ncontract with the advertising agency directly.\n  The IG report also notes that:\n\n       MIF did not fulfill its contractual responsibilities to the \n     Board by taking the steps necessary to protect the Board's \n     interest in the copyrights to the photographs. We also \n     question why the Board's legal counsel is not pursuing legal \n     action against MIF because of its failure to properly protect \n     the Board's interest in the copyrights.\n\n  On a larger front, I have been concerned with activities of IDFA, MIF \nand Public Voice for some time. MIF filed litigation in federal court \nto challenge the decision of the Secretary of Agriculture to implement \nthe Northeast Dairy Compact. In a detailed letter dated April 10, 1996, \nIDFA strongly urged USDA not to approve the Compact. At the same time, \nPublic Voice used almost the same language and expressed concerns \nidentical to those of IDFA.\n  I have previously discussed that extremely close working relationship \nbetween Alan Rosenfeld of Public Voice, now with M & R Associates who \nrepresents IDFA, and IDFA during this time period. Just a couple of \nmonths later, Mr. Rosenfeld was officially listed as a lobbyist with M \n& R Associates in a lobbyist registration form signed by William \nWasserman, formerly the consumer affairs advisor to the Secretary of \nAgriculture, but by then a hired lobbyist for IDFA.\n  For example, in a letter to Secretary Glickman dated April 26, 1996, \nAlan Rosenfeld used almost identical language as was used in a document \ncalled ``Talking Points in Opposition to the Northeast Interstate Dairy \nCompact'' produced by the Campaign for Fair Milk Prices. That Campaign \nis run by none other than William Wasserman, the registered IDFA \nlobbyist who hired Alan.\n  Fortunately, the Secretary disagreed with the IDFA-Public Voice \nviews. He decided that the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact was in \nthe compelling public interest of the compact region.\n  There is no question that the giant processors are against the \nCompact, which gives farmers a little more income and keeps them \nfarming. Most large processors are also for Option 1B, which could \nreduce the income of dairy farmers by about $1 million per day, \naccording to economists with AgriMark--that is $365 million a year.\n  The IG also concluded that the ``Board had not followed good business \npractices by competitively negotiating for contractual services.'' $123 \nmillion was given to an advertising agency ``without competition.''\n  I recognize that Kraft, IDFA, and other representatives of \nmanufacturers of milk, or their parent tobacco companies such as \nPhillip Morris, and those who receive donations from them, want farmers \nto get a low price for milk. Kraft buys milk to manufacture into \nproducts, so of course it wants a low price so it can increase its \nprofits. But at some point if a lot of farmers go out of business, \nKraft, IDFA and others might regret the harm they have caused.\n  As I said last week, I invite the public and the press to search \nFederal Election Commission records on this point and to ask groups \nsuch as Public Voice for Food and Health Policy how much money they \nreceive from tobacco companies, food processors and milk manufacturers. \nMembers of Congress have expressed a great deal of concern about the \nfalse information and misleading studies generated by the Tobacco \nInstitute.\n  The International Dairy Foods Association has pumped out a sea of \nmisinformation about the Compact and has tried to influence a lot of \nlawmakers. They have hired others to disguise the fact that their \nmisinformation campaign was funded with money from these huge \nmilk manufacturers.\n\n  Last week I provided details on these matters and listed a few of the \ngroups and the people they hired to spin the press about the Northeast \nDairy Compact in a negative way. I described some of the Lobbying \nReports that showed the money interconnection. There is no question in \nWashington that the best way to get to the truth is to follow the \nmoney. The problem is that following the money takes a lot of work.\n  Public Voice, which is funded by the International Dairy Foods \nAssociation, other food processors and IDFA members, is a good example \nof how this works.\n  Even if they all--tobacco, Kraft and Public Voice lobbyists--used the \nsame\n\n[[Page S12889]]\n\nline, the public is more likely to listen to Public Voice even if \nsomeone else wrote the script. The public might not suspect special \ninterest spinning if Public Voice made the point. Of course, if they \nare all working together the key would be to make sure no one finds \nout.\n  The best way for the public to check this out is to ask Public Voice \nfor the list of who funds them and who sponsors their events. Ask for \nthe list of food processors and tobacco companies who sponsor these \nevents and donate money. Ask Public Voice if they oppose the 20-cent \nassessments of processors that benefit IDFA and MIF? Or do they just \noppose premiums that give dairy farmers more income?\n  But, as I recently discussed, some of the truth is found in the Lobby \nReports that show who IDFA hired to represent the views of IDFA \nmembers. Yes, Public Voice got money, and one employee of Public Voice \nled the charge against the Compact and then took a job with M & R \nAssociates, one of the groups hired by IDFA to kill the Compact. Public \nVoice took money from IDFA during this time period.\n  Some officials at USDA have views similar to Alan Rosenfeld and \nWilliam Wasserman, especially those closest to the revolving door. \nThere are many firms in Washington that are used to disguise who they \nwork for so that the public can be easily misled. I would like to know \nthe names of the other clients of M & R Associates.\n  I am very concerned about these lobbying efforts to discredit the \nCompact with misinformation. The address of IDFA listed in Washington \nRepresentatives, 1997, is 1250 H. Street, Suite 900, in Washington, \nD.C. The address of the Milk Industry Foundation is the same. So is the \naddress of the National Cheese Institute. The International Ice Cream \nAssociation is also there.\n  The Agricultural Marketing Service of USDA has made a big mistake in \ngiving the Milk Industry Foundation control over millions of dollars \nraised by a mandatory 20-cents-per-hundredweight assessment on many \nfluid milk products.\n  Suppose IDFA or MIF contracted with lobbyists to handle these \noperations? IDFA or MIF could funnel lucrative contracts using these \nmandatory assessments to friends who work with them in opposing the \nCompact, even though the Compact greatly benefits dairy farmers \naccording to the federal Office of Management and Budget.\n  Even worse, when IDFA awards contracts on a basis other than \ncompetitive bidding, they could funnel money into the hands of their \nfriends who would lobby the Congress against dairy farmers. I want to \nknow the names and salaries of every lobbyist who works for or gets \nfunding from IDFA, MIF, the Cheese Institute, the Tobacco Institute, \nPhillip Morris, Kraft and the Ice Cream Association. I also want to \nknow the corporate funders of those groups--IDFA and MIF--who control \nthe funds generated by mandatory assessments. For example, Alan \nRosenfeld was hired from Public Voice to work as a lobbyist with M & R \nStrategic Services. He recently prepared a report for IDFA which was \nissued on IDFA letterhead. Since MIF and thus IDFA gets tons of money \nfrom mandatory assessments, does that free up some additional money to \npay Alan Rosenfeld to write reports attacking the Compact or additional \nmoney to pay William Wasserman to lobby against the Compact?\n  A list of the corporations that provide money to IDFA, MIF, and \nPublic Voice would probably stun most dairy farmers who are trying to \nmake a living through hard work.\n  I am going to call for an investigation of these cozy arrangements \nwith dairy lobbyists, USDA and industry front groups. These front \ngroups who oppose the interests of dairy farmers should not control \nfunds generated by mandatory assessments.\n  A few days ago in the Record I addressed issues surrounding the \nintended extension of the Northeast Interstate Compact in the omnibus \nspending bill. I am gratified that this omnibus bill contains, as did \nthe bill we already sent to the White House, such an extension in the \nprovision extending the time to finalize milk marketing order reform.\n  I am pleased that the Congress is not just going to provide \nadditional income to corn, wheat, soybean and other farmers. Those \nfarmers should be kept in business, but so should dairy farmers and the \nCompact does just that. Keeping the Compact in business until at least \nOctober 1, 1999, will greatly help dairy farmers in New England.\n  The Dairy Compact has worked as we said it would. It keeps dairy \nfarmers in business in bad times by giving them additional income. It \nalso helps stabilize farm and consumer prices for milk. I only wish \nthat all dairy farmers could get the additional income that the Compact \nbrings, but Congress so far has only consented to the Northeast \nCompact. Under the first six months of the Compact, OMB reported that \n``New England dairy farm income rose by an estimated $22-27 million. . \n. .''\n  The Interstate Dairy Compact Commission, with 26 delegates appointed \nby the six governors, is authorized to determine a ``target price''--\n$16.94/cwt in this case. Under the Compact language, which is approved \nby the six states, any state can opt-out temporarily--until a later \ndate that the state determines--or opt-in and receive that additional \nincome for producers. The Compact is voluntary; it is up to each state \nwhether to participate in any particular price regulation.\n  As I just pointed out in this respect, when prices are low the effect \nof the Compact is similar to the loan deficiency payments made under \nmarketing loan programs in that, roughly speaking, producers get the \ndifference between a ``capped'' target amount and the current price. \nWhen farm prices are high, no cash payments are made to producers under \nthe Compact.\n\n  The reason the rate of loss of dairy farms in New England is now \nunder control is that this additional income keeps their families on \nthe farm. Dairy farmers are no less deserving than corn, wheat, \nsoybean, or sorghum farmers. All farmers deserve to earn a decent \nincome for their families.\n  I mentioned that news articles have focused on how in Connecticut and \nVermont the rate of farm loss is much less than before the Compact went \ninto effect. Before the Compact, OMB reports that New England suffered \na ``20-percent decline'' in the number of farms with milk cows from \n1990 to 1996. Now this horrible rate of attrition has slowed. I have \nsupported reasonable efforts to keep family farmers in business \nthroughout our country.\n  In addition, as I pointed out last week, the rate of milk consumption \nin New England is strong compared to the rest of the nation. Dairy \nfarmers are making a decent living in New England and neighboring \nfarmers are selling milk into the region to take advantage of the \nCompact.\n  There is indeed a touch of hypocrisy in this farm crisis. Some, \nincluding some at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, see the loan \ndeficiency payments as a great solution. If prices drop below a target \nprice, the farmers get the difference between their market price and \nthis target price. If prices increase above a certain level, then the \nfarmers cannot receive this cash payment.\n  As I said last week, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact is an \nexample of this. The major benefit of the Compact is to provide income \nto farmers when milk prices are low--income is not provided to farmers \nwhen prices rise past a certain point. The amount of the payment a \nfarmer gets depends on how far milk prices are below the target price. \nYou could simply repeat those two sentences but substitute the word \n``corn,'' ``soybeans'' or ``wheat,'' or whichever commodity, for \n``milk'' and you have described how the loan deficiency payment system \nworks.\n  But try to apply this system to milk prices and many Members of \nCongress and some in the Administration see dairy farmers as \nundeserving. Dairy is a major issue for ermont since more than 70 \npercent of all farm income is from dairy. This is why the Compact is \ncrucial to us.\n  I am pleased that OMB reported that after an initial increase in \nprices at stores just as the Compact was implemented that: ``New \nEngland retail milk prices by December [the sixth month after \nimplementation] returned to the historical relationship to national \nlevels, being about $0.05 per gallon lower.'' According to recent A.C. \nNeilson Corporation marketing research data, U.S. gallon sales of fluid \nmilk are down 1.8 percent compared to one year ago. New\n\n[[Page S12890]]\n\nEngland gallon sales of fluid milk, however, have decreased by only 0.7 \npercent. National sales of fluid milk have declined 1.1 percent more \nthan New England sales of fluid milk.\n  The Connecticut Agriculture Commissioner Shirley Ferris reports, ``In \nJune of 1997, the month before the Compact took effect, the average \nretail price for a gallon of whole milk was $2.72. This June, almost a \nyear after the Compact took effect, the price for a gallon of whole \nmilk is only $2.73. And the price of a gallon of 1% milk is even less \nexpensive now than before the Compact--$.03 less per gallon than last \nJune.''\n  In order to keep farmers in business, I think most consumers would be \nwilling to pay a little more for milk. In order to keep fresh, local \nsupplies of milk I think most consumers would be willing to pay a \nlittle more to keep their local producers in business.\n  Consumers know that if enough producers are forced out of farming, \neventually milk prices could skyrocket. Countries around the world with \ninadequate numbers of dairy farmers pay huge prices for milk.\n  I am pleased that under the Compact, and as confirmed by the OMB \nstudy, it is the producers of milk, the farmers, who get the increase \nin income under the Compact. If anyone doubts that the dairy farmers in \nNew England did not get increased pay checks, someone should randomly \ncall them on the phone and see if they really got the checks. I \ncertainly have not heard complaints that the paychecks were lost in the \nmail. Even farmers in New York, which has not yet joined the Compact, \nare even getting higher paychecks.\n  They are selling milk into the region to take advantage of the \nCompact. If Wisconsin or Minnesota switched places with New York State, \nfarmers in Wisconsin and Minnesota would do the same--sell into the \nCompact region to make more income.\n  While I do not know for sure, I suspect that dairy producers in \nWisconsin and Minnesota would like more income for all their hard \nlabor. Vermont dairy farmers and neighboring New York dairy farmers \nsure do.\n  Except for this benefit for neighboring farmers living just outside \nthe Compact region, OMB reported that ``New England has little effect \non dairy markets outside its region, or on national prices or trends. . \n. . Its shipments outside the region in the form of cheese or milk are \nsmall.'' To provide some perspective, I also wanted to mention that OMB \nreports that in 1996, ``New England accounted for 2.93 percent of the \nNation's milk production and 2.9 percent of its milk cows.''\n  Corporate opponents of the Compact have tried to argue that this was \na fight between consumers and farmers. The OMB study proves that \nconsumer prices are lower in New England than the average for the rest \nof the country. So that is a false argument.\n  The fight is actually between large manufacturers of milk products--\nlarge multinational corporations--and farmers. Manufacturers of any \nproduct, not just manufacturers of cheese or ice cream, want to buy \ntheir inputs as cheaply as possible.\n  So why was there ever a concern about consumer prices increasing in \nthe Compact region? Prices should have never increased.\n  The Wall Street Journal and the New York Times discussed this in news \narticles about retail store price gouging. GAO raised the issue in 1991 \nand is looking at it now.\n  We do know that retail prices for milk are often more than double \nwhat farmers get for their milk--nationwide. Think about that.\n\n  Let's look at the time period just before the compact took effect--\nand pick Vermont as the sample state. As the Wall Street Journal \npointed out, in ``Are Grocers Getting Fat by Overcharging for Milk?'' \nbeginning in November 1996, the price that farmers got for their milk \ndropped by almost 25 percent--35 cents or so per gallon. Store prices \nstayed high, which locked in a huge benefit to stores selling to \nconsumers. Thirty-five cents a gallon is a significant increase in \nbenefits to retail stores.\n  Comparing November 1996 to June 1997, the price farmers received for \ntheir milk dropped 35 cents a gallon, and stayed low, but the prices \nthat stores charged for milk stayed about the same.\n  I have always pointed out that dairy compacts can help reduce this \nretail store price inflation by stabilizing the price that farmers get \nfor milk, thus reducing the need for stores to build in a safety \ncushion to protect themselves in case it costs more for them to \npurchase milk.\n  Without a compact, the price farmers get for their milk can vary \nsignificantly. These variations in price are passed through to stores \nby co-ops and other handlers. Yet stores prefer not to constantly \nchange prices for customers so they build in a cushion. But this huge \nprofit margin can be reduced by compacts which means that dairy \ncompacts can both save consumers money and provide more income to \nfarmers.\n  Unfortunately, the OMB study is based on very limited information \nfrom USDA. USDA only gave OMB price information from six stores in New \nEngland--and only in two cities where it was announced in press \naccounts, in advance, that retail prices would go up even though store \nand wholesaler costs had dropped 35 cents per gallon.\n  Even in light of this, OMB concluded that after six months, retail \nstore prices in the compact region of New England were five cents lower \nthan in the rest of the nation.\n  New England newspaper accounts of the implementation of the Compact \nwere very interesting. For example, the July 1, 1997, edition of the \nPortland Press Herald from Portland, Maine points out that ``Cumberland \nFarms increased the price of whole milk by four cents but dropped the \nprice of skim by a penny'' when the Compact was implemented.\n  Also, they note that ``At Hannaford's Augusta store, Hood milk--a \nbrand-name product--was selling for $2.63 a gallon, while the Hannaford \nstore brand was selling for $2.32.''\n  Also, ``Shaw's increased its price by about 20 cents a gallon in \n[parts of] the five other New England states but kept the price the \nsame here [in Maine].''\n  The June 26, 1997, Boston Globe and the June 27, Providence Journal \npointed out before the Compact was implemented that one of the chains \nsignaled a price increase. A spokesman for Shaw's Supermarkets, Bernard \nRogan, is quoted as saying that milk prices will go up next week.\n  The June 30, Boston Globe reported that, ``The region's major \nsupermarkets are raising their milk prices 20 cents a gallon, ignoring \narguments that their profit margins are big enough to absorb a new \nprice subsidy for New England dairy farmers that takes effect this \nweek.''\n  As OMB discovered after six months, this initial signaled increase \nwas subjected to competitive pressures and that consumer prices in New \nEngland came down.\n  However, even if it took a slight increase in supermarket prices to \nkeep farmers in business, I think that is worth it. If a lot of dairy \nfarmers cannot make a living then eventually dairy prices will go way \nup, just as in a number of foreign countries.\n  Also, as I pointed out recently in the Record, studies of prices \ncharged in stores in Vermont, for example, show that the most important \nfactor in the price of milk is the brand and the store. In cities and \ntowns in Vermont, the variation in price among stores was in the 50 \ncents to one dollar range. In other words, in the same town the price \nof a gallon of milk varied greatly and still does. These store \nvariations, and variations through the use of store coupons, dwarf any \npossible impact of the Compact.\n  All other food expenditures dwarf how much income consumers spend on \nfluid milk. The savings consumers can achieve through buying ``on \nsale'' or house-brand items, or through using discount coupons, far \nexceed typical changes in the price of fluid milk. Only 3 percent of \nthe average household's total expenditures on food go for fluid milk. \nThis information is from an article titled ``Food Cost Review,'' 1995, \nfrom the Economic Research Service of U.S.D.A.\n  Farmers, consumers and processors all need fair prices. Processors \nshould not have received huge profits at the expense of the other two. \nI will continue to monitor these abuses by MIF and IDFA detailed by the \nIG. I greatly appreciate the work of the Roger Viadero, the Inspector \nGeneral, on this issue and on other issues he has handled. He is doing \nan outstanding job along with his staff at USDA.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12886-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S12891]]\n      DEDICATION OF THE MICHAEL J. FITZMAURICE STATE VETERANS HOME\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, on October 2, 1998, South Dakotans \nhonored one of their veterans with the dedication of the Michael J. \nFitzmaurice State Veterans Home in Hot Springs. I believe this is a \nfitting tribute to a man who was willing to sacrifice his own life to \ndefend the lives of his friends amidst the chaos of battle.\n  Michael Fitzmaurice served in Vietnam with the 101st Airborne \nDivision at Khe Sanh. On March 13, 1971, American forces at Khe Sanh \nwere engaged by North Vietnamese troops. During the assault, North \nVietnamese sappers threw three satchel charges into a bunker defended \nby Michael and other airborne troops. Michael Fitzmaurice was able to \nthrow two of the explosive charges out of the bunker, and then showing \nno regard for his own life, used his flak jacket to smother the third \ncharge. Despite receiving severe wounds, Michael Fitzmaurice refused \nmedical attention and continued to defend the bunker from the North \nVietnamese assault. Because of his unselfish action, Michael was \nawarded the Congressional Medal of Honor for his heroism and for saving \nthe lives of his fellow soldiers.\n  Today, Michael Fitzmaurice works at the Sioux Falls Veterans Medical \nCenter after serving twenty years with the South Dakota National Guard. \nHe now lives in Hartford, South Dakota with his wife Patty and his \nchildren. The veterans home dedicated in Michael's honor will serve as \na residence for veterans who saw combat. The facility also has a \nnursing home and a place where veterans can receive needed medical \nattention.\n  From the battlefields of Lexington and Concord, to the beaches of \nNormandy, and to base camps such as Khe Sanh, our nation's history is \nreplete with individuals who, during the savagery of battle, were \nwilling to forgo their own survival not only to protect the lives of \ntheir comrades, but also to defend a people they did not know. \nAmericans should never forget these men and women who served our nation \nwith such dedication and patriotism.\n  Mr. President, I offer my congratulations and gratitude to Michael \nand his family on this profound dedication. The Michael J. Fitzmaurice \nState Veterans Home will stand not only as a testament to Michael \nFitzmaurice's bravery and leadership, but will remain a constant \nreminder of South Dakota's continued dedication in serving the needs of \nour veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12891-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RETIREMENT OF COLONEL WILLIAM L.

Mr. President, as we wind up the 105th Congress, \nI would like to commend Senator Bennett and the Special Committee on \nthe Year 2000 (Y2K) Technology Problem for their work in addressing the \ncomputer problem. The Committee has done a fine job in looking at the \nimpact of Y2K on all aspects of our critical infrastructure: the \nutilities industry, the health care sector, financial services, \ntransportation, government, and businesses. The Committee should also \nbe applauded for the role it played in formulating and passing S. 2392, \nThe Year 2000 Information and Readiness Disclosure Act. As an original \ncosponsor of this piece of legislation, I am delighted to see that the \nPresident signed it into law yesterday. This bill should help us \nameliorate the Y2K problem. I say well done to the Committee for all of \nthe work it has done in such a short amount of time.\n  Almost two and a half years ago, in the 104th Congress, I sounded the \nalarm on the computer problem. On July 31, 1996, I sent President \nClinton a letter expressing my views and concerns about Y2K. I warned \nhim of the ``extreme negative economic consequences of the Y2K Time \nBomb,'' and suggested that ``a presidential aide be appointed to take \nresponsibility for assuring that all Federal Agencies, including the \nmilitary, be Y2K compliant by January 1, 1999 [leaving a year for \n`testing'] and that all commercial and industrial firms doing business \nwith the Federal government must also be compliant by that date.''\n  January 1, 1999 is quickly approaching. Progress has been made on the \nY2K problem. The public and private sector are starting to give it the \nattention that it deserves. But much work remains to be done. As we \nhead into the 106th Congress, we must continue to work on this problem \nwith dedication and resolve.\n  Historically, the fin de siecle has caused quite a stir. Until now, \nhowever, there has been little factual basis on which doomsayers and \napocalyptic fear mongers could spread their gospel. After studying the \npotential impact of Y2K on the telecommunications industry, health \ncare, economy, and other vital sectors of our lives, I would like to \nwarn that we have cause for fear. For the failure to address the \nmillennium bug could be catastrophic.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12891-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO NEIL TILLOTSON\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, Neil Tillotson is one of those rare \nindividuals who has accomplished a great deal in his professional and \npersonal life, but has remained rooted to his origins in the Great \nNorth Woods of New Hampshire. On the occasion of his 100th Birthday \nwhich will be on December 16, 1998, I rise to salute his remarkable \nachievements.\n  Neil Tillotson's life is emblematic of New Hampshire's values of hard \nwork, independence, and community spirit. A lifelong resident of the \nNorth Country, he has been a trailblazer in the latex industry, \ninventing many new products, and for the last 67 years, he has been the \nmost prolific manufacturer of latex products in the world. Through his \nbusiness activities, he has provided jobs for many people in the North \nCountry, and products that improve the standard of living for millions \nof Americans and people around the world.\n  But his business acumen is only part of what makes Neil Tillotson \nspecial. He also holds the unique honor of being the first person to \nvote in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation Presidential primary, and \nthus, in the nation. Dixville Notch, where the Presidential primary \nvoting begins at midnight on election day, has been home to the \nTillotson family for many years, and as patriarch of Dixville Notch, \nNeil Tillotson has been the first person to cast his vote since 1960.\n  New Hampshire takes its politics seriously at all levels, from the \nschool board to the Presidential primary, and Neil Tillotson has been a \nserious player for many years. Since we don't yet have a professional \nsports team, I guess you could say politics is our state sport, and \nwithout Neil Tillotson's support, I might be sitting on the bench \nwatching, instead of playing on the field.\n  Politics runs deep in many New Hampshire towns and I think that is so \nbecause we have a strong sense of community that is expressed through \nour participation in the representative process. It has a way of \nbringing us together, and Neil Tillotson has been an example to many \npeople, prompting them to get involved in the political process.\n  Over his 100 years, Neil Tillotson has been a participant in some of \nthe great events of the 20th Century, including service in World War I \nas a member of General Pershing's cavalry and in the triumph of \ncapitalism over communism.\n  I turned 50 myself just a few years ago, and I can only hope to live \nas long and contribute as much to our state as Neil Tillotson. It is a \nrare person who lives to be 100 years old, but for someone like Neil \nTillotson, like so many other things, he makes it look easy. Neil \nTillotson is a remarkable person, and Kathy and I wish him the very \nbest on this momentous occasion.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12891-4", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S12892]]\n                        TRIBUTE TO GENE CALLAHAN\n\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, at the beginning of the 105th \ncongressional session, a close friend of mine, Gene Callahan, retired \nand moved back to our home state of Illinois. Prior to Gene's \nretirement, he served as the director of government relations for Major \nLeague Baseball here in Washington, DC. Many of you may remember Gene \nas former U.S. Senator Alan J. Dixon's (IL) chief of staff. Gene and I \nhave been in politics for many years beginning with the Illinois \nDemocratic Party and working with my predecessor here in the Senate, \nformer U.S. Senator Paul Simon when Senator Simon was the Illinois Lt. \nGovernor, some thirty years ago.\n  Gene loves the game of baseball so I thought this would be the \nperfect opportunity to wish my dear friends, Gene and Ann Callahan, the \nbest. I thought it fitting that the Callahans return to the great state \nof Illinois during this exciting baseball season and the home run chase \nbetween Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. In fact, Gene and Ann's son, Dan, \nis the head baseball coach at Southern Illinois University in \nCarbondale. I know firsthand, that Gene will stay involved with \nbaseball, and rest assured, I will call on him for political advice \nfrom time to time.\n  As the baseball season draws to a close with the World Series, I want \nto thank everyone connected with Major League Baseball for a great \nsummer. The home run chase with McGwire and Sosa was a baseball fan's \ndream. It brought a sense of what's good about America to the \nforefront. America can't wait for spring training!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12892-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          OLDER AMERICANS ACT\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today with a \nsense of disappointment and frustration that Congress is adjourning \nwithout reauthorizing the Older Americans Act. Our senior citizens \ndeserve better.\n  In January, our Nation will enter the fourth year without an \nauthorization for Older American programs which provide a multitude of \nsupport services for our Nation's elderly including: community-based \nlong-term care, transportation, legal services, adult day care, ``Meals \non Wheels'' and senior citizens centers. For our Nation's Indian \ntribes, it is the cornerstone of programs for their elderly and is the \nonly federal legislation that allows them to directly plan for the \nneeds of their elderly based on their culture and traditions.\n  My personal concern about the lack of authorization for the OAA \nprograms was heightened while traveling around my home state of \nArizona. I continually hear from seniors concerned that the OAA \nprograms are at serious risk because of Congress' failure to \nreauthorize them. They are particularly disturbed that funding for the \nprograms has not been keeping up with inflation, thereby jeopardizing \nimportant programs for the most vulnerable elderly.\n  I recognize the commitment of the Senate Subcommittee on Aging to \nproduce a reauthorization bill, but I became concerned when the \ncommittee did not produce an OAA bill by July. It became clear to me \nthat the limited time left in Congress' schedule would prevent the \ncommittee from completing their work and moving a bill through the full \nlegislative process.\n  This is why, on July 13, I introduced S. 2295, the Reauthorization of \nthe Older Americans Act. I simply could not allow another year to go by \nwithout reaffirming Congress' support and commitment to older \nAmericans.\n  This bill would reauthorize the OAA using the same language from the \n1992 reauthorization which expired in 1995. The bill would extend the \nOAA until 2001, giving the Subcommittee on Aging and Congress \nsufficient time to thoroughly evaluate these programs and reconcile \ndifferences on the reforms needed if we are to ensure the relevance of \nthe OAA, continue to meet our obligations to our current seniors, and \nbe more adequately prepared to meet the needs of future seniors.\n  Sixty-seven of my colleagues agree that Congress should reauthorize \nthe OAA this year and alleviate the fears of our Nation's senior \ncitizens who believe that these programs are in jeopardy. It is \ndisheartening that a bill with such broad bipartisan support was \nprevented from being implemented due to the objections of a small \nminority. I am confident that their concerns could have been addressed \neven as we moved forward on a short-term extension.\n  I remain committed to resolving this issue next year and will work \nwith Senators Gregg and Mikulski to develop a bill that strengthens and \nmore effectively defines the OAA programs for our Nation's elderly. It \nis imperative that we continue our efforts on behalf of older Americans \nand pass a bill which recognizes their unique needs and addressed those \nneeds by reauthorizing the programs of the Older Americans Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12892-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PIERCE J. GERETY, JR.\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nfriend and a great humanitarian--Pierce Gerety, Jr., whose life was \ntragically cut short last month when Swissair Flight 111 crashed off \nthe coast of Nova Scotia. Pierce Gerety, Jr. was a remarkable man, and \nhe will be dearly missed.\n  Pierce Gerety dedicated his entire life to humanitarian causes. The \nnephew of two priests, Pierce once aspired to enter the priesthood \nhimself. After graduating from Yale, he went to Paris to study theology \nand philosophy at the Institute Catholique, where he found time to set \nup a soup kitchen. However, he soon changed his mind about becoming a \npriest when he met his future wife Marie de la Soudiere.\n  After he was married, he and Marie went to India to work for Catholic \nRelief Services. He returned to the United States in 1968, and became a \nsocial-service case worker in New York City. He then attended Harvard \nLaw School and after graduating in 1971, he worked as a legal aid and \ncivil rights attorney. In 1980, he began his career in refugee work in \nThailand with the International Rescue Committee, and, in 1982, he went \nto work at the United Nations. He became a legal officer at the \nheadquarters of the U.N. High Commissioner in Geneva, and he eventually \nbecame a deputy director to the U.N. High Commission for Refugees, but \nhe always longed to be in the field working with those who needed help.\n  He took on a number of difficult assignments, helping refugees in \ncrisis situations in the Philippines, Pakistan, Somalia, Sudan, Congo, \nRwanda and Burundi. In fact, his colleagues have said that Pierce \nGerety put himself in more dangerous situations than any other person \nin the refugee field. When a warlord in Somalia kidnapped some \nhumanitarian aid workers, Pierce Gerety went into that warlord's armed \ncamp and negotiated their release. Last year, he and other officials \npled with the Congolese rebel leader Laurent Kabila to end the \nslaughter of Rwandan refugees.\n  It is ironic that this man, who repeatedly placed himself in harm's \nway to protect refugees around the globe, would lose his life in such a \nsenseless accident.\n  Pierce Gerety, Jr. brought an uncommon intelligence, courage, and \ndevotion to his work. He has touched the lives of countless individuals \nin a positive way. And his impact is not only felt by refugees around \nthe globe, it is felt by his many peers and friends whom he inspired to \ndo more in their own lives to help persons in need.\n  He is survived by his wife Marie and his three children Sebastian, \nPierce, and Maeve. He is also survived by his mother Helen, and his \nthree brothers Tom, Peter, and Miles. I offer my heartfelt sympathies \nto them all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12892-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12892-S12893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SECRET SERVICE SPECIAL AGENT CARL TRUSCOTT\n\n Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I'd like to take this opportunity to \nexpress my thanks and deep appreciation for the work and dedication of \nSecret Service Special Agent Carl Truscott, who was detailed to the \nCommerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary (CJS) Subcommittee on \nAppropriations during the 105th Congress.\n  Nearly two years ago, Carl joined the Subcommittee staff as a \ndetailee from the Secret Service. As a seventeen year veteran of the \nagency, and a member of three Presidential details, Carl was brought on \nto lend his extensive law enforcement expertise and knowledge to the \nappropriations process. As the lead staffer handling the appropriations \nfor the Department of Justice,\n\n[[Page S12893]]\n\nthe DEA, and the FBI, he acted as an effective liaison between myself \nand the agencies. Carl helped reconcile the needs of the Justice \nDepartment with my visions for the future of federal law enforcement, \noften working late nights to hammer out compromises that could make all \nsides happy. This was a difficult task for anyone to take on without \nprior knowledge or experience on the Hill, but Carl handled his \nresponsibilities like an old pro. I could not have developed such a \nclose relationship with the offices of the Attorney General, the FBI \nDirector, and the DEA Administrator without Carl's input and commitment \nto making the connection work.\n  Special Agent Truscott will be leaving the Hill to go back to the \nPresident's detail starting next week. I know that the Appropriations \nCommittee, the Department of Justice, and my personal staff will all \nmiss Carl's presence in the appropriations process next year. It was a \npleasure working with him over the past two years and I wish him luck \nin his career in the Secret Service and in his future endeavors.\n  I'd also like to express my appreciation for the work of Dereck Orr, \nwho was detailed to Senator Hollings' CJS Subcommittee staff from the \nDepartment of Justice's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services. \nDereck has been with the CJS Subcommittee staff for the past year and \nhas contributed important input on law enforcement issues to both sides \nof the Subcommittee. He has been an asset during the long, difficult \nappropriations process this year and I join Senator Hollings in \npraising Dereck's perseverance and commitment. I wish him luck when he \nreturns to the Justice Department and look forward to working with him \nin the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12892-4", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      OECD SHIPBUILDING AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise to announce that I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in the next Congress to pass \nlegislation to implement the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement, an \ninternational agreement that will finally allow our commercial \nshipyards to compete on equal footing with those of our foreign trading \npartners.\n  With the hard work of Members both in the House and Senate, \nespecially my friend the Majority Leader, we were able to craft \nimplementing legislation that was passed and reported out of both the \nSenate Commerce Committee and the Senate Finance Committee and had the \nstrong support of the Department of Defense. If a floor vote had been \npossible this Congress, I am confident we could have passed this \nimportant legislation and the President would have signed it into law.\n  Unless we as a country are content to concede the international \ncommercial shipbuilding market to our trading partners and rely instead \nonly upon the limited and protected U.S. Jones Act market for \ncommercial shipbuilding orders, we must ratify and implement the OECD \nShipbuilding Agreement.\n  So again, I look forward next Congress to working with the Majority \nLeader, Finance Committee Chairman Roth, Commerce Committee Chairman \nMcCain, and my Democratic and Republican colleagues, including the few \nMembers who remain opposed to the Agreement, to implement the OECD \nShipbuilding Agreement for the benefit of the country and our U.S. \nentire commercial shipbuilding industry.\n Mr. LOTT. I share the sentiments of my colleagues from \nLouisiana. I am frustrated over the Senate's inability to complete this \nlegislation. Indeed, he and I have championed this bipartisan effort \nfor some years now. I will resume our joint efforts early in the next \nCongress to secure final ratification of this critical Agreement.\n  U.S. participation in the OECD Shipbuilding Agreement and the \nelimination of foreign subsidies is essential. U.S. commercial \nshipyards cannot successfully compete with the treasuries of other \nnations. Of course, our implementing legislation must also make it \nclear that our vital Jones Act interests and our national security \nprerogatives will never be compromised.\n  The implementing legislation developed in this Congress represents a \nconsensus product with input for many Senators who carefully weighted \nand balanced these important objectives of OECD. The legislation was \nreported by the Finance Committee on two separate occasions and by the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science and Transportation on yet another. It \nenjoys the strong support of both Chairman and vast majority of their \nCommittees.\n  Let me be clear: Navy ships are unequivocally exempted from coverage \nby this Agreement in fact this legislation gives unlimited authority of \nthe Secretary of Defense to exempt from coverage of any other vessels \ndeemed necessary for national security purposes.\n  Similarly, extraordinary steps were taken to protect our Jones Act. \nThat is why this legislation received the strong endorsement from the \nvast majority of the Jones Act shipbuilding and ship operating \ncompanies.\n  On a final note, I hope our OECD Shipbuilding Agreement parties will \ntake note of my intention and commitment to move this legislation early \nnext before taking any action on their own which might forever \ncompromise this historic opportunity to rationalize the global \nshipbuilding market.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12893-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12893]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HONORING VETERANS\n\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I would like to speak for a moment on \nthe importance of our veterans and their service to this nation. As you \nknow, November 11th is Veterans Day, the day we honor those who have \nserved in the United States Armed Forces.\n  For over two hundred years, the democratic form of government that so \nmany of us take for granted has survived and prospered in an \nincreasingly dangerous world. The fulfillment of our Declaration of \nIndependence's tenets of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness \nwas achieved through the genius and drive of our main resource--our \ncitizens. But that genius and drive could never have occurred without \nthe sacrifice and security provided by those who bore the brunt of our \ndefenses and even gave their lives to this cause. From the early days \nof our isolated republic to today's challenges as a global leader, this \ncountry has trusted and relied on the unwavering protection provided by \nour men and women in military uniform.\n  Veterans Day provides us an opportunity to reflect upon and recognize \nthose who have served in the world's finest military. We will honor \nthose who have fought in wartime and protected our nation in peacetime; \nthose who have served on the battlefields of the world and in the \ncommunities that make up this vast and prosperous nation. As Abraham \nLincoln so eloquently articulated in his Gettysburg Address, it is our \nsolemn obligation ``to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which \nthey who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced . . . and that \ngovernment of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not \nperish from the earth.'' We should remember these powerful words and \ncontinue to do the best that we are able to meet the expectations of \nthose who have guaranteed our freedom.\n  I have long been impressed with so many veterans' commitment to \npublic affairs long after their military service. My frequent meetings \nwith veterans in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania reinforces my view \nthat they are America's finest citizens whose duty did not end with \nactive military service. They remain continued supporters and activists \nin reminding the U.S. Congress and, indeed, the American people of the \nneed for a strong national defense. It is this lifetime commitment to \nservice that should be recognized on Veterans Day.\n  Since the Senate is not expected to be in session on Veterans Day, I \nwould like to extend my appreciation to all veterans of the United \nStates Armed Forces. To quote Abraham Lincoln again, during his second \nInaugural Address he said, ``let us strive on to finish the work we are \nin; . . . to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his \nwidow, and his orphan. . . .'' November 11th will be a day of \nrecognition to the service of America's 25 million veterans. I am \ncertain that my colleagues will join me in thanking all veterans for \ntheir remarkable legacy of commitment to honor, duty, and \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12893-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12893-S12894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO CARL TRUSCOTT\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to honor and thank an individual who has\n\n[[Page S12894]]\n\nbeen a tremendous asset to the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations \nSubcommittee for the last two years. That individual is Carl Truscott, \na United States Secret Service agent who has worked with Senator \nGregg's committee staff in preparing the fiscal year 1998 and 1999 CJS \nAppropriations bills.\n  Carl has been responsible for making policy and fiscal \nrecommendations on the budgets of many of the Department of Justice \nprograms. He's done this with integrity, an eye for detail, and a true \nbi-partisan spirit. Paramount to Carl's disposition is his belief in \ndoing a good, thorough and fair job, which translated into him working \nclosely with my staff and the Justice Department, ensuring that \neveryone was on the same page in regard to determining what would be \nbest for the Department of Justice, for the interests of our States, \nand for the interests of our Senators, regardless on which side of the \naisle they sit.\n  I'm sure Carl is moving on to bigger and better things--and I'm also \ncertain he will earn the genuine appreciation for his hard work that he \nhas won time and again here in the Senate. Carl will be missed by this \nSubcommittee. I wish him all the best in his future endeavors, and \nthank him again for all of his excellent work for the Commerce, \nJustice, and State Subcommittee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12893-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          A TRIBUTE TO PETER J. CARRARA--THE BEST OF THE BEST\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ngood neighbor and a man who was the best of the best. His name is Peter \nJ. Carrara and he passed away suddenly on August 20th. However, he will \nbe remembered by everyone who knew him as the epitome of good humor and \noptimism. Or as co-workers put it, ``If you didn't like Peter, you \ndidn't like life.''\n  Peter was a man who loved his country and dreamed of serving the US \nNavy since he was a child. He fulfilled his dream, served with honor, \nand became a highly decorated officer. In fact, he retired in 1992 with \nthe rank of Senior Chief Yeoman on a Ballistic Missile Nuclear \nSubmarine, one of the greatest accomplishments a Navy man can achieve. \nFor his service he was awarded the National Defense Service Medal, five \nNavy Achievement medals, five Good Conduct Medals, Enlisted Submarine \nBreast Insignia, and the SSBN Deterrent Patrol Insignia. Following his \nretirement, he held several jobs, including second constable for the \nTown of Shrewsbury for the last four years of his life.\n  In addition to serving his country, Peter served his community in \nmany ways. He was a member of the Shrewsbury Community Church, Rutland \nFleet Reserve Association, American Legion Post 31, the Shrewsbury So-\nBirds, and a volunteer fireman. He would approach any situation, \nespecially challenging ones, with a calmness and strength which was \nreassuring to everyone around him. To quote his fellow town constable, \n``He could approach hostile people as if he knew the angel of God was \non his shoulder.''\n  As I read through the eulogies given and letters written about Peter, \nI was struck by how many people mentioned his kindness, caring, and \ncompassion for others. Friends praised and remembered his big heart and \ngiving spirit. For example, when he worked for UPS, he stayed late one \nChristmas Eve so families would have their presents for the next day. \nHe was devoted to his friends and family and would do anything for \nthem. When they were sick in the hospital, he would visit with them and \nbring them great comfort.\n  In fact, his ability to comfort and bring a smile to people's face \nwill be how Peter is remembered. My wife Liz said, ``You could never \nfeel down around Peter. His smile and warmth picked your spirits up and \nyou went on your way smiling.'' But the biggest tribute came from a \nchildhood friend. ``You were my hero. I really enjoyed growing up with \nyou, and today you are still my hero.''\n  Farewell, Peter. You will truly be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12894-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRECOGNITION OF THE EFFORTS OF THE PEOPLE OF MASSACHUSETTS TO ASSIST THE \n                       CHEYENNE RIVER SIOUX TRIBE\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I want to take the opportunity \ntoday to recognize the kind and generous people of western \nMassachusetts who donated exercise equipment to the Cheyenne River \nReservation community in my home state of South Dakota.\n  The participating YMCA's of Greenfield, Springfield, Holyoke, \nNorthampton and Westfield Massachusetts organized a month long drive \nthat collected 80 pieces of exercise equipment ranging from treadmills \nto exercise bikes. Robert Sunderland, Vincent Olinski, Harry Rock, \nSuzanne Walker, Stephen Clay, Kurt Kramer, and Mark St. Pierre all \nworked together to make this project a reality. Their vision, tireless \ndedication, and proactive efforts to mobilize the people of western \nMassachusetts should not go unnoticed. Additionally, I would like to \nrecognize Keith Eichenholz of my staff, a native of Greenfield \nMassachusetts himself, for recognizing the effort of these \nparticipating YMCAs, as well as the needs of Indian country in South \nDakota.\n  As my Senate colleagues know, there are nine federally recognized \ntribes in South Dakota, whose members collectively make up one of the \nlargest Native American populations in this country. At the same time, \nSouth Dakota has three of the ten poorest counties in the nation, all \nof which are within reservation boundaries. The severe poverty within \nthese reservations makes it extremely difficult to secure valuable \nresources that can be used to fight the grave health situation plaguing \nthe American Indian communities.\n  The contributions of the western Massachusetts YMCAs will help \novercome these alarming conditions. Native Americans die at younger \nages than the general population: 13 percent of Indian deaths, compared \nto 4 percent of deaths for all races, occur before age 25. Tuberculosis \nas a cause of death for Native Americans is 4 times the national \nmortality rate for this disease, and the Native American mortality rate \nfor diabetes out-paces the national average by 139 percent. \nAdditionally, a 1997 Harvard/Centers for Disease Control study on life \nexpectancy found that the lowest life expectancy in the nation for both \nmen and women, including inner city populations, exists in the Indian \npopulation and are the worst rates of any nation in the western \nhemisphere except Haiti. American health care and medical science are \nfar too advanced to allow such statistics to persist.\n  Time and time again, regular exercise has been proven effective in \nreducing the occurrence of heart disease, diabetes, and early deaths. \nThe five western Massachusetts communities will help provide the \nCheyenne River Reservation community with the opportunity for a \nhealthier lifestyle at practically no cost. Their contribution deserves \nrecognition, and I thank them for all of their help.\n  Throughout my service in Congress I have worked with Indian tribes to \nimprove the quality of life on this nation's Indian reservations. I am \nglad that I have the generous people of Greenfield, Springfield, \nHolyoke, Northampton and Westfield Massachusetts as allies is this \ncourageous effort.\n  Again, I would like to offer my sincere gratitude for their \ncollaborated effort, and wish them continued success in future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12894-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12894-S12896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 125TH BIRTHDAY OF ROSWELL, NEW MEXICO\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am proud to pay tribute to one \nof the most resilient cities in America--Roswell, New Mexico. One-\nhundred and twenty-five years ago, the Roswell Post Office opened its \ndoors and a town's identity was established. Since that time, the \nresidents of Roswell have displayed a hearty ``can-do'' attitude as \nthey adapted to the constantly evolving economic climate of the region.\n  Roswell has served as an economic and educational hub for \nsoutheastern New Mexico. It has been a center for sheep ranching, \ncattle driving, space exploration, and military aviation. Today, \nRoswell supports a thriving dairy industry and, because of its warm \nwinters and relaxed pace, it has become a popular retirement \ndestination for senior citizens across the country. Roswell is the site \nof the New Mexico Military Institute, one of the finest military \npreparatory academies in the\n\n[[Page S12895]]\n\ncountry, and many noteworthy figures such as Pat Garrett, Roy Rogers, \nRoger Stauback, and Nancy Lopez have called it their home.\n  Roswell has come a long way from its humble beginnings as a supply \npost. Throughout its history, it has exemplified the feisty optimism so \ntypical of the American spirit. Roswell's 125 years of history and \ndevelopment merits a fitting celebration and recognition. I ask that \nthe article entitled ``Roswell, Then and Now, An Overview'' which \nappeared in the August 16, 1998 Roswell Daily Record be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The article follows:\n\n             [From the Roswell Daily Record, Aug. 16, 1998]\n\n                   Roswell Then and Now: An Overview\n\n                 (By Elvis E. Fleming--City Historian)\n\n       Roswell's 125th birthday celebration actually commemorates \n     the opening of the Roswell post office Aug. 20, 1873. While \n     the settlement predated the post office by three of four \n     years, there are no records to pin down exactly when the town \n     was actually founded. It was called ``Roswell'' starting in \n     the spring of 1872, but it took a while for the name to catch \n     on.\n       Mescalero Apaches had roamed this area for a long time, but \n     the Pioneer Period in the history of Roswell and Chaves \n     County actually started when the first permanent residents, \n     who were Hispanic farmers and sheep ranchers, came about 1865 \n     to start several area settlements, including Rio Hondo--that \n     part of Roswell that today is called ``Chihuahuita.''\n       The Anglo cattlemen from Texas soon followed. Charles \n     Goodnight and Oliver Loving blazed the Goodnight-Loving Trail \n     in 1866. John Chisum soon settled down here to become the \n     ``Cattle King of the Pecos.'' By the mid-1870s, he was the \n     largest cattle producer in the United States.\n       The area around the confluence of the Rio Hondo and the \n     Pecos River made an excellent spot for cattlemen to rest \n     their herds. There was no supply post between Seven Rivers \n     and Fort Sumner, so James Patterson built a little adobe \n     trading post in what is now the 400 block of North Main \n     Street. The future Roswell was born when Van C. Smith showed \n     up about 1869 or '70 and enlarged Patterson's trading post \n     into a hotel and built a store nearby to cater to the needs \n     of drovers on the Goodnight-Loving Trail.\n       Smith identified his place with the nearby Hispanic \n     settlement of Rio Hondo. In the spring of 1872, however, he \n     decided he needed a more exact address, so he started calling \n     his place ``Roswell'' after his father. The Roswell post \n     office operated in Smith's store 125 years ago, Aug. 20, \n     1873, and he was the first postmaster. He was too much of a \n     gambler to develop the town. That job fell to Capt. Joseph C. \n     Lea, ``The Father of Roswell.''\n       The Lincoln County War was going on about the time Capt. \n     Lea arrived in 1877-78, but he pretty well kept it away from \n     Roswell. The Army sent the now famous ``Buffalo Soldiers'' to \n     protect the town. It was up to another Roswell man, Pat \n     Garrett, to become sheriff of Lincoln County, put an end to \n     the violence and hunt down Billy the Kid.\n       The Developmental Period in Roswell and Chaves County's \n     history dates from around 1890. Chaves County was created in \n     1889 and organized in 1891, the town of Roswell was \n     incorporated in 1891, and artesian water was discovered in \n     town in 1890. Also, New Mexico Military Institute was \n     established in 1891.\n       Before 1894, Roswell claimed to be farther from a railroad \n     than any other town in the United States. The arrival of the \n     Pecos Valley Railway changed that in 1894, which was an \n     important turning point in the area's history--especially \n     after it was extended to Amarillo in 1899.\n       J.J. Hagerman was the one most responsible for both \n     railroad developments. The impact of the railroad on the \n     economic expansion of the city and county cannot be \n     overstated. Many new settlers arrived, which meant new growth \n     for Roswell--the first bank, the first newspaper, many other \n     new businesses, the first schools and the first churches.\n       The Maturing Period in the history of Roswell and Chaves \n     County started around 1903 when Roswell was reincorporated as \n     a city. Over the next several years, utilities and paved \n     streets were developed. The Carnegie Library and the Roswell \n     Country Club were established. The Sisters of the Sorrowful \n     Mother came to Roswell and started St. Mary's Hospital in \n     1906.\n       New Mexico finally became a state in 1912. In preparation \n     for that, Chaves County built a new courthouse that was one \n     of the largest buildings in the Southwest and still is one of \n     the most beautiful public buildings in the state. Roswell's \n     first airport was built in 1929, and the first radio station \n     went on the air in 1931--KGFL.\n       Roswell has been connected with several world-class \n     athletes and entertainers. In the 1920s, local rancher/cowboy \n     Bob Crosby became the ``King of the Cowboys'' when he won the \n     Roosevelt Trophy for being world champion rodeo cowboy three \n     years.\n       Local musicians Louise Massey and the Westerners got their \n     start here in 1928 and went on to become big country/western \n     stars. Roy Rogers, the movies ``King of the Cowboys,'' used \n     to hang out here back in the 1930s. His first wife was a 1932 \n     graduate of Roswell High School, Arline Wilkins, whom he \n     married here in 1936. Singer/composer John Denver was born at \n     St. Mary's Hospital in Roswell in 1943.\n       Clear skies and wide open spaces attracted Dr. Robert H. \n     Goddard, the ``Father of Modern Rocketry,'' to Roswell in the \n     1930s. Here, he made man's first attempts to explore outer \n     space.\n       The Great Depression and the New Deal of the 1030s visited \n     Roswell, and there are a number of monuments to show for it. \n     For example, the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) boys built \n     Bottomless Lakes State Park--the first state park in New \n     Mexico. The Works Progress Administration (WPA) built City \n     Hall, Cahoon Park and Bitter Lake National Wildlife Refuge. \n     The WPA also built schools, DeBremond Stadium and the Roswell \n     Museum and Art Center.\n       The museum opened in 1937 and has continued to grow. One of \n     its most important collections is the Peter Hurd paintings. \n     Peter Hurd, who was born in Roswell in 1904, was the greatest \n     native son artist of New Mexico.\n       The Military Period in Roswell's history dates from the \n     early 1940s, to 1968, but Roswell has always done its part in \n     our nation's military conflicts. National Guard Battery A, \n     one of the oldest and most honored outfits in the state, had \n     gone to the border back in 1916 when Pancho Villa invaded New \n     Mexico; they also went to France in World War I, and were a \n     major part of the infamous Bataan Death March in the early \n     stages of World War II.\n       Roswell's climate brought the U.S. Army here in the early \n     1940s to establish the Roswell Army Air Field, which after \n     World War II became the home of the world's only atomic \n     warfare unit, the 509th Bomb Wing and the ``Enola Gay'' B-29 \n     bomber. The Orchard Park prisoner of war camp brought 4,800 \n     Germans, some of whom made life-time friendships here and \n     others came here to live after the war. New Mexico Military \n     Institute in every war has produced a large portion of \n     officers for the military.\n       In July 1947, Lt. Walter Haut of the Roswell Army Air Field \n     told the Roswell Daily Record--and the world--that the Army \n     had captured a flying saucer that crashed on Mac Brazel's \n     ranch near Corona, 75 miles north west of Roswell. Maj. Jesse \n     Marcel saw the wreckage and said it was not of this world, \n     but Gen. Roger Ramey insisted it was only a weather balloon!\n       You couldn't tell that to Glen Dennis and others who not \n     only saw the strange debris, but also saw some little gray \n     bodies. Apparently, the federal government has been covering \n     up the ``Roswell Incident'' story ever since. The \n     International UFO Museum and Research Center is dedicated to \n     learning the truth and has become Roswell's No. 1 tourist \n     attraction.\n       In January 1948, Roswell Army Air Field became Walker Air \n     Force Base, an important link in the Strategic Air Command. \n     In 1960 it was designated as a support base for a squadron of \n     Atlas ICBMs. A dozen missile sites were built in a 25-mile \n     radius of Walker. They were completed by the end of 1962, \n     then deactivated by March 1965.\n       The deactivation of the missile squadron was the first blow \n     to the military economy of Roswell. The main calmaity was the \n     closure of Walker, which took place June 30, 1967. Parts of \n     Roswell became ghost towns as thousands made their exodus. \n     Roswell's economy collapsed.\n       The present Industrial Period started in 1967 with the \n     conversion of Walker Air Force Base into the Roswell \n     Industrial Air Center (RIAC). The former air base has seen \n     the manufacture of many products, from fireworks, lollipops \n     and Levis jeans to mobile homes and city buses--first by \n     Transportation Manufacturing Corps and more recently by \n     NovaBUS.\n       Roswell Community College moved to the RIAC and used many \n     of the former Air Force buildings for expanded vocational and \n     academic-transfer programs, changing its name to Eastern New \n     Mexico University-Roswell. The college added several new \n     buildings over the years, and in the 1980s built a beautiful \n     new campus for the booming school.\n       An auxiliary landing strip several miles south of Walker \n     was converted to civilian use as well, first as a school for \n     retarded boys and as a minimum security prison--Roswell \n     Correctional Center--since 1978.\n       Other major economic developments in Roswell since 1967 \n     include the influx of retirees, attracted by low living costs \n     and warm weather. THe town has a continued a steady and \n     prosperous growth. Many national chains have branches in \n     Roswell, some of which have been around for a long time. \n     Numerous others have come in the 1990s, so that national \n     names are represented among the department stores, fast-food \n     restaurants and motels. The trend toward modernization of \n     business in Roswell was boosted by the opening of the Roswell \n     Mall north of town in the 1980s.\n       Over the years, several locals have achieved national fame \n     on the fields of sport: such as Tom Brookshier, Pete Jaquess, \n     Chick Smith, Nancy Lopez and the 1956 Little League World \n     Champions. Dallas Cowboys football great Roger Staubach \n     played at NMMI for a year in the early 1960s.\n       Roswell, on the 125th birthday of its post office, is a \n     city approaching 50,000 in population. There is no larger \n     city within a radius of about 200 miles, so Roswell serves as \n     a hub for southeast New Mexico. It is still small enough that \n     traffic is not a big problem; and the business, educational, \n     medical,\n\n[[Page S12896]]\n\n     legal, religious, fraternal and industrial communities \n     provide for virtually all the needs of the folks in Roswell \n     and the area.\n       The next 125 years will no doubt see similar developments--\n     growth, problems, ups and downs--as these years since 1873 \n     have witnessed. But the good folks of Roswell will be proud \n     to live here and enjoy being a part of the Land of \n     Enhancement!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12894-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VERMONT HOME HEALTH CARE\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it has been a long road to get us \nwhere we are today to a modification of the unfair Medicare home health \ninterim payment system (IPS) reimbursement that passed last year as \npart of the Balanced Budget Act (BBA). Making sure that this change was \npassed this year was not about politics but about helping those with \nthe most to lose, the seniors and disabled Americans who rely on home \nhealth care.\n  At the beginning of this year, when I discussed with my colleagues a \nproblem with the ``Medicare Home Health IPS,'' I received a lot of \nblank stares. The rising level of understanding about this problem--and \nthe rising level of support to fix it--was a commendable and effective \nteam effort on the part of home health beneficiaries and their care \ngivers. They were able to explain to their representatives in Congress \nwhy the short-term tinkering in health policy that created the IPS was \nunfair and was done with too little thought for the consequences.\n  The IPS passed last year sought to reduce overall spending on home \nhealth care by eliminating fraud, waste and abuse to preserve the \nbenefit for those who truly need it. But as Vermont providers know all \ntoo well, there were unintended consequences of this proposal that \nseverely harmed their ability to provide care to the most vulnerable \npopulations.\n  Under this faulty system, Vermont's 13 non-profit home health \nagencies predicted millions of dollars in reduced payments this year \nwhile already boasting the lowest average Medicare costs in the \ncountry. The skewed thinking behind the IPS created a system under \nwhich Vermont was punished for its low-cost, efficient provision of \nhome health care while high-cost, inefficient providers were rewarded.\n  A year ago this month, my office began to receive phone calls and \nletters from Vermont home health beneficiaries and their care givers \nwho were beginning to understand what the overwhelming impact of the \nnew IPS would be. In an effort to raise this issue to the level of \nwhere we are today, concerned senators and representatives began the \ndrum beat of highlighting this as a critical issue that must have \nrelief this year.\n  From the beginning there was a lot of reluctance by the congressional \nleadership to take up any Medicare legislation this year.\n  The home health agencies in my state were relentless in their efforts \nto continue to call attention to the fundamental unfairness of the \nMedicare IPS that punished their prudent and efficient provision of \nservice to Vermonters.\n  My staff and I met with home health officials, and we agreed early on \nthat any and all pressure that we could put on the Administration and \nother members of Congress would be critical to ensuring the ability of \nhome health care providers to meet the needs of Vermonters.\n  Several bipartisan Senate bills were introduced over the past year, \nthe first being one sponsored by Senators Kennedy, Kerry, Jeffords and \nmyself. We knew at the time that this was not the perfect answer but \nthat we needed to start a process to get the ball rolling.\n  Subsequently, several other bills were introduced which I also \ncosponsored, most notably by Senator Collins and another by Senator \nGrassley. I also joined Senator Bond in offering an amendment in the \nAppropriations Committee which we withdrew once we were assured that \nthe Republican leadership was taking this issue seriously and would \ndeal with it separately. My colleague from Vermont, Senator Jeffords, \nhas pushed hard for this solution as a member of the Finance Committee.\n  I applaud the bipartisan nature of the work to get this situation \nturned around. The beneficiaries, the agencies which serve them, and \nMembers of Congress continued to press until we found some relief from \nthe fundamental unfairness in the payment system for home health care.\n  The Omnibus Appropriations Act conference agreement passed today \nmakes necessary changes to the IPS payment system for the Medicare's \nhome health care benefit. In short, the agreement is expected to \nprovide some equity to agencies which have low-cost, low-utilization \npractices relative to other agencies by increasing the per beneficiary \nlimits. Agencies below the national median per beneficiary limit will \nhave their limit increased by one-third of the difference between their \nlimit and the national median. The agreement also delays the \nimplementation of the prospective payment system (PPS) until October 1, \n2000, and delays an across-the-board 15 percent reduction in payments \nto home health agencies until that date.\n  Like most contentious issues, this fix does not go as far as I would \nhave liked and as far as I believe efficient providers like those in \nVermont deserve. I support it however because it is better than the \nstatus quo.\n  In the longer term, we need to stop ignoring a more fundamental \nproblem. Congress needs to address the long-term health care needs of \nthe American people.\n  Stepping back to understanding why the IPS was passed last year, we \ncan see that it was in recognition of the difficulty of designing a \nmore permanent PPS for Medicare home health reimbursement, coupled with \nthe need to immediately control spending.\n  In the long term, a well-designed PPS will provide the Medicare \nprogram with the best means to control home health spending and address \nthe problems Vermont home care agencies, and other agencies around the \ncountry that are able to provide quality, low-cost care.\n  The BBA requires implementation of a PPS by agencies in FY 2000. The \nPPS would establish a fixed, predetermined payment per unit of service, \nadjusted for patient characteristics that affect the cost of care. \nUnder a well-designed PPS system, efficient providers would be \nfinancially rewarded. Conversely, inefficient ones would need to better \ncontrol their costs to remain viable. If a PPS is not properly \nimplemented, Medicare will not save money, cost-control incentives will \nat best be weak, and access to and quality of care could suffer.\n  I am committed to working with my colleagues to make sure that we \nwork steadfastly in overcoming any hurdles in developing a well-\ndesigned PPS so that we do not find ourselves in the same situation \nthat we found ourselves with the IPS.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12896-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12896-S12897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             KIRK O'DONNELL\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, two weeks ago, a number of my \ncolleagues and many members of the Washington community gathered at the \nNational Guard Museum for a memorial tribute to a highly respected and \nadmired figure in modern American political life: Kirk O'Donnell. As \nmost of my colleagues know, Kirk O'Donnell was the chief counsel to \nformer Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. and Boston Mayor Kevin White, and \nhe also served as an advisor to Mayors, Congressmen, Senators, and even \nPresidents. Tragically, Kirk O'Donnell recently died at the age of 52.\n  As a fellow Democrat, New Englander, and Irish-American, I had many \noccasions to cross paths with Kirk O'Donnell, and we eventually became \nfriends. And I have met few people in my political career who were as \ncapable and well-liked as Kirk.\n  Al Hunt of the Wall Street Journal remembered Kirk as ``one of the \nablest and most honorable people in American politics.'' Tom Oliphant \nof the Boston Globe said, ``he was arguably the best mayor Boston never \nhad. . . Kirk O'Donnell's life demonstrates that all of us can make a \ndifference and that each of us should try.''\n  In an era of growing cynicism toward politics, he made people feel \noptimistic that government could have a positive impact on people's \nlives. It is always difficult to lose someone who is clearly so \nspecial, but it is made all the more difficult by the fact that Kirk \nwas so young and had so much more to offer.\n  The afterword from the O'Donnell funeral program was Ralph Waldo \nEmerson's definition of what constitutes a successful life:\n\n\n[[Page S12897]]\n\n\n     `` . . . to win the respect of intelligent people and the \n     affection of children; to earn the appreciation of honest \n     critics and endure the betrayal of false friends; to \n     appreciate beauty; to find the best in others; to leave the \n     world a little better place than we found it, whether by a \n     healthy child, a garden patch, or a redeemed social \n     condition; to know even one life breathed easier because you \n     have lived. . . . This is to have succeeded.''\n\n  By this measure, Kirk O'Donnell led a successful life. He was a \nremarkable man, and I will truly miss his friendship.\n  Kirk O'Donnell is survived by his wife Kathryn and his two children, \nHolly and Brendan. I offer my heartfelt sympathies to them all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12896-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO DERECK ORR\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to commend and thank Dereck Orr, who worked with me and my \nappropriations staff this last year on putting together the fiscal year \n1999 Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill. Dereck came to me \nlast year as a Presidential Management Intern on detail from the \nPresident's COPS office, and proved to be a tremendous asset during \nthis difficult appropriations process.\n  If ever there was a year to learn about Congress and the \nAppropriations process, it would be this year. The Commerce, Justice, \nState subcommittee had a long three days of debate on the floor of the \nSenate in July, a month-long conference with the House of \nRepresentatives, and extension of deadline after deadline in completing \naction on our bill and the Omnibus Appropriations Act for fiscal year \n1999. Throughout this entire process, Dereck maintained poise, \nintegrity, responsibility, and unfaltering support for me and my \nappropriations staff in getting the job done. He came in weekends, \nworked late at night, and basically worked above and beyond the call of \nduty. In particular, Dereck tackled the controversy-ridden issues \nsurrounding the Census Bureau and worked with that agency and the House \nand Senate Appropriations staff on finding viable solutions for funding \nconcerns and realistic means of addressing the Bureau's policy \nconcerns. Dereck also versed himself in the Department of State title \nof our bill, making recommendations to staff during the conference on \nour bill.\n  Dereck was truly an asset and welcome addition to my committee staff \nthis last year. He came to me highly recommended by those that worked \nwith him at the Department of Justice; he lived up to those \nrecommendations and then some. Dereck is now back at COPS where they \nagain will benefit from this excellent work. We will miss him here in \nthe Senate, but certainly wish him, his wife, Kim, and their new \naddition well in all their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12897-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       GIRL'S INTERNATIONAL FORUM\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I believe it is important for \ngirls and young women to raise awareness about their concerns, and to \nwork to shape the beliefs and policies which affect girls' lives \nthroughout the world. This year, the Girl's International Forum, \nsponsored by an organization in my state, brought together fifteen \noutstanding girls from thirteen states to Seneca Falls. For three days, \nthey met and drafted the following Girl's Declaration of Sentiments. I \nwant to share their thoughtful ideas with my colleagues now.\n  I ask that the declaration be printed in the Record.\n  The declaration follows:\n\n Girl's International Forum--Girls' Declaration of Sentiments, Seneca \n                          Falls, New York 1998\n\n       Fifteen girls, ages 8-18, created a Girls' Declaration of \n     Sentiments in Seneca Falls, New York on July 16-19, 1998. The \n     girls, hailing from thirteen different states, were brought \n     to Seneca Falls by Girls International Forum, a non-profit \n     organization affiliated with New Moon Magazine for Girls.\n       Modeled after the original Declaration of Sentiments \n     developed in Seneca Falls 150 years ago by suffragists, the \n     Girls' Declaration defines an agenda for the Girls Movement, \n     just as the Declaration of 1848 defined an agenda for the \n     first wave of the Women's Movement. The Girls' Declaration \n     focuses on 8 areas of concern and proposed solutions.\n       The Girls' Declaration was unveiled at the Closing Ceremony \n     of Celebrate '98, the sesquicentennial celebration of the \n     First Women's Rights Convention, and received a standing \n     ovation. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Commission on \n     Human Rights, Nancy Rubin, accepted the Girls' Declaration on \n     behalf of the U.S. government and pledged to share the \n     document with both the Clinton administration and the United \n     Nations.\n       Girls International Forum was created in 1994 so girls \n     could help shape the policies which affect girls' lives \n     around the world. GIF's first project took place in 1995 when \n     they sent 13 U.S. girls (ages 10-17) to the United Nations \n     Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China. As the \n     largest girls delegation at the conference, GIF distributed \n     the Girls Agenda (a pamphlet of girls' issues collected from \n     girls worldwide) and raised awareness about girls' eagerness \n     to participate in setting policy that affects girls' lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12897-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12897-S12898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    Girls' Declaration of Sentiments\n\n\n                                Preamble\n\n       When, in the course of human events, girls are denied the \n     rights and respect they are entitled to, it becomes necessary \n     for girls everywhere to take action to improve their everyday \n     lives.\n       We believe that all people--women, men, girls and boys--are \n     created equal. We all have certain rights as people, and it \n     is up to all of us to make sure that these rights are \n     respected and protected. When our society doesn't recognize \n     these rights, changes must occur. Change should not be made \n     without good reason, but the state of our society compels us \n     to work for change. The rights of girls have not been \n     respected. To gain this respect, we must speak out to declare \n     our independence and explain our reasons for doing so.\n\n\n                                 SPORTS\n\n       Facts: Girls have been denied equal access to some sports, \n     positions, and resources. The little attention and \n     encouragement girls receive is frustrating. Girls have been \n     excluded from leadership roles, decreasing their capacity to \n     participate fully as athletes.\n       Solutions: Girls need to speak out. Girls can create \n     coalitions, push to be included in all sports, or create \n     their own teams. The adults in girls' lives should encourage \n     them with persistent support. Title IX should be more widely \n     recognized, enforced, and expanded in all communities.\n\n\n                           MEDIA/SELF-ESTEEM\n\n       Facts: Girls feel they must fit into an image the media has \n     created. When they don't, they often lose their self-esteem. \n     This loss causes many girls to be more vulnerable to peer \n     pressure which can lead to substance abuse, eating disorders, \n     teenage sex, pregnancy, and other problems.\n       Solutions: The media should promote the beauty of all girls \n     regardless of size, shape, or ethnicity. Girls should take \n     the initiative to be healthier, think positively about \n     themselves, and look for the good things in life. Girls can \n     find support from people in similar situations, mentors, and \n     youth organizations. Girls must take action by forming \n     groups, writing letters, and protesting against the media's \n     distorted images of girls.\n\n\n                               EMPLOYMENT\n\n       Facts: Girls and women have the right to physically \n     demanding or mentally challenging jobs if they choose. They \n     have the right to earn 100 percent of what boys and men earn. \n     Girls and women have the right to a combination of family and \n     career. They have the right to be hired based on \n     capabilities, not on appearance. Girls have the right to work \n     comfortably without fearing sexual harassment.\n       Solution: To accomplish these goals, girls must stand up \n     for themselves. They should help each other understand the \n     problems they face. Girls should stay positive and strong \n     while fighting this peaceful battle for equality.\n\n\n                                VIOLENCE\n\n       Facts: Violence and abuse occur everywhere in this nation, \n     limiting girls' independence to fully explore the world \n     around them. Sexual harassment and other kinds of abuse \n     happen in schools and in some families, lowering the self-\n     esteem of the abused or the threatened.\n       Solutions: Girls and their communities should make sure \n     that social services and police are accessible and available, \n     and that all people know how to reach them. The federal \n     government should create a national toll-free hotline that \n     includes teenagers who have experienced these issues.\n\n\n                               EDUCATION\n\n       Facts: The educational system focuses on men. Not seeing \n     women in leadership positions in history books and in schools \n     gives girls the impression that women are not able to lead as \n     well as men. In school, many teachers and counselors fail to \n     encourage girls to take non-traditional classes such as high-\n     level math and science classes, weightlifting, auto \n     mechanics, and others. When they do take those classes, girls \n     are often ridiculed for enrolling. Boys are allowed to be \n     outspoken in class, while girls are expected to be quiet and \n     self-controlled, leading girls to believe that what they \n     think or say does not matter.\n       Solutions: Girls should communicate with teachers, \n     counselors, parents, and others about their educational \n     rights. If this approach fails, girls must write out their \n     concerns and present them to higher authorities such as \n     principals, school boards, superintendents, or state \n     departments of education.\n\n\n                                RELIGION\n\n       Facts: Many religions teach girls during childhood that \n     only men are meant to be\n\n[[Page S12898]]\n\n     ministers, priests, rabbis, and leaders of congregations. \n     Boys and men are able to participate more fully and are \n     celebrated more often in many religions.\n       Solutions: Girls must challenge their religions and \n     question the limits on their participation. Girls must \n     examine their own beliefs to make sure that what they believe \n     in is what they stand up for. Society should not assume that \n     God has a specific gender.\n\n\n                                PARENTS\n\n       Facts: Most parents are overprotective of their daughters \n     because of problems like rape and kidnapping, but parents \n     don't object to their sons staying out late. Parents often \n     limit girls' freedom, subconsciously using bribery as a \n     blindfold. They often give their daughters more clothes and \n     money, disguising the truth that they are limiting their \n     daughters' freedom.\n       Solutions: Parents should consider setting curfews, \n     allowance, and chores by responsibility and age, instead of \n     by gender. Girls should challenge their parents and society \n     to make their surroundings a safe place to live.\n\n\n                              STEREOTYPING\n\n       Facts: Society generates stereotypes about girls that \n     categorize, suppress, pressure and make assumptions based on \n     girls' past traditions. Examples of stereotypes that narrow \n     how girls define themselves include the assumptions that \n     girls should dress a certain way, look pretty, and be quiet, \n     feminine, and pure. Girls have the right to be considered \n     physically equal to boys. They have the right to be strong \n     individuals and still be considered feminine.\n       Solutions: Girls must define their behavior and appearance \n     according to their personal beliefs and preferences. Society \n     must support and encourage girls' definitions of themselves.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       In essence, girls look forward to respect, equality, good-\n     paying jobs, and full participation in sports. Our hopes and \n     dreams for the future are for girls and women to succeed in \n     society and to accomplish the goals they set for themselves \n     and for future generations. We hold the hope that girls are \n     fully accepted by society in the near future.\n       On behalf of Girls International Forum, we would like to \n     give thanks to our first foremothers: Elizabeth Cady Stanton, \n     Susan B. Anthony, Sojourner Truth and Lucretia Mott. If \n     today's society would encourage leadership in young girls and \n     women we will have a strong tomorrow.\n       Signed by Girls International Forum, Seneca Falls, New York \n     July 19, 1998.\n\n       Morgan Kremers, 14, Leah Rodriguez 18, Gaylene Fred, 14, \n     Meredith Turner-Woolley, 13, Martha Fernandez, 16, Paloma \n     Reyes, 16, Mariya Ho, 11, Jamie E.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to our \nformer colleague, Bill Gradison. Bill served as a highly respected \nmember of the House of Representatives from Ohio from his election in \nNovember 1974 until his retirement from the House of Representatives on \nJanuary 31, 1993. I personally was fortunate to serve with Bill in the \nHouse for eight years. As many of my colleagues know, at the end of the \nyear Bill will be stepping down from his presidency at the Health \nInsurance Association of America (HIAA), where he has served with great \ndistinction for the past 6 years.\n  During his years at HIAA, Bill demonstrated the same knowledge, \ncommitment and skills that he did when he served in Congress. Bill \nGradison is truly an expert in health care policy. And he has worked \ndiligently over the past few years to improve the nation's health care \nsystem and the health of the American people. Equally important, he did \nso at all times with great thoughtfulness and by truly being a \ngentleman.\n  In Bill's 18 years representing Ohio in the House of Representatives, \nhe had a strong influence on many areas, including health care, the \nbudget, taxes, social security, trade, and governmental self \ndiscipline.\n  Of all the issues which he studied and tackled, though, he found \nhealth care to be particularly absorbing and challenging. In Congress \nand out, Bill has worked tirelessly to ensure that all Americans have \naccess to health care that is both high quality and reasonable in cost.\n  In Congress, Bill worked enthusiastically to promote hospice care, an \ninnovative, compassionate approach to caring for the terminally ill and \ntheir families. In 1982, legislation which he sponsored with then \nRepresentative Leon Panetta to allow hospices to provide care under the \nMedicare program, was enacted. Over the years, Bill sponsored numerous \nother hospice-related measures that received strong bipartisan support \nand were subsequently enacted. Today, this humanitarian yet cost \neffective end of life care is widely accepted.\n  One of Bill's most significant non-health Congressional achievements \nwas indexing income tax brackets and the standard deduction for \ninflation. Bill also was a major participant in developing the 1983 \nsocial security measures that restored the system, then teetering on \nbankruptcy, to solvency.\n  Mr. Speaker/Mr. President, I invite all my colleagues to join me in \ncongratulating Bill on his years of dedicated service to Congress and \nto the HIAA, and wishing him the best of luck in all of his future \nendeavors. I know we will continue to be enriched by Bill's \ncontributions to the health care debate and to public policy generally \nfor a long time to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12898-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12898-S12900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNOMINATION OF RICHARD PAEZ TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS IN THE \n                             NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed that the \nSenate appears likely to adjourn for the year without acting on the \nnomination of Richard Paez to the United States Court of Appeals in the \nNinth Circuit. The nomination has been pending--incredibly--for almost \nthree years.\n  I am very proud to say I have supported Judge Paez for over five \nyears. I first had the pleasure of recommending Judge Paez to the \nPresident in August of 1993 for the U.S. District Court in the Central \nDistrict of California, where he currently presides. I introduced him \nat his hearing for the District Court seat in 1994, and was so proud \nthat the Senate confirmed him that same year.\n  Judge Paez' confirmation that day was a historic moment. Judge Paez \nbecame the first Mexican American to serve as a federal trial judge in \nLos Angeles. He has been serving with distinction since, and continues \nto be widely respected.\n  Concerned that Judge Paez' nomination to the appellate court was in \ndanger of not being voted on in this Congress, I wrote a letter to the \nMajority Leader on September 3, 1998, strongly urging that he bring up \nthis nomination before the full Senate. If the Senate had voted, I am \nconfident that it would have found Judge Paez to be exceptionally well \nqualified to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals and would have \nconfirmed him once again.\n  Judge Paez' record, both on the bench as well as before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, once for his district court nomination, and twice \nfor his appellate court nomination, supports the elevation of Judge \nPaez to the U.S. Court of Appeals.\n  For 12 years, Judge Paez served on the Los Angeles Municipal Court, \nwhich is one of the largest metropolitan courts in the country. A \nrecognized leader, his colleagues elected him to serve as both \nSupervising Judge and Presiding Judge.\n  Judge Paez was elected Chair of the L.A. County Municipal Court \nJudges Association, and in 1991, he was appointed by California Supreme \nCourt Chief Justice Malcolm Lucas to the first of two terms on the \nprestigious California Judicial Council, which provides policy \ndirection to the courts, to the governor, and to the legislature, \nconcerning court practices procedures, and its administration.\n  Judge Paez is supported by Sheriff Sherman Block of Los Angeles \nCounty, and Sheldon Sloan who is a former federal judge and is the \nformer president of the Los Angeles County Bar Association.\n  Representative James Rogan of California has also written in support \nof Judge Paez. Representative Rogan was a his colleague when they both \nserved on the Municipal Court in Los Angeles County. Representative \nRogan states ``[h]is character and integrity have never been \nquestioned. He is an accomplished attorney and a respected jurist.''\n  Gil Garcetti, the District Attorney for the County of Los Angeles, \nsupports Judge Paez, and states his ``broad federal and local criminal \njustice experience is very meaningful and should favor a positive vote \nfor confirmation.''\n  James Hahn, the Los Angeles City Attorney, wrote in support of Judge \nPaez that ``his ethical standards are of\n\n[[Page S12899]]\n\nthe highest caliber and his judicial temperament makes him one of the \nmost pleasant judges to deal with.''\n  Peter Brodie, the president of the Association of the Los Angeles \nDeputy Sheriffs, a 6,000 member organization, supports Judge Paez.\n  The commissioner of the Department of California Highway Patrol says \n``Judge Paez' education, experience, and desire to serve make him \nextremely well-qualified to serve on the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals. His character and integrity are impeccable.''\n  Judge Paez was questioned about his views of Proposition 209 in \nCalifornia. On that issue, I would just cite the opinion of H. Walter \nCroskey, Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals in Los Angeles, who \nin his letter of support for Richard Paez' nomination, wrote: ``Based \non my own knowledge of his personal integrity and his long and \ndistinguished judicial career, I have no concern that Judge Paez will \never do anything other than approach each case which comes before him \non the merits and decide it in accordance with established law and \nsettled principles. You cannot ask more of any judge.''\n  Judge Paez is a federal judge who is widely acclaimed in the legal \ncommunity and is eminently qualified for the US Court of Appeals. It is \na great loss to the country and our judicial system that the Senate \nfailed to confirm his nomination.\n  I ask that these letters of support be printed in the Record.\n  The letters follow:\n\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            County of Los Angeles,\n\n\n                            Sheriff's Department Headquarters,\n\n                                 Monterey Park, CA, April 8, 1996.\n     Hon.

Paez has been nominated by \n     President Clinton to serve on the Ninth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals.\n       Judge Paez has been a United States District Judge since \n     1994. In 1981, Governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr. appointed Judge \n     Paez to the Los Angeles Municipal Court. As a member of the \n     Los Angeles Municipal Court, Judge Paez held positions of \n     Presiding Judge, Assistant Presiding Judge, and Supervising \n     Judge. He has also been a Temporary Judge in the California \n     Court of Appeal, Second Appellate District, and the Los \n     Angeles Superior Court, Law and Discovery.\n       Judge Paez is a hard working member of the legal profession \n     with impeccable character and integrity. His desire to serve \n     on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is sincere, and a \n     position for which I feel he is well-qualified.\n       Based on my knowledge of Judge Paez' dedication and \n     experience, I would like to recommend that his appointment to \n     the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals be favorably considered.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Sherman Block,\n     Sheriff.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    Law Offices of\n\n\n                                             Sheldon H.

Paez to serve on the United States Court \n     of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n       I have known Judge Paez as a lawyer, as a Municipal Court \n     Judge and as a United States District Court Judge. In each \n     endeavor, he has performed his duties with distinction. Judge \n     Paez is held in great esteem by all with whom he works, be \n     they members of the Bench or the Bar.\n       As a former Judge, and President-Elect of the Los Angeles \n     County Bar Association, I have been in a position to observe \n     Judge Paez; abilities and demeanor over an extended period of \n     time. As former Chairman of Senators (now Governor) Wilson's \n     and Seymour's Committee on Selection of Federal Judges, U.S. \n     Attorneys, and Marshals for the Central District of \n     California, I certainly believe I have gained an appreciation \n     for what kind of a combination of character, work ethic, \n     demeanor and intelligence is required to fulfill the \n     demanding position of a Judge of the Circuit Court.\n       Richard Paez is a hard working, experienced quality Judge. \n     He can be strong without being overbearing, and he can be \n     compassionate without being soft. He has been, and will \n     continue to be, a credit to the judiciary as a whole. I \n     recommend him without reservation.\n       Let us hope and pray that the President continues to send \n     us individuals of the same quality and experience as Richard \n     Paez.\n           Sincerely,\n     Sheldon H.

Paez who has been \n     nominated by President Clinton for an appointment to the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. I \n     understand that Judge Paez's nomination passed out of the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee on March 12, 1998, and his \n     nomination is currently pending confirmation on the Senate \n     floor.\n       Judge Paez and I were colleagues together when we both \n     served on the Municipal Court bench in Los Angeles County. As \n     you are aware from his nomination hearings before your \n     committee, Judge Paez has many fine qualities and impressive \n     credentials. His character and integrity have never been \n     questioned. He is an accomplished attorney and a respected \n     jurist.\n       Please give Judge Paez's nomination every possible \n     consideration as the Senate deliberates scheduling judicial \n     nominees on the Senate floor.\n       With best personal regards, I remain,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   James E.

Paez has informed me that his nomination to the \n     Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is pending consideration and \n     vote by the United States Senate. I am writing to convey my \n     support for Judge Paez' appointment to the Ninth Circuit.\n       Judge Paez possesses an impressive record of service as a \n     judge in both civil and criminal matters. While the Los \n     Angeles Municipal Court presiding judge, he was instrumental \n     in instituting a program to reduce the delay in processing \n     cases through the court system. During his 17-year tenure on \n     the bench, he has served on innumerable committees to improve \n     the judicial system in Los Angeles. Though my staff has only \n     had experience with him as a Municipal Court judge, handling \n     felony preliminary hearings, he was viewed then as a hard-\n     working, good judge who took his job seriously and treated \n     prosecutors and defense lawyers with professional courtesy.\n       But even before being appointed to the bench, Judge Paez \n     demonstrated a strong commitment to the area of public \n     interest law and to performing pro bono work on behalf of \n     many indigent persons who could not afford attorneys to \n     represent them.\n       In my view, Judge Paez' broad federal and local criminal \n     justice experience is very meaningful and should favor a \n     positive vote for confirmation.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                     Gil Garcetti,\n     District Attorney.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    City Attorney,\n\n\n                                          City of Los Angeles,\n\n                                  Los Angeles, CA, April 23, 1998.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I am writing to express my strong \n     support for the nomination of Judge Richard A. Paez to the \n     Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       As the elected City Attorney for the City of Los Angeles, I \n     am responsible for defending the City, and ultimately the \n     taxpayers, in numerous actions in both state and federal \n     courts. Attorneys from this office appear before virtually \n     every judge in those courts. As a consequence, I am aware of \n     the qualifications, abilities and performance to each of \n     those jurists. Whenever one of our cases is assigned to Judge \n     Paez, I am confident that the City will receive a fair and \n     impartial trial. His reputation as a bright, hardworking \n     judge who is committed to making the correct legal decision \n     is well deserved. In his 17 years as a judge he has \n     demonstrated a keen knowledge of the law and the ability to \n     quickly and easily grasp the factual record. Moreover, his \n     ethical standards are of the highest caliber and his judicial \n     temperament makes him one of the most pleasant judges to deal \n     with.\n       Judge Paez' experience, demonstrated abilities and \n     commitment to the law make him an excellent nominee for the \n     Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. I am confident that he would \n     serve with distinction on that court. His nomination should \n     be confirmed.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                    James K.

Dave McCloud was an outstanding \nofficer, husband and father. The nation and the Air Force lost one of \nits finest military leaders when Dave McCloud passed away. General \nMcCloud was an energetic, sincere and honest man who I considered a \ntrue friend. Like many others, I mourn Dave's passing every day.\n  I know Dave's wife Anna misses her partner and I know his son and \ndaughter, Robyn, miss their father.

Mr. President, because of a tremendous bipartisan \neffort, and the support of many of our nation's local community \nleaders, a step toward justice and fairness for Haitian refugees will \nbe taken by this Congress.\n  The effort began on November 11, 1997, and will culminate in the \npassage of this omnibus budget bill.\n  My colleagues, both in the Senate and the House deserve many thanks: \nSenator Connie Mack, Senator Kennedy, Senator Abraham, Representatives \nMeek, Conyers, Diaz-Balart and Ros-Lehtinen. The support of the White \nHouse was instrumental in reaching the final agreement to include this \nlegislation in the omnibus appropriations bill. In both chambers, with \nboth parties, the Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act gained the \nsupport needed for passage.\n  In so many instances, this legislation meant life or death for the \nrefugees who came here seeking safety from persecution. In the field \nhearing, held in Miami last December, Amnesty International stated \nunequivocally that the safety of refugees who were deported to Haiti \ncould not be guaranteed.\n  I was so appreciative, not only of the bipartisan support that this \nlegislation received, but of support that crossed national lines as \nwell. From the beginning, the Hispanic community: Fraternidad \nNicauaguense, the Bloque de Apoyo a la Unidad Nicaraguense, Unidad \nHondurena, the Cuban-American community, and others have joined \ntogether to help their Haitian brethren achieve immigration fairness.\n  The measure of this legislation's impact can best be seen through the \neyes of those individuals who were most impacted by the previous state \nof affairs. I had the opportunity, the pleasure, to meet many of them \nat our hearing in Miami. Every audience member was moved by their \ntestimony, by the personal accounts of their experiences in Haiti, and \nthe brutality that they fled.\n  I had the opportunity to meet others in this category on my trips to \nHaiti, and my visits to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Even in these harsh \nconditions, the spirit and determination of these brave individuals was \nremarkable, struggling to liberate themselves and their families from \npersecution and brutality. They are following in the tradition of \nfighters for freedom and justice worldwide.\n  Our nation has, since its foundation, served as a refuge of those \nseeking justice and safety. The evolution of our country's current \nrefugee policy is in many ways to ensure that we avoid situations, such \nas the one that developed, close to my home state, in the time leading \nup to World War II. The vessel St. Louis moored within sight of the \ncity of Miami for several days, filled with passengers of the Jewish \nfaith, fleeing the violence in Europe. Our country refused them safety. \nThe passengers returned to Europe, many of them to their certain death.\n  Since then, beginning with specific refugee legislation in the \ndecades after the war and developing into the Refugee Act of 1980, the \nUnited States of America has offered freedom and sanctuary to those \nfleeing persecution, brutality, and human rights abuses.\n  The bipartisan effort that led to the passage of the Haitian \nImmigration Fairness Act ensures that we maintain this valued tradition \nin the United States. We will treat Haitian national refugees in the \nsame manner as we have treated similarly situated individuals over the \nlast decades.\n  In relation to one aspect of the legislation, I wanted to clarify the \nintent of the section dealing with stays of deportation. The intent of \nthis legislation is that the INS would not seek to remove a qualified \nspouse or the child of a qualified alien who has applied for relief \nunder this legislation, and received a stay of deportation or removal.\n  Again, many of my colleagues in the Senate and the House deserve \nthanks for their tremendous support on this effort. It will make a \ndifference in the lives of many individuals who are a part of our \nvibrant South Florida community. They will no longer be in immigration \nlimbo, and can continue to build their part of the American \ndream.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12900-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12900-S12902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SERBIAN CRACKDOWN ON INDEPENDENT MEDIA\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to call to my \ncolleagues' attention an ominous and entirely predictable development--\nSlobodan Milosevic is closing the independent media in Serbia. He is \nfollowing the time-worn practice of dictators by trying to control \nSerbians' thinking--and therefore their politics--by controlling their \naccess to information.\n  The Senate and House have declared that we have reason to believe \nthat\n\n[[Page S12901]]\n\nMilosevic has committed war crimes, crimes against humanity and \ngenocide. While offenses like denying freedom of speech, assembly, and \nthe press to his people don't rise to that capital criminal level, they \nfurther demonstrate his fine disdain for the rules and values of the \nrest of the world, and his iron determination to hold power at all \ncosts.\n  We are treated to the spectacle of Milosevic's killers conducting \nethnic cleansing in Kosovo while he and his political allies use the \nKosovo conflict as a tool to divide and suppress Serbian domestic \npolitical opposition. The mass public demonstrations aimed at the \ncreation of democracy in Serbia have ceased. Factions joined together \nin opposition to Milosevic have been split apart, as he has appealed \nonce again to extreme nationalist Serbian sentiment.\n  Indeed, his excuse for closing these independent media outlets has \nbeen because they have been spreading ``fear, panic and defeatism'' and \nundermining ``the people's readiness to safeguard the territorial \nintegrity and sovereignty of Serbia.'' He has been so happy with the \nresults of this effort that his tame parliament, according to a report \nin the October 21, 1998 edition of the Washington Post, ``adopted a new \ninformation law today that critics say further restricts independent \nmedia and leads the country back toward dictatorship. The law bans \nbroadcasts of Serbian-language programs by foreign media and calls for \nhuge fines against media editors and owners who disobey the decree. It \nalso gives broad powers to the authorities and places further \nrestrictions on working permits for media organizations.''\n  This situation was thoroughly discussed in a Washington Post op-ed \nentitled ``Darkness Over Serbia,'' by Slobodan Pavlovic, printed in the \nTuesday, October 20, 1998 edition on page A19. I commend this article \nto my colleagues.\n  Milosevic has carefully calibrated his defiance of the rest of the \nworld. He knows, or at least thinks he knows, what it would take to \ntrigger a forceful response to his actions, and he stays just short of \nthat threshold. The terrible consequences of his determination, and the \nworld's forbearance, are clear to see in the faces of the refugees in \nKosovo and hear in the silence left by the suppressed voices of his \ndomestic opposition in Serbia.\n  Just as in Bosnia, the international community, represented by \nAmbassador Richard Holbrooke, has gone to Milosevic in Belgrade, \nlooking for peace in Kosovo. Once again, we have made Milosevic the \nindispensable man, and thereby encouraged him to remain difficult, at a \nlevel that requires our constant attention. In addition, in the process \nof seeking Milosevic's agreement to abide by the terms of a United \nNations Security Council resolution, our visiting delegations have not \nmet with the democratic opposition in Serbia. This has sent a \nregrettable message, one that we should not have sent.\n  Mr. President, while we cannot save the independent media in Serbia \nfrom Milosevic's wrath, we must let them know that we care, that we \nhave not forgotten them, that we support them, and that we understand \nthat a democratic Serbia open to the West and the world is the solution \nto lasting peace in the Balkans. I also want to express my support for \nour efforts to sustain Serbian-language broadcasting into Serbia, which \nis even more important now that independent domestic voices are stifled \nby force.\n  The people of Serbia are not enemies of the United States. The \nMilosevic regime is not just an enemy of the United States, it is an \nenemy of the world. The sooner those powers that extend, in some form, \ncomfort and support to Milosevic realize this, the sooner we can move \ntoward the establishment of peace in the Balkans.\n  It is in no power's interest that there should be lasting war, \npolitical instability, and economic depression in the Balkans. Whatever \nadvantage may be gained in the short term by diverting time, money, \nforces, and energy to coping with the results of Milosevic's unbridled \npolitical ambition can vanish quickly. If he should miscalculate or if \nany number of unpredictable events should take place, this conflict \ncould spill across international borders with incalculable \nconsequences.\n  In conclusion, while expressions of our outrage cannot reopen \nnewspapers or turn on radio or television transmitters, we can give \nhope and courage to those who believe in basic human rights. Freedom of \nspeech, assembly, and the press are essential to the creation and \nfunction of civil society. Serbia and Montenegro have promised in the \nHelsinki Accords and elsewhere to respect and protect these rights, and \nMilosevic's regime is in clear and blatant violation of these \ncommitments. I expect the United States and our allies to make clear to \nMilosevic that we know what he has done and is doing and will hold him \nresponsible for these actions.\n  I ask that an article entitled ``Milosevic Told He Hasn't Met NATO \nDemands'' be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n             [From the Associated Press, October 21, 1998]\n\n               Milosevic Told He Hasn't Met NATO Demands\n\n                             (By Tom Cohen)\n\n       Pristina, Yugoslavia, Oct. 20.--NATO's military chief \n     warned Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic today he still \n     has not met terms of an agreement to avert airstrikes.\n       U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark delivered the message to \n     Milosevic in the capital Belgrade as a new surge of violence \n     raised fears about the Oct. 12 agreement with U.S. envoy \n     Richard C. Holbrooke aimed at ending the ethnic conflict in \n     Kosovo province. Their meeting began around 6 p.m. today and \n     ended late in the evening.\n       Earlier, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin told \n     reporters in Washington that Clark would talk to the Yugoslav \n     leader ``about his failure to comply fully with the \n     requirements of the international community. And he will be \n     making very clear that NATO will use military force against \n     the Serbs if he [Milosevic] doesn't comply,'' Rubin said.\n       U.S. and NATO officials have complained that Milosevic \n     still has not withdrawn all the special police units sent to \n     Kosovo in February when he launched his crackdown against \n     ethnic Albanian separatists of the Kosovo Liberation Army.\n       The guerrillas have been fighting for independence for \n     Kosovo, a province of Yugoslavia's main republic of Serbia. \n     Ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million \n     inhabitants.\n       Under an agreement with Holbrooke, Milosevic pledged to \n     meet a series of U.N. demands--including a withdrawal of \n     special police and army units, halting the crackdown, \n     allowing international agencies to aid refugees and resuming \n     talks with ethnic Albanians on the future of the province.\n       Meanwhile, recent violence has prompted Yugoslav army \n     troops backed by Serbian police to maintain a presence. The \n     official Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said today a Serbian \n     policeman was wounded when ``terrorists'' attacked a police \n     patrol near Klina, 30 miles southwest of Pristina, the \n     capital. U.S. officials have also warned the Kosovo \n     Liberation Army to halt such attacks.\n       In Pristina, the rebels issued a statement detailing a \n     series of demands, chief among them the withdrawal of all \n     government forces from the province. In a statement to \n     Albanian-language media, rebels also demanded a halt to \n     arrests of suspected guerrillas, release of ``political \n     prisoners'' and investigations of ``crimes against \n     humanity.''\n       ``Failure to fulfill those demands will impose on [the \n     Kosovo Liberation Army] the continuation of the war for \n     freedom, independence and democracy,'' the rebels said.\n       Meanwhile, the Serbian parliament adopted a new information \n     law today that critics say further restricts independent \n     media and leads the country back toward dictatorship.\n       The law bans broadcasts of Serbian-language programs by \n     foreign media and calls for huge fines against media editors \n     and owners who disobey the decree. It also gives broad powers \n     to the authorities and places further restrictions on working \n     permits for media organizations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Oct. 20, 1998]\n\n                          Darkness Over Serbia\n\n                         (By Slobodan Pavlovic)\n\n       Fortunately, bombs did not fall on Serbia. But Serbia still \n     found itself in darkness--a media darkness characterizing \n     totalitarian regimes. A darkness that never existed even \n     during the time that we are ready today to call ``Tito's \n     dictatorship in Yugoslavia.''\n       The ruling red-black coalition in Belgrade (Slobodan \n     Milosevic's Socialists, the Communists of his wife Mira \n     Markovic and radicals led by Vojislav Seselj) has imposed a \n     sort of dictatorship in Serbia. The government order to close \n     down the leading independent dailies Nasa Borba, Dnevni \n     Telegraf and Danas, to silence a number of radio stations and \n     to ban transmission of foreign broadcasts, has created legal \n     ground for the so-called ``Information Bill,'' which was \n     urgently prepared for the Serbian assembly.\n       On the battlefield for truth in Serbia there are left two \n     privately owned tabloids, two independent news agencies and \n     the Association of the Independent Electronic Media, led by \n     the popular radio station B92. How long they will survive \n     remains to be seen. The regime is sending threatening signals \n     that, after the downing of the flagships of the independent \n     media, it will deal with all the other ``sources of the enemy \n     propaganda,'' including owners of the satellite dishes and \n     Internet providers in Serbia.\n\n[[Page S12902]]\n\n       Although Slobodan Milosevic announced last week that the \n     agreement on Kosovo reached with ambassador Richard Holbrooke \n     has eliminated immediate danger of war, the closing down of \n     the independent media is still being carried out for, \n     allegedly, spreading ``fear, panic and defeatism'' and \n     undermining ``the people's readiness to safeguard the \n     territorial integrity and sovereignty of Serbia.''\n       Milosevic's war against truth, which has been fought since \n     the beginning of the breakdown of the former Yugoslavia, has \n     continued on Kosovo. Intentions of the Belgrade despot are \n     clear: He obviously does not want the threat of the NATO \n     force he has brought to Serbia to receive media coverage at \n     home, except that provided by government propaganda. Only \n     that way can he conceal from the people who are already \n     generally brainwashed by official propaganda, the fact that \n     the agreement with Holbrooke represents no victory for Serbia \n     (as claimed by the controlled media in Belgrade) but an \n     ultimatum from the international community on the basic \n     issues of Kosovo, which could have been resolved a long time \n     ago--without war, victims, destruction, refugees and OSCE and \n     NATO verifiers.\n       The British prime minister, Tony Blair, stated a few days \n     ago that President Milosevic is deluding himself if he counts \n     on using the latest breakthrough in the Kosovo talks as \n     leverage to undermine the remaining political opponents in \n     Serbia. This message from London sounds promising, but would \n     serve even better if the free world were to confirm it by \n     taking a few concrete steps.\n       The Cold War was a war for democracy, which America won \n     without firing one single bullet. Would it not be ironic and \n     tragic that lessons in democracy are to be given now by \n     dropping NATO bombs on those still living in the times before \n     the fall of the Berlin Wall?\n       Cooperation of the Belgrade regime could be secured only by \n     threatening Milosevic with ``arguments'' from the commander \n     of NATO, Gen. Wesley Clark. However, the agreement reached \n     later (it would be a mistake to characterize it as a peace \n     agreement; at best, it is a cease-fire) does not address at \n     all the fundamental underlying problem of continuing \n     political instability in Balkans--the lack of democracy in \n     Serbia. In fact, the Kosovo agreement strengthens Milosevic's \n     authoritarian power. He will now quickly establish full \n     cooperation with international humanitarian agencies, while \n     proclaiming at home that he has done his duty in suppressing \n     the terrorist rebellion in Kosovo.\n       Friends of Serbia abroad often say that the Serbian people \n     have to start helping themselves, before anyone else can help \n     them on their road to democracy. That is true. But it is also \n     true that the United States and, generally, the international \n     community have up to now not paid the necessary attention to \n     the existing democratic alternative in Serbia, nor have they \n     offered them the necessary help required.\n       For example, in the agreement between Holbrooke and \n     Milosevic, a condition is set that within nine months free \n     and fair elections must be held in Kosovo, but it is not \n     noted anywhere that the same regular elections in Serbia \n     proper should be one of the conditions for its reentry into \n     the international institutions.\n       Equally, the Clinton administration has for some time been \n     advised to begin diplomatic isolation of President Milosevic, \n     instead of providing him with the public image of an \n     internationally recognized and respected leader. As the \n     representatives of the Serbian democratic alternative said \n     during their recent visit to Washington: ``Milosevic is the \n     problem, not the solution for Serbia.''\n       There cannot be real solutions for the problems in Kosovo \n     and Bosnia without democracy in Serbia, and there will not be \n     democracy in Serbia as long as Slobodan Milosevic is in \n     charge in Belgrade. The current media darkness over Serbia \n     confirms that said fact.\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF JAMES C. HORMEL\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am deeply saddened that the \nSenate will adjourn for the year without approving the nomination of \nJames C. Hormel to be U.S. Ambassador to Luxembourg. Mr. Hormel's \nnomination has been pending in the Senate, but it has never even been \nscheduled for debate.\n  Since James Hormel's nomination was favorably reported out of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee last year, many senators have asked \nthe Majority Leader to schedule a debate and vote. Many have recognized \nMr. Hormel's extensive knowledge of diplomacy, international relations \nand the business world, his outstanding record of service to his \ncommunity and his nation, and his leadership qualities--all of which \nmake him obviously qualified for the post to which he was nominated by \nthe President.\n  James Hormel graduated from Swathmore College and shortly thereafter \nearned his Juris Doctorate at the University of Chicago Law School. He \nserved for several years as the Dean of Students and Assistant Dean at \nthe University of Chicago Law School. Since 1984, he has presided as \nChairman of EQUIDEX, Inc., an investment firm based in San Francisco.\n  For the past 30 years, Mr. Hormel has been a dedicated \nphilanthropist, generously working to support a wide range of worthy \ncauses. For his unselfish acts of giving, he has received several \nawards and honors. In 1996, he was named Philanthropist of the Year by \nthe Golden Gate Chapter of the National Society of Fundraising \nExecutives.\n  On the local level, Mr. Hormel is an active member of the San \nFrancisco community working with several important civic organizations. \nHis current projects include the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, the \nHuman Rights Campaign Foundation, the San Francisco Symphony and the \nAmerican Foundation for AIDS Research.\n  James Hormel has the necessary skills and talents to serve as an \nambassador. He is clearly qualified to represent his country in \nLuxembourg. He has as clear a record of achievement and service as any \nambassadorial nominee the Senate has ever considered.\n  But despite Mr. Hormel's impressive resume and the favorable \nrecommendation of the Foreign Relations Committee, his nomination was \nnot even given the courtesy of a debate by the full Senate. Why not? \nAny senator who questioned Mr. Hormel's qualifications to be ambassador \nto Luxembourg could have done so in a public debate on the Senate \nfloor. That is every senator's right. That is the Senate's procedure. \nThat is the Constitutional process.\n  Unfortunately, however, instead of a debate by the full Senate on the \nquestion of his nomination, Mr. Hormel himself was subjected to \nrepeated accusations in the form of ``morning business statements'' and \ncomments to the news media.\n  I can only say, Mr. President, that, in my view, the Senate failed to \ntake up the nomination of James Hormel for the sole reason that he is \ngay.\n  The Senate should have debated and voted on this nomination. If it \nhad done so, I am confident that Mr. Hormel would have been confirmed. \nBut, because of the prejudice of a few individuals, James Hormel has \nbeen denied the opportunity to serve his country in a position at which \nI believe he would have excelled and made us all proud.\n  The failure to act on the nomination of James C. Hormel will forever \nbe a blot on the record of this Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12900-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12902-S12903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE REPORT--S. 2500\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask that the following report \nby the Congressional Budget Office on S. 2500 by printed in the \nCongressional Record for the information of all Members.\n  The report follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 14, 1998.\n     Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has \n     prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 2500, a bill to \n     protect the sanctity of contracts and leases entered into by \n     surface patent holders with respect to coalbed methane gas.\n       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be \n     pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Victoria V. \n     Heid.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  June E. O'Neill,\n                                                         Director.\n       Enclosure.\n\n\n               CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE COST ESTIMATE\n\n     S. 2500--A bill to protect the sanctity of contracts and \n         leases entered into by surface patent holders with \n         respect to coalbed methane gas\n       CBO estimates that enacting S. 2500 would have no \n     significant impact on the federal budget in the next five \n     years, although it is possible that the legislation could \n     result in a loss of offsetting receipts. Because the bill \n     could affect direct spending, pay-as-you-go procedures would \n     apply. S. 2500 contains no intergovernmental or private-\n     sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform \n     Act and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal \n     governments.\n       In many parts of the west, ownership of the subsurface \n     estate is split: the coal estate, oil and gas estate, and \n     hardrock mineral estate may all be separately owned. Until \n     recently, current law has been interpreted to associate \n     coalbed methane (CBM) with the oil and gas estate. Thus, \n     royalties from CBM production are paid to the owner of the \n     oil and gas estate.\n       On July 20, 1998, the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals \n     ruled that CBM is associated with the coal estate rather than \n     the oil and gas estate. If upheld, this ruling would mean \n     that where the coal estate and the oil\n\n[[Page S12903]]\n\n     and gas estate are owned by different parties. CBM royalties \n     now being paid to the owner of the oil and gas estate would \n     instead be due to the owner of the coal estate. Where the \n     federal government owns the coal estate but not the oil and \n     gas estate, the federal government could begin collecting CBM \n     royalties; where the government owns the oil and gas estate \n     but not the coal estate, the government might have to cease \n     collecting CBM royalties. According to the Department of the \n     Interior (DOI), the former of these two cases would be common \n     and the latter case would be rare. But because the ruling by \n     the 10th Circuit Court could be appealed to the U.S. Supreme \n     Court or could be contradicted by a ruling in a different \n     circuit court of appeals, DOI will not consider collecting \n     such CBM royalties until the interpretation of current law is \n     clear.\n       S. 2500 would provide that, for any lease in effect on or \n     before enactment of the bill that allows for CBM production \n     and where the federal government retains ownership of the \n     coal estate, existing lessees would continue to pay CBM \n     royalties to nonfederal owner of the oil and gas estate.\n       For purposes of this estimate, CBO assumes that, in the \n     absence of the bill, the current situation will continue for \n     the foreseeable future--that is, the federal government will \n     not collect CBM royalties on existing leases when it owns \n     only the coal estate. Therefore, we estimate that enacting S. \n     2500 would not affect offsetting receipts from mineral \n     production and any associated payments to states over the \n     next five years. Another outcome is possible, however. If the \n     ruling of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is \n     subsequently upheld, enacting the bill could result in a loss \n     of offsetting receipts that the federal government would \n     otherwise collect for certain CBM production. CBO has little \n     information about the size of the potential losses, but they \n     could be less than $1 million or as much as several million \n     dollars a year.\n       The CBO staff contact is Victoria V. Heid. This estimate \n     was approved by Robert A. Sunshine, Deputy Assistant Director \n     for Budget Analysis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12902-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        A TRIBUTE TO SUSY SMITH\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nSusy Smith, who has served as my Legislative Director for nearly my \nentire Senate career. Her contributions to my legislative efforts have \nbeen without parallel, and she leaves with an impressive record of \nachievement and the profound respect of all who have been fortunate \nenough to work with her.\n  Susy is one of those unique people who knows how to make government \nwork for its people. Her work in the Carter administration, along with \nher more than ten years as a top level congressional aide to \nCongressman Norm Mineta, Senator Barbara Mikulski, and myself, have \nbeen a testament to both her talent and commitment to public service. \nHer quiet leadership, innate sense of judgment, and uncanny ability to \nstay on top of dozens of issues pending before the Senate made her an \nenormously valuable asset to my office.\n  Susy also possesses a deep and abiding faith in the American \npolitical process, and the role that Congress plays in our \nconstitutional system of government. She has helped me imbue my staff \nwith a sense of their duty to serve the people of California, together \nwith the knowledge that the work we do here truly makes a difference in \npeople's lives back home.\n  Susy has played a vital role in helping to pass some of my most \nimportant legislative initiatives such as the Desert Protection Act, \nthe Assault Weapons Ban, and the Breast Cancer Research Stamp Act. In \nfact, over the past 5 years, Susy has put her indelible stamp on every \npiece of legislation that came out of my office. Her hard work has paid \noff not just for the people of California, but for the entire Nation--\nin safer streets, in more money for cancer research, in better health \ncare for America's women, and in national parks that all of us can \nenjoy, to name just a few.\n  What stands out most about Susy is her wonderful ability to bring out \nthe best of everyone. Her good judgement, great sense of humor, and \nsupportive nature carried the staff through many tough battles, long \ndays, and stressful times. She is not only a sharp political strategist \nand astute policy analyst, but a terrific manager and steadying \npresence in the office. I have appreciated her professional spirit and \nhave placed much confidence in her decision making and perspective.\n  So it is with a deep sense of admiration, some sadness, and heartfelt \ngood wishes that my staff and I say goodbye to Susy, secure in the \nknowledge that she will be just as successful in all her future \nendeavors as she has been working in the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12903-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          PATIENT PROTECTIONS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to express how disappointed \nI am that the 105th Congress has failed to act on legislation to \nincrease protections for the millions of Americans whose health \ninsurance benefits are managed by health maintenance organizations \n(HMOs).\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights legislation, which was introduced by the \nDemocratic Leader, Senator Daschle, and cosponsored by me and most of \nmy Democratic colleagues, was endorsed by over 180 organizations, \nincluding the American Medical Association, the American Nurses \nAssociation, and the AARP.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights would have given protections to all 161 \nmillion privately insured Americans. It would have: Guaranteed patients \naccess to emergency room services; ensured access to specialists for \npatients with serious or chronic conditions; given women direct access \nto the OB/GYN, and allowed them to designate their OB/GYNs as primary \ncare doctors; allowed patients to appeal their insurance companies' \ndecisions to an independent reviewer and receive timely decisions that \nwould be binding on HMOs; protected doctors and nurses who advocate for \ntheir patients from being fired by an HMO; prohibit insurance companies \nfrom arbitrarily interfering with the decisions of doctors; ensured \nthat doctors be able to decide which medications their patients should \nreceive; and limited the ability of insurance companies to use \nfinancial incentives to get doctors to deny patient care.\n  It is unfortunate that the Majority Leader would not allow a vote on \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights. But this fight is not over. Americans \ncontinue to demand that their HMOs be held accountable for putting \nprofits ahead of patients. Supporters of the Patients' Bill of Rights \ncontinue to believe that doctors--not HMO accountants--should make \nmedical decisions.\n  I urge the leadership of the 106th Congress, which will convene in \nJanuary, 1999, to immediately schedule a debate and vote on the \nPatients' Bill of Rights, in order to secure basic patient protections \nfor the 60 percent of all Americans who get their health insurance \nthrough HMOs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12903-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12903-S12904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY LAW PROFESSOR RICHARD N.

Gardner)\n\n       New York.--A top priority for the Clinton administration is \n     to persuade Congress to\n\n[[Page S12904]]\n\n     pay more than $1 billion in back dues to the United Nations. \n     Failure to do so would undermine critical UN operations in \n     peacekeeping and development and further diminish U.S. \n     influence in the world organization.\n       Complicating the administration's task is a new and \n     fallacious idea, accepted by many members of Congress, that \n     America has no legal obligation to pay its UN debts.\n       Last fall the Senate Foreign Relations Committee declared \n     that the UN Charter ``in no way creates a `legal obligation' \n     '' on the U.S. Congress to provide the money to pay the dues. \n     In justification, the committee wrote: ``The United States \n     Constitution places the authority to tax United States \n     citizens and to authorize and appropriate those funds solely \n     in the power of the United States Congress.''\n       Those statements reflect a dangerous misunderstanding of \n     the relation between international and domestic law.\n       The UN Charter is a treaty that legally binds every UN \n     member. Of course, a treaty cannot override the U.S. \n     Constitution; Congress is free as a matter of domestic law to \n     violate U.S. obligations under international law.\n       But these truisms do not alter the facts: If Congress \n     exercises its constitutional right to violate a treaty, \n     America still has a legal obligation to other countries, and \n     refusal to live up to U.S. commitments can have legal \n     consequences.\n       There is no international police force to enforce \n     international law, but nations generally observe treaty \n     obligations because of a desire for reciprocity and fear of \n     reprisal.\n       In 1961, when the Soviet Union refused to pay its \n     assessments for the Congo and Middle East peacekeeping \n     operations, Republican and Democratic members of Congress \n     insisted that the United States go to the World Court to get \n     an advisory opinion that the Soviet Union had a legal \n     obligation to pay.\n       The U.S. brief to the court, in whose preparation I had a \n     part, stated: ``The General Assembly's adoption and \n     apportionment of the organization's expenses create a binding \n     legal obligation on the part of the member states to pay \n     their assessed shares.'' In 1962, the court agreed with that \n     proposition, and the General Assembly accepted it.\n       Article 19 of the UN Charter provides that a country in \n     arrears of its assessments by two full years shall lose its \n     vote in the General Assembly. The assembly, in an unfortunate \n     failure of political will, failed to apply that sanction to \n     the Soviet Union when it became applicable in 1964. \n     Nevertheless, the assembly recently has regularly applied the \n     loss-of-vote sanction.\n       We are not just dealing here with legal technicalities, but \n     with realpolitik in the best sense of the word. If nations \n     were free to treat their UN assessments as voluntary, the \n     financial basis of the organization would quickly dissolve.\n       Some Americans would not mind it if the United Nations' \n     financial support unraveled. They do not seem fully to \n     appreciate how important the United Nations' work in conflict \n     resolution, peacekeeping, sustainable development, \n     humanitarian relief and human rights can be for America.\n       If the United States has no legal obligation to live up to \n     its treaties and other international agreements, neither do \n     other countries. Then, any country would be free to violate \n     any legal commitment it has made to America, whether to open \n     its domestic market, reduce its nuclear arsenal, provide \n     basing for U.S. ships and aircraft, extradite or prosecute \n     terrorists or refrain from poisoning the global \n     environment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12903-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CARNEY J.

Mr. Campion has served \nCalifornia's Golden Gate Bridge, Highway and Transportation District \nfor 23 years with a standard of excellence that deserves our \nrecognition.\n  As a Californian, and on behalf of all Californians, I want to \npersonally thank Mr. Campion for his years of dedicated and outstanding \nservice. Over the past 14 years, as general manager of the Golden Gate \nBridge, Highway and Transportation District, Mr. Campion has been \ninstrumental in advancing numerous projects aimed at improving the \ntransportation infrastructure for California's future. His commitment \nto find better ways to serve the public was exemplified in his \nsuccessful effort to modernize and expand the District's bus transit \nand administration facility in San Rafael. It was his leadership that \nsparked the purchase and preservation of the abandoned Northwestern \nPacific Railroad right-of-way from Novato, California, north to \nWillits, California, for future transportation use. His innovative \nspirit led to many improvements of the Golden Gate Bridge and under his \nleadership the huge 50th Anniversary Celebration for the bridge was a \nroaring success. I was fortunate to have worked closely with him on a \nnumber of occasions, most recently in obtaining desperately needed \nfederal funding for a portion of the $217 million seismic retrofit of \nthe Golden Gate Bridge.\n  Mr. Campion has also served as a diplomat by managing to bridge the \npolitical gap between San Francisco and North Bay representatives on \nthe span's board. He deserves our admiration for performing his job \nsuperbly while continuing to display his commitment to best \nrepresenting the interests of Marin, San Francisco and, most of all, \nthe bridge which is a world-renowned landmark of my great state, the \nGolden Gate Bridge.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Campion's ability to function effectively and \ncreatively during his years of service are worthy of our unmeasurable \ngratitude. With Mr. Campion's retirement, the Golden Gate Bridge and \nthe citizens of my state are losing the services of a committed and \nintelligent man. I wish him all the best, and hope his retirement is as \nfulfilling as his career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12904-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12904-S12905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MEDICARE CERTIFICATION\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, for the last few years, I have been \nworking on an issue of great importance to my constituents in Flint, \nMichigan. The city of Flint is home to an outstanding medical facility, \nHurley Medical Center. A subsidiary of Hurley Medical Center owns a \nnursing home, Heartland Manor, also located in Flint. Heartland Manor \nhas applied to HCFA for Medicare certification which it has been \nattempting to do since 1994. However, Heartland Manor has been thwarted \nin this process at every turn by HCFA. I would like to lay out the \nfacts of this situation for the record.\n  On July 27, 1989, Chateau Gardens, a nursing home facility, was \nterminated from the Medicare program. On January 1, 1994, West Flint \nVillage Long Term Care Inc., a subsidiary of Hurley Foundation, \npurchased Chateau Gardens. The new owner, Hurley Medical Center, is a \nnon profit public hospital with an excellent reputation. State \nofficials requested that Hurley Medical Center take over Heartland \nManor. In taking over the facility, the entire staff and management of \nthe nursing home was changed. In 1994 Heartland Manor applied for \ncertification into the Medicare program as a new, prospective, \nprovider. Heartland Manor had never before entered into a Medicare \nparticipation agreement and had never been issued a provider number. \nHowever, HCFA chose to consider Heartland as a re-entry provider and \nHeartland was subsequently denied participation into the Medicare \nprogram based in large part on violations which HCFA carried over from \nthe previous owner. If Heartland Manor had been treated as a new \nprovider, it would have been approved and would presently be in the \nMedicare program.\n  The complaints that have been cited against Heartland Manor itself \nare typical of complaints which are lodged against many established and \nreputable nursing homes. In fact, the citations which Heartland Manor \nhas received have consistently been either deleted or reduced in their \ndetermination of scope and severity. I recently reviewed eight \ncomplaints that were levied against Heartland Manor in August. None of \nthe complaints represented a determination of a deficient facility \npractice.\n  Hurley Medical Center is planning to build a new complex that will \nbring state of the art care to an underserved area. The only barrier to \nthis undertaking is Heartland's lack of Medicare certification. Once \nHeartland Manor receives Medicare certification, Hurley plans to put \n$10 million into renovating Heartland Manor.\n  I believe that Heartland Manor deserves to be treated as a new \nprovider as was determined by Administrative Law Judge Stephen \nAhlgren's February 26, 1998 ruling. It is illogical and unconscionable \nthat HCFA is refusing to treat Heartland Manor as a new provider.\n  Mr. President, I had hoped that we could have resolved this issue in \nthe appropriations process. It was my intent to offer an amendment to \nthe Labor Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Bill \nthat would have required that HCFA consider Heartland Manor to be a new \nprovider for Medicare certification purposes. That bill never showed up \non the floor but instead was wrapped into an omnibus nonamendable \nconference report.\n\n[[Page S12905]]\n\n  I believe that it is fair and just for the community of Flint that \nHeartland Manor be treated as a new provider. Providing Heartland Manor \nwith the ability to apply as a new provider will allow the nursing home \nto receive a fair shot at Medicare certification which is all I am \nasking for.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12904-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE DUNGENESS CRAB CONSERVATION AND MANAGEMENT ACT\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today Congress passed a version of \nthe Dungeness Crab Conservation and Management Act, a bipartisan bill \nwhich I cosponsored along with Senators Murray, Gorton, and Smith. I \nwould like to particularly commend Senator Murray for her strong \nleadership on this issue. She introduced the bill earlier this year and \nworked hard to secure its passage in this Congress.\n  Dungeness crab is integral to the economies of Oregon's coastal \ncommunities. The fishery is successfully managed, from both an \nenvironmental and an economic standpoint, by the States of Oregon, \nWashington, and California. Under existing law, the Federal government \nwould have taken control of the management of Dungeness crab next year, \ncosting taxpayers hundreds of thousands of dollars. Our legislation \nprevents this from happening. This is a common sense approach: it \nextends the existing authority for the States to manage Dungeness crab \nin Federal waters and eliminates the need to develop a costly Federal \nfishery managment plan.\n  The Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, enacted \nin 1976, established regional Fishery Management Councils to develop \nFederal management plans for fisheries in need of conservation and \nmanagement in Federal waters. However, in order to meet regional needs, \nthe interpretation of this provision has traditionally been flexible, \nallowing states to manage some fisheries in Federal waters. An example \nof this flexibility is state management of the West Coast Dungeness \ncrab fishery.\n  Since the 1960's, the States of Oregon, Washington and California \nhave managed the Dungeness crab fishery in Federal waters. The three \nstates and the concerned Indian tribes have worked together to make \nsure fishermen from each state are treated fairly and the fishery \nremains biologically sound. West Coast fishermen, scientists, fishery \nmanagers, and conservation groups all agree that state management has \nbeen a success story.\n  From a conservation standpoint, state management of Dungeness crab is \neffective. The crabs are harvested in a way that ensures healthy \npopulations for the future. In addition, the problem of bycatch, or \nincidental catch of other fish species, is almost non-existent in the \ncrab fishery.\n  Under the Magnuson Act, the authority for state management of \nDungeness crab expires next year. The expiration of state authority \nwould have required the Pacific Fishery Management Council to develop a \nFederal fishery management plan in 1999. Developing this plan would \nhave consumed scant Council resources and staff time.\n  As many folks in Oregon know, management of West Coast groundfish and \nsalmon species presents huge challenges to fishery managers. The \nCouncil shouldn't be forced to divert critical resources from \ngroundfish and salmon in order to manage a species like crab, which is \ndoing fine under the existing states' plan. With the passage of this \nlegislation today, the Council can continue to focus its resources on \nthe fisheries that need special attention.\n  This bill makes common sense by taking advantage of the unique \nsituation presented by the Dungeness crab fishery. Essentially, \nCongress is agreeing with what many folks have said of this fishery: \n``if it's not broken, don't fix it.'' I am glad Congress could work \ntogether in a bipartisan fashion to pass this common-sense \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12905-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12905-S12906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE SALTON SEA RECLAMATION ACT OF 1998\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am so pleased that the 105th \nCongress has approved H.R. 3267, the Salton Sea Reclamation Act of \n1998. This legislation is an important step toward an efficient and \nresponsible restoration of the unique Salton Sea ecosystem.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced S. 1716, the Senate version of the \nSalton Sea restoration legislation. H.R. 3267 includes portions of my \nlegislation. Although it does not authorize all of the steps necessary \nto complete the recovery of the Salton Sea as my bill would have done, \nit is a necessary step toward that goal.\n  Over the years, scientists, communities and politicians alike have \nbeen trying to draw national attention to the decline of the Salton \nSea. Our late friend and colleague, Representative Sonny Bono, who died \nin a tragic skiing accident in January, worked tirelessly to make this \nissue an environmental priority for this Congress.\n  The Salton Sea is a unique natural resource in Southern California. \nCreated in 1905 by a breach in a levee along the Colorado River, the \nSalton Sea is California's largest inland body of water. It is one of \nthe most important habitats for migratory birds along the Pacific \nFlyway.\n  For 16 months after the breach, the Colorado River flowed into a dry \nlakebed, filling it to a depth of 80 feet. For a time following the \nclosure of the levee, the water levels declined rapidly as evaporation \ngreatly exceeded inflow. A minimum level was reached in the 1920s, \nafter which the sea once again began to rise, due largely to the \nimportation of water into the basin for agricultural purposes from the \nNew and Alamo Rivers.\n  Since there is no natural outlet for the sea at its current level, \nevaporation is the only way water leaves the basin. All the salts \ncarried with water that flows into the sea have remained there, along \nwith salts re-suspended from prehistoric/historic times by the new \ninundation. Salinity is currently more than 25 percent higher than \nocean water, and rising.\n  This extreme salinity, along with agricultural and wastewater in the \nsea, are rapidly deteriorating the entire ecosystem. The existing \nSalton Sea ecosystem is under severe stress and nearing collapse, with \nmillions of fish and thousands of bird die-offs in recent years. Birds \nand fish that once thrived here are now threatened with death and \ndisease as the tons of salts and toxic contaminants that are constantly \ndumped into the Salton Sea become more and more concentrated and deadly \nover time. The local economy is also being affected by the disaster at \nthe Salton Sea by the loss of recreational opportunities, decrease in \ntourism, and the impact on agriculture.\n  We all now agree that we must take the necessary long-term and short-\nterm steps to stabilize salinity and contaminant levels to protect the \ndwindling fishery resources and to reduce the threats to migratory \nbirds. However, there is no consensus on how that should be done.\n  The Salton Sea Reclamation Act should answer those questions. It \nrequires the Interior Department to report to Congress within two years \non the options for restoring the Salton Sea, including a recommendation \nfor a preferred option. Interior will review ways to reduce and \nstabilize salinity, stabilize surface elevation, restore the health of \nfish and wildlife resources and their habitats, enhance recreational \nuse and economic development, and continue the use the Salton Sea for \nirrigation drainage.\n  When this report is submitted to Congress, we will then have the \ninformation necessary to act swiftly to authorize construction of a \nrestoration project.\n  It has taken the hard work and dedication of many individuals to make \nthis legislation a success. I would like to thank members of the Salton \nSea Authority, including the Imperial County Board of Supervisors, the \nRiverside County Board of Supervisors, the Imperial Irrigation \nDistrict, and the Coachella Valley Water District, the National Audubon \nSociety, the Department of the Interior, Congresswoman Mary Bono, \nCongressman George Brown, Congressman Hunter, and the entire Salton Sea \nTask Force, Senator Kyl and Senator Chafee.\n  Scientists have warned that the Salton Sea will be a dead sea within \nfifteen years. This legislation is an integral step to ensure that we \navoid such a disaster.\n  I am pleased that my House and Senate colleagues have agreed to this \nnecessary and important legislation that will not only benefit \nCalifornians and our natural heritage, but will also\n\n[[Page S12906]]\n\ncarry on the legacy of Representative Bono.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12905-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12906-S12907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE SECURITIES LITIGATION UNIFORM STANDARDS ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I speak today about passage of the \nconference report on the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of \n1998, S. 1260. Recently, the report was agreed to by both chambers of \nCongress and sent to the President for his signature.\n  I supported the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 as \nwell as S. 1260. I did so because I recognize the national nature of \nour markets as well as the need to encourage capital investment. I am \npleased that we have been able to further these goals through this \nlegislation. However, I am concerned by the attempt of a few to lessen \nthe obligations owed investors.\n  Particularly troubling has been the incorrect use of legislative \nhistory to imply that a defrauded investor, now barred from discovery \nprior to the adjudication of a motion to dismiss, must include, in a \npleading, evidence of conscious attempts to defraud by the defendant. \nFirst, no such implication was made by the 1995 bill. Second, no bill \nwould have passed if such implications were included in the 1998 \nlegislation. Thus, allegations of motive, opportunity, and \nrecklessness, as well as conscious fraud, continue to satisfy the \nrequirements of a 10b(5) pleading. This is the rigorous, but time-\ntested standard for pleading which has been applied in the Second \nCircuit. This is the standard that we adopted in 1995, and the national \nstandard created by S. 1260.\n  The legislative history most frequently cited incorrectly is the \nPresidential veto message which accompanied his rejection of the 1995 \nbill; a veto which was overridden. I cannot understand why any weight \nwould be given to the President's interpretation of a bill he vetoed. \nThe purpose of any veto message is to portray the bill as negatively as \npossible, to avoid a veto override. Accusations the President made \nabout the pleading standard were not only overblown, they were \nspecifically rejected during debate after the veto and prior to the \nveto override.\n  Mr. President, as the Senate considered partially preempting state \nlaw, many Senators, including the primary sponsors of the bill, made \nclear that preemption would only occur if the federal standard insured \ninvestors protections from fraud. Most importantly this means a proper \npleading standard and scienter requirement. This view was shared by \nChairman Levitt of the Securities Exchange Commission. This is \nreflected in Chairman Levitt's testimony before Congress, in \ncorrespondence between the SEC and the Senate sponsors of the bill, as \nwell as in statements by Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee \nChairman D'Amato and the Ranking Member of the Securities Subcommittee, \nSenator Dodd.\n  Recent events in foreign markets have made all too clear the havoc \nthat results when investors are not fully apprized of substantial risks \nand rewards associated with investments. The Senate made clear that, in \nenacting partial preemption, it would not tolerate implementation of \nuntested standards concerning the obligations owed investors. Nor, \nmight I add, did industry proponents of the bill ask for a lessening of \nthese standards.\n  In order to better illustrate this point, Mr. President, I ask that a \nletter I sent to Members of the Conference Committee on S. 1260 be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 2, 1998.\n     Chairman Alfonse M. D'Amato,\n     Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write to you as a conferee on the \n     Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1998, S. 1260. \n     As you know, I supported passage of this legislation, and \n     voted to override the President's veto of the Private \n     Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. While class action \n     suits are frequently the only financially feasible means for \n     small investors to recover damages, such lawsuits have been \n     subject to abuse. By creating national standards, such as \n     those in S. 1260, we recognize the national nature of our \n     markets and encourage capital formation.\n       However, it is essential to recognize that preemption marks \n     a significant change concerning the obligations of Congress. \n     When federal legislation was enacted to combat securities \n     fraud in 1933 and 1934, federal law augmented existing state \n     statutes. States were free to provide greater protections, \n     and many have. Many of our colleagues voted for the 1995 \n     legislation knowing that if federal standards failed to \n     provide adequate investor protections, state law would \n     provide a necessary backup.\n       With passage of this legislation, Congress accepts full and \n     sole responsibility to ensure that fraud standards allow \n     truly victimized investors to recoup lost funds. Only a \n     meaningful right of action against those who defraud can \n     guarantee investor confidence in our national markets. \n     Recently, on the international stage, we have seen all too \n     clearly the problem of markets which fail to ensure that \n     consumers receive truthful, complete information.\n       Therefore, my support for this bill rests on the \n     presumption that the recklessness standard was not altered by \n     either the 1995 Act or this legislation. I strongly endorsed \n     the Senate Report which accompanies this legislation because \n     it stated clearly that nothing in the 1995 legislation \n     changed either the scienter standard or the most stringent \n     pleading standard, that of the Second Circuit. This language \n     was central to the legislation receiving the support of \n     Chairman Levitt of the Securities and Exchange Committee. It \n     was also central to my support.\n       As the Senate Banking Committee recognized at his second \n     confirmation hearing, Chairman Levitt has a lifetime of \n     experience as both an investor and regulator of markets. That \n     experience has led him to be the most articulate advocate of \n     the need for a recklessness standard concerning the scienter \n     requirement. In October 21, 1997 testimony before a \n     Subcommittee in the House of Representatives, Chairman Levitt \n     said, ``[E]liminating recklessness . . . would be tantamount \n     to eliminating manslaughter from the criminal laws. It would \n     be like saying you have to prove intentional murder or the \n     defendant gets off scot free. . . . If we were to lose the \n     reckless standard we would leave substantial numbers of the \n     investing public naked to attacks by . . . schemers.''\n       In testimony before a Senate Banking Subcommittee, on \n     October 29, 1997, Chairman Levitt further articulated his \n     position regarding the impact of a loss of the recklessness \n     standard. He said, ``A higher scienter standard (than \n     recklessness) would lessen the incentives for corporations to \n     conduct a full inquiry into potentially troublesome or \n     embarrassing areas, and thus would threaten the disclosure \n     process that has made our markets a model for nations around \n     the world.''\n       The danger posed by a loss of recklessness to our citizens \n     and markets is clear. We should not overrule the judgement of \n     the SEC Chair, not to mention every single Circuit Court of \n     Appeals that has adjudicated the issue. I would assume that \n     the motives which led to SEC and the Administration to insist \n     on the Senate Report language concerning recklessness would \n     also apply to their views of the Conference Report.\n       With regard to the pleading standard, some Members of \n     Congress, and, unfortunately, a minority of federal district \n     courts, have made much of the President's veto measure of the \n     1995 legislation. Specifically, some have pointed out that \n     the President vetoed the 1995 bill due to concerns that the \n     Conference Report adopted a pleading standard higher than \n     that of the Second Circuit, the most stringent standard at \n     that time. As I, and indeed a bipartisan group of Senators \n     and Representatives, made clear in the veto override vote, \n     the President overreached on this point. The pleading \n     standard was raised to the highest bar available, that of the \n     Second Circuit, but no further. In spite of the \n     Administration's 1995 veto, this preemption gained the \n     support of Chairman Levitt. It is, therefore, difficult to \n     understand how some can argue that the 1995 legislation \n     changed the pleading standard of the Second Circuit.\n       The reason for allowing a plaintiff to establish scienter \n     through a pleading of motive and opportunity or recklessness \n     is clear. As one New York Federal District Court has stated, \n     ``a plaintiff realistically cannot be expected to plead a \n     defendant's actual state of mind.'' Since the 1995 Act allows \n     for a stay of discovery pending a defendant's motion to \n     dismiss, requiring a plaintiff to establish actual knowledge \n     of fraud or an intent to defraud in a complaint raises the \n     bar far higher than most legitimately defrauded investors can \n     meet.\n       Firms which advocate for S. 1260 do so based on the need to \n     eliminate the circumvention of federal standards and federal \n     stays of discovery through state court filings. They do not \n     argue for a lessening of the obligations owed investors. I am \n     concerned that should the conference committee include \n     language which could be interpreted to eviscerate the ability \n     of plaintiffs to satisfy the scienter standard by proof of \n     recklessness or to require plaintiffs, barred from discovery, \n     to adhere to a pleading standard requiring conscious \n     behavior, the bill will lose the support of Chairman Levitt \n     and many Members of Congress. I urge the Conference to \n     support language included in the Senate Report and move \n     forward with a bill that a bipartisan group in Congress can \n     support and the President can sign.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Jack Reed,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I respectfully point out that the letter was \nsent during the Conference Committee negotiations on the bill and \nillustrates\n\n[[Page S12907]]\n\nthe fact that the Senate was unwilling to alter positions it \nestablished in Senate passage of S. 1260. I appreciate the opportunity \nto clarify the debate surrounding this issue. I commend Chairman \nD'Amato and Senator Dodd for their work on this bill. They have \nfurthered the goal of capital formation while ensuring proper \nprotections for consumers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12906-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO STATE REPRESENTATIVE MORRIS HOOD, JR.\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, earlier this month, a powerful voice \nfor fairness and compassion fell silent with the untimely death of \nState Representative Morris Hood, Jr.\n  Representative Hood served in the Michigan House of Representatives \nfor 28 years, representing a part of the City of Detroit, my home town. \nHe was the Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. He \ndistinguished himself in that role by fighting to make education \naccessible to all people. He strove to give everyone the opportunity to \ngo to school, to obtain a job and earn a living. He was the primary \nfounder of the King-Chavez-Parks initiative, which has provided \nthousands of dollars in scholarship money to deserving minority \nstudents. He was a believer in a positive role for government in our \nsociety. He once said, ``There are some things government is meant to \ndo. One of the them is to take care of those who can't take care of \nthemselves.''\n  Morris Hood, Jr. recognized the painful effects of discrimination and \nsponsored legislation to give small and minority owned businesses the \nability to compete for state contracts. Foremost of all, Morris Hood \nwas a promoter of the City of Detroit. He saw in Detroit a community \nfull of possibilities, inhabited by people full of potential. He saw as \nhis responsibility to use government as one means to unlock that \npotential. That is why he was such a strong supporter of Focus: HOPE, \nan organization that is near and dear to my heart. His voice will be \ndearly missed. Our hearts go out to his children, Denise and Morris \nIII.\n  Mr. President I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in honoring the \nmemory of a passionate legislator, State Representative Morris Hood, \nJr.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12907-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12907-S12908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             OUR UNFINISHED WORK TO PROTECT PRIVACY RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the American people have a growing \nconcern over encroachments on personal privacy. It seems that \neverywhere we turn, new technologies, new communications media, and new \nbusiness services created with the best of intentions and highest of \nexpectations also pose a threat to our ability to keep our lives to \nourselves, to live, work and think without having giant corporations or \ngovernment looking over our shoulders, or peeking through our keyholes.\n  The current national media obsession with the Monica Lewinsky scandal \nhas focused attention on abuses of power by independent counsel Kenneth \nStarr. I have been a prosecutor, and I am intimately familiar with the \nenormous power prosecutors wield. This power is generally circumscribed \nby a sense of honor and by professionalism, and for those for whom this \nis not enough, by the Bar's canons of ethics and disciplinary rules \nand, for federal prosecutors, the rules and regulations of the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  Mr. Starr has a different view of these obligations, and privacy has \nbeen the first casualty. He began his investigation into the \nPresident's personal life by using the results of an illegal wiretap. \nThe State of Maryland protects its residents from having private \nconversations tape recorded without their knowledge or consent. Mr. \nStarr condoned the deliberate flouting of that law by granting the \nperpetrator immunity and then using the illicit recordings to persuade \nthe Attorney General to expand his jurisdiction.\n  That was just the beginning. In February, Prosecutor Starr forced a \nmother to travel to the country's Capital to sit before a federal grand \njury, with no right to have counsel present, and reveal the most \nintimate secrets of her daughter. That led me to introduce legislation \nto develop Federal prosecutorial guidelines to protect familial privacy \nand parent-child communications in matters that do not involve \nallegations of violent conduct or drug trafficking.\n  Mr. Starr issued subpoenas to bookstores to pry into what we read and \nfurther encroached upon our First Amendment rights with subpoenas to \nreporters, at every step acting contrary to Justice Department \nguidelines. He intruded into the attorney-client privilege, and even \nrequired Secret Service agents to gossip about those whom they are \nsworn to protect, and whose privacy they have safeguarded for decade \nupon decade. Then all of the private information he gathered, all of \nthe excruciating details of personal life, appeared almost \ncontemporaneously in the public press, attributed to unidentified \nsources, despite the command of the law that all matters before a grand \njury remain secret.\n  The independent counsel law was passed with the best of intentions, \nwith my support. I never imagined that the power would be so abused, \nand privacy so ignored. But that is the point. We must act to prevent \nabuses of privacy.\n  Mr. Starr, by his gross excesses, has become a symbol of the threat \nto privacy and the threat to individual liberty from abuse of power and \ninformation. That threat has been amplified by the unseemly haste with \nwhich the Republican majority on the House Judiciary Committee voted to \nplaster the mud from Ken Starr's report all over the Internet, so that \nliterally all the world would have a chance to peek through the \nkeyhole. This intemperate action, in an unabashed effort to gain \npolitical advantage at the expense of privacy and dignity, should be a \nlesson to the American people that we need additional legal protection \nto protect their privacy.\n  The far more pervasive problem is the incremental encroachment on \nprivacy through the lack of safeguards on personal, financial and \nmedical information about each of us that can be stolen, sold or \nmishandled and find its way into the wrong hands with a push of a \nbutton.\n  The right of privacy is one of the most vulnerable rights in the \ninformation age. The digitalization of information and the explosion in \nthe growth of computing and electronic networking offer tremendous \npotential benefits to the way Americans live, work, conduct commerce, \nand interact with their government. But the new technology also \npresents new threats to our individual privacy and security, in \nparticular, our ability to control the terms under which our personal \ninformation is acquired, disclosed, and used.\n  The threats are there, but so are the solutions, if we only take the \ntime to look for them. For example, this Congress passed legislation \nthat will make the United States government more accessible and \naccountable to the citizenry by directing Federal agencies to accept \n``electronic signatures'' for government forms that are submitted \nelectronically. When the bill was reported out of committee, it \nestablished a framework for government use of electronic signatures \nwithout putting in place any privacy protections for the vast amounts \nof personal information collected in the process. I was concerned that \ncitizens would be forced to sacrifice their privacy as the price of \ncommunicating with the government electronically. Senator Abraham and I \ncorrected this oversight by adding forward-looking privacy protections \nto the bill, which strictly limit the ways in which information \ncollected as a byproduct of electronic communications with the \ngovernment can be used or disclosed to others.\n  As I remarked when the bill passed, however, this is just the \nbeginning of Congress's efforts to address the new privacy issues \nraised by electronic government and the information age. Congress will \nalmost certainly be called upon in the next session to consider broader \nelectronic signature legislation, and issues of law enforcement access \nto electronic data and mechanisms for enforcing privacy rights in \ncyberspace will need to be part of that discussion.\n  The government also holds tens of millions of medical records of \nindividuals covered by Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health \nprograms. This information is routinely released by the government in \nindividually-identifiable form for purposes such as medical research or \nin order to ferret out fraud\n\n[[Page S12908]]\n\nand abuse. These are laudable activities, but without setting strong \nstandards for an entity to meet before gaining access to this \ninformation there is the possibility of misuse and abuse of this very \nsensitive personal information.\n  We have a Federal Privacy Act in this country that has not been \nsubstantially changed since its passage almost 25 years ago. One \npurpose of the Privacy Act was to protect our citizens from government \nintrusion and the sharing of data across agencies without the knowledge \nor consent of the subject of the information. Yet, the Privacy Act \ncontains a problematic ``routine use'' exception, which is already a \nhuge loophole to use health and other information for any purpose.\n  I first noted my concern with this loophole during congressional \nhearings in 1996 on the transfer by the FBI of background investigation \nfiles to the White House for former Republican White House employees. \nThe FBI admitted that it made these transfers pursuant to the ``routine \nuse'' exception. Ironically, more information from the confidential FBI \nbackground files were revealed to the public in the course of \ncongressional hearings than from any action taken elsewhere. For \nexample, it was a House Committee that first revealed the names of \npeople whose file summaries were requested. It was also a House \nCommittee that used information from a Clinton White House employee's \nfile to embarrass him and it was a House Chairman who ``went public'' \nwith the confidential FBI background memo from the employee's \nbackground file in a statement made on the floor of the House. That is \nwhy during those hearings, on September 25, 1996, I called for a \nreexamination of the Privacy Act and tightening of the routine use \nloophole.\n  My concern is heightened by a July 16, 1998, published notice by the \nHealth Care Financing Administration to add new ``routine uses'' to the \nPrivacy Act. The proposal is very broad. In the name of combating fraud \nand abuse, this proposal would permit the release of individual \nspecific information to any governmental or non-governmental entity \nthat has anything to do with health care. This new HCFA ``routine use'' \nexception proposal turns our notion of privacy protection on its head, \nand makes more urgent the need for review of and restrictions on the \n``routine use'' of private medical and other information collected and \nheld by the government.\n  At a time when the Congress and the Administration are grappling with \nhow best to protect the privacy of individually-identifiable medical \nrecords in the private health care sector, we better make sure that we \nhave our own house in order. I introduced legislation in this Congress \nthat would help protect the privacy of individually-identifiable \nmedical records, and I plan to expand on that initiative in the next \nCongress to ensure that such records are not mishandled by Federal \nagencies.\n  The next Congress will also need to consider how our privacy \nsafeguards for personal, financial and medical information measure up \nto the tough privacy standards established by the European Union. The \nEU Data Protection Directive is set to take effect next week. That \ncould be a big problem for American businesses, since the new rules \nrequire EU member countries to prohibit the transmission of personal \ndata to or through any non-EU country that fails to provide adequate \ndata protection as defined under European law. European officials have \nsaid repeatedly over the past year that the patchwork of privacy laws \nin the United States may not meet their standards. Our law is less \nprotective than EU standards in a variety of respects on a range of \nissues, including requirements to obtain data fairly and lawfully; \nlimitations on the collection of sensitive data; limitations on the \npurpose of data collection; bans on the collection and storage of \nunnecessary personal information; requirements regarding data accuracy; \nlimitations regarding duration of storage; and centralized supervision \nof privacy protections and practices.\n  The flow of information from Europe may not stop suddenly on Monday, \nbut the clock is ticking. Europe is committed to enforcing the \nDirective. Our continued failure to address this issue could have \nserious economic consequences for U.S. firms and transborder data \nflows.\n  When we do address this issue--hopefully early in the next Congress--\nwe may find that the problem is not that Europe protects privacy too \nmuch. We may find that the problem is our own failure to keep U.S. \nprivacy laws up to date. The EU Directive is an example of the kind of \nprivacy protection that American consumers need and do not have. It has \nencouraged European companies to develop good privacy techniques. It \nhas produced policies, including policies on cryptography, that are \nconsistent with the interests of both consumers and businesses.\n  Even if we decide not to lock in the commands of the EU Data \nDirective, we can learn from it. Marc Rotenberg, the Director of the \nElectronic Privacy Information Center, made this point eloquently \nearlier this year, when he testified before the House Committee on \nInternational Relations: ``The EU Data Directive is not so much a \nproblem as it is a reminder that our privacy laws are out of date.'' I \nagree with his conclusion that, in the end, ``we need stronger privacy \nsafeguards not to satisfy European government, but to assure the \nprotection of our own citizens.''\n  There is a cartoonish quality to the excesses of Ken Starr and the \nham-handedness of the House Republican leadership, who seem to be vying \nfor the title of poster child for privacy reform legislation. This \ncould lull us into a false sense that their sort of nonsense may be \npernicious, but it is not something that affects the average citizen. \nDo not be misled. It bears repeating again and again that personal, \nfinancial and medical information of any American can fall into the \nwrong hands.\n  Americans are rightly concerned about the adequacy of privacy \nprotection in this country. Indeed, this is a matter that concerns all \nAmericans in the most personal of ways.\n  The European Union has responded to the demands of the information \nage with tough privacy standards. The privacy protections in our new \ndigital signature legislation show that we can get ahead of the curve, \nanticipate problems and head them off even before they arise, if only \nwe give the matter the attention it deserves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12907-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12908-S12909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WORLD POPULATION AWARENESS WEEK\n\n Mr. KOHL.

I am pleased to note that Jeannette Bell, Mayor of West \nAllis has agreed to proclaim World Population Awareness Week as well.\n  I ask that the proclamation be printed in the Record.\n  The proclamation follows:\n\n\n           world population awareness week proclamation--1998\n\n       Whereas world population stands today at more than 5.9 \n     billion and increases by more than 80 million per year, with \n     virtually all of this growth in the least developed \n     countries;\n       Whereas the consequences of rapid population growth are not \n     limited to the developing world but extend to all nations and \n     to all people, including every citizen of the State of \n     Wisconsin concerned for human dignity, freedom and democracy, \n     as well as for the impact on the global economy.\n       Whereas 1.3 billion people--more than the combined \n     population of Europe and North Africa--live in absolute \n     poverty on the equivalent of one U.S. dollar or less a day;\n       Whereas 1.5 billion people--nearly one-quarter of the world \n     population--lack an adequate supply of clean drinking water \n     or sanitation;\n       Whereas more than 840 million people--one fifth of the \n     entire population of the developing world--are hungry or \n     malnourished;\n       Whereas demographic studies and surveys indicate that at \n     least 120 million married women in the developing world--and \n     a large but undefined number of unmarried women--want more \n     control over their fertility but lack access to family \n     planning;\n       Whereas this unmet demand for family planning is projected \n     to result in 1.2 billion unintended births;\n       Whereas the 1994 International Conference on Population and \n     Development determined that political commitment and \n     appropriate\n\n[[Page S12909]]\n\n     programs aimed at providing universal access to voluntary \n     family planning information, education and services can \n     ensure world population stabilization at 8 billion or less \n     rather than 12 billion or more.

Mr. President, on October 15th, America lost it's \nreigning Polka King, and Wisconsin lost a beloved friend: Frankie \nYankovic.\n  From the day he debuted in the Milwaukee area at Bert Phillips \nBallroom in Menomonee Falls, Frankie Yankovic has had a special place \namong Wisconsin's polka fans. Wisconsinites loves to polka, so much so \nthat it's our state's official dance. And no polka musician has won \nmore accolades, had more devoted fans, or taught more Americans to love \nthat simple dance than Frankie Yankovic.\n  While he was born in West Virginia and was a long-time resident of \nCleveland, Frankie Yankovic felt a special connection to Milwaukee. ``I \nshould have come here and made Milwaukee my hometown,'' he once said. \nThere is nothing we'd have liked better, but Wisconsinites were lucky \nfor the many chances we've had to enjoy Yankovic's music, and to pay \ntribute to his myriad achievements in the music world.\n  In fact, it was in Milwaukee that Yankovic was crowned as America's \nPolka King in 1948. Just one year later, his ``Blue Skirt Waltz'' hit \nnumber two on Columbia Records' bestseller list, just behind Gene \nAutry's ``Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,'' one of the best-selling \nrecords of all time. He was the first inductee to both the Polka Hall \nof Fame in Minnesota in 1988 and the Wisconsin Polka Hall of Fame in \n1996.\n  Yankovic didn't just contribute to popular music, he revolutionized \nit by infusing traditional polka music with a smoother style, and \nintroducing new instruments, such as the bass fiddle, to polka \narrangements.\n  Throughout his career, Yankovic's singular style energized audiences. \nHis compositions were legendary, including such Wisconsin-inspired \ntunes as the ``Kringleville Polka,'' about Racine, and ``There's No Joy \nLeft Now in Milwaukee,'' about the Braves leaving for Atlanta.\n  Yankovic was a man who made audiences roar and floors shake as he \nbrought capacity crowds to their feet to do that simple step that just, \nas Yankovic put it, ``makes people happy.'' He often rallied audiences \nby asking ``What do you think this is, a concert? Let's get up and \ndance!''\n  Milwaukeeans know that Frankie Yankovic was loved coast to coast, \nappearing on Johnny Carson and performing with the likes of Milton \nBerle and Doris Day. And we know that Cleveland was his permanent \naddress. But in Wisconsin, we proudly count him as one of our own. ``I \nlove Milwaukee,'' he often said, and Milwaukee loved him back. On \nbehalf of the people of Wisconsin, I thank Frankie Yankovic for the \nhappiness he brought to Wisconsin's polka fans over the years, and I \npay tribute to his memory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12909-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12909-S12910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CONGRESS AGAIN FAILS TO CLEAN UP BROWNFIELDS\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I very much regret that once \nagain--for the 3rd Congress, that's six years--the Congress has refused \nto take action on brownfields legislation because of unrelated and very \ncontroversial issues related to the Superfund program.\n  As I have for three Congresses, on the very first day of the 105th \nCongress, along with ten other Senators, I introduced S. 18, a bill to \nencourage brownfields revitalization efforts. Brownfields are \nabandoned, or idle, former industrial properties which may or may not \nbe contaminated. Brownfields exist in cities, suburbs and rural areas. \nTheir reuse can result in badly needed jobs and significant revenues \nalong with environmental cleanup of hundreds of thousands of \ncommunities across the country. One section of S. 18 established an \nexemption from potential Superfund liability for developers who clean \nup brownfields but had nothing to do with any contamination that might \nbe present. These provisions merely clarified that Congress did not \nintend the specter of Superfund liability to deter the purchase and \nredevelopment of brownfields properties. This simple clarification has \nlong enjoyed broad-based, bipartisan support.\n  Mr. President, on November 7, 1997, I also introduced S. 1497. This \nbill is in some ways analogous to the brownfields bill, in that it \nprovides an exemption from Superfund liability for homeowners, small \nbusinesses, and non-profit organizations which sent only municipal \nsolid waste to Superfund sites.\n  Mr. President, S. 1497 was, so to speak, dedicated to Barbara \nWilliams, and all those like her, who got caught up unfairly in a \nlitigation web that the Congress never intended when Superfund was \nwritten. Barbara Williams is the owner of Sunny Ray Restaurant. Ms. \nWilliams was sued and asked to pay for cleanup of a Superfund site, \nthough she only disposed of mashed potatoes and other restaurant waste \nat that site. She has testified before the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee twice.\n  Mr. President, I find it appalling that this woman was stuck in a \nSuperfund lawsuit, brought by industries that had polluted the site but \ndid not want to pay to clean up their mess. S. 1497 included a \nprovision clarifying that Congress did not intend parties such as \nhomeowners, pizza parlor owners, or girl scouts--that disposed only of \nhousehold, or household-like trash--to be subject to suit under \nSuperfund. Like brownfields liability exemptions, these exemptions for \ninnocent parties enjoy broad, longstanding, bipartisan support.\n  Mr. President, this is the third consecutive Congress we have \nnegotiated comprehensive Superfund reform, but failed to pass \nlegislation. In the 103rd Congress, the Committee marked up a \ncomprehensive Superfund reform bill that boasted unusually broad-based \nsupport, and reported it out on an 13:4 vote. But for reasons which had \nlittle to do with Superfund, for reasons that were blatantly political, \nthe bill was not enacted into law. In the 104th Congress, consensus \nevaporated, and the Republican Majority introduced comprehensive reform \nbills that can only be described as extreme. In the 105th Congress, the \nparties got closer, yet, despite the hundreds of hours of work by our \nstaffs, did not get close enough. I personally spent weeks negotiating \npainstaking details of this complex statute. But unfortunately, rather \nthan resolve remaining differences, the Committee elected to proceed to \na partisan mark-up. Indeed, it reported its Superfund bill, S. 8, \nalmost entirely along party lines, with the vote on final passage at \n11:7.\n  Mr. President, the Committee may or may not take up comprehensive \nreform again in the 106th Congress. Given GAO's August, 1998 report \nfinding that EPA has already selected remedies at 95% of non-federal \nSuperfund sites, I question whether this effort is at all worthwhile. \nBut the battle lines are beginning to be drawn. It is reported that \nsome are urging industry to spend as much as did the tobacco industry--\nsome $40 million--to have their way.\n  But while my Republican colleagues persist in an all or nothing \nstrategy, I urge that this body be cognizant of the price exacted by \nthis approach. This posture essentially takes our nation's cities and \nsmall businesses as hostages in a war over Superfund. And the \nconsequences are very real.\n  The nation's Mayors estimate they lose between $200 and $500 million \na year in tax revenues from brownfields sitting idle, and that \nreturning these sites to productive use could create some 236,000 new \njobs. They, as well as developers and bankers, say immediate action is \nimperative, since new tax laws provide incentives for brownfields \nredevelopment, but expire in 2001. In short, the window is narrow \nduring which brownfields reform will make any difference at all. Each \nday Congress fails to act on brownfields liability, it deprives our \ncities of unique redevelopment opportunities.\n  And as for municipal solid waste, as Mrs. Williams testified, neither \nher lawyer's fees nor her settlement costs are covered by insurance, \nnor are they business expenses she can deduct. She must make enough \nmoney to pay these penalties on top of her other bills and her payroll. \nEach day Congress fails to\n\n[[Page S12910]]\n\nfree Barbara Williams and requires that she pay still more lawyers' \nfees, Congress adds to her burden, or as she testified, expands the \n``cloud'' cast over her head.\n  Mr. President, I submit that holding these non-controversial, \npractical and entirely beneficial bills hostage to an ideological fight \nover the Superfund program is not in the public interest. I am very \ndisappointed that for the sixth year in a row, we withheld action on \nlegislation that could provide enormous benefits to the public. This is \nwhat gives government a bad name. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12909-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          REAUTHORIZATION OF THE SURFACE TRANSPORTATION BOARD\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS.

A healthy \ntransportation system is critical to sustaining a vibrant and growing \neconomy. Under the able and forward-looking leadership of Linda Morgan, \nthe Board's Chairman, who was with us on the Commerce Committee for \nmany years, the Board has worked to ensure that the transportation \nsystem is both healthy and responsive. Although it was established to \nbe principally an adjudicatory body, the Board has reached out to the \ntransportation community in an unprecedented way. It has handled the \ncrisis in the West appropriately, letting the private sector work it \nout where possible, but intervening when necessary. It has initiated \nproceedings at the request of Senator McCain and Senator Hutchison to \nreview the status of access and competition in the railroad industry, \nand its actions have produced a mix of government action and private-\nsector solutions. With its staff of 135, it puts out more work than \nmuch larger agencies, issuing well-reasoned, thoughtful, and balanced \ndecisions in tough, contentious cases. Just recently, in the Conrail \nacquisition case, the Board issued one such decision that is good for \nmy State, and for the Nation.\n  But the Board is stretched thin. It needs to train new people to \nreplace the many employees who are likely to retire soon. And next \nyear, it will continue to expend resources monitoring the \nimplementation of the Conrail acquisition and the rest of the rail \nnetwork. The Board needs adequate resources to do the hard work that we \nexpect it to do.\n  Because we need the Board, and because the Board has done a fine job, \nI am here today supporting a clean reauthorization bill. I supported \nthe Staggers Act when it was passed, and I think in large part it has \nbeen a success.\n  I know that there is some concern about how our transportation system \nought to look, and that there are many important issues on the table \nright now. Several of those issues are being handled by the Board, in \nconnection with its competition and access hearings. I am confident \nthat the Board will do the right thing with the issues before it.\n  However, some of the tougher issues that have not yet been resolved--\nfor example, the substantially more open access that some shippers \nwant--are not for the Board. They are for us, and they are real. But \nthe fact that the railroads and those who use the system have a lot of \nground to cover on these legislative issues should not hold up the \nBoard's reauthorization. Legislative change is our job. The Board, \nworking with the law we gave it, has done its job. I want to thank the \nBoard in general, and Chairman Morgan in particular, who has my \nunqualified support, for a job well done. The Nation needs agencies \nlike the Board and public servants like Chairman Morgan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12910-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12910]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TRIBUTE TO FORMER STATE REPRESENTATIVE PERRY BULLARD\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak of the untimely \ndeath of former Michigan State Representative Perry Bullard.\n  Perry Bullard had a sharp mind, and a tongue to match. He has been \ncalled outspoken and abrasive. But what he really was was a passionate \nlegislator. He had a fundamental belief in democracy, and the \nprotection of individual liberties. He served in the Michigan House of \nRepresentatives for 20 years, rising to the position of Chairman of the \nHouse Judiciary Committee. His commitment to the rights of individuals \nin a democracy and the rights of individuals to access their government \nare evidenced by the bills he sponsored which have become law. He wrote \nthe Michigan Open Meeting Act, the state Freedom of Information Act, \nthe Whistleblower Protections Act and the Polygraph Protections Act. He \nwas behind the passage of the state's Statutory Will Act, which created \na fill-in-the-blank will form that allows people to write their own \nwills. Equally important to the bills he passed were the bills he \nstopped. He prevented passage of legislation to loosen requirements for \npolice wiretaps, and to allow for police entering homes without a \nwarrant. Perry Bullard was a liberal, and unabashedly so. He believed \nthat being liberal meant protecting liberty. For him protecting liberty \nmeant putting the interests of the public ahead of those of the state. \nHe will be missed and our hearts go out to his wife, Kelly.\n  Mr. President I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in honoring the \nmemory of a passionate legislator, Perry Bullard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12910-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12910-S12912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             BILL LANN LEE\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to express my deep \ndisappointment and sadness that the Senate has failed to act on the \nnomination of Bill Lann Lee as Assistant Attorney General for Civil \nRights at the Department of Justice.\n  Bill Lann Lee's nomination was sent to the Senate in July, 1997. I \nhad the honor of introducing him to the Judiciary Committee, and I have \nspoken to the Senate numerous times to urge his confirmation. In my \ntravels throughout my home state of California, I have heard over and \nover from his supporters, ``please make sure Bill Lann Lee gets \nconfirmed.''\n  I cannot explain why the Senate failed to act on this eminently \nqualified nominee. I can only guess that an eminently qualified \ncandidate fell victim to partisan politics. Mr. Lee has served for 10 \nmonths as the Acting Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights \nbecause the Judiciary Committee refused to report the nomination. The \nCommittee did not act because it did not wish the full Senate to vote--\nbecause the majority of that Committee knew that Bill Lann Lee would be \nconfirmed if a vote were taken.\n  If any member of this body does not wish to confirm one of the \nPresident's nominees, then he or she should have the courage to vote \nthat nominee down. But that did not happen.\n  In all this time, one thing is certain; those who know Mr. Lee, and \nthose who are aware of his record, know Mr. Bill Lann Lee is the best \nperson for the position of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights \nat the Department of Justice. Unfortunately, this nomination has been \nheld back by a few senators who oppose Mr. Lee as head of the Civil \nRights Division because, oddly enough, Mr. Lee believes strongly in \ncivil rights.\n  I want the record to be clear about Bill Lann Lee, his personal \nhistory and his professsional credentials, both of which make him the \nperfect candidate to be Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.\n  Bill Lann Lee was born in Harlem, the son of hardworking, patriotic, \nimmigrant parents who came to this country because they believed \nAmerica was the land of opportunity. His father, William Lee, not only \nspoke of this, but also showed his son by example, that a penniless \nimmigrant who works hard in this country can make a better life for \nhimself and for his family. Many of us know the senior Lee was a \nlaundryman in New York, who faced daily unspeakable discrimination. \nWhat some of my colleagues may not know is that the senior Lee \nvolunteered in the U.S. Army Air Force during World War II. He fought \noverseas for America and all that America\n\n[[Page S12911]]\n\nstands for, and he advanced to corporal, where as an Army soldier, he \nwas treated just like everyone else.\n  Bill Lann Lee took to heart these lessons of hard work and dedication \nto America's values. He attended the renowned Bronx High School of \nScience. He went on to attend Yale on a scholarship and graduated Phi \nBeta Kappa and magna cum laude. He received his law degree from \nColumbia University Law school.\n  Attending school, Mr. Lee was one of the most formally dressed \nstudents. He frequently wore white dress shirts to class, while his \nclassmates wore sweatshirts with college logos. When I think of the \nreason why Bill Lann Lee wore white dress shirts every day, tears well \nup in my eyes.\n  Bill Lee, who came from poverty, wore white dress shirts because \nthese were the shirts left behind at his parents' laundry business. \nBill Lee wore the clothes that were forgotten by others. He wore the \nclothes that his parents toiled over, despite the cramp conditions in \ntheir tiny laundry, despite the fact they all ate their meals amidst \npiles of dirty laundry. All this in hopes that one day their children \nwould make something of themselves--an immigrant's dream--the American \ndream. And Bill Lann Lee wore those white dress shirts with pride, to \nsave money for his family, to save money for his education, all this in \nhopes that one day he would fulfill that dream, and make something of \nhimself.\n  Mr. Lee spent most of his 24-year legal career with the NAACP Legal \nDefense and Educational Fund, which was founded by the late Supreme \nCourt Justice, Thurgood Marshall. Lee left the Legal Defense Fund in \n1983 and worked for the Center for Law in the Public Interest, but \neventually returned to the Legal Defense Fund in 1988.\n  During the course of his career, Mr. Lee showed his ability to build \nconsensus and coalitions, fostering negotiations and settlements even \nas he litigated contentious civil rights cases. An example of this is a \ncase alleging that Vons Grocery Stores' hiring practices kept women and \nminorities locked in entry-level jobs. Lee's skill to seek a settlement \nresulted in the praise of Vons' general counsel because the court \ndecree expressly stated Vons was not required to meet quotas or hire \nunqualified individuals, but that Vons must show a good faith effort \nfor hiring and promoting qualified minority employees.\n  While Bill Lee's record speaks volumes, many have felt they wanted to \nadd a few words.\n  In a letter to Erskine Bowles, Mayor Richard Riordan of Los Angeles \nexplained that Mr. Lee was opposing counsel in an important civil \nrights case (Labor/Community Strategy Center v. Los Angeles County \nMetropolitan Transportation Authority) which was ultimately settled. \nMayor Riordan writes, ``The work of my opponents rarely evoke my \npraise, but the negotiations could not have concluded successfully \nwithout Mr. Lee's practical leadership and expertise.'' Mayor Riordan \nbelieves Mr. Lee to have a stellar track record as a civil rights \nlitigator, and in closing, writes: ``Mr. Lee has practiced mainstream \ncivil rights law. He does not believe in quotas. He has pursued \nflexible and reasonable remedies that in each case were approved by a \ncourt.''\n  Additionally, former U.S. Senator Hiram Fong, a Republican from \nHawaii, lends his support to Mr. Lee. Senator Fong, who served in the \nU.S. Senate for 17 years and was on the Judiciary Committee, states ``I \nam herewith heartily endorsing the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to the \nposition of Assistant United States Attorney General for Civil Rights . \n. . His record shows that he is an exceptional litigator with over 20 \nyears experience with civil rights issues.''\n  Also, William Murphy, District Attorney for Staten Island, New York, \nwrote on behalf of the National District Attorneys Association in \nstrong support for Bill Lee. Mr. Murphy writes ``I believe that as the \nAssistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, he will remain fully \ncognizant of the need and expectations of the people of the United \nStates to be provided effective, efficient and fair law enforcement \nservices. I am convinced that he will do his utmost to insuring that \nhonest and hardworking police officers are not tarnished by the acts of \na few miscreants.''\n  Even Kenneth Klein, the lead attorney on the opposing legal team on \nthe Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority case, \nwrote a letter of support for Mr. Lee. Mr. Klein, a former prosecutor, \nwrites: ``Notwithstanding the significant disparity between Mr. Lee's \npolitical philosophy and my own, I cannot think of a better candidate \nto fill the position of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights \nthan Bill Lann Lee.''\n  Mr. President, again, I deeply regret that the Senate did not have \nthe chance to vote on this nomination. I know that Bill Lann Lee would \nhave been confirmed by a wide margin. I am sorry that those senators \nwho disagreed with the President and his nominees to express that \ndisagreement in the form of a vote.\n  Mr. President, I ask that these letters of support be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The letters follow:\n\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                              City of Los Angeles,\n\n\n                                          Office of the Mayor,\n\n                                  Los Angeles, CA, March 20, 1997.\n     Re: Bill Lann Lee, candidate for Assistant Attorney General, \n         Civil Rights Division, United States Department of \n         Justice.\n\n     Erskine Bowles\n     Chief of Staff, Office of the President, The White House, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Bowles: I am writing to support the appointment of \n     Bill Lann Lee to the United States Department of Justice \n     position of Assistant Attorney General, Civil Rights \n     Division. Throughout his distinguished career as a civil \n     rights lawyer, Mr. Lee has worked to advance the civil rights \n     progress of the nation and of our richly diverse city of Los \n     Angeles.\n       In my opinion, Bill Lee is an astute lawyer who is superbly \n     qualified to enforce our national civil rights laws. Mr. \n     Lee's candidacy offers the president an excellent opportunity \n     to reaffirm his strong support of women's rights and civil \n     rights laws.\n       Mr. Lee first became known to me as opposing counsel in an \n     important civil rights case concerning poor bus riders in Los \n     Angeles. As Mayor, I took a leading role in settling that \n     case. The work of my opponents rarely evoke my praise, but \n     the negotiations could not have concluded successfully \n     without Mr. Lee's practical leadership and expertise.\n       I know that his expertise is the result of working twenty-\n     two years in the ``All Star'' leagues of civil rights \n     litigators. His track record is nationally renowned and \n     speaks for itself. Beyond the many victories, what makes his \n     work special is that he has represented clients from every \n     background, including poor whites, women and children \n     suffering from lead poisoning. His admirable ability to win \n     the trust of so many communities is evident in the broad \n     coalition of civil rights and women's rights experts who are \n     backing his candidacy for this position.\n       Mr. Lee has practiced mainstream civil rights law. He does \n     not believe in quotas. He has pursued flexible and reasonable \n     remedies that in each case were approved by a court.\n       Mr. Lee is an outstanding citizen of Los Angeles. He has my \n     enthusiastic support and strongest recommendation for the \n     position of Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Richard J. Riordan,\n     Mayor.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Finance Enterprises, Ltd.,\n\n                                    Honolulu, HI, August 25, 1997.\n     To the Members of the Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Gentlemen: As one who has served in the United States \n     Senate from the State of Hawaii for seventeen years and as a \n     former member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I am \n     herewith heartily endorsing the nomination of Bill Lann Lee \n     to the position of Assistant United States Attorney General \n     for Civil Rights.\n       Mr. Lee has had a very distinguished career in public \n     service especially in matters pertaining to civil rights \n     discrimination.\n       I have been deeply impressed by Mr. Lee's efforts in behalf \n     of the poor, children, minorities, women and others who seek \n     a more just and fair society. He is able and well qualified \n     for the position he seeks. His record shows that he is an \n     exceptional litigator with over 20 years experience with \n     civil rights issues.\n       I respectfully request that Mr. Bill Lann Lee's nomination \n     be given an early hearing and that he be given the \n     Committee's endorsement.\n       With warmest aloha,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Hiram L.

Orrin G.

Crucial to his \n     success as Assistant Attorney General will be his ability to \n     minimize destructive conflict between state, local and \n     federal resources to achieve the goal of bringing peace and \n     harmony to our communities.\n       In my discussion with him on his goals in his nominative \n     role, Mr. Lee has indicated his strong dedication to seeking \n     out nonconfrontational and alternative methods of resolving \n     the festering problems besetting our police. Moreover, he \n     recognizes that many complaints are without merit and based \n     in perception rather than fact. He is eminently aware that he \n     must make a viable and continual contribution to fostering a \n     stronger working relationships between law enforcement and \n     all segments of our communities to achieve the goal of ending \n     both actual and perceptions of police misconduct.\n       During our discussions we also addressed how best to \n     accomplish the investigative efforts, involving both local \n     and federal interests, in cases involving police misconduct. \n     He has pledged to work with local leaders to develop \n     protocols to combine efforts to ensure effective use of \n     assets, a fuller development of the pertinent facts and a \n     timelier resolution. This alone would be a lasting \n     contribution if brought to fruition.\n       I believe that as the Assistant Attorney General for Civil \n     Rights, he will remain fully cognizant of the need and \n     expectations of the people of the United States to be \n     provided effective, efficient and fair law enforcement \n     services. I am convinced that he will do his utmost to \n     insuring that honest and hardworking police officers are not \n     tarnished by the acts of a few miscreants.\n       Thank you for considering my perspective in considering \n     this important appointment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                William L.

Orrin Hatch,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I am aware of the fact that the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee is considering the nomination of Bill \n     Lann Lee for the post of Assistant Attorney General for Civil \n     Rights. As the lead attorney representing the Los Angeles \n     County Metropolitan Transportation Authority in the case of \n     Labor/Community Strategy Center, et al. v. Los Angeles County \n     Metropolitan Transportation Authority (the ``LACMTA \n     litigation''), I came to know Bill Lann Lee quite well. We \n     clashed on many issues during the course of that litigation. \n     However, I have nothing but the highest regard for Mr. Lann \n     Lee as an attorney and as a gentleman.\n       Additionally, as a former prosecutor, it is my belief that \n     the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights must be an \n     individual who is pragmatic. During the course of the LACMTA \n     litigation, we were able to work with Mr. Lee to reach \n     compromises on a number of substantial issues--the most \n     important of which was the Consent Decree that resolved the \n     litigation. Were it not for Mr. Lee's pragmatic approach, the \n     parties would never have been able to resolve their \n     differences.\n       Notwithstanding the significant disparity between Mr. Lee's \n     political philosophy and my own, I cannot think of a better \n     candidate to fill the position of Assistant Attorney General \n     for Civil Rights than Bill Lann Lee.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Kenneth Klein,\n     of Riordan & McKinzie.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12910-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE JOURNAL\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of calendar No. 707, H.R. 1023.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1023) to provide for compassionate payments \n     with regard to individuals with blood-clotting disorders, \n     such as hemophilia, who contracted human immunodeficiency \n     virus due to contaminated blood products, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, H.R. 1023, the Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief \nFund Act, would authorize the establishment of a fund from which \ncompassionate payments would be made to people with hemophilia who \ncontracted HIV/AIDS through tainted blood products during the early \n1980s. These people were victimized by the failure of the federal \ngovernment to safeguard these blood products--failures included \ninadequate measures to screen out high-risk donors and long-delayed \nrecalls of blood products known to pose an elevated risk of infection. \nDuring the time period specified in the legislation, approximately \n7,200 victims were infected. Each victim--or the victim's family--would \nreceive a single $100,000 payment. The total authorization is $750,000, \nwhich would have to be separately appropriated. The relief fund sunsets \nafter 5 years. H.R. 1023 passed the House without objection on the \nsuspension calendar in May. Similar legislation in the Senate (S. 358), \nwhich I sponsored, has 62 bipartisan cosponsors.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I rise to make remarks concerning the Ricky Ray \nHemophilia Relief Fund Act to provide compassionate payments to \nhemophiliac victims of the blood supply crisis of the 1980s. The House \npassed the bill last May; unfortunately the Senate may not be able to \npass a bill this year. The tragedy of the blood supply's infection has \nbrought unbearable pain to families all over the country. I have heard \nfrom hundreds of these individuals and families over the past months, \nand I had hoped this bill would bring some closure to the grief of \nthousands of families who have suffered because of the blood crisis of \nthe 1980s.\n  I am saddened, however, that the bill that passed the House \nacknowledged fewer than half the victims of the blood supply crisis. \nAlong with Senators Warner and Faircloth, I have fought to include \nvictims of transfusion-associated AIDS in the bill this year. They are \nvictims of the same blood supply crisis and are just as deserving of \nacknowledgment and compassion from the federal government.\n  I cannot overstate my disappointment, and I can only imagine their \npain. This is a group of people that has suffered a great tragedy. In \ntheir minds, in the minds of the hemophiliac community, and in the \nminds of members who have advocated for the Ricky Ray bill, the federal \ngovernment played a role in the tragedy. It would be bad enough for the \nfederal government to never step forward and acknowledge the tragedy, \nbut passing a bill without them would have been the worst kind of \naffront. We would have acknowledged the tragedy, but ignored the \ndistress it has brought to this particular community.\n  With commitment from a few of my key colleagues that we would pass a \nbill for transfusion-associated AIDS cases next year, I supported \npassage of H.R. 1023. I want to take this opportunity to discuss some \nof the background of the bill and the reasons that I have fought so \nhard to include the transfusion-associated AIDS community in the Ricky \nRay bill this year.\n  While financial need and simple compassion for the tragedy suffered \nmay be two reasons of many to pass this bill, these reasons alone \ncannot justify government payments to victims of the blood supply. The \nbill is heavily rooted in the belief that in the early to mid-1980s the \ngovernment failed to protect users of the blood supply. The record that \nhas been built in the Senate in floor speeches and in testimony \nprovided at the Labor Committee hearing reflects this reason above all \nothers for passing this bill.\n  Last October the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources held a \nhearing on ``HIV/AIDS: Recent Developments and Future Opportunities.'' \nA good portion of that hearing was devoted to a discussion on the blood \ncrisis of the 1980s, resulting in the HIV infection of thousands of \nAmericans who trusted that the blood or blood products with which they \nwere treated was safe. Witnesses at the hearing included John Williams, \nthe father of a child who contracted HIV from the clotting factor and \ndied at the age of 18, and\n\n[[Page S12913]]\n\nDonna McCullough, a young woman who contracted HIV when she received a \nblood transfusion after a miscarriage.\n  Several witnesses at the hearing, including my colleagues Senator \nMike DeWine and Congressman Porter Goss, testified that the federal \ngovernment played a role in bringing on this tragedy and therefore owes \nthis expression of compassion to the community affected.\n  Witnesses testified that the federal government is the watchdog \ncharged with protecting the blood supply and that the government failed \nto respond aggressively to the early signs of blood borne diseases. The \ngovernment did not do all it could have done to screen donors and test \nblood. The government failed to recall potentially contaminated blood \nand blood products; and then, knowing that transfusion of HIV-infected \nblood and blood products led to HIV infection, knowing that some of the \nblood was contaminated, and knowing that people were using it, the \ngovernment still failed to notify people who were at risk. The details \nof the government's role were outlined in an Institute of Medicine \n(IOM) report published in 1995.\n\n\n                    the institute of medicine report\n\n  The IOM was commissioned to assess what happened in the 1980s with \nthe hope of avoiding another crisis like the one that has devastated \nthese families. The resulting report, ``HIV and the Blood Supply: An \nAnalysis of Crisis Decisionmaking'' made criticisms of the government's \nhandling of the blood crisis and has been cited many times in support \nof the Ricky Ray bill. Witnesses at the hearing spoke about the report \nand its findings, and it has been quoted repeatedly by advocates for \nthe Ricky Ray bill.\n  The report is usually quoted in a way that highlights the \nshortcomings of government decision-making as they affected the \nhemophiliac community. But there is more to the report, and I would \nlike to outline some of the points that are made most often with regard \nto the IOM report--both because I think the findings of the report \nprovide insight as to why the Ricky Ray bill has enjoyed the support it \nhas, and also to demonstrate that the IOM findings applied equally to \nthe transfusion community.\n  The IOM Committee found a ``failure of leadership'' with regard to \nthe government's role in ensuring the safety of the blood supply. We \nknow that ``failure of leadership'' led to the HIV infection of more \nthan one-half of the Nation's hemophilia population. In fact, the IOM \nCommittee identified problems that:\n\n     indicated a failure of leadership and inadequate \n     institutional decision making processes in 1983 and 1984. No \n     person or agency was able to coordinate all of the \n     organizations sharing the public health responsibility for \n     achieving a safe blood supply.\n\n  The suggestion that only the hemophiliac community was affected by a \n``failure of leadership'' is an inaccurate representation of the \nreport's findings. More importantly, that representation tragically \nexcludes transfusion-associated AIDS cases, a community that is equally \ndeserving of acknowledgment. Any failings of the government with regard \nto ensuring a safe blood supply clearly affected transfusion recipients \nas well as hemophiliacs.\n  The IOM Committee also concluded that:\n\n     when confronted with a range of options for using donor \n     screening and deferral to reduce the probability of spreading \n     HIV through the blood supply, blood bank officials and \n     federal authorities consistently chose the least aggressive \n     option that was justifiable.\n\n  The government's decision to use least aggressive options with regard \nto donor screening and deferral decisions not only bypassed an \nopportunity to slow the spread of HIV within the hemophilia community, \nit resulted in thousands of cases of transfusion-associated AIDS. If \ninfected blood had not been donated, no one would have been infected.\n  The IOM report outlined several specific areas where it found that \nthe government failed to provide leadership, including:\n  March, 1983 letters relating to donor screening were unclear and not \nspecific in their directives.\n  A July, 1983 decision not to recall plasma products automatically \nwhenever linked to individual donors identified as having or suspected \nof having AIDS.\n  Delay in FDA's formal decision to recommend tracing recipients of \ntransfusions from a donor who was later found to have HIV.\n  Each of these failures has been described on this floor with regard \nto how it affected the hemophiliac community, leaving the strong \nimpression that only the hemophiliac community was affected. Again, \nwith full understanding of the facts, it is obvious that each of these \ndecision points affects not only a hemophiliac in receipt of an \ninfected blood product, but any recipient of an infected blood \ntransfusion, whether hemophiliac, surgical patient, or a mother who had \njust lost her first child to a miscarriage.\n  The IOM used the phrase ``missed opportunities'' to characterize the \ngovernment's activities during the early and mid-1980s. Advocates for \nthe Ricky Ray bill have made much of how the ``missed opportunities'' \naffected the hemophiliac community. The IOM said:\n\n       The Committee believes that it was reasonable to require \n     blood banks to implement these two screening procedures \n     [screening donors and testing blood for surrogate markers] in \n     January 1983. The FDA's failure to require this is evidence \n     that the agency did not adequately use its regulatory \n     authority and therefore missed opportunities to protect the \n     public health.\n\n  Seen in context, the ``missed opportunities'' argument, like the \n``failure of leadership'' argument, applies equally to the transfusion-\nassociated AIDS cases.\n\n\n                             Legal Barriers\n\n  Mr. Williams and others at the hearing last October testified that \nthe hemophiliac community has found it nearly impossible to make \nrecovery through the courts because of blood shield laws in most states \nthat raise the burden of proof for product liability claims for blood \nand blood products. In addition, all states have statutes of \nlimitations that prohibit litigation if the suit was not filed within a \ncertain period of time. These arguments also have been presented on the \nSenate floor in support of the Ricky Ray bill and the hemophiliac \ncommunity.\n  Again, these legal barriers also apply to the transfusion cases. \nTransfusion-associated AIDS victims are subject to the same blood \nshield laws and statutes of limitations that Mr. Williams mentioned at \nthe Labor Committee hearing last fall. I heard from one father in \nVirginia who described the humility of being laughed at as the winning \ndefense attorneys left the courtroom. He and his wife had filed suit \nafter their three-year old son died of AIDS. The boy had been infected \nby a transfusion he received as an infant. Is he any less deserving?\n  Furthermore, we must note that the hemophiliac community has settled \na class action with the factor manufacturers for $100,000 per infected \nindividual. The transfusion community has won no such class action \naward. Some people may think that most transfusion victims recovered \nmillions of dollars in court, and therefore need not be helped in this \nlegislation. That is simply not the case. While in a very few cases \nindividuals in this group were able to track the source of their \ninfection and bring suit successfully against the blood bank, the vast \nmajority were not.\n  According to the book ``Transfusion-Associated AIDS,'' by Robert K. \nJenner, an attorney who has represented both hemophiliac and \ntransfusion victims, only 2-6% of transfusion victims have received any \ncompensation through legal action. He cites a study conducted by \nTransfusion magazine, and notes that only 150-300 transfusion lawsuits \nwere filed. Of those, only 40 went to trial, and only 14 resulted in \nawards. Many of the 14 awards were later reduced by the court or \nsettled after trial for a lesser amount.\n\n  Combining these numbers with CDC's estimate that there are 10,214 \nvictims of transfusion-associated AIDS from the early and mid-1980s, we \ncan calculate that somewhere between 1.5 to 3% of transfusion cases \nfiled suit, and far less than 1% of those experienced recovery anywhere \nnear the hundreds of thousands we have been led to believe they \nreceived in court.\n\n\n                    Compensation in Other Countries\n\n  We have been reminded frequently that the U.S. is the last developed \ncountry to provide assistance/compensation to hemophiliacs who were \ninfected with HIV by contaminated\n\n[[Page S12914]]\n\nblood. What we haven't heard is that many of those countries included \nother victims of the blood supply crisis in their compensation \nprograms, including Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, and \nSwitzerland.\n\n\n                     Estimating Transfusion Victims\n\n  I know some of my colleagues may be concerned that we don't know \nenough about the transfusion victim community to have confidence in the \nnumber of victims we have calculated. I believe we know quite a bit. \nThe estimated number of transfusion victims, 10,214, is based on data \nobtained from the Centers for Disease Control, the federal agency \ncharged with tracking incidence of AIDS. Further, the Congressional \nBudget Office has analyzed this number and concurs with the estimate.\n  While we cannot identify these victims by name, I don't see how we \ncould and I don't see why we need to. The legislation that was reported \nunanimously by the Committee on Labor and Human Resources, S. 2564, \nestablishes appropriate criteria that must be demonstrated in order to \ncollect a compassionate payment.\n  We know that the transfusion victims acquired AIDS through the same \nmode of transmission as the hemophiliac community and they have \nsuffered greatly. Like the hemophiliac community, some of them passed \nthe disease on to their spouses and children and must live with that \npain. Like the hemophilia community, some of them have experienced \nextreme financial difficulty because of the combined effect of their \nunderlying disease and AIDS.\n  Regardless of our ability to generalize about this group of people, \nwe know that they have suffered greatly because of the blood supply \ncrisis, and we owe them the same acknowledgment and compassion that we \nhave offered to the hemophilia community.\n\n\n                          No Washington Lobby\n\n  There are roughly 10,000 people in addition to hemophiliacs who \nsuffered extreme tragedy because of the blood supply crisis of the \n1980s. The transfusion community is in fact somewhat bigger than the \nhemophiliac community. That fact may surprise my colleagues, because \nmost of them have probably not been lobbied by this community.\n  Upon reflection it will become clear why this community has not been \nactively lobbying. They have no political voice and no Washington \noffice providing them with daily updates on the status of their bill. \nThey don't have a lobbying voice in Washington or a strong grassroots \nnetwork because they are not united by a single disease like \nhemophilia.\n  There is one courageous individual working on behalf of this group \nwho deserves mention. Steve Grissom is the President of a group called \nNational Association for Victims of Transfusion-Acquired AIDS, or \nNAVTA. Steve is in his mid-40s and suffers from AIDS acquired from \nblood transfusions he received to treat his leukemia. Steve is a \nstrong, proud man who certainly does not want our pity. I want to \nexpress my deep respect for the man Steve is and the work he has done \nto help the cause of thousands who suffer as he does.\n  I met with Steve last summer in my office here in Washington. He \ndrove from North Carolina with his wife and young daughter. Steve moves \nin a wheelchair and breathes with the assistance of an oxygen tank. I'm \nnot sure whether he chose to drive rather than fly all the way to \nWashington because it's easier on his breathing or because of financial \nconstraints, and I'm not going to ask. Either way, making that long \ndrive is symbolic of his commitment.\n  Steve works by himself out of his home with the assistance of e-mail, \nfax machines, and the internet. He has done everything he can think of \nand can afford to do to connect with other people who share his \ncircumstances. It is more difficult than any of us can imagine to try \norganize the population that Steve is trying to reach. Except for HIV \nor AIDS, these people have nothing in common. And the one thing they do \nhave in common--AIDS--carries enormous stigma. Privacy considerations \nmake it nearly impossible for this community to network and form an \neffective grassroots lobby. How should these people go about finding \neach other?\n  They also have no money. They have no substantial membership to \nsupport campaigns to alert other victims to their existence. They have \nno pharmaceutical or corporate partners who want to collaborate with \nthem to advance a research or policy agenda related to their disease, \nor want to make contributions to the work of NAVTA in the name of good \npublic relations.\n  In addition to paying tribute to Steve and NAVTA for the enormous \nwork he has done to support my efforts in the Senate, I also want to \ndraw attention to the generous spirit of NAVTA. Transfusion-associated \nAIDS victims know they should have been included in the Ricky Ray bill. \nEven so, in their contacts with me they have always been clear that \nthey did not want to be added to the bill if that would preclude \npassage. Theirs is a generosity of spirit seldom seen in Washington.\n  As it happened, NAVTA copied the National Hemophilia Foundation on \nits June letter expressing NAVTA's wish that transfusion cases not be \nthe reason the bill dies. Within a week the letter was being circulated \non Capitol Hill as an argument for excluding transfusion victims.\n\n\n                          Timing and Procedure\n\n  The House passed its version of the Ricky Ray bill in May, 1998. At \nthe time of the Committee's hearing on this issue (October, 1997) I had \nasserted my view that the bill should extend its compassion to other \nvictims, and immediately upon House passage I began work on that \neffort.\n  The immediate message from the advocates of the bill was that there \nwas not time to make these changes. I did not believe that then and I \ndon't believe it now. The changes I proposed were simple in nature and \nI never heard a good reason that they couldn't be made.\n  In June, I circulated draft language that would include the \ntransfusion community. Early in July full-page advertisements ran in \nthe Vermont Sunday papers asserting that I was holding up the bill in \nmy Committee. This while I was still waiting for feedback on my \nlanguage from the same group that ran the ads.\n  Nonetheless, I continued to press forward and eventually received \nfeedback from all interested parties. There were no substantive \ncomments to the changes I proposed. In fact, advocates for the bill \nagreed that transfusion victims had suffered a tragedy similar to their \nown. The objection I continued to hear was that there wasn't time in \nthe legislative session to complete the process.\n  Once I had received feedback from all interested parties, I \ninformally queried my Committee members about discharging the bill from \nthe Committee--this was in July just before the August recess. I was \ntold there would be objections; significantly, those objections were \nunrelated to the changes I had made to the bill. It became apparent \nthat a mark-up would be required, so at the end of July my proposed \nlanguage was published in the Congressional Record.\n  I scheduled a Committee markup of the Ricky Ray bill for September 9. \nBecause there was not a quorum present we were unable to conduct \nCommittee business that day. I attempted to complete the markup two \nmore times in the following week, but both times scheduling changes on \nthe floor precluded our meeting. Early in the week of September 14, \nSenator DeWine and I agreed that the prudent next step would be to \nallow both my Chairman's mark and H.R. 1023 to be passed from the \nCommittee.\n  We rescheduled the markup for September 16, and on that day both \nbills passed the Committee by voice vote. I promised then that I would \ndo everything I could to pass a bill that included both communities. I \nalso promised that if it became clear that we couldn't get the changes \npassed this year, I would agree to passage of the Ricky Ray bill \nwithout the transfusion community. That is where we now find ourselves, \nso, with assurances that we will add transfusion victims next year, I \nsupport passing H.R. 1023.\n  In closing, I would like to remind my colleagues who the transfusion \nvictims are. They are pregnant Moms, accident victims, and people like \nSteve Grissom, mentioned earlier. Until now they were united only in \ntheir trust in a blood supply that gave them AIDS. I hope that, if \nnothing else, our efforts this year in the Senate will help other \ntransfusion victims to find Steve and\n\n[[Page S12915]]\n\nNAVTA so that, next year, my colleagues will hear from the other \nvictims of the blood supply crisis.\n  They are out there and they, too, deserve our acknowledgment and \ncompassion.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator DeWine and commend \nhim for his dedicated effort in this area. He felt that a wrong had \nbeen committed and that people had suffered because of no mistake of \ntheir own. Something had to be done to right the wrong. This is the \nbill that has been known as the Ricky Ray Relief Fund.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read the \nthird time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating to the bill appear at this point in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 1023) was considered read the third time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12912-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12915-S12916]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n AMENDING SENATE RESOLUTION 209 TO PROVIDE BUDGET LEVELS IN THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 312 submitted earlier \ntoday by Senator Domenici.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 312) to amend Senate Resolution 209 \n     in order to provide budget levels in the Senate for purposes \n     of Fiscal Year 1999 and include the appropriate budgetary \n     levels for fiscal years 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, for the information of the Senate, this \nresolution on behalf of Senator Lautenberg and myself is the so-called \ndeeming budget resolution. We have cleared this with our colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  Last year this Congress reached an historic agreement with the \nPresident. We enacted the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. I think those \npundits who like to suggest that this Congress has not done anything \nseem to conveniently forget that the balanced budget agreement was done \nin this Congress.\n  Nevertheless, that agreement and the implementing legislation--the \nBudget Enforcement Act of 1997--put in place for 5 years spending \nlimits on appropriated accounts and extended various other fiscal \nenforcement tools. I have often thought of this legislation as a first \nstep in creating a biennial budgeting and appropriations process. We \nhave operated in the second session of this Congress under those \nspending caps and applied the discipline of that act to help us secure \nthe first balanced budget in decades.\n  The levels set forth in this Senate resolution reflect the bipartisan \nbalanced budget agreement--updated for the most recent fiscal and \neconomic information provided to us by the Congressional Budget Office \nand for legislation enacted since the last budget resolution was agreed \nto.\n  This is similar to the action which the Senate took on April 2 of \nthis year when we passed S. Res. 209 which provided a section 302 \nallocation to the Committee on Appropriations in advance of completing \naction on a budget resolution.\n  What we have done today is simply provide committee spending \nallocations and establish overall aggregate levels of spending and \nrevenues so that we can continue the fiscal discipline inherent in our \nbudget rules--this means we will be able to enforce our section 302 and \n311 points of order and our pay-as-you-go rule.\n  I feel this discipline has been critical to our ability to uphold the \nbipartisan balanced budget agreement and led us to a period of budget \nsurpluses. Thus we should not let the fact that we were unable to \ncomplete conference prevent us from going forward with the budget rules \nwhich have served us so well in the past.\n  I am hopeful that early in the next Congress we might consummate the \n2 year budgeting and appropriations process in statute along with other \nchanges to the Budget Act necessitated by the changed environment of \nprojected budget surpluses.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the allocations of budget \nauthority and outlays under section 302 of the Budget Act for Senate \nauthorizing committees be printed in the Record. The Senate \nappropriations already received its allocation on April 2 of this year \nwhen the Senate adopted S. Res. 209.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nSENATE COMMITTEE BUDGET AUTHORITY AND OUTLAY ALLOCATIONS PURSUANT TO SECTION 302 OF THE

Mr. President, I support this resolution, which is \nessentially a technical change that will facilitate enforcement of the \nBudget Act in the Senate.\n  This resolution would update the following figures for purposes of \nenforcing points of order in the Senate only. First, aggregates for \nrevenues, budget authority, outlays, and Social Security revenues and \noutlays. Second, Section 302(a) allocations for Senate committees.\n  The resolution does not include functional totals or reconciliation \ninstructions. It would not endorse the spending priorities included in \nthe Senate-passed resolution, or any other spending priorities, for \nthat matter. Also, it would not apply to the House of Representatives. \nIt therefore it not a budget resolution in any sense.\n  The allocations and aggregates in this resolution are based on CBO's \nAugust baseline estimates, updated for enacted legislation and some \ntechnical corrections. The resolution is based on legislation enacted \nas of today. However, it includes a provision allowing the Chairman to \nrevise the aggregates and allocations once more based only on \nlegislation enacted through the end of the session. This means that \neach committee, and the Senate paygo ledger, will start the year with a \nclean slate.\n  Mr. President, since Congress has not adopted a budget resolution for \nFY99, the Senate is now operating under the budget resolution approved \nlast year for FY98 and beyond. This has the effect of limiting the \navailability of points of order to enforce the basic rules of the \nBalanced Budget Agreement.\n  For example, when the Senate considers legislation proposing revenue \nreductions or new mandatory spending, the Senate's ``pay-as-you-go'' \nrules require that all costs be offset in the first, the first five, \nand the second five years of the budget resolution in effect at the \ntime. Since we are now operating under last year's resolution, there is \nnow no point of order available based on the failure of such \nlegislation, for example, to offset all costs in the first year after \nenactment. This resolution would address this problem.\n  So, Mr. President, I support this resolution. It is not a budget \nresolution. It does not propose a set of spending priorities. It is \nsimply a technical change that will help us enforce the basic structure \nof the Budget Enforcement Act.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that \nany statements relating to the resolution appear at this point in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 312) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 312\n\n       Resolved, That Senate Resolution 209, agreed to April 2, \n     1999 (105th Congress), is amended by striking all after the \n     resolving clause and inserting the following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 2263, which is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2263) to authorize and request the President \n     to award the congressional Medal of Honor posthumously to \n     Theodore Roosevelt for his gallant and heroic actions in the \n     attack on San Juan Heights, Cuba, during the Spanish-American \n     War.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, as the Senate considers H.R. 2263, a \nbill to authorize the President to award the Medal of Honor to Theodore \nRoosevelt for his actions on San Juan Heights in cuba during the \nSpanish-American War, I want to clarify what we are doing. This bill \ndoes not award the Medal of Honor to Theodore Roosevelt. It does \nauthorize the President to award the Medal of Honor to then Colonel \nRoosevelt.\n  Colonel Roosevelt's actions on San Juan Heights may well merit the \naward of the Medal of Honor. However, in order to make such a \ndetermination, one must carefully review the historical record, \nincluding any eyewitness\n\n[[Page S12917]]\n\naccounts that may be available, and evaluate the record against the \ncriteria for award of the Medal of Honor that was applied to other \nmembers of the Armed forces who were recommended for the Medal of Honor \nduring the Spanish-American War. In my opinion, this is a task that can \nonly be performed by the military services.\n  In fact, in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n1996, we established a procedure in which the military services would \nevaluate recommendations for awards for past actions and notify the \nCommittee on Armed Services of those found to be meritorious. Each \nyear, in the National Defense Authorization Act, we waive the time \nlimits for those awards recommended by the Secretaries of the Military \nDepartments so that the award may be made.\n  Mr. President, Senator Levin and myself, as well as Congressmen \nSpence, Skelton, and McHale have agreed to and signed a letter to the \nPresident regarding this issue. This letter makes it clear that we \nbelieve the President should consult with the Secretary of the Army, \nwho is reviewing the accounts of Colonel Roosevelt's actions before \ndeciding to award the Medal of Honor to Theodore Roosevelt. I ask \nunanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record following \nmy remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, this bill should not be seen as a \nprecedent for Congressional decisions on military awards. Our \nlegislation in 1996 established a procedure designed to ensure that \nheroic and meritorious actions do not go unrecognized solely due to the \npassage of time. However, the procedure also preserves the integrity of \nthe military award system which is important to our military services \nand the American people.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I want to commend Congressman McHale for \nhis determined efforts in bringing this matter to our attention. It is \nmy fervent hope that Colonel Roosevelt's action will be appropriately \nrecognized while preserving the time honored processes and traditions \nwithin our military services for awarding our Nation's most hallowed \naward for valor, the Medal of Honor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                  Committee on Armed Services,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 20, 1998.\n     The President,\n     The White House, Washington, DC 20500\n       Dear Mr. President: We want to share our views with you on \n     H.R. 2263, a bill that authorizes and requests you to award \n     the Medal of Honor posthumously to Theodore Roosevelt for his \n     actions in the attack on San Juan Heights, Cuba during the \n     Spanish American War.\n       We supported this legislation with the intent and \n     understanding that: (a) prior to reaching a decision on \n     awarding the Medal of Honor posthumously to Theodore \n     Roosevelt pursuant to this legislation, you will seek the \n     advice of the Secretary of the Army; (b) Theodore Roosevelt \n     will be considered for eligibility for the Medal of Honor \n     based on the same standard of merit that was applied to other \n     members of the armed forces who received this medal during \n     the Spanish American War; and (c) the Secretary of the Army \n     will prepare a full and formal record of Theodore Roosevelt's \n     valor, inviting public submissions, with emphasis on the \n     eyewitness and contemporaneous accounts of Roosevelt's \n     battlefield courage.\n       If an injustice was done to Theodore Roosevelt in \n     withholding the Medal of Honor, we believe it should be \n     corrected.\n           Sincerely,\n     Carl Levin,\n       Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Armed Services, \n     United States Senate.\n     Strom Thurmond,\n       Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, United States \n     Senate.\n     Ike Skelton,\n       Ranking Minority Member, Committee on National Security, \n     United States House of Representatives.\n     Floyd Spence,\n       Chairman, Committee on National Security, United States \n     House of Representatives.\n     Paul McHale,\n       Member, Committee on National Security, United States House \n     of Representatives.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I support this legislation that authorizes \nand requests the President to award the Medal of Honor posthumously to \nTheodore Roosevelt for his actions in the attack on San Juan Heights, \nCuba during the Spanish American War. I support this legislation \nbecause the letter to the President that Senator Thurmond has put in \nthe Record makes clear the congressional intent in passing this \nlegislation.\n  I want to briefly summarize the key points of this letter. It is our \nintent and understanding that: prior to reaching a decision on awarding \nthe Medal of Honor posthumously to Theodore Roosevelt pursuant to this \nlegislation, the President will seek the advice of the Secretary of the \nArmy; Theodore Roosevelt will be considered for eligibility for the \nMedal of Honor based on the same standard of merit that was applied to \nother members of the armed forces who received this medal during the \nSpanish American War; and the Secretary of the Army will prepare a full \nand formal record of Theodore Roosevelt's valor, inviting public \nsubmissions, with emphasis on the eyewitness and contemporaneous \naccounts of Roosevelt's battlefield courage.\n  Mr. President, military awards and decorations--particularly \ndecorations for valor--are a hallowed part of the military services' \ncore values and traditions, and are critical to the morale and esprit \nof the men and women who serve in our armed forces. In my view, the \ndecision to award a medal of valor is the prerogative of the military \nservice, not the Congress. That is why Congress recently enacted \nsection 1130 of Title 10 United States Code. This section allows \nMembers of Congress to request a Service Secretary to review proposals \nfor military decorations that were not previously submitted in a timely \nfashion, but leaves the final determination as to the merits of \napproving the decoration to the Service Secretary.\n  There are many people who believe that Theodore Roosevelt's actions \nin the attack on San Juan Heights are deserving of this high honor, and \nthat this honor was withheld from him at the time despite the \nrecommendation of his military chain of command. I believe that a \ncomplete record should be assembled and the entire issue should be \ncarefully reviewed by the Army. Secretary of the Army Louis Caldera \nrecently pledged to Congress that the Army is conducting this review, \nand he has agreed to review personally all of the material in this \ncase.\n  Mr. President, if an injustice was done to Theodore Roosevelt in \nwithholding the Medal of Honor, it should be corrected. But the \nlegislation we are passing today is advisory and not directive. Before \nthe President reaches a final decision on whether to award the Medal of \nHonor to Theodore Roosevelt, our letter to the President makes clear \nthe congressional intent that he should consult with the Secretary of \nthe Army.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of H.R. \n2263, legislation that encourages the posthumous award of the Medal of \nHonor to Theodore Roosevelt.\n  The courage demonstrated by Col. Theodore Roosevelt as he led the \nFirst US Volunteer Cavalry in an attack on San Juan Heights, Cuba, has \nrightly become a part of American folklore. That day, on July 1, 1898, \nin one of the most famous military actions in our nation's history, \nRoosevelt showed why he is rightly regarded as an American hero.\n  Roosevelt had every reason to expect to be awarded the Medal of \nHonor. Award of this most prestigious medal to ``TR'' was recommended \nby his commanding general.\n  Unfortunately, political considerations at the time stood in the way. \nAs Roosevelt's great grandson, Tweed Roosevelt, testified before \nCongress last month, however, TR did not take the occasion of his \nassumption of the presidency to retaliate against those who had denied \nhim an award he clearly deserved. The same character he showed in \nbattle during the Spanish-American War continued to be evident once \nRoosevelt reached the pinnacle of power in the United States.\n  Fortunately, today the Senate is taking legislative action that will \nallow this injustice to be corrected. One century after TR and his \nRoughriders\n\n[[Page S12918]]\n\ncharged up San Juan Heights, the Senate stands ready to pass \nlegislation that would authorize and request that the Medal of Honor be \nawarded posthumously to Theodore Roosevelt. I was pleased to work with \nthe distinguished leadership of the Senate Armed Services Committee on \nthis matter, and thank them for their good work.\n  As those of my colleagues who have studied Roosevelt's life are \naware, my state has a special connection with Theodore Roosevelt. TR \nliked to say that the years he spent in the Badlands of North Dakota \nwere the best of his life. Today, Theodore Roosevelt National Park \nstands as an enduring reminder of TR's love for North Dakota and the \nprofound impact that my state had on this remarkable American.\n  As a North Dakotan and an American, I am pleased that the life and \nideas of Theodore Roosevelt are receiving renewed attention. TR's \nruggedness, patriotism, optimism, and spirit reflect what is best about \nour country. He also articulated a vision of America that remains \ncompelling today, and merits a new look. Teddy Roosevelt called for \nmaintaining a strong national defense, protecting our environmental \ntreasures, encouraging entrepreneurship, and, by broadening access to \neducation and health care, ensuring that every American has a viable \nshot at realizing their dreams. This is a vision we all would do well \nto pursue.\n  Again, Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues for their support \nof the legislation before us today, and congratulate the Armed Services \nCommittee for its leadership in seeing that an historical wrong can be \nrighted before the end of this session of Congress. Theodore Roosevelt \nwas a great American who displayed remarkable courage in battle. It is \ngood to know that the bill we will pass today will help get him the \nrecognition he deserves.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to indicate my \nstrong support for this bill. It is my sincere conviction that we are \ntoday making right a historic wrong. One hundred years ago, Theodore \nRoosevelt was denied the Congressional Medal of Honor simply because he \nattempted to force the War Department to return sick veterans of the \nSpanish-American War to their homes in the United States. In so doing, \nhe embarrassed a political rival, who it just so happened was also the \nSecretary of War. As a result, despite the unanimous recommendation of \nhis uniformed superiors, his political superior denied him the nation's \nhighest military honor.\n  On July 1, 1898, Colonel Theodore Roosevelt, commander of the 1st \nU.S. Volunteer Cavalry Regiment--the famed ``Rough Riders''--was just \n39 years of age. He had resigned his position as Assistant Secretary of \nthe Navy so that he could help organize the regiment. American forces, \nbattling both the Spanish and the Cuban jungle, prepared to storm San \nJuan Hill and the heights surrounding the strategic port city of \nSantiago, Cuba. within the protected walls surrounding the port of \nSantiago sat the Spanish fleet, which had to be neutralized if the \nUnited States was to win the war.\n  The American attack against Kettle Hill and San Juan Hill was pinned \ndown immediately by the merciless fire of the Spanish forces entrenched \non the heights above. According to one participant, ``the situation was \ndesperate. Our troops could not retreat as the trail for two miles \nbehind them was wedged with men. They could not remain where they were \nfor they were being shot to pieces. . .'' U.S. forces still hunkered \ndown at the foot of the hill were unable to return fire.\n  After long delay, Roosevelt received orders to advance. With \nRoosevelt at their lead, the Rough Riders advanced to the front of the \nAmerican line. Determined to rally the American forces to victory, \nRoosevelt shouted: ``If you don't want to go forward, let my men \npass.'' Roosevelt dared and goaded men in the rear forward until they \ncrowded the ones in front of them. The whole line, tired of waiting and \neager to close with the enemy, was straining to go forward.\n  Leading the charge up the hill, Roosevelt waved his hat and went up \nthe hill with a rush. With Roosevelt in the lead, thee American forces \nreached the summit of Kettle Hill and swept aside the last of the \nSpanish defenders. Without hesitating, Roosevelt directed his men to \nfire against the Spanish defenders on nearby San Juan Hill, where \nanother American force was advancing in the face of heavy fire. \nRallying his forces, Roosevelt leapt forward advancing into the valley \nbetween Kettle Hill and San Juan Hill. In his excitement to charge the \nSpanish position, Roosevelt soon realized instead of the entire \nregiment following him, only five other men had joined him in the \ncharge.\n  Roosevelt then proceeded to run back to Kettle Hill, where he angrily \nyelled at the regiment to follow him. The Rough Riders responded by \nshouting: ``We didn't see you go! Lead on and we will follow!'' Lead he \ndid. Once again, Roosevelt, this time with the Rough Riders behind, \nrushed up San Juan Hill for a second time. Once again, Roosevelt led \nhis men into the Spanish line on the top of the height. Roosevelt then \nsucceeded in organizing and leading the defense of the heights \nthroughout the night. Out of four hundred men in the regiment, 86 had \nbeen killed or wounded, six were missing and another 40 were struck \nwith heat exhaustion.\n  Military experts, historians, and everyone who had witnessed both the \ncharge up Kettle Hill and San Juan Hill agreed that they had occurred \nand succeeded because of the man who had led them. For his actions, \nColonel Leonard Wood, 1st U.S. volunteer Cavalry, recommended Roosevelt \nfor the Congressional Medal of Honor. The recommendation received \nendorsement throughout the chain of command.\n  After the cessation of hostilities, the American forces remaining on \nCuba, including the rough riders, were ravaged by malaria and fever. \nThe commanders on Cuba, including Roosevelt and Leonard Wood, pleaded \nwith the War Department, to bring the men home. But Secretary of War \nAlger, who believed the troops were infected with yellow fever, wished \nto delay their return until the disease had run its course. Fearing \nthat the continued stay of the troops on the island would result in the \ndeath of thousands, Roosevelt, with the support of the other commanders \non the island, drafted a letter demanding that the troops be brought \nback home lest thousands die in Cuba.\n  The letter was published in the press, and was a great embarrassment \nto President McKinley and Secretary of War Alger. Although subsequently \nRoosevelt received credit for bringing the troops home, Alger rejected \nthe recommendation of Roosevelt's superiors that he be awarded the \nMedal of Honor for his actions. Roosevelt's wife would later write that \nAlger's rejection of Roosevelt's recommendation for the Medal of Honor \n``was one of the bitterest disappointments of his life.''\n  I will admit that I approached the prospect of legislating the \nnation's highest military award for valor with some concern. However, \nmy review of the facts of this case have convinced me that Teddy \nRoosevelt earned the Medal of Honor on the battlefield, only to see it \ndenied for political reasons. I am pleased, one hundred years later, to \nbe a part of correcting this injustice today.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I commend Congressman McHale and a number of \nHouse Members that took the time and stayed committed to this until we \ndid get it accomplished. From what I have learned about it, it is the \nright thing to do.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read the \nthird time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating to the bill be placed at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 2263) was considered read the third time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12916-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12918-S12936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               VETERANS BENEFITS IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

The Secretary shall seek to enter into the \n     agreement not later than two months after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n       (2)(A) If the Secretary is unable within the time period \n     set forth in paragraph (1) to enter into an agreement with \n     the Academy for the purposes of this section on terms \n     acceptable to the Secretary, the Secretary shall seek to \n     enter into an agreement for purposes of this section with \n     another appropriate scientific organization that is not part \n     of the Government, operates as a not-for-profit entity, and \n     has expertise and objectivity comparable to that of the \n     Academy.\n\n[[Page S12920]]\n\n       (B) If the Secretary enters into an agreement with another \n     organization under this paragraph, any reference in this \n     section to the National Academy of Sciences shall be treated \n     as a reference to such other organization.\n       (c) Review of Scientific Evidence.--(1) Under the agreement \n     under subsection (b), the National Academy of Sciences shall \n     conduct a comprehensive review and evaluation of the \n     available scientific and medical information regarding the \n     health status of Gulf War veterans and the health \n     consequences of exposures to risk factors during service in \n     the Persian Gulf War. In conducting such review and \n     evaluation, the Academy shall--\n       (A) identify the biological, chemical, or other toxic \n     agents, environmental or wartime hazards, or preventive \n     medicines or vaccines (including the agents specified in \n     subsection (d)(1)) to which members of the Armed Forces who \n     served in the Southwest Asia theater of operations during the \n     Persian Gulf War may have been exposed by reason of such \n     service;\n       (B) identify the illnesses associated with the agents, \n     hazards, or medicines or vaccines identified under \n     subparagraph (A); and\n       (C) identify the illnesses (including diagnosed illnesses \n     and undiagnosed illnesses) for which there is scientific \n     evidence of a higher prevalence among populations of Gulf War \n     veterans when compared with other appropriate populations of \n     individuals.\n       (2) In identifying illnesses under subparagraphs (B) and \n     (C) of paragraph (1), the Academy shall review and summarize \n     the relevant scientific evidence regarding illnesses, \n     including symptoms, adverse reproductive health outcomes, and \n     mortality, among the members described in paragraph (1)(A) \n     and among other appropriate populations of individuals.\n       (3) In conducting the review and evaluation under paragraph \n     (1), the Academy shall, for each illness identified under \n     subparagraph (B) or (C) of that paragraph, assess the latency \n     period, if any, between service or exposure to any potential \n     risk factor (including an agent, hazard, or medicine or \n     vaccine identified under subparagraph (A) of that paragraph) \n     and the manifestation of such illness.\n       (d) Specified Agents.--(1) In identifying under subsection \n     (c)(1)(A) the agents, hazards, or preventive medicines or \n     vaccines to which members of the Armed Forces may have been \n     exposed, the National Academy of Sciences shall consider the \n     following:\n       (A) The following organophosphorous pesticides:\n       (i) Chlorpyrifos.\n       (ii) Diazinon.\n       (iii) Dichlorvos.\n       (iv) Malathion.\n       (B) The following carbamate pesticides:\n       (i) Proxpur.\n       (ii) Carbaryl.\n       (iii) Methomyl.\n       (C) The carbamate pyridostigmine bromide used as nerve \n     agent prophylaxis.\n       (D) The following chlorinated hydrocarbons and other \n     pesticides and repellents:\n       (i) Lindane.\n       (ii) Pyrethrins.\n       (iii) Permethrins.\n       (iv) Rodenticides (bait).\n       (v) Repellent (DEET).\n       (E) The following low-level nerve agents and precursor \n     compounds at exposure levels below those which produce \n     immediately apparent incapacitating symptoms:\n       (i) Sarin.\n       (ii) Tabun.\n       (F) The following synthetic chemical compounds:\n       (i) Mustard agents at levels below those which cause \n     immediate blistering.\n       (ii) Volatile organic compounds.\n       (iii) Hydrazine.\n       (iv) Red fuming nitric acid.\n       (v) Solvents.\n       (G) The following sources of radiation:\n       (i) Depleted uranium.\n       (ii) Microwave radiation.\n       (iii) Radio frequency radiation.\n       (H) The following environmental particulates and \n     pollutants:\n       (i) Hydrogen sulfide.\n       (ii) Oil fire byproducts.\n       (iii) Diesel heater fumes.\n       (iv) Sand micro-particles.\n       (I) Diseases endemic to the region (including the \n     following):\n       (i) Leishmaniasis.\n       (ii) Sandfly fever.\n       (iii) Pathogenic escherichia coli.\n       (iv) Shigellosis.\n       (J) Time compressed administration of multiple live, \n     `attenuated', and toxoid vaccines.\n       (2) The consideration of agents, hazards, and medicines and \n     vaccines under paragraph (1) shall not preclude the Academy \n     from identifying other agents, hazards, or medicines or \n     vaccines to which members of the Armed Forces may have been \n     exposed for purposes of any report under subsection (h).\n       (3) Not later than six months after entry into the \n     agreement under subsection (b), the Academy shall submit to \n     the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the \n     House of Representatives a report specifying the agents, \n     hazards, and medicines and vaccines considered under \n     paragraph (1).\n       (e) Scientific Determinations Concerning Illnesses.--(1) \n     For each illness identified under subparagraph (B) or (C) of \n     subsection (c)(1), the National Academy of Sciences shall \n     determine (to the extent available scientific evidence \n     permits) whether there is scientific evidence of an \n     association of that illness with Gulf War service or exposure \n     during Gulf War service to one or more agents, hazards, or \n     medicines or vaccines. In making those determinations, the \n     Academy shall consider--\n       (A) the strength of scientific evidence, the replicability \n     of results, the statistical significance of results, and the \n     appropriateness of the scientific methods used to detect the \n     association;\n       (B) in any case where there is evidence of an apparent \n     association, whether there is reasonable confidence that that \n     apparent association is not due to chance, bias, or \n     confounding;\n       (C) the increased risk of the illness among human or animal \n     populations exposed to the agent, hazard, or medicine or \n     vaccine;\n       (D) whether a plausible biological mechanism or other \n     evidence of a causal relationship exists between exposure to \n     the agent, hazard, or medicine or vaccine and the illness;\n       (E) in any case where information about exposure levels is \n     available, whether the evidence indicates that the levels of \n     exposure of the studied populations were of the same \n     magnitude as the estimated likely exposures of Gulf War \n     veterans; and\n       (F) whether there is an increased risk of illness among \n     Gulf War veterans in comparison with appropriate peer groups.\n       (2) The Academy shall include in its reports under \n     subsection (h) a full discussion of the scientific evidence \n     and reasoning that led to its conclusions under this \n     subsection.\n       (f) Recommendations for Additional Scientific Studies.--(1) \n     Under the agreement under subsection (b), the National \n     Academy of Sciences shall make any recommendations that it \n     considers appropriate for additional scientific studies \n     (including studies relating to treatment models) to resolve \n     areas of continuing scientific uncertainty relating to the \n     health consequences of service in the Persian Gulf War or \n     exposure to toxic agents, environmental or wartime hazards, \n     or preventive medicines or vaccines associated with Gulf War \n     service.\n       (2) In making recommendations for additional studies, the \n     Academy shall consider the available scientific data, the \n     value and relevance of the information that could result from \n     such studies, and the cost and feasibility of carrying out \n     such studies.\n       (g) Subsequent Reviews.--(1) Under the agreement under \n     subsection (b), the National Academy of Sciences shall \n     conduct on a periodic and ongoing basis additional reviews of \n     the evidence and data relating to its activities under this \n     section.\n       (2) As part of each review under this subsection, the \n     Academy shall--\n       (A) conduct as comprehensive a review as is practicable of \n     the information referred to in subsection (c), the evidence \n     referred to in subsection (e), and the data referred to in \n     subsection (f) that became available since the last review of \n     such information, evidence, and data under this section; and\n       (B) make determinations under the subsections referred to \n     in subparagraph (A) on the basis of the results of such \n     review and all other reviews previously conducted for \n     purposes of this section.\n       (h) Reports by Academy.--(1) Under the agreement under \n     subsection (b), the National Academy of Sciences shall submit \n     to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the Senate and the \n     House of Representatives and the Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs periodic written reports regarding the Academy's \n     activities under the agreement.\n       (2) The first report under paragraph (1) shall be submitted \n     not later than two years after entry into the agreement under \n     subsection (b). That report shall include--\n       (A) the determinations and discussion referred to in \n     subsection (e); and\n       (B) any recommendations of the Academy under subsection \n     (f).\n       (3) Reports shall be submitted under this subsection at \n     least once every two years, as measured from the date of the \n     report under paragraph (2).\n       (4) In any report under this subsection (other than the \n     report under paragraph (2)), the Academy may specify an \n     absence of meaningful developments in the scientific or \n     medical community with respect to the activities of the \n     Academy under this section during the two-year period ending \n     on the date of such report.\n       (i) Reports by Secretary.--(1) The Secretary shall review \n     each report from the Academy under subsection (h).

Mr. President, as the ranking member of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I am enormously pleased that the Senate \nis considering this comprehensive bill which would make valuable \nchanges to a wide range of veterans' benefits and services. This \nlegislation represents the culmination of considerable oversight and \ninvestigation, hearings and markups in both the House and Senate, and \nthe normal flow of legislation and compromise which is the basis of \nreaching consensus. The bill does not represent all that I or others \ninvolved would have wanted; but it does represent the best that we \ncould do under the rules and budget constraints within which we \noperate.\n  Although the bill we consider today addresses many initiatives--from \nassisting Persian Gulf War veterans to providing educational assistance \nto health care professionals--I will mention only some of the issues \nwhich are of particular interest to me.\n\n\n              GULF WAR VETERANS' HEALTH CARE AND RESEARCH\n\n  Mr. President, H.R. 4110, as amended, represents a comprehensive \neffort to address the needs of our Gulf War veterans. In addition to \naddressing these veterans' health care needs, this legislation provides \nfor research on the prevention and treatment of post-conflict \nillnesses.\n  As Ranking Member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I have \nwitnessed firsthand the struggles of many of our Gulf War veterans, in \nWest Virginia and across the nation. For many, the Persian Gulf War \nwill undoubtedly be remembered as one of our country's most decisive \nmilitary victories. Despite our fears regarding the possibility of \nmassive troop injuries and losses, the careful planning and strategy of \nour military leaders paid off. At the end of the ground war, it \nappeared that there had been relatively few casualties. But as with any \nwar, the human costs of the Gulf War have been high, and we see now \nthat the casualties have continued long after the battle was over.\n  Many of the men and women who served in the Gulf have suffered \nchronic, and in some cases, disabling health problems. Their pain has \nbeen compounded by their difficulty in getting the government they \nserved to acknowledge their problems and provide the appropriate care \nand benefits they deserve. This legislation will address some of their \nconcerns. I regret that we can't do more, but we must begin the process \nwhere we can. We can't wait the 20 years we waited after the Vietnam \nwar to assess the effects of Agent Orange, or the 40 years we waited \nafter World War II to concede the problems of radiation-exposed \nveterans. It is time to learn from the lessons of the past and act now.\n  Section 102 extends VA's authority to provide health care to Gulf War \nveterans through December 31, 2001. This is a vital provision. After \nthe war, DoD and VA acknowledged that they couldn't diagnose the health \nproblems affecting Persian Gulf War veterans. We did not want to make \nthese veterans wait for the science to catch up before we could provide \nhealth care and compensation for their service-related conditions. That \nis why, back in 1993, we provided Persian Gulf War veterans with \npriority health care at VA facilities for conditions related to their \nexposure to battlefield exposures and environmental hazards. Gulf War \nveterans' access to health care through VA must continue to be ensured, \nand this agreement does that.\n  Section 102 also extends VA's current authority to provide treatment \nfor veterans of future conflicts. We are making it possible for future \nveterans to seek and receive care through VA immediately after leaving \nthe military and up to two years following discharge. By doing this, we \nmay be able to prevent some chronic health conditions by providing \nearly treatment.\n  The substitute amendment calls upon the Secretary of Veterans Affairs \nto enter into an agreement with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) \nto assist in the development of a plan for the establishment of a \nnational center for the study of war-related illnesses and post-\ndeployment health issues. Such a center would play a critical role in \ncarrying out and promoting research on the diagnosis, treatment, and \nprevention of such illnesses.\n  Though not specifically mentioned in the bill, a national center \ncould also serve to promote pre-deployment and post-deployment health \npolicies that are sorely needed to help prevent war-related illnesses. \nIt is important that there be a central body to study and learn from \nthe health lessons of each war, so we are not doomed to continue \nrepeating them.\n  In addition, this bill directs the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nenter into agreements with the NAS to conduct studies and provide \nrecommendations for research that may be needed to better understand \nthe possible health effects of exposures to toxic agents or \nenvironmental or wartime hazards associated with Gulf War service. The \nNAS will also provide recommendations to VA on the development of \ncontinuing medical education programs on the treatment of war-related \nillnesses and the assessment of new treatments to alleviate the effects \nof these illnesses.\n\n\n                      GULF WAR VETERANS' BENEFITS\n\n  Mr. President, last year I introduced S. 1320, which would have \nestablished a scientific basis for determining what illnesses are \nassociated with service in the Gulf War and should be compensable by \nthe VA. This year, Senator Byrd, Senator Specter, and I built upon that \nmodel and introduced S. 2358, which unanimously passed the Senate \nearlier this month.\n  S. 1320 and S. 2358 require the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nenter into an agreement with NAS to begin an ongoing scientific review \nto identify potential exposures that members of the Armed Services \nexperienced in the Gulf, and the potential illnesses or health \nconditions associated with those exposures. If NAS found evidence of a \npositive association between these illnesses and exposures, the \nSecretary would then determine if those illnesses warranted presumptive \nservice connection. This is important because current law requires Gulf \nWar veterans to either experience health effects in service that can be \nlinked to their current illness, or be found to have a chronic \n``undiagnosed illnesses'' within 10 years of returning from the Gulf. \nHowever, veterans are reporting illnesses now that don't fall into \neither of these categories. I believe that the NAS reviews will help \nremedy this ``Catch 22'' situation.\n  However, I was disappointed that we were unable to move beyond the \ninitial steps contained in H.R. 4110 in negotiations with the House and \nSenate Veterans' Affairs Committees. H.R. 4110 only provides for VA to \ncontract with NAS to perform the scientific review to identify \npotential exposures and illnesses associated with those exposures, but \nexcluded the critical directive and guidance to VA to make \ndeterminations about compensation and presumption of battlefield \nexposures. Nonetheless, I felt that it was important that we accomplish \nwhat we could in this Congress to begin the process, although I \nrealized this would still leave more for us to accomplish in the 106th \nCongress.\n  We would have been left with only this initial step were it not for \nthe senior Senator from West Virginia, Senator Byrd. Senator Byrd \nsuccessfully negotiated the inclusion of the compensation and \npresumption provisions of S. 2358 in the Omnibus Appropriations bill. \nSo, I thank him today, and the veterans' service organizations for \ntheir work on behalf of America's Gulf War veterans.\n  And finally, I also want to thank Senators Specter and Daschle for \ntheir tireless efforts. We now have legislation that Gulf War veterans \ncan be proud of as a result of all their work.\n\n\n                        EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT\n\n  Title II contains various changes to VA's education programs that \nallow more veterans access to these programs and improves their ability \nto use their Montgomery GI Bill benefits. Among them are provisions for \na more accurate way to calculate the number of veteran-students \ntraining at schools, by switching from a once-a-year ``snapshot'' to \ncounting enrollment throughout the year; more flexibility in the \npayment of veterans of their VA work-study program amount; the ability \nto tap into the current trend of many colleges who grant credit hours \nfor life experience; and allowance for servicemembers to use those life \nexperience credit hours to satisfy the eligibility requirement of \ncompletion of a high school diploma or 12 college semester hours before \nleaving active duty.\n\n[[Page S12934]]\n\n  In addition, Section 204 changes the pilot license requirement for a \nmedical certificate, as the certificate automatically downgrades after \n6 months, but the training period is longer than that. This ensures \nthat veterans will be able to complete their flight training program. \nSection 205 increases the flexibility of veterans participating in on-\njob training (OJT) programs to work in fields such as law enforcement, \npublic safety, and other State and local government agencies that \nbecause of local restrictions, cannot provide the VA-required wage \nincrease in the final month of OJT. Finally, this compromise agreement \nrequires the VA and the military to work together to better inform \nservicemembers and veterans of VA educational benefits.\n  Title II also makes a critical modification to the Uniformed Services \nEmployment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), which protects the \nrights of persons who serve in the U.S. Armed Forces for a limited \nperiod of time to return to their civilian employment. USERRA allows \nreturning servicemembers to bring a cause of action against employers \nwho violate their employment rights.\n  However, several States have taken the position that the Eleventh \nAmendment to the Constitution bars USERRA from applying to State \nagencies as employers. This argument is based on the 1996 Supreme Court \ndecision in Seminole Tribe of Florida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44 (1996), \nwhich held that Congress was unable to enact a law that allowed \nindividuals to sue states for violating federal statutes under the \nEleventh amendment. Several district courts have applied the Seminole \ndecision to dismiss USERRA cases against states as employers.\n  Title II would substitute the United States for an individual veteran \nas the plaintiff in cases where the Attorney General believes that a \nState has not complied with USERRA. This restores the ability of \nveterans who are employed by a state agency to seek redress for \nviolations of their reemployment rights.\n\n\n                     MEDAL OF HONOR SPECIAL PENSION\n\n  Section 301 provides for an increase in the monthly pension that \nrecipients of the Medal of Honor are entitled to. The current special \npension is $400 per month. This compromise agreement would increase the \namount to $600 per month.\n  The recipients of the Medal of Honor are American heroes, and as \nsuch, are asked to participate in patriotic ceremonies all over the \ncountry, frequently at their own cost. I am very pleased that this \nmodest increase in their monthly special pension was agreed to in order \nto help defray some of these costs for these great Americans.\n\n\n                             LIFE INSURANCE\n\n  Title III of the compromise contains some very important provisions \nfor veterans and their families at an extremely difficult time in their \nlives.\n  Section 302 allows VA to provide an accelerated death benefit to SGLI \nor VGLI-insured persons having a life expectancy of 12 months or less. \nThis provision would allow these terminally ill veterans to elect to \nreceive up to 50 percent of the amount of their insurance policy, \nproviding them financial assistance at a time when they may have \noverwhelming medical bills or other life expenses, but may be too ill \nto continue working.\n  The option to receive an accelerated death benefit is available in \nmany commercial life insurance policies. In 1996, Congress enacted a \nprovision that allowed veterans to convert their SGLI or VGLI policies \nto commercial policies. This allowed veterans to seek commercial \npolicies with this option. However, being faced with a terminal illness \nis a very difficult and emotional time, and the Committee correctly \ndetermined that it would be better for veterans to be able to cut out \nthe ``middle man'' and elect to receive accelerated benefits from the \nVA, without having to seek out another insurer. These benefits would \nnot be counted as income for the purposes of determining eligibility \nfor any federal program. I am very gratified that we are able to \napprove this measure that improves in some small way the quality of \nlife for our terminally ill veterans.\n  Section 303 requires VA to assess whether the two programs that are \ndesigned to help the survivors of service-connected veterans--the \ninsurance program and Dependency and Indemnity Compensation (DIC)--are, \nin fact, meeting their needs. In 1992, Congress enacted reforms \ntargeted at addressing this question by doubling the amount of life \ninsurance benefits to $200,000, and creating a uniform payment system \nfor DIC that is no longer dependent upon the rank of the veteran in \nservice. Nonetheless, many of the survivors were unable to work because \nthey remained at home to care for a totally disabled, service-connected \nveteran. That veteran may even have been receiving additional benefits \n(such as housebound or aid and attendance) above the 100-percent rate, \nwhich is currently $1,964 per month. However, after the veteran passes \naway, the surviving spouse's monthly compensation amount is generally \ndecreased to $850 per month. I have real concerns about whether the \ncurrent VA programs are adequately providing for these surviving \nspouses, and I am looking forward to any recommendations that VA may \nmake in this report.\n  Finally, section 304 provides financial relief to NSLI ``H'' policy \nholders. The policy holders are WWII veterans, some of whom were \ndisqualified from participating in NSLI's other program (the ``V'' \npolicy). ``V'' policy holders have a cap on their premiums as they get \nolder and are also eligible for dividends if the amount of premiums \npaid in a year exceeds the amount paid out in policies. That was not \nthe case for ``H'' policy holders. This provision makes ``H'' and ``V'' \npolicies identical, restoring fairness to approximately 1,200 affected \nveterans.\n\n\n                            memorial affairs\n\n  Mr. President, Title IV addresses an area of growing concern to \nveterans and their families--memorial affairs. The median age of \nveterans is over 75 years old. Our veteran population is aging, which \nunfortunately also means that veterans are dying at an increasing pace. \nIt our honor and duty to provide for their memorialization through the \nVA's National Cemetery System (NCS).\n  Section 401 gives VA the authority to place memorial markers in \nnational cemeteries to commemorate a veteran's deceased spouse whose \nremains are unavailable for interment. VA already has the authority to \nplace a memorial marker for veterans whose remains are unavailable.\n  Section 402 provides burial and cemetery benefits at VA National \nCemeteries for those who served in the United States Merchant Marines \nbetween August 16, 1945, and December 31, 1946, and served on a vessel \noperated by the War Shipping Administration or the Office of Defense \nTransportation operating overseas.\n\n  Section 403 renames the National Cemetery System as the National \nCemetery Administration and redesignates the position of the Director \nof the National Cemetery System to Under Secretary of Veterans Affairs \nfor Memorial Affairs.\n  Section 404 modifies the State Cemetery Grants Program to authorize \nVA to pay up to 100 percent of the costs of constructing and equipping \nstate veterans' cemeteries. VA currently has authority to pay up to 50 \npercent of the cost of land acquisition and construction. However, most \nstates that have participated in the program have used land that is \neither already state property or is donated. Thus, they have no \nacquisition costs. This change will allow states with limited funding \nto participate in the program. The State Cemetery Grants Program is a \nvery important component of VA's Cemetery System, since it increases \nveterans' access to burial in a veterans cemetery. I am very hopeful \nthat this change will lead to greater participation by states in the \nprogram.\n\n\n                       court of veterans appeals\n\n  In 1988, Congress created the Court of Veterans Appeals to provide \nveterans with an opportunity for judicial review of their claims for \nbenefits from the VA. In creating this court, Congress intended to make \nits benefits and features comparable to that of other courts. The \nfollowing modifications from Title V are intended to bring this Court \nin line with other Article I courts: exemption of the judges' \nretirement fund from sequestration orders and adjustments to their \nsurvivor annuity program.\n  Despite the changes to the survivor program to provide for a cost-of-\nliving allowance, the small size of the Court gives rise to concerns \nabout the fiscal integrity and expense of management of such a program. \nTherefore, this compromise agreement directs the Court to\n\n[[Page S12935]]\n\nprovide Congress with a report on the feasibility of merging the \nCourt's retirement and survivor annuity program with another federal \ncourt's retirement and survivor annuity program.\n  This title also provides that when a sitting judge is nominated for \nan additional term, that judge could remain on the bench for up to one \nyear, pending Senate confirmation. This would prevent any break in \nservice of the judge which might affect veterans' cases pending before \nthe Court.\n  Finally, this title renames the ``Court of Veterans Appeals\" as the \n``United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.'' This is a step \nforward in erasing the misperception that the Court is part of the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs.\n\n\n                      transitional housing program\n\n  Mr. President, I am very concerned about the plight of homeless \nveterans. Statistics from the Department of Veterans Affairs show that \none in three homeless persons are veterans. There are very few federal \nprograms specifically targeted at homeless veterans to address the \nspecific needs of this population; in particular, there is a shortage \nof transitional housing for homeless veterans. Transition programs can \nprovide structured long-term housing and assistance in finding and \nmaintaining employment, while requiring sobriety and accountability.\n  As a way to maximize the limited federal funding available for the \nhomeless veterans transitional housing program, this compromise \nagreement (Title VI) creates a pilot loan guaranty program that would \nbe administered by VA. The guaranty reduces the risk to lenders, \nenabling community-based organizations to seek outside capital. The \nloans can be used for a wide variety of activities, including \nconstruction or rehabilitation of housing, refinancing of existing \nloans, and acquisition of land, furniture, and equipment.\n  I am very excited about this partnership between the private and \npublic sectors, and between the federal government and community-based \norganizations. I am hopeful that it will be a successful new way for us \nto reach out to our Nation's homeless veterans.\n\n\n           extension of eligibility for reservist home loans\n\n  In 1992, Public Law 102-547 provided for a 5-year pilot program to \nallow eligible members of the Selected Reserves to qualify for VA \nhousing loan benefits. The authority for this program expires on \nOctober 27, 1999. With this imminent expiration date and the length of \nservice requirements for eligibility, the military is not able to fully \ncapitalize on this valuable recruiting tool. This agreement extends the \neligibility for Reservists and the funding fee that VA is allowed to \ncharge Reservists (currently 2.75 percent) to September 30, 2003.\n  This program has provided an invaluable recruitment and retention \nincentive. VA has guaranteed approximately 43,000 loans to date, of \nwhich about 67 percent were made to first-time home buyers. The \nforeclosure rate on these loans, according to VA, is approximately one \nhalf that of other VA loan guaranty programs. Given the increased use \nof Reservists in military deployments, it is only fitting that this \nprogram be continued.\n  I thank Senator Akaka for his leadership on this issue.\n\n\nhealth care for veterans treated with nasopharyngeal radium irradiation\n\n  Section 901 of the substitute amendment authorizes the Secretary to \nprovide health care for the treatment of any head or neck cancers which \nare associated with a veteran's receipt of nasopharyngeal radium \nirradiation treatments in active military, naval, or air service.\n  Thousands of military personnel, primarily Navy submariners and Army \nAir Corps pilots, received nasopharyngeal radium treatments to treat \nand prevent inner ear problems that developed due to the inadequate \npressurization of their respective vessels. The treatment was used \noriginally on children with ear infections, so to adapt the treatment \nto healthy adults, the Navy and Army conducted experiments on small \ngroups of submariners and pilots. Subsequently, between 8,000 and \n12,000 servicemen were irradiated for military purposes. As pressurized \nplanes and submarines became available, the need for these treatments \nwas fortunately obviated by the early 1960's.\n\n  Looking back to the early years, we now know just how dangerous these \ntreatments were. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \nestimate that tissues at the exact site of radium placement were \nexposed to 2000 rem of radiation--400 times greater than the maximum \n``safe'' level of radiation exposure established by the Atomic Energy \nCommission. Parts of the brain received 24 rem--five times the accepted \nlimit of exposure.\n  The health effects of the treatments that were specifically given to \nour veterans is unknown. A lack of documentation precludes careful \nscientific studies. However, one study done on individuals who had \nreceived nasopharyngeal radium treatments concluded there was an \nincreased risk of developing head and neck tumors associated with the \nchildhood treatments. We will continue to study the plight of all \natomic veterans, but this legislation offers health care to a group of \natomic veterans that have up to now been ignored by the VA. It is \nreasonable, compassionate, and long overdue.\n  I thank Senator Lieberman for his leadership on this issue and the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs for pursuing this vital initiative.\n\n\n              HEALTH CARE PERSONNEL INCENTIVE ACT OF 1998\n\n  I am enormously pleased today that the Veterans Programs Enhancement \nAct of 1998 includes provisions to create viable scholarship and loan \nreduction programs in VA. Title VIII is based on legislation, ``The \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Primary Care Providers Incentive Act of \n1998,'' which I introduced with the cosponsorship of Senator Mikulski.\n  Like many other health care organizations, VA is committed to \nincreased use of mid-level practitioners. There are generally two good \nways to hire and keep highly skilled professionals: offer incentives to \ncurrent employees to get training in new areas of need by providing \nscholarships, and recruit new providers by offering assistance in \npaying off student loans. The bill before us, which includes both a \nscholarship program and an education debt reduction program, can help.\n  In VA hospitals and clinics, some of the most difficult positions to \nfill are those of occupational and physical therapists and physicians \nassistants. In my home state of West Virginia, for example, there has \nbeen a vacancy at one of the VA hospitals for an occupational therapist \nfor over twelve years. Two of the VA hospitals have no physical \ntherapists at all. This is simply unacceptable.\n  The plain fact is that the VA cannot offer the same starting salaries \nas those available in private practice. VA's starting salary level for \nphysician assistants, for example, is $15,000 lower than in the private \nsector. The Education Debt Reduction Program included within the Health \nCare Personnel Incentive Act gives the VA a financial recruitment tool \nthat will be an enormous help in making the VAMCs more competitive for \nthese much-needed and highly skilled individuals. This program was \nfirst designed by Senator Mikulski in 1993 in recognition of this very \nproblem. It was needed then; it is still needed now; and I thank \nSenator Mikulski for her leadership.\n\n  Recruitment is only half of the story, though. Retention of trained \nhealth care personnel, especially in the face of low morale due to \nbudget cuts, is equally important. The scholarship program in this \nlegislation is designed to answer this very need. Eligibility is \nlimited to current VA employees, thus enabling VA to build staff \nmorale. Further, VA gets the workforce they need, composed of motivated \nand loyal employees.\n  Several physical therapists who received VA scholarships have written \nto me. They all have emphasized that their scholarships have enabled \nthem to finish their schooling without incurring additional debt. They \nall are now working in VA medical centers and bringing their new skills \nto veterans. This is a win-win situation.\n  Although this is a time of budget reductions in health care, these \nprograms are a worthwhile investment. They enhance morale of the \nphysician assistants, physical therapists, nurses, and all other health \ncare providers in the short term, while building a workforce that \nmatches VA's needs and improves veterans' health care in the long run.\n  I thank former Committee minority staff Congressional Science Fellow, \nJoanne Tornow, for her dedicated and\n\n[[Page S12936]]\n\npersistent efforts to move this legislation forward this year.\n\n\n                          SPECIALIZED SERVICES\n\n  Section 903 continues the current practice of requiring reports from \nthe Secretary of Veterans Affairs regarding specialized treatment and \nrehabilitative needs of disabled veterans, including veterans with \nspinal cord dysfunction, blindness, amputation, and mental illness.\n  Section 903 also requires the Under Secretary for Health to prescribe \nobjective standards of job performance, so as to ensure compliance and \nplace greater emphasis on specialized services. I truly believe that we \nneed to refocus VA on specialized services, and I am pleased that this \nprovision was included.\n  Officers of the West Virginia Paralyzed Veterans of America have told \nme about their concerns about the quality of training made available to \nVA staff serving on the Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) primary care teams in \nthe VA medical centers in my State of West Virginia. Instead of the \nweek of specialized training (followed by hands-on training in an SCI \nunit) recommended by a VHA Directive, SCI primary care teams in West \nVirginia receive a 3-day training session only. I also hear disturbing \naccounts from veterans who were given wheelchairs without being \nmeasured to make sure they fit properly; improper cushions placed in \nwheelchairs causing pressure sores that can last for months; and VA \nstaff who were unfamiliar with such procedures as turning the \nhospitalized SCI patient or even dressing them. This is not acceptable.\n  In sum, Mr. President, I cannot guarantee that the necessary \nspecialized care is there in all four of the West Virginia VA medical \ncenters, or any other VA medical center across the country. The \nlegislation before us today will give VA an objective and uniform \nstandard by which to judge, and accurately report on, the quality and \nscope of specialized services.\n\n\n                                  COLA\n\n  H.R. 4110 also contains one of the most important pieces of \nlegislation that Congress must pass every year--authorization for a \ncost-of living-allowance (COLA) increase for veterans and survivors \ncompensation programs. The amount of the increase is not specified in \nthis legislation, since the percentage of the increase had not been \ndetermined by the time of its passage in the House. Instead, as is \ncustomary, the bill authorizes the increase to be equal to the rate of \nincrease in Social Security recipients' benefits amounts. The rate of \nincrease is based on leading economic indicators of inflation. By being \ntied to the rate of inflation, the COLA ensures that veterans' benefits \nwill keep pace with rising costs and maintain the buying power of \ncompensation for our service-connected disabled veterans and their \nfamilies.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n  Mr. President, in closing, I want to acknowledge the work of our \nCommittee's Chairman, Senator Specter, in developing this comprehensive \nlegislation. Through his efforts, and that of his staff--especially the \nCommittee Staff Director, Charles Battaglia, and the Committee General \nCounsel, William Tuerk, the Senate Committee has fully met its \nresponsibilities and can be proud of the legislation we consider today.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nagree to the amendments of the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate passed H.R. \n4110, the Veterans Programs Enhancement Act of 1998. This measure \nstrives to improve the services and benefits provided to our nation's \nveterans by amending several health, education, housing, and other \nbenefits programs within the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  I am especially pleased that the measure contains two provisions \nwhich I have been working on. Section 603 of the bill will extend the \neligibility of members of the National Guard and Reserve for the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) Home Loan Guaranty Program. The \nprovision will ensure that the men and women in the Selected Reserve \nwill continue to be eligible for this program through September 30, \n2003. Under current law, authorization for the program is scheduled to \nexpire in October 1999.\n  As the author of legislation in 1992 which extended eligibility for \nVA-guaranteed home loans to National Guard and Reserve members who \ncomplete six years of service, I am pleased with the participation in \nthe program by members of the Selected Reserve. The VA Home Loan \nGuaranty Program for Guard and Reserve members has provided many \nindividuals and families with a needed opportunity to obtain a mortgage \nin order to purchase a home, many for the first time. The VA Home Loan \nGuaranty Program is not only beneficial for members of the Selected \nReserve, it also contributes to the financial viability of the VA Home \nLoan Guaranty Program since the origination fees paid by Reservists \nmore than offset the cost of additional loan guarantees. I am gratified \nthat the home loan program will continue to be made available to \nmembers of the National Guard and Reserves who have served our country.\n  I am also pleased with the inclusion of Section 706 in H.R. 4110. \nThis provision would prohibit the Secretary of Veterans Affairs from \nestablishing or collecting parking fees at the Spark M. Matsunaga \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs Medical and Regional Office Center in \nHonolulu, Hawaii. Under current law, the VA is required to charge its \nusers and employees to park at facilities built with special revolving \nfunds. In Hawaii, the VA parking structure is located on the grounds of \nthe Tripler Army Medical Hospital and will be shared by VA and the \nDepartment of Defense. The joint VA/DOD parking facility would result \nin an administrative nightmare if parking fees were required to be \nassessed for VA medical employees and visitors but not DOD personnel \nand visitors. Furthermore, the costs of administering the parking fees \nfar outweigh the revenues that would be generated from the assessment \nof nominal parking charges. The waiver of parking fees for the VA \nparking structure at Tripler Army Medical Center will ensure that all \nvisitors and employees enjoy free and equal access to the facilities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12918-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE WITH RESPECT TO THE BRUTAL KILLING \n                           OF MATTHEW SHEPARD\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the legislation I \nintroduced along with Senator McCain, the Federal Reports Elimination \nAct of 1998, S. 1364, was passed by the House earlier this week and is \nbeing considered by the Senate under unanimous consent today. The law \neliminates 132 outdated reporting requirements imposed on federal \nagencies by Congress through statute.\n  The Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs and the House Committee \non Government Reform and Oversight circulated a list of reports that \nwas initially provided by the President in his 1997 budget to all \ncommittees having cognizance over the reports recommended for \nelimination. The committees reviewed the list of reports and identified \nthose reports they deemed essential. The initial list contained over \n400 reports; the bill that passed the Senate contained over 200 \nreports, and the bill as passed by the House contains 132 reports for \nelimination.\n\n[[Page S12941]]\n\nThe reports that were in the initial proposal that are not included in \nthe bill as passed by the House have been reviewed by both houses of \nCongress and considered necessary and useful to the Congress in its \noversight responsibilities.\n  Reports elimination is not a new area of interest in Congress. This \nis the third piece of legislation we have passed in the last 15 years \nto eliminate or modify wasteful reporting requirements. Just three \nyears ago, in 1995, Senator McCain and I introduced and got enacted \nPublic Law 104-66, the ``Federal Reports Elimination and Sunset Act of \n1995,'' which eliminated or modified 207 reports. Section 3003 of \nPublic Law 104-66, contains a provision for the termination of all \nannual, semiannual, or other regular periodic reporting requirements, \nsubject to some exceptions, 4 years after the date of enactment. The \nbill was enacted into law on December 21, 1995, which means that \neffective December 21, 1999, reports listed in the House No. 103-7, \nthat are not exempt from termination, will be automatically eliminated \non December 21st of next year. Committees and Members should be on \nnotice that if there are reporting requirements now in law that they \nwant to continue that are annual, semiannual or periodic, those \nreporting requirements will have to be reenacted before the 1999 \ndeadline. It will require an affirmative act of legislation to continue \nthose reporting requirements. While it is important to eliminate \nwasteful and unnecessary reports, it is equally important to continue \nthose reporting requirements that we think are essential to the work of \nthe Congress. I urge my colleagues to be alert to this upcoming \ndeadline.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator McCain for his excellent work in \nhelping to get today's legislation passed. I also want to thank Myla \nEdwards of my office who handled this bill for us as a legislative \nfellow. Ensuring that this bill covers the intended reporting \nrequirements is tedious work, and Myla demonstrated the care, patience, \nand commitment necessary to get a bill like this passed.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3836\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate today is \npassing the Hatch-Biden-Lautenberg substitute amendment to H.R. 4164, \nand I am hopeful that the other body will take up and pass the measure \nbefore Congress adjourns for the year.\n  What this legislation does is simple. Under current federal law, \nstates must give full faith and credit to the child custody orders of \nanother state. A custody order is defined as including a visitation \norder. However, as evidence from around the country has shown, state \ncourts often do not automatically recognize visitation orders, \nparticularly when it is a visitation order for someone other than the \nchild's parent, such as a grandparent. State courts are supposed to \nhonor such orders, but it is often an arduous process getting them to \ndo so.\n  This legislation simply clarifies that the full faith and credit law \nincludes visitation orders. We want it to be absolutely clear to state \ncourts that a state visitation order entered consistently with the \nprovisions of the federal full faith and credit statute must be given \nfull faith and credit by all other states. In a narrow legal sense, it \ndoes nothing different than current federal law. But, by making that \nlaw more explicit, it hopefully will eliminate the hassles, obstacles, \nand delays that too often confront those who have valid visitation \norders and are asking only that federal law be followed.\n  Mr. President, the author of this idea was Representative Rob Andrews \nof New Jersey, who deserves credit for bringing this issue to our \nattention. From the day in 1997 when he introduced his bill on \nvisitation orders, he has been tireless in pushing for its passage. I \ncommend him and congratulate him.\n  Finally, I want to thank Senator Hatch for his willingness to move \nthis bill in the final days of the session. There is a lot of pressing \nwork to be done, and this issue could have got lost in the final \ncrunch. But, the chairman and his staff were very gracious in working \nwith me to pass this bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to, the bill be read a third time and passed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3837) was agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 4164), as amended, was considered read the third time, \nand passed.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12941-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12942-S12943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S12942]]\n TECHNICAL AMENDMENTS TO SECTION 10, TITLE 9, OF THE UNITED STATES CODE\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, the Senate has done the right thing by \nagreeing to support David R. Kaczynski in his effort to donate more \nmoney to the victims of his brother, ``Unabomber'' Theodore J. \nKaczynski. I hope the House of Representatives will now follow suit. \nThis is a rare opportunity for Congress to write a happy ending to a \nsad story, and we should seize it. The U.S. Congress should not be in \nthe business of discouraging acts of altruism.\n  In August, Mr. Kaczynski and his wife, Linda E. Patrik, constituents \nof mine from Schenectady, New York, received a $1 million reward from \nthe FBI for information leading to the 1996 arrest of Theodore \nKaczynski. Immediately upon receiving the reward, David Kaczynski \npledged that after payment of taxes and attorney's fees, all reward \nmonies would go to the Unabomber's victims and their families. Mr. \nKaczynski then contacted my office to ask whether Congress could \nprovide, through legislation, that no tax be imposed so that a greater \namount would be passed on to the victims. The uniquely compelling case \nfor this measure was clear from the moment David Kaczynski first \ncontacted me. I agreed and immediately introduced legislation, which \nwas cosponsored by Senators D'Amato, Baucus and Burns.\n  Since then, our legislation has received the support of others. \nSenators Roth, Hatch, Dodd, Lautenberg, and Moseley-Braun have all \nstated their strong support for the measure, and in the House, \nCongressman Mike NcNulty and Amo Houghton of New York, both Ways and \nMeans Committee members, have introduced companion legislation.\n  The Kaczynski family's decision was a wonderful, selfless act of \nhumanity. Congress ought to applaud and support this fine example. It \nis good public policy to encourage reward recipients to donate those \nproceeds to the victims of violent crime. Without this legislation, \nfederal taxes on the reward would total approximately $355,000. In \nother words, the Federal Treasury would get that money instead of the \nvictims. It would be unjust for the Federal government to take that \nmoney when we have the power to pass it on to the victims.\n  I thank Senators for supporting this important measure, and I urge \nits early enactment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12943-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          TECHNICAL CORRECTION IN THE ENROLLMENT OF H.R. 3910\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I rise on the occasion of the Senate's \npassage, by unanimous consent, of Senate Resolution 298, condemning the \nterror, vengeance, and human rights abuses against the civilian \npopulation of Sierra Leone. I would like to thank my colleagues, \nparticularly the members of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, \nfor their support, as well as their quick action on this important \nlegislation. While the resolution speaks for itself in its condemnation \nof atrocities and insistence that all people abide by international \nstandards of decency, allow me to make just a few points.\n  On a number of occasions, Mr. President, I have come to the floor to \ninsist that America's status as the world's first free nation, and the \ncontinuing leader of the free world, imposes certain responsibilities \non us. Most important, our status imposes on us the duty to speak out \nand where possible act to prevent gross violations of basic human \nrights. Yet at this very moment there is a crisis in the Sierra Leone \nof tragic proportions, in which truly unbelievable atrocities are being \ncommitted against the civilian population.\n  Mr. President, we should not permit this tragedy to go unnoticed and \nwe should not permit the war crimes being committed there to be \ncommitted with impunity.\n\n[[Page S12946]]\n\n  I learned about the Sierra Leone crisis from concerned individuals \nand in my capacity as Chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee, which \nhas oversight of refugee matters. I have spoken to Secretary of State \nAlbright about the Sierra Leone crisis, both because of the situation \nof current refugees and more broadly because I believe we may have a \nunique opportunity to help stop the war in Sierra Leone so that more \nlives are not wasted or shattered and more innocent people not turned \ninto refugees.\n  Over 500,000 Sierra Leonean refugees currently reside, often in \nconditions of incredible poverty and deprivation, outside of their \ncountry. This number includes something like 350,000 in Guinea and \n182,000 in Liberia. The majority of these people have fled Sierra Leone \nover the past year, with over 250,000 fleeing in the past six months. \nAll are fleeing armed conflict and civil war.\n\n  Let me briefly rehearse the events that have produced this tragic \nsituation.\n  In May of 1997, the democratically elected president of Sierra Leone, \nPresident Tejan Kabbah, was overthrown in a military coup, leading to a \nlarge outflow of refugees and the evacuation of our own and other \nforeign embassies in the capital of Freetown. For nine months, the \ncountry was ruled by a coalition of rebel groups including the AFRC \n(Armed Forces Revolutionary Council) and the RUF (Revolutionary United \nFront). In February 1998, the West African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG, \na regional force principally composed of Nigerians) secured control of \nFreetown and restored Kabbah to power. ECOMOG controls the area \nsurrounding Freetown and is continuing offensives in the interior of \nthe country to try to regain control.\n  Starting in February and March, rebels (also referred to as the \njunta) began to retaliate through a campaign of terror directed at the \npopulation. This has led to the massive exodus of hundreds of thousands \nof civilians. The rebel leader, Foday Sankoh, was captured by ECOMOG \nand is scheduled to be tried for treason in Freetown. Last month, his \nsecond in command threatened to wipe out the remaining population if \nFoday Sankoh is tried. Speaking on BBC radio, he declared that, if \nFoday Sankoh is tried, the rebels will launch ``operation spare no \nsoul,'' killing ``every living thing, including chickens.''\n  His past conduct proves that his threats are not empty.\n  Unbelievable atrocities have been committed against the Sierra \nLeoneans. Sierra Leonean refugees in Guinea and Liberia also face \nsevere shortages of food and medical care. Reports of violence include \nkillings, amputations of body parts with machetes, rapes (including of \nyoung girls), and other torture. On occasion, violence has been \ntargeted at Kabbah supporters. Some amputee victims have had notes \npinned to their chests warning Kabbah of further violence, and others \nare told to tell Kabbah to give them their hands back. In other cases \nthe violence appears indiscriminate and designed to terrorize the \npopulation. Villages have been evacuated and destroyed on a large scale \nas Sierra Leoneans try to flee the rebels.\n   Mr. President, I introduced this resolution because the violence is \nnot over. Unfortunately, it may have just begun. Fighting continues in \nSierra Leone, and the refuges need help. West African states have \ncommitted their soldiers to help achieve peace in Sierra Leone. But \nthey need logistical and other support--support we can provide without \nplacing American lives at risk. Our leadership can make a difference \nhere in ending the horrors in Sierra Leone and assisting the victims of \nwar. We should not look the other way.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12945-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE 65TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE \n                     UKRAINIAN FAMINE OF 1932-1933\n\n  The resolution (S. Con.

Con. Res. 122), with its preamble, reads as \nfollows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 122\n\n       Whereas this year marks the 65th anniversary of the \n     Ukrainian Famine of 1932-1933 that caused the deaths of at \n     least 7,000,000 Ukrainians and that was covered up and \n     officially denied by the government of the former Soviet \n     Union;\n       Whereas millions of Ukrainians died, not by natural causes \n     such as pestilence, drought, floods, or a poor harvest, but \n     by policies designed to punish Ukraine for its aversion and \n     opposition to the government of the former Soviet Union's \n     oppression and imperialism, including the forced \n     collectivization of agriculture;\n       Whereas when Ukraine was famine-stricken, the government of \n     the former Soviet Union exported 1,700,000 tons of grain to \n     the West while offers from international relief organizations \n     to assist the starving population were rejected on the \n     grounds that there was no famine in Ukraine and no need for \n     the assistance;\n       Whereas the borders of Ukraine were tightly controlled and \n     starving Ukrainians were not allowed to cross into Russian \n     territory in search of bread;\n       Whereas in his book ``The Harvest of Sorrow'', British \n     historian Robert Conquest explains, ``A quarter of the rural \n     population, men, women, and children, lay dead or dying, the \n     rest in various stages of debilitation with no strength to \n     bury their families or neighbors.'';\n       Whereas the Commission on the Ukraine Famine was \n     established on December 13, 1985, to conduct a study with the \n     goal of expanding the world's knowledge and understanding of \n     the famine and to expose the government of the former Soviet \n     Union for its atrocities in the famine;\n       Whereas the Commission's report to Congress confirmed that \n     the government of the former Soviet Union consciously \n     employed the brutal policy of forced famine to repress the \n     Ukrainian population and to oppress the Ukrainians' \n     inviolable religious and political rights; and\n       Whereas the Commission on the Ukraine Famine presented 4 \n     volumes of findings and conclusions, 10 volumes of archival \n     material, and over 200 cassettes of testimony from famine \n     survivors to the newly independent Government of Ukraine in \n     1993, during the official observances of the 60th anniversary \n     of the Ukrainian famine in Kyiv, Ukraine: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n         Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the recent outbreak of the harmful microbe Pfiesteria \n     piscicida in the coastal waters of the United States is one \n     example of potentially harmful algal blooms composed of \n     naturally occurring species that reproduce explosively and \n     that are increasing in frequency and intensity in the \n     Nation's coastal waters;\n       (2) other recent occurrences of harmful algal blooms \n     include red tides in the Gulf of Mexico and the Southeast; \n     brown tides in New York and Texas; ciguatera fish poisoning \n     in Hawaii,\n\n[[Page S12957]]\n\n     Florida, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands; \n     and shellfish poisonings in the Gulf of Maine, the Pacific \n     Northwest, and the Gulf of Alaska;\n       (3) in certain cases, harmful algal blooms have resulted in \n     fish kills, the deaths of numerous endangered West Indian \n     manatees, beach and shellfish bed closures, threats to public \n     health and safety, and concern among the public about the \n     safety of seafood;\n       (4) according to some scientists, the factors causing or \n     contributing to harmful algal blooms may include excessive \n     nutrients in coastal waters, other forms of pollution, the \n     transfer of harmful species through ship ballast water, and \n     ocean currents;\n       (5) harmful algal blooms may have been responsible for an \n     estimated $1,000,000,000 in economic losses during the past \n     decade;\n       (6) harmful algal blooms and blooms of non-toxic algal \n     species may lead to other damaging marine conditions such as \n     hypoxia (reduced oxygen concentrations), which are harmful or \n     fatal to fish, shellfish, and benthic organisms;\n       (7) according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration in the Department of Commerce, 53 percent of \n     United States estuaries experience hypoxia for at least part \n     of the year and a 7,000 square mile area in the Gulf of \n     Mexico off Louisiana and Texas suffers from hypoxia;\n       (8) according to some scientists, a factor believed to \n     cause hypoxia is excessive nutrient loading into coastal \n     waters;\n       (9) there is a need to identify more workable and effective \n     actions to reduce nutrient loadings to coastal waters;\n       (10) the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \n     through its ongoing research, education, grant, and coastal \n     resource management programs, possesses a full range of \n     capabilities necessary to support a near and long-term \n     comprehensive effort to prevent, reduce, and control harmful \n     algal blooms and hypoxia;\n       (11) funding for the research and related programs of the \n     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will aid in \n     improving the Nation's understanding and capabilities for \n     addressing the human and environmental costs associated with \n     harmful algal blooms and hypoxia; and\n       (12) other Federal agencies such as the Environmental \n     Protection Agency, the Department of Agriculture, and the \n     National Science Foundation, along with the States, Indian \n     tribes, and local governments, conduct important work related \n     to the prevention, reduction, and control of harmful algal \n     blooms and hypoxia.\n\n     SEC. 603. ASSESSMENTS.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Inter-Agency Task Force.--The \n     President, through the Committee on Environment and Natural \n     Resources of the National Science and Technology Council, \n     shall establish an Inter-Agency Task Force on Harmful Algal \n     Blooms and Hypoxia (hereinafter referred to as the ``Task \n     Force''). The Task Force shall consist of the following \n     representatives from--\n       (1) the Department of Commerce (who shall serve as Chairman \n     of the Task Force);\n       (2) the Environmental Protection Agency;\n       (3) the Department of Agriculture;\n       (4) the Department of the Interior;\n       (5) the Department of the Navy;\n       (6) the Department of Health and Human Services;\n       (7) the National Science Foundation;\n       (8) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration;\n       (9) the Food and Drug Administration;\n       (10) the Office of Science and Technology Policy;\n       (11) the Council on Environmental Quality; and\n       (12) such other Federal agencies as the President considers \n     appropriate.\n       (b) Assessment of Harmful Algal Blooms.--\n       (1) Not later than 12 months after the date of enactment of \n     this title, the Task Force, in cooperation with the coastal \n     States, Indian tribes, and local governments, industry \n     (including agricultural organizations), academic \n     institutions, and non-governmental organizations with \n     expertise in coastal zone management, shall complete and \n     submit to the Congress an assessment which examines the \n     ecological and economic consequences of harmful algal blooms, \n     alternatives for reducing, mitigating, and controlling \n     harmful algal blooms, and the social and economic costs and \n     benefits of such alternatives.\n       (2) The assessment shall--\n       (A) identify alternatives for preventing unnecessary \n     duplication of effort among Federal agencies and departments \n     with respect to harmful algal blooms; and\n       (B) provide for Federal cooperation and coordination with \n     and assistance to the coastal States, Indian tribes, and \n     local governments in the prevention, reduction, management, \n     mitigation, and control of harmful algal blooms and their \n     environmental and public health impacts.\n       (c) Assessment of Hypoxia.--\n       (1) Not later than 12 months after the date of enactment of \n     this title, the Task Force, in cooperation with the States, \n     Indian tribes, local governments, industry, agricultural, \n     academic institutions, and non-governmental organizations \n     with expertise in watershed and coastal zone management, \n     shall complete and submit to the Congress an assessment which \n     examines the ecological and economic consequences of hypoxia \n     in United States coastal waters, alternatives for reducing, \n     mitigating, and controlling hypoxia, and the social and \n     economic costs and benefits of such alternatives.\n       (2) The assessment shall--\n       (A) establish needs, priorities, and guidelines for a peer-\n     reviewed, inter-agency research program on the causes, \n     characteristics, and impacts of hypoxia;\n       (B) identify alternatives for preventing unnecessary \n     duplication of effort among Federal agencies and departments \n     with respect to hypoxia; and\n       (C) provide for Federal cooperation and coordination with \n     and assistance to the States, Indian tribes, and local \n     governments in the prevention, reduction, management, \n     mitigation, and control of hypoxia and its environmental \n     impacts.\n       (e) Disestablishment of Task Force.--The President may \n     disestablish the Task Force after submission of the plan in \n     section 604(d).\n\n     SEC. 604. NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO HYPOXIA.\n\n       (a) Assessment Report.--Not later than May 30, 1999, the \n     Task Force shall complete and submit to Congress and the \n     President an integrated assessment of hypoxia in the northern \n     Gulf of Mexico that examines: the distribution, dynamics, and \n     causes; ecological and economic consequences; sources and \n     loads of nutrients transported by the Mississippi River to \n     the Gulf of Mexico; effects of reducing nutrient loads; \n     methods for reducing nutrient loads; and the social and \n     economic costs and benefits of such methods.\n       (b) Submission of a Plan.--No later than March 30, 2000, \n     the President, in conjunction with the chief executive \n     officers of the States, shall develop and submit to Congress \n     a plan, based on the integrated assessment submitted under \n     subsection (a), for reducing, mitigating, and controlling \n     hypoxia in the northern Gulf of Mexico. In developing such \n     plan, the President shall consult with State, Indian tribe, \n     and local governments, academic, agricultural, industry, and \n     environmental groups and representatives. Such plan shall \n     include incentive-based partnership approaches. The plan \n     shall also include the social and economic costs and benefits \n     of the measures for reducing, mitigating, and controlling \n     hypoxia. At least 90 days before the President submits such \n     plan to the Congress, a summary of the proposed plan shall be \n     published in the Federal Register for a public comment period \n     of not less than 60 days.\n\n     SEC. 605. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary of \n     Commerce for research, education, and monitoring activities \n     related to the prevention, reduction, and control of harmful \n     algal blooms and hypoxia, $15,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, \n     $18,250,000 for fiscal year 2000, and $19,000,000 for fiscal \n     year 2001, to remain available until expended. The Secretary \n     shall consult with the States on a regular basis regarding \n     the development and implementation of the activities \n     authorized under this section. Of such amounts for each \n     fiscal year--\n       (1) $1,500,000 for fiscal year 1999, $1,500,000 for fiscal \n     year 2000, and $2,000,000 for fiscal year 2001 may be used to \n     enable the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to \n     carry out research and assessment activities, including \n     procurement of necessary research equipment, at research \n     laboratories of the National Ocean Service and the National \n     Marine Fisheries Service;\n       (2) $4,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, $5,500,000 for fiscal \n     year 2000, and $5,500,000 for fiscal year 2001 may be used to \n     carry out the Ecology and Oceanography of Harmful Algal \n     Blooms (ECOHAB) project under the Coastal Ocean Program \n     established under section 201(c) of Public Law 102-567;\n       (3) $1,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, $2,000,000 for fiscal \n     year 2000, and $2,000,000 for fiscal year 2001 may be used by \n     the National Ocean Service of the National Oceanic and \n     Atmospheric Administration to carry out a peer-reviewed \n     research project on management measures that can be taken to \n     prevent, reduce, control, and mitigate harmful algal blooms;\n       (4) $5,500,000 for each of the fiscal years 1999, 2000, and \n     2001 may be used to carry out Federal and State annual \n     monitoring and analysis activities for harmful algal blooms \n     administered by the National Ocean Service of the National \n     Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; and\n       (5) $3,000,000 for fiscal year 1999, $3,750,000 for fiscal \n     year 2000, and $4,000,000 for fiscal year 2001 may be used \n     for activities related to research and monitoring on hypoxia \n     by the National Ocean Service and the Office of Oceanic and \n     Atmospheric Research of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration.\n\n     SEC. 606. PROTECTION OF STATES' RIGHTS.\n\n       (a) Nothing in this title shall be interpreted to adversely \n     affect existing State regulatory or enforcement power which \n     has been granted to any State through the Clean Water Act or \n     Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972.\n       (b) Nothing in this title shall be interpreted to expand \n     the regulatory or enforcement power of the Federal Government \n     which has been delegated to any State through the Clean Water \n     Act or Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I understand that the House has sent the Senate a \nsubstitute to H.R. 2204, the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1998, \nthat includes a provision that would amend the Clean Water Act.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The Senator is correct. The version of H.R. 2204 that \nfirst passed the House last year included a section that made a change \nto the Clean Water Act to clarify liability concerns of the oil spill \nresponse industry. The Senate-passed H.R. 2204 on Monday, October 12, \n1998, but it did not include the provision. The House amendment that is \nnow before the Senate includes this provision in section 411(b).\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Senator, would you please describe the intent of the \nprovision?\n\n[[Page S12958]]\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The intent of this provision is to make it clear that \ndischarges incidental to mechanical removal authorized by the President \nare not themselves separate and distinct acts of discharge within the \nmeaning of the Clean Water Act. Our purpose is that persons, such as \ncleanup contractors, whose sole connection to discharges is cleanup or \nremoval, will not be held responsible for unavoidable inconsequential \ndischarges which are a function only of available response technology. \nFor example, mechanical removal activities such as the ``decanting'' or \nseparation of water from recovered oil usually involve the return of \nexcess water into the response area. Since mechanical removal devices \ndo not operate with 100% efficiency, some oil from the original \ndischarge is entrained with the return water flow to the water body \nbeing mechanically cleaned.\n  Section 411(b) is not intended to alter the liability of responsible \nparties in any fashion. It is not intended to enable a responsible \nparty to attribute any portion of the oil originally spilled to a \nsubsequent release incident to the mechanical oil removal process. In \nother words, this provision is not intended to alter Congress' intent \nas expressed in section 311(c)(4)(B) of the Clean Water Act. It is \nlimited solely to actions approved by the President in accordance with \nClean Water Act section 311(c). In addition, this provision does not \nalter in any way the penalty calculation set forth in this section.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Thank you.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Coast Guard \nReauthorization Act. The House recently passed an amended version of \nthe Senate Coast Guard bill. While I support the overall \nreauthorization of the Coast Guard, I want to comment on several \nprovisions contained in the House passed bill.\n  There is currently an administrative process in place to convey \nexcess Federal government property. I believe that legislation which \nmandates the transfer or disposal of Federal property under terms which \ncircumvent the established administrative procedures is inappropriate. \nConsequently, the Senate bill used discretionary language to address \ncertain conveyances requested by individual senators. However, the \nHouse bill includes mandatory legislative conveyances. In this case \nonly, I am accepting the mandatory language because I am satisfied that \nthe Coast Guard is willing and prepared to make each of these \nparticular conveyances.\n  Another important difference between the House and Senate passed \nbills relates to drug interdiction. I sponsored an amendment in the \nSenate bill which would have established criminal sanctions for the \nknowing failure to obey an order to land an airplane. As a former \npilot, let me clearly state that this provision was not designed to put \nany pilot at risk of an arbitrary or random forced landing. Arbitrary \nor random forced landings are impermissible under the Senate provision. \nAs with all aviation legislation in which I have been involved, safety \nis a top priority. Under current law, if a Federal law enforcement \nofficer who is enforcing drug smuggling or money laundering laws \nwitnesses a person loading tons of cocaine onto a plane in Mexico, sees \nthe plane take off and enter the United States, he may issue an order \nto land, and if the pilot knowingly disobeys that order, there is \ncurrently no criminal penalty associated with such a failure to obey \nthe order.\n  The criminal sanctions contained in the Senate bill would only be \napplied to a person who knowingly disobeyed an order to land issued by \na Federal law enforcement agent who is enforcing drug smuggling or \nmoney laundering laws. The bill would also require the Federal Aviation \nAdministration (FAA) to write regulations defining the means by and \ncircumstances under which it would be appropriate to order an aircraft \nto land. One of the FAA's essential missions is aviation safety. \nAccordingly, the FAA would be required to ensure that any such order is \nclearly communicated in accordance with international standards. \nMoreover, the FAA would be further required to specify when an order to \nland may be issued based on observed conduct, prior information, or \nother circumstances. Therefore, orders to land would have to be \njustifiable, not arbitrary or random. Orders to land would only be \nissued in cases where the authorized federal law enforcement agent has \nobserved conduct or possesses reliable information which provides \nsufficient evidence of a violation of Federal drug smuggling or money \nlaundering laws. If enacted, I would take every step possible to ensure \nthat this provision does not diminish safety in any way.\n  Last year, 430 metric tons of cocaine entered the United States from \nMexico. In 1995, drugs cost taxpayers an estimated $109 billion. The \naverage convicted drug smuggler was sentenced to only 4.3 years in \njail, and is expected to serve less than half of that sentence. It is \nincumbent on all of us to fight the war on drugs with every responsible \nand safe measure at our disposal. The provision in the Senate bill \nwould help those men and women who fight the war on drugs at our \nborders by providing an additional penalty for those who knowingly \ndisobey the law.\n  A provision included in both the House and Senate bill relates to the \nInternational Safety Management Code (ISM Code). On July 1, 1998, the \nowners and operators of passenger vessels, tankers and bulk carriers \nwere required to have in place safety management systems which meet the \nrequirements of the ISM Code. On July 1, 2002, all other large cargo \nships and self-propelled mobile offshore drilling units will have to \ncomply. Companies and vessels not ISM Code-certified are not permitted \nto enter U.S. waters.\n  Shipowners required to comply with the ISM Code have raised concerns \nthat the ISM Code may be misused. The ISM Code requires a system of \ninternal audits and reporting systems which are intended to encourage \ncompliance with applicable environmental and vessel safety standards. \nHowever, the documents produced as a result of the ISM Code would also \nprovide indications of past non-conformities. Obviously, for this \ninformation to be useful in rectifying environmental and safety \nconcerns, it must be candid and complete. However, this information, \nprepared by shipowners or operators, may be used in enforcement actions \nagainst a shipowner or operator, crews and shoreside personnel by \ngovernmental agencies and may be subject to discovery in civil \nlitigation.\n  The provision in both the Senate and House bills would require the \nSecretary to conduct a study to examine the operation of the ISM Code, \ntaking into account the effectiveness of internal audits and reports. \nAfter completion of the study, the Secretary is required to develop a \npolicy to achieve full compliance with and effective implementation of \nthe ISM Code. Under the provision, the public shall be given the \nopportunity to participate in and comment on the study. In addition, it \nmay be appropriate for the Secretary to form a working group of \naffected private parties to assist in the development of the study and \nthe issuance of the required policy and any resulting legislative \nrecommendations. Any private citizen who is a member of any such \nworking group cannot receive any form of government funds, \nreimbursement or travel expenses for participation in, or while a \nmember of, the working group.\n  The bill also includes a provision that would fix a curious conflict \nin maritime statutes that currently prohibits U.S. and foreign \ncommercial vessel operators from agreeing among themselves to comply \nwith the Maritime Administration's cargo preference policies concerning \nvessel sharing agreements, but allows the Maritime Administration to \nimpose those policies on the agreements themselves. The vessel sharing \nagreement provision in the bill would allow the commercial vessel \noperators to voluntarily comply with that policy. This provision is \nconsistent with a recent U.S. appeals court decision on this issue and \nsimply preserves the status quo. The proper place to resolve concerns \nwith cargo preference, many of which I share, is in the cargo \npreference statutes themselves.\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nCoast Guard Authorization Act.\n  Since 1790 the U.S. Coast Guard and its predecessor services have \ndone a truly outstanding job of protecting America's coasts and \nmaritime interests. Today, the Coast Guard is recognized as the \n``Premier Maritime Service in the World'' and a model of efficiency \nwithin the federal government.\n\n[[Page S12959]]\n\n  Despite drastic reductions in resources and personnel over the last \nseveral years, the result of government downsizing and shrinking \nbudgets, the Coast Guard has admirably maintained a high level of \nservice. The Coast Guard has met the challenges of a growing number of \nmissions while continuously improving performance in its existing \nmission areas of law enforcement, maritime safety, marine environmental \nprotection, and national security. With personal strength at the lowest \nlevel since 1967, and the smallest fleet of aircraft and seagoing \ncutters since 1989, the men and women of the Coast Guard continue to \nprovide outstanding service to our nation. Since 1992, the number of \nfisheries boarding conducted by Coast Guard personnel has increased by \n62%. Since 1983, the number of undocumented migrants interdicted by the \nCoast Guard has grown by 635%. Last year, arrests of cocaine \ntraffickers were up 1000%, and cocaine seizures were triple the \nprevious year. Through these incredible interdiction efforts, the Coast \nGuard kept more than 468 million cocaine ``hits'' and 100 million \nmarijuana ``joints'' off American streets last year. The estimated \nstreet value of these seizures is more than $4.2 billion--$1 billion \nmore than the Coast Guard's entire 1997 discretionary budget.\n  The return on investment provided to the American taxpayer by the \nCoast Guard is not unique to its drug enforcement mission. In the area \nof Search and Rescue alone, the Coast Guard provided the American \npublic with a 4-to-1 return on investment last year represented by \n5,000 lives saved and 65,000 persons assisted. Further, Coast Guard \nprevention efforts have contributed to a 50% reduction in major oil \nspills over the past 10 years and a 43% decline in recreational boating \ndeaths since 1970.\n  Mr. President, many in this country have no knowledge of the U.S. \nCoast Guard. Many do not realize the Coast Guard operates throughout \nthe world and, in addition to its many other missions, is this nation's \nfifth armed service. Many do not realize that the U.S. Coast Guard \nparticipated extensively in the Persian Gulf War and, in fact, still \nhas personnel in the Persian Gulf enforcing the embargo against Iraq, \nas well as in other ``hot spots'' around the world. Coast Guard \ncutters, aircraft and personnel routinely deploy throughout the world \nin support of Coast Guard missions ranging from search and rescue, law \nenforcement, and environmental protection to ice breaking, port \nsecurity, and vessel safety.\n  Mr. President, the U.S. Coast Guard is an agency in which the U.S. \nshould invest, not divest. This bill authorizes adequate funding and \nincludes other provisions to allow the Coast Guard to continue to carry \nout its important work. For these reasons, I urge the passage of this \nimportant measure.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have serious objections to a provision in \nthe Coast Guard authorization bill that was inserted in the House bill \nin a managers amendment with no hearings or vote in the Senate. This \nprovision grants a waiver of existing law for a single vessel operating \non the Great Lakes and elsewhere against the wishes of both Michigan \nSenators and other Senators and in circumvention of a Customs Service \nruling regarding the type of dredge work this vessel is allowed to \nperform.\n  This waiver is a discriminatory provision which gives special \ntreatment and a competitive advantage to one vessel at the expense of \nits competitors.\n  Mr. President, the granting of this waiver will be detrimental to \nother dredgers on the Great Lakes and elsewhere who are abiding by U.S. \nlaw and U.S. Customs Service interpretations of the Jones Act. The \nhopper dredge vessel Columbus, the vessel seeking the waiver, was \nchallenged by a competitor for violating the Jones Act because it was \nperforming dredging work that was not allowed under that Act. That \nchallenge was upheld by the U.S. Customs Service. However, instead of \nabiding by or appealing the Customs Service ruling, a legislative \nwaiver was sought to circumvent that ruling. The waiver was granted by \nthe House, but not the Senate because the Senate passed Coast Guard \nauthorization bill did not contain this discriminatory provision.\n  I want to make clear that the only reason this waiver will be \nincluded in the final Coast Guard authorization bill is due to the \ncircumstances under which this bill is being considered. Under normal \ncircumstances, I believe the Senate would have removed this provision \nfrom the final bill.\n  Next year I will introduce legislation to repeal the Jones Act waiver \nthat is contained in the Coast Guard authorization bill, H.R. 2204, for \nthe vessel Columbus. Mr. Chairman, it's my understanding that you and \nSenator Snowe will work with me to repeal this waiver as early as \npossible next year.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I recognize the concerns of the senior Senator from \nMichigan about this waiver. I will work with you to repeal the Jones \nAct waiver for the vessel Columbus.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I also recognize the Senator's concerns and I will work \nwith the Senator from Michigan to find a solution that eliminates an \nunfair competitive disadvantage when the Commerce Committee considers \nthe legislation as early as possible next year. This is a complex issue \nand I am sure that the Senator from Michigan would agree that fairness \nto all parties involved must be taken into account in addressing it. I \nwould also like to address the broader issue of what type of dredging \nshould be conducted on the Great Lakes so there is clarification on \nthis issue in the future.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate agree to \nthe amendment of the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I understand most all of the legislative and \nExecutive Calendar items that can be cleared have been considered by \nthe Senate. We are still working on some of the nominations for \nclearance. I thank all of my colleagues for their cooperation in the \n105th Congress. I hope they have a good campaign season and period at \nhome with their constituents and that we can work together on some very \nimportant issues in the 106th Congress.\n  We will have the final close in a few moments, but I understand there \nare at least one or two Senators who will have statements before we get \nto that.\n  Once again, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12947-4", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12959-S12960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE RICKY RAY BILL\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, first let me thank the majority leader for \nthe passage of the Ricky Ray bill, which just occurred a few moments \nago. This is a bill that I introduced, along with Senator Bob Graham, \nhere in the Senate. It was introduced in the House of Representatives \nby Representative Tauzin. It has certainly been worked on and helped \nimmensely by Speaker Gingrich, by Congressman Hyde and by Senator \nJeffords. It is a bill which I believe will do some justice in regard \nto a great tragedy. It is a great tragedy that has afflicted thousands \nand thousands of Americans through literally no fault of their own. \nThese are hemophiliacs who received tainted blood. Many of them have \ndied as a result of that. Many of them are suffering today, and their \nfamilies are suffering. They have tremendous expenses. They have the \nnormal expenses of being hemophiliac and on top of that they now have \nAIDS. The reason for this bill is to correct this injustice. The \ninjustice was that the Federal Government was simply not vigilant, did \nnot do what it should have done to protect the precious blood supply of \nthis country.\n  Those of us who have worked on this bill for the last several years, \nI think, have felt this was not just another bill in the Congress. We \nhave seen and we have talked firsthand to the families who have \nsuffered. I met in my office with a man from Ohio whose son died. His \nson died because of this tainted blood. As the father, one of the \ncaregivers of this child who had hemophilia, he was the one who had to \nadminister the blood. To talk to this father, with tears in his eyes, \nin my office, was something I will never forget. This bill will not \nbring his son back. It will not bring back those who have died. But \nwhat it will do for those families is give them some compensation,\n\n[[Page S12960]]\n\nsome help to deal with their medical expenses. Equally important, it \nwill be a very clear signal to them and to the country that when a \nmistake is made, when the Government does not do what it should do, \nwhen people suffer as they have suffered, that justice will be done. \nThis bill is about justice.\n  It is now on its way to the President. Again, I thank all of those \nwho have been involved in this: Senator Lott, Senator Jeffords, \nCongressman Hyde, Senator Bob Graham, Porter Goss in the House, the \nprime sponsor in the House, as well as Speaker Gingrich.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12959-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DRUG INTERDICTION\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I will now take a moment to discuss one of \nthe most important accomplishments of this Congress. It is an \naccomplishment that occurred about 4\\1/2\\ hours ago. Back in July, I, \nalong with a bipartisan, bicameral core group of legislators, came to \nthe floor and introduced a bill that called for a major new effort to \nrestore a balance to our drug interdiction and eradication efforts. \nToday, just this morning, after a few short months, this important \neffort has been included in the omnibus bill that we passed. It is \nincluded in the bill that is being sent to the President and that, with \nhis signature, will then become law.\n  This bill, this effort, is about restoring balance to America's \nantidrug efforts. Restoring balance to America's antidrug effort is a \nmajor accomplishment of this Congress. It is vitally important to the \nfuture of America's children. Our drug interdiction efforts, keeping \ndrugs out of this country, are lagging way behind where they ought to \nbe. Drugs are far too plentiful, far too easy to find, far too cheap, \nfar too easy to obtain. It is so easy. The amount of drugs in our \ncountry is at an unprecedented high level.\n  Back in the 1980s and 1990s we used to have a balanced antidrug \nstrategy. We provided the right balance of resources to fight drugs. \nWhat do I mean by balance? I think we have to take a multifaceted \napproach to the drug problem. We have to have treatment for those who \nneed that and who are willing to go into treatment. We have to have \neducation and other methods to stop people from starting drugs. We have \nto have domestic law enforcement, most of which is handled at the local \nlevel but, of course, it also includes the DEA and the FBI. And, we \nalso have to have international drug interdiction, stopping drugs from \nleaving the source countries--Peru, Bolivia and Colombia--stopping them \non the high seas, stopping them at the border. We have to have all four \ncomponents. What this bill does is restores that balance, or a better \nway of saying it, frankly, a more accurate way of saying it, is it \nbegins to restore this balance.\n  This effort is not just about providing resources. It is \ndemonstrating, rather, the will to stop drugs before they reach our \nborders. This is not just about dollars. It is not just about dollars \nand cents. It is also about leadership. It is the Federal \nGovernment's--our--responsibility, and the Federal Government's alone \nto stop drugs at the source or in transit to our borders. In the other \nareas, where we talk about treatment, or domestic law enforcement, \nprevention, education, all of these are shared responsibilities of the \nlocal communities and the State and the Federal Government and the \nprivate sector and the nonprofit groups. But when we talk about drug \ninterdiction, that is the one thing that nobody else can do but the \nFederal Government. That is our responsibility and the buck does, in \nfact, stop here.\n  It is the Federal Government's responsibility, and the Federal \nGovernment's alone, to stop drugs at the source or in transit to our \nborders. I have seen it firsthand. I have been to the Caribbean, I have \nbeen to the Bahamas, I have been off the coast of Haiti and off the \ncoast of the Dominican Republic. I have been along the border in El \nPaso. I have been into New Mexico. I have talked directly to the men \nand women of this great country who are fighting this war. We have \ngreat people who are doing that. I have seen firsthand that what we are \ncurrently providing to uphold this responsibility is simply not enough. \nIt is, frankly, inadequate. Just as we need military readiness to \ndefend America against war, we need drug interdiction readiness to \ndefend America against drugs.\n  We do know how to do it. We do know how to do it. We have great \npeople. We got our ideas for this legislation from the experts, from \nmen and women of key agencies such as the Coast Guard, Customs, DEA. \nThat is where the ideas for this legislation that will now become law \ncame from. Their resources have been dramatically reduced, tragically, \nin recent years. This bill begins--and I say begins--to fix this \nproblem by providing the very resources they need. We could not be here \ntoday without their assistance.\n  This was a bipartisan effort. We worked with both sides of the aisle. \nWe had Gen. Barry McCaffrey's involvement and his help and cooperation \nand assistance. Today we certainly can be proud of this victory, but \ntoday is just the first step. We have a long way to go to restore this \nbalance. We will be back next year to continue this war. But make no \nmistake about it, this bill is a major step towards keeping drugs out \nof our country. This bill will mean more planes in the air, more ships \nat sea, less drugs on the streets of America. We are back in the \nbusiness of putting the drug lords out of business.\n  I thank my good friend, Bill McCollum, Congressman McCollum from \nFlorida, for leading this effort in the House of Representatives. I \nthank Denny Hastert, chairman of the Speaker's drug task force, who did \na remarkable job in securing close to $700 million to get this \ninitiative started. I also thank our bipartisan core group on drug \ninterdiction--Senators Paul Coverdell, Bob Graham, Al D'Amato, Dianne \nFeinstein, Lauch Faircloth, and of course Porter Goss, Chuck Grassley \nand Kit Bond.\n  The Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, and Majority Leader Trent \nLott, both were absolutely instrumental in getting this included in the \nbudget package that we just passed. But for them it simply would not \nhave happened, and we know that.\n  The two chairmen of the Appropriations Committees, Senator Ted \nStevens and Congressman Bob Livingston, deserve our thanks for taking \nthe lead to include our initiative in their omnibus bill.\n  This legislation will make a huge difference in our efforts to win \nback America's future from the drug lords. It is just the beginning to \nrestore the balance but it is a major, significant beginning. It is a \nmajor victory. I thank my colleagues who worked so very hard on this.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12960-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12960-S12961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       AFRICA: SEEDS OF HOPE ACT\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like now to turn the Senate's \nattention to a very important foreign policy, as well as humanitarian, \nmeasure, a measure that has also been passed by the Congress. I am \nreferring to the Africa: Seeds of Hope Act.\n  Back in July, Senator Sarbanes and I introduced legislation on the \nSenate floor to promote small-scale agricultural and rural development \nin Africa, a bill cosponsored in the House of Representatives by our \ncolleagues, Doug Bereuter and Lee Hamilton, a bipartisan effort, a bill \nthat will save lives, a bill that will help people help themselves.\n  The Africa: Seeds of Hope Act represents a commitment to seek ways to \nhelp farmers in sub-Saharan Africa through sustainable agriculture, \nresearch, rural finance and extension projects. The bill will also \nrecognize important benefits such overseas agricultural advances could \nhold for America's farmers. The Senate and House have both passed the \nbill. It is now on its way to the President.\n  We need to sow seeds of hope in Africa. There are a vast number of \npeople in Africa who go each day without the necessary nourishment that \nwe in our country take for granted. In many parts of Africa, women and \nchildren struggle daily to find the food that will barely sustain them \nfor another day.\n  The problem in Africa has worsened over the last 30 years, and this \nis in spite of the fact that in many parts of the world the situation \nis getting better, and in Africa it is getting worse. The number of \nAfricans who are unable to produce the food and provisions they need to \nlead healthy, productive lives is tragically rising. According to the \nFood and Agriculture Organization, around 215 million people are \nundernourished in sub-Saharan Africa, and\n\n[[Page S12961]]\n\nthis number is expected to increase--increase dramatically--into the \nnext century.\n  Food is the basic necessity of life. It is an unfortunate reality \nthat many of the African people lead lives of needless suffering \nbecause they don't have the skills and tools necessary to help \nthemselves. As a result, many African countries are dependent on the \noutside world for humanitarian assistance and basic nutrition. These \ncountries import a large percentage of the food they consume. Africa's \nfood imports are projected to rise from less than 8 million metric tons \nin 1990, to more than 25 million metric tons by the year 2020. Mr. \nPresident, this is a very, very dangerous trend, and it must be \nchanged, it must be reversed.\n  The bill we just passed is based on the insight that the most \neffective way to improve conditions for Africa's poor is to increase \nthe productivity of their agricultural sector. Whenever I travel to \ndeveloping countries, I always like to spend time looking at that \ncountry's agricultural sector. I have seen firsthand in many countries \nthat their rural areas can succeed through agricultural development and \nthrough the right kind of assistance, the assistance that uses the \nexpertise that we have in this country at our universities, the \nexpertise that we have among our farmers, to share that knowledge and \nthat know-how.\n  About 70 percent of Africa's poor live in rural areas. That is where \nthe major problem is, and that is where this bill can make a \ndifference, because not only do we want to see and help these \nindividuals in rural areas feed themselves, we also understand that if \nthey cannot feed themselves, what they do is move to the cities. When \nthey move to the cities, many times the conditions are even worse than \nthe conditions they left in the rural areas. It is a trend we see \nworldwide, and it is a trend that is very, very dangerous. It breeds \ninstability, and it breeds other problems.\n  Rural and agricultural markets play a critical role in the majority \nof the African workforce. It has been reported that 70 percent of \nAfrican employment is in the agricultural market. If we are serious \nabout opening up new trade relations with the continent--and we should \nbe--then we need to be aggressive in helping to strengthen the \nfoundation for their survival.\n  Let me outline a few highlights of this bill.\n  This legislation first encourages agencies and organizations to make \nrural development issues a priority by teaching effective farming \nmethods to small-scale African farmers and entrepreneurs. This is \npeople to people, farmer to farmer and not dealing with many of these \ngovernments.\n  It provides African small farmers and entrepreneurs with improved \naccess to credit and other resources necessary to stimulate production \nin microenterprise.\n  It mobilizes new resources for investment in African agriculture and \nrural development through the U.S. Overseas Private Investment \nCorporation.\n  It facilitates the coordination of national and international \nagricultural research and extension efforts aimed at developing the \nskills of African researchers, African extension agents, farmers and \nagribusiness people. In fact, the bill would allow American \nuniversities to play a pivotal role in this effort.\n  Finally, this bill requires the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment, when providing nonemergency assistance through the Public \nLaw 480 title II programs, to include assistance programs for people \nwho are otherwise unable to meet their basic food needs, including \nfeeding programs for the disabled, for the orphaned, for the elderly, \nfor the sick and for the dying.\n  African farmers and the African people are in dire need of \nagricultural development. This bill can help them gain the knowledge \nthey need for this important development. At the same time, the \nlegislation will help our own agricultural producers by opening new \nexport markets for American farmers, especially those who deal with \nvalue-added goods.\n  Mr. President, as the economies in sub-Saharan Africa develop, their \ncitizens' incomes will increase, thus raising their standard of living. \nIn turn, they will be in a better position to purchase a new variety of \ngoods, including American agricultural commodities and equipment. This \nis where our export markets can flourish. As a citizen of Ohio, I am \nexcited at the export prospects for the hard-working farmers of my own \nState.\n  Another significant point to consider is that food stability is a \ncritical factor in preventing civil strife within nations. Our \ninvestment in international agriculture and rural development will help \nreduce demands for U.S. disaster and famine relief.\n  International agricultural development assistance has depleted over \ntime. In fact, over the past decade alone, money for this program has \ndropped by 70 percent. We should refocus our efforts in this important \nprogram, and this bill will do that.\n  Under this bill, USAID will be called upon to use its resources for \nprograms and improved food security and agricultural productivity for \nAfrican farmers.\n  This legislation has the ability to make a real difference in the \nlives of real people. As a compassionate Nation, we should want to aid \nthose less fortunate to better help themselves. The bill will help \nthese individuals make important progress in meeting human needs. In \npassing this bill, the U.S. Congress has done some very important work, \nand I congratulate my colleagues for the bill as we send it on its way \nto the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12960-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12961-S12962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         AN ATROCITY IN WYOMING\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, if I can turn to a much sadder topic. One \nof the saddest duties of public life is having to express moral truths. \nIt is sad because it should be unnecessary. Thomas Jefferson two \ncenturies ago enunciated some truths that he said ``we hold to be self-\nevident.'' We hold to be self-evident.\n  It should be self-evident that in a country of liberty, a country of \nrule of law and respect for human rights that we should condemn the \nmurder of any human being. We should, as a logical consequence of this \nprinciple, condemn the murder of people who have killed because the \nmurderers disapprove of some aspect of the murder victim's personal \nlife.\n  That is why our national attitude toward the atrocity that took place \nin Laramie, WY, on October 7 is so very important.\n  Let us all, as Americans, leave no doubt that the murder of young \nMatthew Shepard was a vicious, despicable crime. Again, it should--I \nrepeat--should be self-evident. But Mr. President, I have seen news \nreports that protesters, demonstrators, hecklers went to this young \nman's funeral to spew hatred and venom. Some might say their \ndemonstrations are protected by the first amendment, and that may or \nmay not be true--and I am not going to deal with that and talk about \nthat today --but what I wish to underscore today is that I, too, have \nfirst amendment rights--we all do--a right to tell the truth about \nthese demonstrators' conduct. And to do so, polite phrases might not be \nenough.\n\n  So let's make it very clear: The people who committed this crime are \ndespicable, they are scum. And the people who intruded on the privacy \nof this poor family, the family of the deceased, the people who \nintruded on their privacy at that hour of sorrow, to mock the deceased, \nmock this young man, these people who did this are lowlifes--they \nshould be condemned by all Americans. They deserve the contempt of all \ncivilized people.\n  Mr. President, I see that my colleague from Virginia has been on the \nfloor for some time. I also note the majority leader may be coming back \nat any moment. I would advise my colleague, the majority leader, as \nwell as my colleague from Virginia, that I have some additional \ncomments about another topic that would be fairly extensive. I would be \nmore than happy to yield at this point, either to the majority leader \nor to my colleague from Virginia, just with the understanding that I \nwill have the opportunity before the Senate does go out of session for \nthe year to make these comments.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I appreciate the consideration of my \ncolleague, the Senator from Ohio. I had planned to yield to the \nmajority leader.\n\n[[Page S12962]]\n\n He had said that he was going to return to finish his wrapup. And, \nindeed, if he is ready to do so now, I will yield; otherwise, I will \ntake advantage of this opportunity to make a few comments about the \nvote that we concluded this morning.\n  Mr. DeWINE. If I could reclaim my time, just for a moment --and the \nmajority leader I do not think was on the floor when I made the \ncomment--I advised my friend from Virginia, as well as the majority \nleader, that I do have some additional comments about a separate issue. \nI know the majority leader needs to do the final wrapup. I am not sure \nwhether he is ready to do that.\n  Mr. LOTT. We are, I believe, ready to move through a number of \nnominations if you would allow me to proceed at this point.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12961-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12962-S12968]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, this Congress has taken steps to \nsignificantly reduce the Federal judicial vacancy rate to its lowest \nlevel in almost a decade. As Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I am \nproud to boast about some of the successes that have been achieved this \nCongress by the Committee and Republican Senate. I also feel compelled \nto set the record straight that the Committee and Republican Senate \nthis Congress have been dedicated and productive.\n  One could speculate that if the Democrats controlled the Senate, more \nClinton nominees would have been confirmed. But then again, maybe not. \nThis Congress, the Committee held hearings for 111 out of 127 judicial \nnominees. Of the 16 nominees that did not have hearings, 3 withdrew \nfrom consideration. The Committee held 23 judicial, and an additional 8 \nnon-judicial, nominations hearings for a total of 31 nominations \nhearings. In all, this Congress the Republican Senate confirmed 101 \njudicial nominees, which is well above the average confirmed over the \nlast five Congresses, which is 96. Indeed, notwithstanding the rhetoric \nwe often heard from the other side of the aisle, according to the \nAlliance for Justice, a liberal judicial watch group, almost 50% of the \njudges confirmed by the Republican Senate have been women and/or \nmembers of a minority group.\n  The Republican Senate, by working in a fair and orderly manner, also \nreduced the vacancy rate of the Federal Judiciary to 5.9%--the lowest \nvacancy rate since the Judiciary was expanded in 1990. While \nconsidering this rate, keep in mind two things: first, that the Clinton \nAdministration is on record as having stated that a vacancy rate just \nover 7% is virtual full-employment of the judiciary, and second, that \nthe Clinton Administration did not get around to nominating anyone for \n29 of the 50 vacant judgeships. To put it another way, this \nAdministration failed to nominate anyone for almost 60% of the current \njudicial vacancies. Thus, the Republican Senate would have been \nprecluded from filling every single judicial vacancy because it cannot \nconfirm judges whose nominations it has not received.\n  The accusation that the Republican Senate delays consideration of \ncertain nominees is simply a ploy to divert attention away from the \nfact that qualified, non-controversial nominees, which constitutes the \noverwhelming majority of nominees, were confirmed promptly, usually by \nunanimous consent. Indeed, one need go no further than the high number \nof Clinton Administration nominees that were confirmed by this year's \nRepublican Senate to determine whether their motives were anything but \naltruistic.\n  Yes, there were some controversial nominees that did not move, and in \nfact, some of these nominees were forced to withdraw. But the \nconfirmation process is not a numbers game, and I will not compromise \nthe Senate's advice and consent function simply because the White House \nhas sent us nominees that are either not qualified or controversial. \nThere are a range of factors which make a nominee controversial or \ndifficult to confirm, such as lack of experience or questionable \ninformation contained in materials not in the public domain or in their \npast records that may be at variance with the proper role of judges in \nsociety. But I assure you that gender, ethnicity, and race are not \nincluded in the determination.\n  For me, the touchstones in evaluating the qualifications of a nominee \nare whether they are committed to upholding the rule of law and \nproperly understand the limitations of the judicial role. The Senate \nhas an obligation to the American people to review thoroughly the \nrecords of the nominees it receives to ensure that they are capable and \nqualified to serve as Federal judges and will not spend a lifetime \ncareer rendering politically motivated decisions. I would not, in good \nconscience, vote for the confirmation of any nominee whom I believed \nwould abdicate his or her duty to interpret and enforce, and instead \nmake, the laws of this Nation.\n  As Committee Chairman, I take my role in the confirmation of judges \nvery seriously, and would not allow irrelevant criteria to be analyzed \nin determining a nominee's fitness to sit on the Federal bench, \npractically speaking, for what amounts to life tenure. As a Senator, I \ntake my role of advice and consent equally as serious and would not \ntolerate the disingenuous consideration of any nominee.\n  The demagogues and naysayers can continue to impugn the purported \nsecret motives of the Republicans and\n\n[[Page S12964]]\n\ncontinue to malign those who exercise their Constitutional duty to \nthoroughly evaluate and review the complete record and background of \neach nominee before casting a vote in favor or in opposition thereto. \nAnd the Republican Senate will continue to plow ahead in the next \nCongress honorably and fairly discharging its Constitutional duties \nwithout wavering. However, I could not leave this Congress without \ncongratulating my fellow Republican Senators, Senator Lott in \nparticular, for all of their hard work and accomplishments in what, at \ntimes, has been a contentious atmosphere. Senator Lott has done his \nbest and has acted in a fair and principled manner in processing these \nnominees. He is to be commended.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as the Senate concludes this second session \nof the 105th Congress, I want to take a moment to thank Senator Hatch, \nthe Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, for working with us to \nconfirm judges desperately needed around the country. He pressed \nforward with three confirmation hearings in October, which resulted in \nsending another nine judicial nominees to the Senate calendar. He \nsupported each of the nominees confirmed by the Senate this year and \nworked hard to clear judicial nominees reported by the Committee for \naction by the Senate. I also thank the Majority Leader for proceeding \nto consider the judicial nominations confirmed in these last days of \nthe session.\n  For the year, the Senate confirmed 65 federal judges to the District \nCourts and Courts of Appeals around the country and to the Court of \nInternational Trade. In addition, we confirmed a number of judges to \nthe United States Court of Claims and to the court for the Northern \nMariana Islands.\n  Senator Hatch is fond of saying that the Senate could do better. I \nagree with him and hope that we will continue to do better next year. I \nbegan this year challenging the Senate to maintain that pace it \nestablished in the last nine months of last year. Had we done so, we \ncould have confirmed 90 judges. Instead, the Senate has acted to \nconfirm only 65 of the 91 nominations received for the 115 vacancies \nthe federal judiciary experienced this year.\n  Together with the 36 judges confirmed last year, the total number of \narticle III federal judges confirmed during this Congress to a 2-year \ntotal of 101--the same total that was confirmed in one year when \nDemocrats made up the majority of the Senate in 1994. The 104th \nCongress (1995-96) resulted in a 2-year total of only 75 judges being \nconfirmed. By way of contrast, I note that during the last two years of \nthe Bush Administration, even including the presidential election year \nof 1992, a Democratic Senate confirmed 124 federal judges.\n  Meanwhile 50 judicial vacancies remain. This is one of the largest \nnumber of vacancies left unfilled at the end of a Congress. In 1983 \nvacancies numbered only 16. Even after the creation of 85 new \njudgeships in 1984, the number of vacancies had been reduced to only 33 \nby the end of the 99th Congress in 1986. At the end of the 100th \nCongress in 1988, which had a Democratic majority and a Republican \npresident, judicial vacancies numbered only 23. In 1996 the Republican \nSenate adjourned leaving 64 judicial vacancies. This year the Senate is \nadjourning leaving 50 judicial vacancies and the number is likely to \nincrease during the recess.\n  Moreover, the Republican Congress has refused to consider the \nauthorization of the additional judges needed by the federal judiciary \nto deal with their ever increasing workload. In 1984 and in 1990, \nCongress did respond to requests for needed judicial resources by the \nJudicial Conference. Indeed, in 1990, a Democratic majority in the \nCongress created judgeships during a Republican presidential \nadministration. Last year the Judicial Conference of the United States \nrequested that an additional 53 judgeships be authorized around the \ncountry. If Congress had passed the Federal Judgeship Act of 1997, \nS.678, as it should have, the federal judiciary would have 103 \nvacancies today. That is the more accurate measure of the needs of the \nfederal judiciary that have been ignored by the Congress over the past \nseveral years.\n  In order to understand why a judicial vacancy crisis is plaguing so \nmany federal courts, we need only recall how unproductive the \nRepublican Senate has been over the last three years. More and more of \nthe vacancies are judicial emergencies that have been left vacant for \nlonger periods of time. The President has sent the Senate qualified \nnominees for 23 of the current judicial emergency vacancies, 15 of \nthose nominations that are still pending as the Senate prepares to \nadjourn.\n  In his 1997 Year-End Report, Chief Justice Rehnquist focussed on the \nproblem of ``too few judges and too much work.'' He noted the vacancy \ncrisis and the persistence of scores of judicial emergency vacancies \nand observed: ``Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable \ntime for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote.'' He \nwent on to note: ``The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm \nany particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it \nshould vote him up or vote him down.''\n  During the entire 4 years of the Bush administration there were only \nthree judicial nominations that were pending before the Senate for as \nlong as 9 months before being confirmed and none took as long as a \nyear. In 1997 alone there were 10 judicial nominations that took more \nthan 9 months before a final favorably vote and 9 of those 10 extended \nover a year to a year and one-half. Of the judges confirmed this year, \nProfessor Fletcher's confirmation took 41 months--the longest-pending \njudicial nomination in the history of the United States--Hilda Tagle's \nconfirmation took 32 months, Susan Oki Mollway's confirmation took 30 \nmonths, Ann Aiken's confirmation took 26 months, Margaret McKeown's \nconfirmation took 24 months, Margaret Morrow's confirmation took 21 \nmonths, Judge Sonia Sotomayor's confirmation took 15 months, Rebecca \nPallmeyer's confirmation took 14 months, Dan Polster's confirmation \ntook 12 months, and Victoria Roberts' confirmation took 11 months.\n\n  I calculate that the average number of days for those few lucky \nnominees who are finally confirmed is continuing to escalate. In 1996, \nthe Republican Senate shattered the record for the average number of \ndays from nomination to confirmation for judicial confirmation. The \naverage rose to a record 183 days. Last year, the average number of \ndays from nomination to confirmation rose dramatically yet again, and \nthat was during the first year of a presidential term. From initial \nnomination to confirmation, the average time it took for Senate action \non the 36 judges confirmed in 1997 broke the 200-day barrier for the \nfirst time in our history. It was 212 days. Unfortunately, that time is \nstill growing and the average is still rising to the detriment of the \nadministration of justice. This year the Senate will break last year's \nrecord. The average time from nomination to confirmation for the 65 \njudges confirmed this year was over 230 days.\n  In addition, nominations are being forced to sit on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar for longer and longer periods of time. Unlike \nearlier days in the Senate when nominees were not made to wait for \nweeks and months on the Senate calendar before they could be \nconsidered, that is now becoming the rule. Margaret Morrow, Sonia \nSotomayor, Richard Paez, Ronnie White, Patrick Murphy and Michael \nMcCuskey each spent more than four months on the Senate Executive \nCalendar awaiting action.\n  Further, this Congress is concluding with four judicial nominations \nthat have been favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee still \npending on the Senate Executive Calendar. Two were reported without \nobjection by unanimous consent. I do not know why Justice Ronnie L. \nWhite and Judge William J. Hibbler, two outstanding African-American \nnominees are being held on the Senate calendar without a vote. I regret \nthat the Majority Leader was unable to call up for a vote the \nnomination of Judge Richard Paez to the Ninth Circuit or the nomination \nof Timothy Dyk to the Federal Circuit.\n  Most Congresses end without any judicial nominations left on the \nSenate Executive Calendar. Indeed the 99th, 101st, 102nd, and 103rd \nCongresses all ended without a single judicial nomination left on the \nSenate calendar. The Democratic Senate majority in the two Congresses \nof the Bush Administration ended both those Congresses, the 101st and \n102nd, without a single judicial\n\n[[Page S12965]]\n\nnomination on the calendar. By contrast, the Republican Senate majority \nin the last Congress, the 104th, left an unprecedented seven judicial \nnominations on the Senate Executive Calendar at adjournment without \nSenate action. The 105th Congress is concluding with four qualified \njudicial nominees being denied action by the Senate.\n  At each step of the process, judicial nominations are being delayed \nand stalled. Judge Richard Paez, Justice Ronnie L. White, Judge William \nJ. Hibbler and Timothy Dyk are being denied consideration by the \nSenate. Marsha Berzon, Anabelle Rodriquez, Clarence Sundram, and \nMatthew Kennelly were each denied a vote before the Judiciary Committee \nfollowing a hearing. Judge James A. Beatty, Jr., Helene N. White, Jorge \nC. Rangel, Ronald M. Gould, Robert S. Raymar, Barry P. Goode, among a \ntotal of 13 judicial nominees, end this Congress without ever having \nreceived a hearing before the Judiciary Committee.\n  At the conclusion of the debate on the nomination of Merrick Garland \nto the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, as \n23 Republicans were preparing to vote against that exceptionally well-\nqualified nominee whose confirmation had been delayed 18 months, \nSenator Hatch said ``playing politics with judges is unfair, and I am \nsick of it.'' I agree with him. I look forward to a return to the days \nwhen judicial nominations are treated with the respect and attention \nthat they deserve.\n\n\n                     Nomination of Edward J. Damich\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today the Senate will confirm the \nnomination of Edward J. Damich to be a judge on the Court of Federal \nClaims. Mr. Damich has been the Chief Intellectual Property Counsel to \nthe Judiciary Committee since 1995. He has already had a distinguished \ncareer and is highly qualified to fill this challenging position. He \nreceived an A.B. degree from St. Stephen's College in 1970, a J.D. \ndegree from the School of Law of Catholic University in 1976, and LL.M. \nand J.S.D. degrees from Columbia University School of Law. Upon his \ngraduation from law school, he joined the faculty of the Delaware Law \nSchool of Widener University as a Professor of Law where he remained \nuntil 1984. From 1984-95, he was a Professor of Law at the George Mason \nUniversity School of Law. During 1992-1993, Mr. Damich also served as a \nCommissioner of the Copyright Royalty Tribunal.\n  Mr. Damich also has numerous accomplishments outside his professional \ncareer. He was named Outstanding Faculty Member in 1980 and 1984, and \nis listed in Who's Who in American Law. He has served as President of \nthe National Federation of Croatian Americans and as a Board Member of \nthe Washington Area Lawyers for the Arts. He is also widely published \nin both the acadmic and professional forums.\n  His hard work and intellect has made him a true asset to the \nCommittee, and his presence will be missed. I am confident that he will \nmake a terrific judge, and I wish him all the luck in this very \nimportant stage of his career.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to express my support for the \nnomination of Edward Damich to the U.S. Court of Federal Claims. I \nbelieve he is a fine choice for this important position.\n  Before joining the staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1995 as \nChief Intellectual Property Counsel, Mr. Damich served as a \nCommissioner of the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel. In that \ncapacity, he was involved in numerous copyright issues, including the \nproper distribution of millions of dollars in copyright licensing fees. \nFurther, for many years, he served as a Professor of Law in the area of \nintellectual property, first at Delaware Law School and later at the \nGeorge Mason University School of Law in Virginia.\n  Mr. Damich has been an asset to the Senate Judiciary Committee in \nrecent Congresses. He is a strong supporter of property rights and has \nbrought a wealth of knowledge of intellectual property law to his work. \nHe has played an important supporting role on many important pieces of \nlegislation in this area, including most recently the Digital \nMillennium Copyright Act.\n  Mr. Damich is well qualified to serve on the Court of Claims, and I \nam pleased to support his nomination.\n\n\n                         judge norman a. mordue\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate has \nconfirmed Norman A. Mordue to the bench of the United States District \nCourt for the Northern District of New York.\n  Norman Mordue is a distinguished and competent jurist, having \npreviously served as an assistant district attorney and county judge. \nHe is now a New York Supreme Court justice. He is also a war hero. He \nearned this country's second highest military honor, the Distinguished \nService Cross for Extraordinary Heroism, while serving as an infantry \nplatoon leader with the 1st Air Cavalry Division in Vietnam.\n  Judge Mordue has been active in many New York State Bar activities--\nhe is a presiding officer in the Bar's judicial section and a \ncontinuing legal education lecturer--and he has been elected by his \npeers to head the Supreme Court Justices' Association. I have every \nconfidence that he will make an excellent addition to the federal \njudiciary.\n\n\n                     nomination of margaret seymour\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to express my strong support for \nJudge Margaret Seymour, President Clinton's nominee to be a United \nStates District Judge for the District of South Carolina. Judge Seymour \nwill replace Judge William Traxler, an excellent jurist who I \nrecommended to the President for the District Court and who has just \nbeen elevated to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Judge Seymour had a varied legal career in the private sector and in \ngovernment service before becoming an Assistant United States Attorney \nin South Carolina in 1990. During four of her six years in the U.S. \nAttorney's office, she was Chief of the Civil Division. Also, she twice \nserved as Interim United States Attorney, once in 1993 and again in \n1996.\n  She was appointed a United States Magistrate Judge for the District \nof South Carolina in 1996, where she serves today. In that capacity, \nshe is known as a diligent and fair jurist. She is also a person of \ncharacter and integrity.\n  I am very pleased to support her, and I am confident she will be a \nvery able addition to the District Court.\n\n\n                     nomination of denise o'donnell\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate will \nconfirm Denise O'Donnell to be the United States Attorney for the \nWestern District of New York. She now becomes the first woman in the \nhistory of the 17-county Western District to be chief federal \nprosecutor. No woman before has ever had a presidential appointment in \nthe district to one of the top three justice posts: judge, prosecutor \nor federal marshall.\n  Ms. O'Donnell is a career Assistant U.S. Attorney. She came to the \nWestern District in 1985 as an Assistant U.S. Attorney and was named \nFirst Assistant in 1993. She has served as Interim U.S. Attorney since \nSeptember 1997. In addition, she was a part-time instructor in the the \nTrial Technique Program at her alma mater, the State University of New \nYork at Buffalo Law School. She graduated summa cum laude from that \ninstitution and was the senior editor of its law review.\n  During her distinguished career as a prosecutor, Ms. O'Donnell has \nhandled a host of complex criminal matters, including cases involving \nRICO, tax fraud, narcotics, and violent crimes. She is also an active \nparticipant in her local and state bar organizations and, last year was \nthe Women Lawyers Association Lawyer of the Year.\n  I am confident that Ms. O'Donnell will serve with the highest \ndistinction.\n\n\n                    nomination of margaret e. curran\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today the Senate will consider the \nnomination of Margaret E. Curran as U.S. Attorney for the District of \nRhode Island. I wholeheartedly support Ms. Curran's nomination and \nappreciate its speedy consideration by the Judiciary Committee. It \ncertainly is noteworthy that Ms. Curran will be the first woman to \nserve as U.S. Attorney for Rhode Island in the more than two hundred \nyears that this position has existed.\n  Ms. Curran has served as Interim U.S. Attorney since May. She has \nproven herself to be a thoughtful, competent, and qualified federal \nprosecutor. I have every confidence that she will continue to do a fine \njob as the chief federal law enforcement office in Rhode Island. An \neditorial in the Providence Journal said of Ms. Curran:\n\n[[Page S12966]]\n\n``She has shown herself to have capacious qualities of leadership, \nintellectual rigor, and good humor,'' qualities that will serve her \nwell as U.S. Attorney.\n  Ms. Curran has twelve years of experience as a federal prosecutor. \nShe has earned wide regard from the legal community in Rhode Island. \nAnd she enjoys resounding support from Governor Lincoln Almond, who, \nfor twenty years, held the position she will assume.\n  Meg Curran is a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania and \nreceived a Master of Science Degree in anthropology from Purdue \nUniversity. In 1983, she received her Law Degree from the University of \nConnecticut, where she served as editor-in-chief of the Connecticut Law \nReview. Before serving in the U.S. Attorney's office, Ms. Curran was \nclerk to the Honorable Bruce M. Selya, U.S. District Court for the \nDistrict of Rhode Island and for the Honorable Thomas J. Meskill, U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit. She is a member of the Rhode \nIsland Bar Association, serves on the Federal Branch-Bar Committee, as \nwell as the Roger Williams American Inn of Court, the First Circuit \nGender Bias Task Force, and the American Law Institute. Also, Ms. \nCurran is professor of advanced criminal law at Roger Williams \nUniversity Law School in Rhode Island.\n  I am delighted that the Senate is prepared to confirm Margaret Ellen \nCurran as U.S. Attorney for the District of Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Senate's \nconfirmation of Margaret Ellen Curran as U.S. Attorney for the District \nof Rhode Island. I am proud to have been involved in the historic \nnomination of this outstanding career prosecutor. A native of \nProvidence, Meg is the first woman to serve as Rhode Island's federal \nattorney. Her confirmation by the U.S. Senate today sends a clear \nmessage to career federal attorneys that their work and service is \nvalued.\n  Ms. Curran brings not only the necessary legal expertise and \ntechnical skill to this position, but she has also demonstrated the \nprosecutorial temperament necessary to carry out her significant \nresponsibilities in a fair and judicious manner. I am confident that \nU.S. Attorney Curran will serve Rhode Island and its people extremely \nwell.\n  Ms. Curran graduated from Pilgrim High School in Warwick. She \nreceived a B.A. degree from the University of Pennsylvania, a Master of \nScience from Purdue University, and her law degree from the University \nof Connecticut School of Law, where she was Editor in Chief of the Law \nReview. After graduation, Meg served as a law clerk to the Honorable \nBruce Selya, then a federal district judge in Rhode Island. She nexted \nserved a clerkship for the Honorable Thomas Meskill on the Second \nCircuit Court of Appeals. After her second clerkship, in 1985, Meg \nbecame an associate at the Providence law firm of Wistow & Barylick \npursuing general litigation matters.\n  Since 1986, when she joined the U.S. Attorney's Office in Rhode \nIsland, Meg has distinguished herself as an outstanding prosecutor. As \na trail prosecutor, Meg tried a range of cases involving white-collar \ncriminals, organized crime, illegal weapons possession, and was \nresponsible for obtaining the largest monetary penalty, at the time, \nfor the illegal discharge of pollutants into Narragansett Bay.\n  In 1990, Meg was appointed as the district's Principal Appellate \nAttorney and Appellate Chief. In that position she has had primary \nresponsibility for all appeals. As Appellate Chief she has successfully \npursued precedent setting cases involving both mandatory sentencing for \ncareer criminals as well as heightened penalties for dealers of \ndangerous drugs.\n  Meg has proven herself an accomplished trial and appellate attorney, \nand, for this, she has been recognized. She has received the annual \nSpecial Achievement Awards for Sustained Superior Performance of Duty \nfrom the Department of Justice four times. In 1993, she was named the \nFederal Employee of the Year by the Federal Executive Council of Rhode \nIsland. Today, the United States Senate has provided her with the \nultimate recognition of a career prosecutor by confirming her as U.S. \nAttorney for the District of Rhode Island.\n  In addition to her professional service, Meg has also found time to \nserve her community. Since 1995, Meg has been an adjunct professor at \nRoger Williams University School of Law, teaching advanced criminal \nprocedure. She is a member of the Rhode Island Bar Association and \nserves on the Federal Bench/Bar Committee. Meg also serves on the First \nCircuit Gender Bias Task Force and is a member of the Board of Trustees \nof the Rode Island Zoological Society.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to have been involved in the nomination of \nU.S. Attorney Curran. I wish her, her husband Michael, and their \ndaughter Margee the very best.\n\n\n                     confirmation of cardell cooper\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support \nfor the confirmation of Cardell Cooper to be the Department of Housing \nand Urban Development's (HUD) Assistant Secretary for Community \nPlanning and Development. I thank the members of the Banking Committee, \nChairman D'Amato, and Ranking Member Sarbanes for moving Mr. Cooper's \nnomination swiftly through the Committee.\n  Mr. Cooper served with distinction as mayor of East Orange, New \nJersey from 1990 to 1997. Prior to serving as mayor, from 1988 to 1990, \nMr. Cooper was County Administrator for Essex County, where he was \nresponsible for day-to-day management of the one of the largest and \nmost urban counties in New Jersey.\n  As a mayor and county administrator, Mr. Cooper was on the front \nlines. His practical experience, coupled with his passion for public \nservice, makes him an excellent choice for this post. He knows the \ncritical difference that development programs can make to communities \nand their residents, and the importance of forging strong partnerships \nbetween local, state and federal governments. His commitment to local \neconomic development programs serving our young people, such as \nYouthBuild, and urban environmental initiatives, such as the \nbrownfields program, will fuel his efforts to help our urban leaders \nsucceed. Through his work with the Conference of Mayors, he has built \nsolid relationships with mayors across the country and enjoys \nbipartisan support. His endorsement by the Conference of Mayors is a \ntestament to the leadership he has provided.\n  Mr. President, while professional experience and particular skills \nare important for effective service, Cardell Cooper has the personal \nstrengths and attributes the Senate looks for in nominees to high \nposts. He is an energetic leader, with a strong work ethic and a deep \ncommitment to public service and the mission of the Department. I can \npersonally attest to his integrity and ability to work well within a \nlarger organization.\n  Mr. President, I hope the full Senate will act expeditiously to \nconfirm Cardell Cooper as HUD's new Assistant Secretary for Community \nPlanning and Development.\n\n\n                      confirmation of harold lucas\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to convey to the full \nSenate my overwhelming support for the confirmation of Harold Lucas to \nbe the Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) new \nAssistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. I especially want to \nthank Chairman D'Amato and Ranking Member Sarbanes, and all the members \nof the Senate Banking Committee, for moving Mr. Lucas' nomination so \nquickly through the Committee.\n  Mr. Lucas has first-hand knowledge of the challenges facing our \nnation's public housing authorities. Prior to his nomination, Mr. Lucas \nserved as Executive Director of the Housing Authority of the City of \nNewark, New Jersey. When Mr. Lucas took hold of the reins at the \nHousing Authority in 1992, HUD considered it to be a ``troubled'' \nagency, and had given it failing grades since its creation in the \n1970s. Within two years of taking over, Mr. Lucas turned things around. \nLast year, the agency received a 94 percent rating--an A in anyone's \nbook--and is now considered one of the top performing housing agencies \nin both New Jersey and the nation.\n  During his tenure, Mr. Lucas tore down many dilapidated high-rise \nbuildings and replaced them with more attractive townhouse-style \nhousing that\n\n[[Page S12967]]\n\nprovides a better quality of life for tenants and improves the \nneighborhoods that surround it.\n  Mr. Lucas' dedication to helping public housing residents achieve \nself-sufficiency, and his strong commitment to ensuring the safety and \nviability of our public housing stock, are testament to his \nqualifications for this position. I am confident that our nation's \nhousing authorities will be well served by having someone as dynamic \nand experienced as Mr. Lucas at the helm.\n  Mr. President, I therefore urge the full Senate to conform, without \ndelay, Mr. Lucas to be HUD's new Assistant Secretary for Public and \nIndian Housing.\n\n\n                 Commerce Committee And Labor Committee\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I further ask unanimous consent that the Commerce Committee \nand the Labor Committee be immediately discharged from further \nconsideration of the following nominations, and further that the Senate \nthen proceed to their consideration: John Moran, Harold Creel, Ashish \nSen, Anita Jones, Pamela Ferguson, and nominations in the Public Health \nService.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The nominations considered en bloc are as follows:\n\n\n                           commerce committee\n\n       John A. Moran, of Virginia, to be a Federal Maritime \n     Commissioner for the term expiring June 30, 2000.\n       Harold J. Creel, Jr., of South Carolina, to be a Federal \n     Maritime Commissioner for the term expiring June 30, 20004. \n     (Reappointment)\n       Ashish Sen, of Illinois, to be Director of the Bureau of \n     Transportation Statistics, Department of Transportation, for \n     the term of four years.\n\n\n                            labor committee\n\n       Anita K. Jones, of Virginia, to be a Member of the National \n     Science Board, National Science Foundation, for a term \n     expiring May 10, 2004.\n       Pamela A. Ferguson, of Iowa, to be a Member of the National \n     Science Board, National Science Foundation, for a term \n     expiring May 10, 2004.\n\n\n                         public health service\n\n       Public Health Service nominations beginning Robert W. \n     Amler, and ending Cheryl A. Wiseman, which nominations were \n     received by the Senate and appeared in the Congressional \n     Record on April 24, 1998.\n       Public Health Service nominations beginning Marie A. \n     Coffey, and ending Julia C. Watkins, which nominations were \n     received by the Senate and appeared in the Congressional \n     Record on July 7, 1998.\n\n\nnominations of john a. moran and harold j. creel, jr., federal maritime \n                             commissioners\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate unanimously confirmed the \nnominations of John A. Moran and Harold J. Creel, Jr. to serve as \nFederal Maritime Commissioners. John Moran will be replacing Joseph \nScroggins on the Commission while Hal Creel will be serving a second \nterm as Chairman of the FMC. I applaud the selection of these two \nhighly qualified individuals for these important positions.\n  John Moran brings more than a decade of congressional and legislative \nexperience in maritime transportation and policy to the FMC. During his \nnine-year tenure as a staffer in the House and Senate, John focused on \na number of important maritime issues, including the Oil Pollution Act \nof 1990. His work on the 1990 amendments to the Shipping Act of 1984 \nand the 1991-1992 Advisory Commission on Conferences in Ocean Shipping \n(ACCOS) ensures that he is well prepared for his FMC assignment. The \nACCOS process crystallized the concerns of stakeholders regarding the \nShipping Act of 1984 and was a forerunner to S. 414, the Ocean Shipping \nReform Act of 1998. This experience will serve John well as he assumes \nthe shared responsibility for implementing that Act. I have great \nconfidence in John Moran's ability and integrity.\n  Hal Creel has been the Chairman of the FMC for more than four years. \nDuring that time, the agency has gone from being characterized as \n``obsolete'' to being hailed as a champion of free and open access to \nforeign trade markets. Hal deserves tremendous credit for this reversal \nof fortune. Through Hal's leadership, the FMC has punished unfair \nforeign shipping practices in Japan and is reviewing similar concerns \nregarding shipping practices in China and Brazil. Hal has also \ndemonstrated the FMC's willingness to respond quickly to industry \ncomplaints regarding violations of the Shipping Act of 1984. More than \n90% of all U.S. international trade is transported by ships. \nMaintaining a fair and open international ocean shipping system is \nvital to this nation's economy. Hal is clearly deserving of another \nterm as Chairman of this crucial independent agency.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to take this opportunity to express \nmy thanks to another FMC commissioner, Ming Hsu, for her long service \nto this agency. Ming Hsu supplies a wealth of experience in Asia-U.S. \ntrade to the FMC. This has proven vital to addressing a number of ocean \nshipping concerns in this increasingly important trade lane.\n  With the President expected to sign the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of \n1998 in the coming days, I am confident that the Federal Maritime \nCommission, with Hal Creel, John Moran, Ming Hus, and Del Won, is more \nthan ready to implement this landmark legislation.\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \ncongratulate two nominees, Mr. Hal Creel and Mr. John Moran, upon their \nconfirmation to be Federal Maritime Commissioners.\n  Hal Creel, a native of South Carolina and my former Senior Counsel on \nthe Maritime Subcommittee, has been a Federal Maritime Commissioner for \nfour years. He has served the last two and a half years as the agency's \nChairman. As Chairman, he has demonstrated a wide-ranging knowledge of \nthe maritime industry and an outstanding ability to oversee industry \nactivities. Our Nation is extremely fortunate to have such a dedicated \nindividual at the helm of this important government body.\n  Mr. Creel and the Federal Maritime Commission are responsible for \noverseeing all international liner shipping in the U.S.--over $500 \nbillion in trade. His efforts in the controversy surrounding Japan's \nrestrictive port practices come immediately to mind.\n  The Government of Japan for many years has orchestrated a system that \nimpedes open trade, unjustly favors Japanese companies, and results in \ntremendous inefficiencies for anyone serving Japan's ports. The FMC, \nunder Mr. Creel's guidance, met these problems head-on and he was \ninstrumental in bringing the two governments to the bargaining table. \nThe bilateral agreement that resulted paves the way for far-reaching \nchanges that can remove these unfair barriers to trade. The progress \nmade to date has occurred in large measure due to the Commission's \nfirm, results-oriented approach. I urge him to continue to keep the \nJapanese honest, and to perform their agreed upon obligations.\n  Hal Creel also has led the Commission in its efforts to resolve \nunfavorable trading conditions with the Peoples Republic of China and \nBrazil. These trades pose differing problems, but circumstances that \nnonetheless restrict U.S. companies or render their business dealings \nunnecessarily difficult or simply inefficient.\n  Hal Creel is widely respected by all sectors of the industry as an \ninvolved, knowledgeable Chairman who can be trusted to make impartial \ndecisions based on all relevant factors. This has been evidenced by the \nobjective, informed decisions he renders in formal proceedings, his \nvoting record on important agency matters, and the evenhanded \nenforcement program administered by the Commission. As Chairman of the \nFMC, Hal Creel has worked hard to curb harmful practices and create \nequitable trading conditions for the entire industry. He takes a \npersonal stake in these matters and works hard to obtain industry \ncompliance with the laws passed by this Congress. But those who \nwillfully violate the law or intentionally disregard the Nation's ocean \nshipping policies as contained in the Shipping Act are dealt with \nappropriately.\n  These are turbulent times in the liner shipping industry, times that \ncall for effective and respected leadership from our Nation's \nregulatory body. Mr. Creel provides that leadership now, and I am \ncertain will continue to do so as the industry enters the new \nenvironment that will result from the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998 \npassed by this body last week.\n  I am proud of the accomplishments and fine work Hal has done at the \nFMC. I am also proud that he is a native South Carolinian. He certainly \nhas continued the fine tradition and excellence he established as a \nstaffer and\n\n[[Page S12968]]\n\nsenior counsel for the Senate Commerce Committee. His reappointment is \nwell deserved.\n  I also wish to convey my support for John Moran to become a \nCommissioner at the FMC. John also is a former Commerce Committee \ncounsel who served all members of that Committee with distinction. John \nand Hal worked together at the Committee on a bipartisan basis, \nslugging through tough issues and serving all of the Members well.\n  For my Senate colleagues who do not know Mr. Moran, his only fault is \nthat he is not from South Carolina. He has demonstrated his abilities \nand intellect time and time again. He is well suited to be a Federal \nMaritime Commissioner. Currently, John works representing the American \nWaterways Operators, as their Vice President for legislative affairs. \nJohn also has an outstanding reputation within the maritime and \ntransportation industry sectors.\n  I congratulate these two deserving individuals, who have been \nappointed to the agency which plays such a critical role in \ninternational trade.\n\n\n                      Foreign Relations Committee\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I also ask unanimous consent that the Foreign Relations \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of the following \nnominations which are currently at the desk, and agreed to by both \nsides, and the Senate proceed to their consideration, en bloc.\n  The nominations considered en bloc are as follows:\n       Robert Patrick John Finn, of New York, a Career Member of \n     the Senior Foreign Service, Class of Counselor, to be \n     Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the United \n     States of American to the Republic of Tajikistan.\n       C.

Mr. President, I would like to speak briefly on the omnibus \nappropriations bill that we approved this morning. It was roughly a \n$500 billion omnibus appropriations bill. And I would like to begin by \nsaying that I am thankful that we did not shut down the Federal \nGovernment to resolve our spending differences this year. That was \nclearly a failed approach that disillusioned our Nation and unjustly \npunished the dedicated Federal employees who serve the American people. \nBut I also have to say I have enormous concern with how we got here, \nand with some of the consequences of the road we traveled.\n  Like every one of our colleagues, I am pleased with many aspects of \nthis bill, but disappointed with other aspects. I am pleased that we \nfinally achieved justice for farmers who face racial discrimination at \nthe USDA, that we have acted decisively to strengthen our Nation's \ndefenses, that we have invested substantially in improving the \neducation of our children, that we have refrained--for now at least--\nfrom interfering in the local operation of our region's airports, and \nthat we were able to eliminate some of the most egregious anti-\nenvironmental riders.\n\n  I'm disappointed that we abandoned fiscal discipline and avoided, \nonce again, making the tough choices to pay for our priorities. \nInstead, we spent $21 plus billion of the so-called ``surplus,'' which \nwe should be saving to protect Social Security, and we failed to enact \nanother round of base closures to help fund needed military readiness \nimprovements. I'm also disappointed that we couldn't make the cuts \nnecessary to find the funds needed to help localities that are \nstruggling to modernize their schools.\n  Mostly I'm disappointed by the process that led us to an up or down \nvote, with virtually no debate, on eight separate annual spending bills \nconsolidated into a giant roughly $500 billion package that funds \nnearly one third of our government. Mr. President, we have a obligation \nto debate our priorities in the open and make the tough decisions, just \nlike American families are required to do every day.\n  I believe this process amounts to a dereliction of our duty as \nrepresentatives of the people. While I appreciate the hard work of the \nappropriations committees, this all-encompassing appropriations bill \nhas ultimately been the work product of too few people with no \nrealistic opportunity for amendment. Members were left to hope that \ntheir interests, and the interests of those they represent, were being \nadvanced. This is heavy burden to ask the appropriations committee and \nthe leadership to bear, and we shouldn't be placing them in that \nposition.\n  We should be able to debate, and vote, about whether funds should be \nspent on improving our system of education, and about how they should \nbe spent. We should be able to debate, and vote, about how to remedy \nracial discrimination in the federal government. And we should able to \ndebate, and vote, about the best way to protect the environment.\n\n  But instead of the open debate we need, instead of the careful \nconsideration by each and every member of the public policy \nconsequences that affect our states and nation, we have what amounts to \na take-it-or-leave-it appropriations bill that will, again, fund nearly \none-third of the federal government.\n  There's no question, Mr. President, that there are times when a take-\nit-or-leave it approach is necessary. I support, for example, the base \nclosure process because it is the only mechanism we have devised which \nforces members of Congress to vote for the politically unpopular \nclosure of unnecessary military facilities. And in order to maintain \nour role as the world's sole remaining superpower, the need to \nundertake another round of base closures to increase funding in \ncritical areas will become an imperative. I also support take-it-or-\nleave-it fast track trade authority to promote free trade because it's \nthe only way other governments will negotiate with us that can achieve \nmeaningful results.\n  But when it comes to deciding our priorities in federal spending, we \nneed a more open and rational process. Each year that we proceed in \nthis fashion, I become more convinced that we should follow the lead of \nmany states, like my own, Virginia, and undertake biennial budgeting. \nWe should alternate a year of appropriations with a year of oversight. \nJust today, I signed onto an effort by Senator Domenici to institute \nbiennial budgeting.\n  Due to our failure to pass a budget resolution this year, we have \nbeen guided in large part by the balanced budget agreement we reached \ntwo years ago. I supported that agreement, because when I came to the \nSenate in 1988, one of my highest priorities was fighting for fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  But the problems we've encountered this year in passing our \nappropriations bills stem directly from the unrealistic goals we \nestablished in the balanced budget agreement. We all but ignored the \n800 pound gorilla sitting in the room--entitlement spending--and \ninstead focused on reducing our investments through future cuts in \ndiscretionary spending. I certainly support weeding out unnecessary \ndiscretionary spending, which is why I support the line-item veto, but \neffectively lowering discretionary caps in real terms, without regard \nto where those cuts might fall, is not the wisest approach.\n\n  The discretionary caps we established in 1997 did not require that \ntough decisions be made. It merely left to a future Congress the \ndifficult choices in dividing a shrinking pie. We are now that ``future \nCongress'' and we're having a difficult time reaping what we have sewn. \nSo we cut ``phantom'' future investments to preserve current \nconsumption spending. But to reduce federal spending, and to someday \nreduce the national debt, we really need to reform entitlement \nprograms. And the longer we wait, the more difficult the task will \nbecome.\n  So while I'm pleased that we reached our destination, I'm extremely \ndisappointed with the road we took to get here. And I hope that during \nthe next Congress, we will work to improve the appropriations process, \nto get our fiscal work done on time and in the open, and to begin the \nenormous task of reforming entitlement programs and saving Social \nSecurity by making the tough choices.\n  Mr. President, I reluctantly supported the appropriations bill today \nbecause, while the process that produced the bill is a terrible one, \nthe failure to enact the bill would have been far worse. Without this \nbill there would have been another government shutdown, and the funds \nwouldn't be there to bolster our military, improve the education of our \nchildren, and render long-denied justice for those who've suffered \ndiscrimination. Despite all the benefits this bill will provide, \nhowever, I strongly object to violating our fiscal discipline and \nspending $21 billion of the surplus, which will ultimately make the job \nof saving Social Security more difficult.\n  Next year, we've got to do better.\n\n[[Page S12970]]\n\n  With that, Mr. President, I wish our departing colleagues well during \nour adjournment and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12969-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12970-S12972]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WORLD AFFAIRS\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, in a few short minutes the curtain will \nfall on this Congress. Today we complete our legislative business. Yet \nthe business of global peace and national security will continue. \nIssues such as our global economy, regional stability, nuclear \nproliferation, proliferation of biological and chemical weapons--just \nto name a few--determine the condition of this business. It is a \nbusiness that requires the daily attention of our world leaders, \nincluding the President of the United States, including his advisors, \nand including, yes, this Senate.\n  Yet today it is claimed that our national attention is not focused on \nthe kinds of affairs that have a huge impact on our national security. \nIt is claimed that our focus is not made on foreign affairs. Even our \nPresident, we are told, is not able to devote to foreign policy the \nlevel of commitment and leadership our country needs. We are told he is \ndistracted. Some say he was distracted first by a lengthy independent \ncounsel investigation, and now distracted by a congressional \nimpeachment process. We are told he is distracted needlessly from doing \nthe job at hand.\n  Distracted. That is a word that has gotten quite a bit of mileage \nlately. It has found its way into our editorial pages and into our \nSunday morning talk shows. We are told by the political columnists and \nTV pundits that all of us were distracted in this country--all of us--\nby the Starr investigation and the Starr report.\n  Soon it will be the House impeachment process that draws our \nattention. We are told that all of us are distracted--the American \npeople, the Congress, and first of all, the President--by all of this. \nWe are told that that distraction is dangerous--dangerous because it \ncould send the wrong signal to a rogue nation or a terrorist group or \nfurther complicate an already complex global economic slowdown.\n  The conclusion that seems to be reached by a number of people is that \nit is in our best interest, perhaps even our national security \ninterest, to achieve an expedited resolution of the impeachment \nprocess, and to do it quickly. Some argue that what we need is an \nalternative to the impeachment process itself. Some have used the term \n``censure'' or ``reprimand.'' I am deeply concerned that the upcoming \nimpeachment process is perceived as a distraction, one that inhibits \nthe kind of vision and strategic planning that we must expect from the \nleader of the world's sole superpower.\n  This perception is not lost on those around the globe who have a \nstake in American leadership. And who doesn't have a stake in American \nleadership? One European Finance Minister here in Washington for the \nannual IMF World Bank talks was quoted in the New York Times with the \nfollowing:\n\n       You might find that the leader of the world's biggest \n     economy could spend more time figuring out ways to save the \n     world economy if he was not trying to save his job.\n\n  There is no reason for the President of the United States to be \ndistracted to the point of even remote danger to our national security. \nIn other words, we must not let the perception of distraction dictate \nthe reality. We can and must address our interests here and abroad in \nthe midst of this constitutional impeachment process.\n  For that reason, we cannot let this perceived distraction in any way \nundermine our constitutional duties as Members of Congress. Perhaps \nmost important, we cannot let this argument of distraction serve as an \nexcuse to avoid the kind of long-range planning and decisionmaking, the \nstrategic thinking, that we need, and should expect, from our President \nin regard to the American foreign policy during these very difficult \ntimes.\n  These are difficult times, perhaps the most difficult and the most \nchallenging period in the post-cold-war era. Since the end of the cold \nwar we have experienced a combined period of peace and prosperity \nprobably not seen in this country since the 1920s. However, ours has \nnot been a tranquil peace. The President had to send ground troops to \nSomalia, Haiti, and most recently to Bosnia. We have taken to the air \nwith swift military action in Iran, Sudan and the hills of Afghanistan. \nWe made a show of force in Iraq, the Taiwan Straits, and recently in \nSerbia. If the last 7 years have proven one lesson, it is clear that \nthe challenges of peace do not end with its achievement. It must be \nprotected, enforced and advanced with the same vigilance and \ndetermination we used in the past to arrive at this point in history. \nAs Henry Kissinger reminded our young allies more than 10 years ago:\n\n       History knows no resting places. What does not advance must \n     sooner or later decline.\n\n  The world has not been resting. Indeed, this has been a time of \nincreasing restlessness. At no time since the fall of the Soviet Union \nhas the world needed either individual or collective leadership more \nthan it does today. We are in need of leadership that strives not just \nfor quick fixes but solutions that look beyond the short term. When the \nworld looks for leadership, it can only look one place, and that is to \nthe United States. If the United States does not lead, there is no one \nelse who can lead, no one else who will lead. We must lead.\n\n  The issues we face are numerous, complex, interrelated and \npotentially self-destructive. As we near a new millennium, we find \nourselves at a virtual crossroad in so many different areas. We stand \non the brink of a nuclear arms race in Asia and the Middle East. \nNationalism raised the prospect of war in several regions, from Central \nEurope to Asia, and most ominous, we face a worldwide economic \ndislocation, and perhaps a global recession, a global recession that \nthreatens to undermine, if not overwhelm, the progress of the \ndemocracies that we have seen springing up in virtually every corner of \nthe world. Each one of these challenges has serious economic and \nsecurity consequences for our own country. Each one of these issues \nrequires leadership from the United States.\n  Let me expand briefly on each of these challenges. First, the threat \nof a nuclear arm race in Asia and the Middle East raises serious \nquestions about the effectiveness of our own unilateral and our \nmultilateral efforts to control the flow of materials, to control the \nflow of technology and information that is needed to build a nuclear \nweapon and the means to deliver. In May of this year, as we all recall, \nIndia and Pakistan both reinforced their status as nuclear powers. \nChina, as we all know, has gone to great length to advance its own \nballistic missile capability. And 3 years after an agreement with the \nClinton administration to cease its nuclear weapons program, North \nKorea may still be moving forward to acquire nuclear weapons. In \nAugust, North Korea tested a two-stage ballistic missile that \ndemonstrated its capability to deliver a nuclear payload.\n  When the Persian Gulf war ended in 1991, both sides agreed to a U.N. \nSecurity Council resolution that required the destruction and banned \nfuture possession and development of nuclear, chemical and biological \nweapons in Iraq. But time and time again, Iraq has demonstrated its \nclear resolve never to abide by this resolution. The United Nations \ndemonstrated it has no resolve to insist on compliance.\n  Iran continues to actively pursue a nuclear weapons program. The \ncapability, if obtained, could fuel a nuclear arms race throughout Asia \nand the Middle East. Perhaps of greatest concern, nuclear proliferation \nin this region raises the risk that a nuclear device could end up in \nthe hands of terrorist organizations or other elements hostile to the \nUnited States or hostile to the free world.\n  While these nations have challenged international nuclear \nnonproliferation policies and agreements, others are asserting \nnationalism as well as ethnic prerogatives, prerogatives which have \ntested the United Nations and our NATO allies.\n  Certainly we can point to the success of the stabilization forces to \nsustain the Dayton peace accords in Bosnia. However, when will the \nultimate end game be in sight? At what point can our troops return \nhome? At what point can real peace sustained by the Bosnians themselves \never be achieved?\n  While we struggle to find the end game of peace in Bosnia, we are \njust beginning to make the opening moves and struggle to restore peace \nin the neighboring Serbian province of\n\n[[Page S12971]]\n\nKosovo. Milosevic has pledged to abide by U.N. demand, but only after \nthe United States and our NATO allies started speaking with force, \nshowing that they are ready. Bosnia has taught us hard lessons. We \ncannot rest on a commitment made by a war criminal, and the actions or \ninactions over the last week clearly reinforce that, as well.\n  To the east, Turkey finds itself in military buildup against two \nadversaries, Syria and Greece. This administration now has been in a \nweek-long struggle to revive, once again, the single issue that has \nkept peace and democracy bottled on the eastern shore of the \nMediterranean, the peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.\n  The regional tensions I have just described are fueled by ethnic and \nhistoric tensions that clearly go back for generations, go back \ncenturies. It is safe to say that to achieve stability all sides have \nto defy the history of violence and bloodshed that preceded. While \nthese nations attempt to reinforce their place in history, other \nnations are trying to save or achieve the economic and democratic \nsuccess stories of recent history. Currency downturns across all of \nAsia now threaten the economic vitality in Latin America, particularly \nin Brazil. International drug trafficking from South America to the \nU.S.-Mexico border also undermines legitimate economic development \nefforts by countries in the production and transit zones. Our own \nefforts have to look to the larger global economic picture. For \nexample, forcing a drop in the U.S. currency relative to the yen may \nmake Japanese products less expensive, but it effectively makes \nproducts made by their Asian competitors more expensive, which could \nstall economic growth in places like Thailand or Singapore.\n\n  Mr. President, I have outlined a series of challenges. Each of these \nchallenges offers no simple solutions. Let's be very clear and honest \nabout that. Each has long-term consequences, though, for U.S. national \nsecurity. All of them are really interrelated. For example, the harder \nit is for Russia to right herself economically and politically, the \nharder it will be for Russia to avoid marketing its own destructive \nassets--those assets, of course, being nuclear technology.\n  Mr. President, President Clinton is looking to leave a legacy; \nsurely, he must be. The challenge to leave such a legacy to advance \nglobal peace and prosperity into the next century is there for the \ntaking. Mr. President, the American people should not accept the \nupcoming impeachment process, or investigation--however we want to \nphrase it--as an identified impediment to achieving that legacy. What \nit would reveal instead is an administration that is lacking in the \ncreative administrative capacity to articulate and advance a long-term \nforeign policy agenda. It is that failure to articulate and then stand \nby that agenda that poses the real risk to U.S. interests around the \nworld.\n  Mr. President, it is important that we put the impeachment process \nlaunched by the House of Representatives in its proper perspective. We \nare not faced today with a constitutional crisis. Instead, we are \nbeginning a constitutional process. We don't know the ultimate outcome \nof that. It is a constitutional process designed by our Founding \nFathers, designed to be a check on the potentially abusive power of a \nPresident. It is up to us in Congress to ultimately determine what \n``high crimes and misdemeanors'' mean, and to ultimately determine what \nthe facts are. It is up to us to follow that constitutional process \nthat was laid out over 200 years ago by the founders of this country.\n  Mr. President, for impeachment, the Constitution provides Congress a \nway to preserve the integrity of the President and, more to the point, \nto define this process and the kinds of practices that would fall into \nthe category of high crimes and misdemeanors. Certainly a President \nfaced with this constitutional process will have to devote time and \neffort to overcome the possible removal from office. We know that. But \nshould we seek to limit or alter this process arbitrarily because it \ntakes him away from other perhaps more pressing duties? Certainly not.\n  Mr. President, impeachment is not the only process in our \nConstitution that can result in removal of a President. The \nConstitution provides a regular formal check on the President's powers \nknown as ``elections''--the electoral process itself. As we all know, a \nPresident who is subjected to this constitutional process has to devote \na great deal of time and attention to prevent his removal from office \nby the people. It is called running for election and running for \nreelection. Campaigns have become longer and more expensive. They \ndemand more and more of a President's time and energy. This has taken \nplace in the midst of challenging times. Not one time was this normal \nelection process altered because of its potentially adverse affects on \na President's ability to lead in times of difficulty, or even in times \nof crisis. Abraham Lincoln fought both a military war to save the union \nand a political war to save his Presidency in 1864. Franklin Roosevelt \nbattled economic depression, and then Nazi and Japanese aggression, \nthrough three reelection campaigns. All of his successors, except one, \nfrom Harry Truman to George Bush had to wage and win a cold war, stop \nand dismantle communism, run a campaign and, at the same time, remain \nin office.\n  I cite these examples because we expect our Presidents to exercise \nleadership even when they are being subjected to a political process \nthat could result in their removal from office. Although the \nimpeachment process raises very serious issues, it is no more a \nconstitutional crisis than the very electoral process itself. Even \ntoday, in the days when Presidents are actively involved in reelection \ncampaigns that begin almost immediately after being sworn into office, \nwe expect our President to not let the campaign distract him from \nexercising leadership on the larger issues that are vital to this \ncountry. Nor have we ever postponed an election because of any fear \nthat it would disrupt or threaten our Nation's security --not even when \nour Nation was at war, not even when our Nation was bitterly divided.\n  Mr. President, with that in mind, we should not allow the current \nimpeachment proceedings to be used as an excuse for not confronting the \nmore important challenges we face in the world today. As I said in the \nbeginning of my remarks, the business of national security and global \npeace is never-ending. This makes Presidential leadership a full time \njob, no matter what constitutional processes are utilized to remove the \nPresident from office by those who elected him or those tasked to \nprotect the integrity of that office, whether it is what we consider to \nbe the normal every-four-year reelection process or this extraordinary, \nunusual process that is clearly prescribed in the Constitution--the \nimpeachment process that we are about today.\n\n  Therefore, Mr. President, any process to address the charges raised \nby the independent counsel, short of that provided for in the \nConstitution, would be a grave mistake. I am confident that the \nchairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Congressman Henry Hyde, will \nconduct a thorough and fair hearing. Congressman Hyde will not let the \nprocess last a day longer than is needed. It is a process that will \nconsume the time of many members of the legislative and executive \nbranch of Government. However, it is a process put in place by the \nfounders of this country to preserve the integrity of representative \ngovernment. We have a duty to follow that process. It is not in \nanyone's interest to cheapen or weaken this process in a way that \ncompromises our system of Government.\n  With that said, the process must continue. I am confident that the \nHouse and the Senate will conduct themselves in a way that will give \nconfidence to the American people that we are following the \nConstitution and that we are doing what we think is right--whatever the \noutcome.\n  Mr. President, I urge the President of the United States to \ndemonstrate that we are a country capable of following our Constitution \nand maintaining our position of leadership in the world. That could \nonly occur if the President brushes aside the talk of distraction and \ntakes on the numerous challenges before us. Ultimately, Mr. President, \nthe truest sign of weakness is not a President focused on the \nconstitutional process at hand, but an entire administration that is \nnot prepared to exercise the leadership needed to work with our\n\n[[Page S12972]]\n\nallies, develop sound policies, and then abide by them.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12970-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12972-S12973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                                TREATIES\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of the \nresolution of ratification of two treaties that are of unsurpassed \nimportance to America's prospects in the global economy of the 21st \ncentury.\n  The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) treaties are \nhardly the topics of everyday conversation in my home state of Ohio, or \nin any of my colleagues' home states. But they are critically important \ntreaties. Every country that ratifies these treaties is required to \nupdate its laws against the piracy of copyrighted materials, and to \nextend those laws to the electronic commerce marketplace epitomized by \nthe Internet. That outcome will be great news for Ohioans, and for all \nAmericans.\n  American creativity is the envy of the world today. Our music, \nmovies, computer software, video games and published materials are in \ngreat demand in almost every country in the world. In fact, taken as a \nwhole, the industries dependent on copyrighted are our country's single \nbiggest export earner, with an estimated $60 billion in exports and \nforeign sales in 1996. No wonder studies show that the creative \nindustries are one of most dynamic sectors of our economy, accounting \nfor some 3.5 million U.S. jobs.\n  The greatest single threat to this economic success story is piracy. \nNew technology heightens this threat. The Internet and other digital \nmedia offer great potential for bringing the fruits of American \ncreativity to new markets; but they also make it easier than ever \nbefore for pirates to make unlimited numbers of perfect copies of our \ncreative works, and distribute them around the world--literally at the \ntouch of a button.\n  That's where these two new treaties come in. By requiring countries \nto upgrade their copyright laws, and to update them for the digital \nage, the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms \nTreaty, provide critical new legal tools in the fight against piracy \nworldwide. That will help make overseas markets safer for the export of \nU.S. music, movies, software and books--and encourage the further \ngrowth of this key sector of our economy.\n  Ratification of the WIPO treaties advances another important goal--\none that does not simply translate to dollars and cents. It helps to \nunderscore the need for responsible conduct on the Internet. People who \nwould never even consider shoplifting a CD or a videocassette from a \nstore sometimes think the same rules about respecting private property \nshould not apply in cyberspace. Ratifying these two treaties helps to \ndispel that illusion. That's good news, not only for the creative \ncommunity--songwriters, performers, software designers, authors--but \nalso for all our families as they explore the exciting new territory of \nthe Internet.\n  Mr. President, as a member of the Judiciary Committee, I worked with \nmy colleagues to hammer out the legislation needed to implement the \nstandards of the WIPO treaties in U.S. law. Since our copyright law is \nalready strong, only a few provisions had to be added--but, some \nprovisions were contentious, and I am pleased that we were able to \nachieve a balanced, compromise solution that commanded almost unanimous \nsupport. That legislation, which also made other important improvements \nto our copyright law, is on its way to the President's desk, and I urge \nhim to sign it.\n  Today's action complete the job, by authorizing the Administration to \nformally ratify the two treaties. It will also send a powerful message \nto our trading partners--some of whom must make many more extensive \nchanges to their copyright laws in order to meet the standards of these \ntreaties--that now is the time to move forward on this critical task.\n  I commend my colleagues in the Foreign Relations Committee for moving \nthis measure to the Senate floor so promptly after the Senate's \nadoption of the implementing legislation, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the resolution of ratification.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, on September 10, 1998, in my role as \nChairman of the Subcommittee on International Economic Policy, Export \nand Trade Promotion, I chaired the Foreign Relations Committee hearing \non two important treaties that the Senate will ratify today. I refer to \nthe World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty (WCT) and \nthe World Intellectual Property Organization Performances and \nPhonograms Treaty (WPPT), collectively known as the WIPO Treaties, done \nat Geneva on December 20, 1996, and signed by the United States on \nApril 12, 1997. These treaties will play a key role in assuring U.S. \nglobal competitiveness in the electronic commerce marketplace of the \n21st century.\n  The purpose of the WIPO Treaties is to respond to the challenges of \nprotecting copyrighted works, performances and sound recordings in the \nrealm of digital technology. The adoption of these treaties represents \na major step toward achieving adequate protection of intellectual \nproperty in the growing global economy. Bringing these treaties into \neffect will greatly facilitate global electronic commerce, and will \nfacilitate exports and foreign sales of U.S. copyrighted materials in \nmarkets around the world.\n  In the hearing I chaired regarding the WIPO Treaties, the Foreign \nRelations Committee heard testimony from representatives of the \nAdministration and from the information technology, telecommunications, \nand motion picture industries, including Jack Valenti, President and \nCEO of the Motion Picture Association of America, as well as from a \ncoalition of educational and library interests. All the witnesses gave \ntheir overwhelming support for U.S. ratification of the WIPO Treaties. \nHowever, the main message that came from the hearing was that the WIPO \nTreaties needed to pass in conjunction\n\n[[Page S12973]]\n\nwith the corresponding implementation legislation that would update \ncurrent U.S. copyright laws. We will have accomplished that task.\n  On October 8, 1998, the Senate unanimously passed the conference \nreport to H.R. 2281, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. This \nlegislation will allow for the full implementation of the WIPO \nTreaties, by modifying current U.S. law in a few areas to meet the \nobligations imposed by the treaties and to ensure that liability \nquestions are clearly defined in the treaties. U.S. copyright laws are \nstrong and are vigorously enforced. However, these changes were needed \nto bring them up to date so U.S. law fell into compliance with the WIPO \nTreaties.\n  American creativity is the key to our competitiveness in this global \neconomy. With so many industries in the United States protected by \ncopyright--such as the computer software, music, recording, audio-\nvisual and publishing industries--being among the most dynamic and \nfastest-growing sectors of the U.S. economy, it is important to protect \nthese industries. In 1996, in a study commissioned by the International \nIntellectual Property Alliance, it was estimated that the U.S. creative \nindustries contributed almost $280 billion to the Gross Domestic \nProduct, and accounted for some 3.5 million jobs, surpassing any single \nmanufacturing sector by both measures. Most important, the estimated \n$60 billion of foreign sales and exports by the U.S. copyright \nindustries in 1996 made them the leading export sector of the entire \neconomy. Consequently, the strength of legal protection in other \ncountries for U.S. copyrighted materials is a key factor in promoting \nour global competitiveness.\n  The growth of digital networks such as the Internet offers an \nexciting opportunity for enhanced access by U.S. creators to world \nmarkets, but also presents a threat in the form of increased digital \npiracy of American works of authorship. The same technology that \nenables rapid and efficient authorized dissemination of U.S. \ncopyrighted materials around the world also enables pirates to make and \ndistribute perfect copies of these materials without authorization, \nmore rapidly and efficiently then ever before, and with less risk of \ndetection. Network-based digital piracy threatens to inflict losses on \nAmerican creators that dwarf the estimated $18-20 billion which our \ncreative industries now lose to overseas piracy every year. For these \nreasons, I plan to hold a hearing next year in my subcommittee on \nInternational Economic Policy, Export and Trade Promotion on the \neffects of software piracy on the U.S. economy as well as the global \neconomy.\n  Given the leading role of the U.S. creative industries in the global \ntrade in computer software, music and recordings, and published test \nmaterials, it is clearly in the U.S. national interest for the WIPO \nTreaties to come into force as soon as possible. Prompt U.S. \nratification of the treaties will send a clear message to other \ncountries and will provide critical momentum to the drive to bring the \ntreaties into force.\n  I urge my colleagues to approve the Resolution of Ratification, and \nthus complete the process of giving the Senate's advice and consent to \nthese two important treaties.\n  Mr. DeWINE.  Mr. President, also on behalf of the majority leader, \nSenator Lott, I ask for a division vote on the resolutions of \nratification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A division is requested.\n  Senators in favor of the ratification of the treaties please stand \nand be counted. (After a pause.) Those opposed to the ratification will \nplease stand and be counted.\n  On this vote, with two-thirds of the Senators present having voted in \nthe affirmative, the resolutions of ratification are agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/21/senate-section/article/S12972-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "21", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12973]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask the Chair lay before the Senate a \nmessage from the House of Representatives on the bill (S. 2375) to \namend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Foreign Corrupt \nPractices Act of 1977, to strengthen prohibitions on international \nbribery and other corrupt practices, and for other purposes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the House of Representatives:\n       Resolved, That the House disagree to the Senate amendments \n     numbered 2 through 6 of the House amendment to the bill (S. \n     2375) entitled ``An Act to amend the Securities Exchange Act \n     of 1934 and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, to \n     strengthen prohibitions on international bribery and other \n     corrupt practices, and for other purposes'', and agree the \n     Senate amendment numbered 1 with the following amendment:\n       In lieu of the matter proposed to be stricken by such \n     amendment strike line 8 on page 23 of the House engrossed \n     amendments and all that follows through line 2 on page 25 and \n     insert the following:\n       (c) Extension of Legal Process.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as required by international \n     agreements to which the United States is a party, an \n     international organization providing commercial \n     communications services, its officials and employees, and its \n     records shall not be accorded immunity from suit or legal \n     process for any act or omission taken in connection with such \n     organization's capacity as a provider, directly or \n     indirectly, of commercial telecommunications services to, \n     from, or within the United States.\n       (2) No effect on personal liability.--Paragraph (1) shall \n     not affect any immunity from personal liability of any \n     individual who is an official or employee of an international \n     organization providing commercial communications services.\n       (3) Effective date.--This subsection shall take effect on \n     May 1, 1999.\n       (d) Elimination or Limitation of Exceptions.--\n       (1) Action required.--The President shall, in a manner that \n     is consistent with requirements in international agreements \n     to which the United States is a party, expeditiously take all \n     appropriate actions necessary to eliminate or to reduce \n     substantially all privileges and immunities that are accorded \n     to an international organization described in subparagraph \n     (A) or (B) of subsection (a)(1), its officials, its \n     employees, or its records, and that are not eliminated \n     pursuant to subsection (c).\n       (2) Designation of agreements.--The President shall \n     designate which agreements constitute international \n     agreements to which the United States is a party for purposes \n     of this section.\n\n\n                          colloquy on s. 2375\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I am aware that the Senator from Montana has raised \nconcerns regarding section 5 of the bill. Do the amendments considered \nby the Senate today satisfy your concerns?\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator would yield, as the Ranking Democrat of \nthe Senate Banking Committee, I would also like to know the views of \nthe Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank my colleagues. Yes, the amendments do satisfy my \nconcerns.\n  The amendments to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) approved \nby the Senate today, to implement in the United States the OECD \nConvention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Public Officials in \nInternational Business Transactions, are an important achievement in \nensuring fair play for American companies doing business overseas. The \nvalue of this legislation for U.S. business fully justifies the action \nwe are taking today. However, there are provisions in this bill that \nare unrelated to implementation of the\n\n[[Page S12974]]\n\nOECD convention. I would have preferred a bill that did not contain \nthese unrelated provisions, principally embodied in Section 5.\n  The House earlier passed S. 2375 with an amendment making significant \nchanges to language addressing the treatment of international \norganizations providing commercial communications services which had \nearlier been contained in Section 5 of H.R. 4353 as reported by the \nHouse Commerce Committee. These changes reflect an agreement between \nthe House and Senate Commerce Committee leaders. It is my understanding \nthat the House Commerce Committee report accompanying H.R. 4353 \naddressing Section 5 of that bill is not germane to the interpretation \nof section 5 in light of the significant changes made therein.\n  With respect to Section 5 and the other provisions of the bill \nconcerning the international organizations INTELSAT and Inmarsat, the \nSenate is accepting these provisions because of our understanding that \nnothing in the bill will change the immunities treatment of INTELSAT \nand Inmarsat, nor create an inconsistency with U.S. obligations under \ninternational agreements (e.g., by requiring action or inaction by the \nExecutive Branch) or interfere with the President's authorities under \nthe constitution to conduct the foreign relations of the United States. \nTo achieve the objectives of Section 5, the President can be expected \nto use existing and future negotiations aimed at the privatization of \nthe telecommunications services of INTELSAT and Inmarsat.\n  I have the following specific views with regard to the bill's \ntelecommunications provisions:\n  The United States remains in a positions to meet fully its \nobligations under the INTELSAT Headquarters Agreement, an international \nagreement under which the United States has undertaken international \nlegal obligations to INTELSAT. Nothing in the statute changes the \nimmunity standards of that Agreement. Based on my discussions with the \nadministration, I expect that the President will designate the INTELSAT \nHeadquarters Agreement under subsection (d)(2).\n  The requirement in [section 5(d)(1)] for the President, consistent \nwith requirements in international agreements to which the U.S. is a \nparty, to take all appropriate actions to eliminate or limit \nsubstantially any privileges and immunities from suit or legal process \naccorded to an international organization applies only to suits or \nlegal process in respect of the organizations' commercial activities. \nSuch an interpretation would be consistent with the theory of sovereign \nimmunity to which the United States adheres.\n  The requirements [in Section 5(d)] for the President, consistent with \nrequirements in international agreements to which the U.S. is a party, \nexpeditiously take all appropriate actions to eliminate or limit \nsubstantially privileges and immunities does not compel the President \nto take any action which the President may find to be contrary to the \ninterests of the United States and does not compel the President to \ndecertify INTELSAT or Inmarsat under the International Organizations \nImmunities Act I am pleased that subsection 5(d) gives the President \nbroad discretion to determine what measures are ``appropriate'' to \nachieve the objectives of section 5.\n  The bill should not frustrate negotiations by the President to \nprivatize successfully the commercial activities of INTELSAT and \nInmarsat in a fashion that eliminates all privileges and immunities for \nsuch activities; this being the best means of satisfying the objective \nof fair and open commercial competition.\n  I further understand that all efforts of INTELSAT and Inmarsat to \nrestructure into private business organizations constitute core \nfunctions of these organizations, not commercial functions, within the \nmeaning of subsection (c)(1) of Section 5.\n  I understand that Section (5) of S. 2375 is not intended to overturn \nor disturb any judicial decision interpreting the privileges and \nimmunities of signatories of INTELSAT and Inmarsat, especially Alpha \nLyracom (PanAmSat) v. COMSAT, 946 F.2d 168 (2d Cir. 1991).\n  It is my understanding that subsection (d) of Section (5) is intended \nto become effective on May 1, 1999 when subsection (c) becomes \neffective, since the two subsections are intended to operate in \nconcert.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to clarify the scope and intent of this \nlegislation. At this time, I would like to ask the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona, the Chairman of the Committee on Commerce, \nScience and Transportation if he concurs?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Montana. I do concur with the \nstatements just delivered concerning the interpretation of Section 5 in \nS. 2375.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank my colleague from Arizona.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask that the Senate recede from its \namendments numbered 2 through 6. I further ask the Senate concur in the \nHouse amendment to the Senate amendment numbered 1.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nconcur in the amendment of the House with a further amendment which is \nat the desk on behalf of Senators Murkowski and Bumpers.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3842) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am very pleased at the Senate's \npassage of S. 2117, as amended, which includes a number of legislative \nitems of great interest to my home state of New Mexico. This \nlegislation allows for transfer by the Secretaries of Agriculture and \nInterior real property and improvements at the old Jicarilla Ranger \nDistrict Station, near the village of Gobernador, New Mexico to San \nJuan College. It also allows for transfer by the Secretary of the \nInterior real property and improvements at the old Coyote Ranger \nDistrict Station, near the small town of Coyote, New Mexico, to Rio \nArriba County. An additional provision will amend the National Trails \nSystem Act to designate El Camino Real de Tierra Adentro as a National \nHistoric Trail, and finally, this bill will convey tracts of land--paid \nfor by Carlsbad Irrigation District and referred to as ``acquired \nlands''--back to the district, which I have been working to accomplish \nfor several congresses.\n\n[[Page S12979]]\n\n  All of these provisions have bipartisan and administrative support, \nand all will improve the lives of New Mexicans around the state. \nRegarding the Jicarilla Ranger District transfer, the Forest Service \ndetermined that the ten acres in question are of no further use to them \nand recently endorsed passage of this bill to provide long-term \nbenefits for the people of San Juan County and the students and faculty \nof San Juan College in northwest New Mexico. The Coyote Ranger Station \nin northern New Mexico will also continue to be used for public \npurposes, including a community center, and a fire substation. Some of \nthe buildings will also be available for Rio Arriba County to use for \nstorage and repair of road maintenance equipment, and other County \nvehicles.\n  Over one third of the land in New Mexico is owned by the federal \ngovernment, and therefore finding appropriate sites for community and \neducational purposes can be difficult. These transfers are logical \nsince they provide facilities and lands for community use while \nremoving unwanted and unused land and facilities from federal \nownership.\n  Amending the National Trails System Act to designate El Camino Real \nde Tierra Adentro as a National Historic Trail, commemorating the \nSpanish settlement of the southwest United States is particularly \nappropriate in this year of the Cuartocentenario. 1998 is the 400th \nanniversary of the establishment of the first Spanish capital at San \nJuan Pueblo, the first terminus of the El Camino Real by Don Juan de \nOnate. We in New Mexico are most proud of this chapter in our Nation's \nhistory. This trail represents the migration route into the interior of \nthe continent by Spanish settlers, and I am pleased that our nation \nwill honor this part of its history.\n  Finally, the transfer included which is specific to the Carlsbad \nproject in New Mexico, directs the Carlsbad Irrigation District to \ncontinue to manage lands as they have been in the past, for the \npurposes for which the project was constructed. I believe this is a \nfair and equitable bill that has been developed over years of \nnegotiations. The Carlsbad Irrigation District has had operations and \nmaintenance responsibilities for the past 66 years. It met all the \nrepayment obligations to the government in 1991, and it's about time we \nlet CID have what is rightfully theirs.\n  This legislation accomplishes three things: conveys title of acquired \nlands and facilities to Carlsbad Irrigation District; allows the \nDistrict to assume management of leases and the benefits of the \nreceipts from these acquired lands; and sets a 180 day deadline for the \ntransfer, establishing a 50-50 cost-sharing standard for carrying out \nthe transfer.\n  This legislation is long overdue, is not contentious, and has in fact \npassed out of the Senate before.
