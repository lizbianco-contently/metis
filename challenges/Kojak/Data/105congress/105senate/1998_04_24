Mr. President, this morning the Senate will begin \nconsideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 1757, the \nState Department reorganization bill, under a 6-hour time agreement. \nUnder the previous order, the vote on the conference report will occur \non Tuesday, April 28 at 2:25 p.m.\n  On Monday, following morning business, the Senate will proceed to \nexecutive session to consider the NATO expansion treaty. It is hoped \nthat Members who wish to offer amendments to the treaty will come to \nthe floor on Monday to offer and debate those amendments.\n  We have had some discussion already on this NATO enlargement. I \nremember very well an outstanding speech given on the floor by the \ndistinguished Senator from Oregon a month or so ago, a beautiful speech \nlaced with history. It made an indelible impression upon my mind.\n  Senators have claimed that we have not enough time on NATO \nenlargement, or that the issue has been unfocused. But one of the \nproblems has been that Senators have not been willing to come to the \nfloor and offer their amendments.\n  Beginning Monday, the debate will be focused and uninterrupted on \nthis very important issue of the NATO treaty alliance. We will spend \nall day on Monday and all day on Tuesday with the only interruption \nbeing the vote at 2:25 when we come back in from our policy luncheons. \nWe will spend whatever time is necessary on Tuesday and Wednesday. I \nhope that we can complete it Wednesday after a thoughtful debate. Every \nSenator will have an opportunity to make a statement, if he or she \nwishes, or to offer amendments. But we must begin the process, and it \nincludes having amendments in fact offered so we can bring it to a \nconclusion.\n  I remind our colleagues that we still have a lot of very important \nissues that we need to take up. Unfortunately, earlier in the year \nseveral committees had not acted. But committees are acting profusely, \nand good bills are beginning to line up now. I would like to begin to \nmove bills. In fact, we probably are going to have a high-tech period \nwhere we take up as many as 10 bills from a variety of committees that \nare important to the high-tech area, all the way from antislamming in \nthe telephone area to gambling on the Internet, and a lot of things in \nbetween and beyond those. We have other good bills that we want to try \nto consider.\n  In order to be able to do that and get to the IRS reform package the \nweek after next, we are just going to have to have more cooperation. If \nMembers continue to delay, then there will be more nights like last \nnight where we were here at 8 or 8:30 or 9. I don't think our work is \nas good when we are working late into the night.\n  As a reminder to all Members, there will be a rollcall vote on Monday \nat 6 p.m. on an Executive Calendar matter to be determined today by the \nmajority\n\n[[Page S3562]]\n\nleader after consultation and with information, of course, being \nprovided to the minority.\n  As previously announced, there will be no rollcall votes during \ntoday's session since we have 6 hours reserved for debate on the State \nDepartment reorganization.\n  The next vote will then occur at 6 p.m. on Monday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/24/senate-section/article/S3561-4", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE EDUCATION BILL\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly on a couple of \nissues. I will not take long. But I want to again express my \nappreciation to a number of Senators and to the Senate as a whole for \nthe passage of the education bill on Thursday night by a bipartisan \nvote of 56 to 43 with one Senator being absent. I think you have to \nacknowledge that Senator Coverdell of Georgia was persistent. He was \nfair. This issue really has been considered in one form or another for \nover a month. But he stuck with it. There was a lot of give and take. I \nappreciate the involvement of Senator Torricelli of New Jersey and his \nsupport of the bill. But more important than that, I appreciated the \ntone of the debate. There are fundamental disagreements on how we begin \nto improve the quality of education in America, deal with violence in \nthe schools, and drugs in the schools. That is understandable. But we \ndon't have to be nasty in our disagreements. We weren't.\n  I thought the debate was of a high quality. While the disagreements \nare passionate, we covered a lot of subjects over the last week, a lot \nof amendments. We probably voted on 10 or 12 amendments on this bill. \nOthers were accepted or agreed to in one way or another or set aside by \nagreements. It took cooperation to get it done even after most of the \nweek was spent on that. I think we came up with a good bill. Education \nis important. This is the best debate I have seen on education in many \nyears. Having been in Congress for 25 years, the debate on education \nover those 25 years has always been the same: more decisions from \nWashington, more programs from Washington, more strings from \nWashington, more money from Washington. And the test scores and the \nviolence--the test scores have been going down and the violence and \ndrugs have been going up. What we have been doing is not working. We \nneed to try some different things.\n  This bill does that: More choice in elementary and secondary \neducation, No. 1.\n  I emphasized in my remarks that in my own State, higher education in \nAmerica is the best in the world. People want to come from all over the \nworld and go to schools, from Stanford to Harvard to Ole Miss, to get \ndegrees in science and engineering, business, or whatever.\n  But our elementary and secondary education has been deteriorating, \nand we are way down on most lists. Why is that? What is the difference \nbetween higher education and elementary and secondary education? One \ndifference is choice. When you finish high school you can go to a trade \nschool, you can go to a community college, you can go to a \ndenominational college, or you can go to a university. You have a \nchoice. The second big difference is you have financial assistance to \nbe able to do it.\n  For 2 years I worked in the placement and financial aid office at the \nUniversity of Mississippi. I know the importance of grants, loans, \nscholarships, and work-study programs for any student in America. Any \nstudent in America can go to college. He or she has a choice. Not so in \nelementary and secondary. If you are poor, if you come from a blue-\ncollar working family like I did, son of a shipyard worker and a mother \nthat taught school to help make ends meet, they couldn't afford to send \nme to a different school. They couldn't afford today's market. They \nwouldn't have been able to afford tutors or computers. They just \ncouldn't have done it. We don't have financial assistance. There needs \nto be some. How can you get it?\n  No. 1, allow the parents to keep more of their money and make choices \nabout how to spend their money in helping their children. This is not \nan attack on public schools.\n  I am a product of public schools. My wife is a product of public \nschools. Both of my children went to public schools from the first \ngrade through college. Now, a lot of people who are pontificating as \ngreat defenders of public education went to private schools and send \ntheir children to private schools. It makes it difficult to believe \nthat you are as sincere as I am. I want to help public education, but I \nwant to give parents a choice.\n  When I give this sort of speech to some of the traditional education \ngroups, they say, ``But the bad schools, the bad public schools may not \nmake it.'' Right. That is the idea. It is called competition. It is \ncalled quality. Get right, improve the quality of your teachers, \nimprove the quality of the administration, or go out of business; let \nsomebody else do it that can do a better job.\n  This bill also included merit pay for teachers, teacher testing. I \nstill don't understand why it is OK to test and test and test the \nstudents but, oh, you can't test the teachers. That is one of the \nproblems we have all over this country. We don't always have good-\nquality teachers. Should we encourage it? Should we pay them better? \nYes. Should they be paid by the Federal Government? No. That is a local \ndecision, State decision.\n  Senator Gorton came up with a block grant approach, but it was an \ninteresting approach. Again, it is a choice. He took programs, \nconsolidated them into something over $10 billion, and he said, Well, \nnow, States, if you want to continue with the traditional strings-\nattached, Washington-knows-best controls from the bureaucracy, you can \ndo that. If Massachusetts wants its money to come through the Federal \nmultiplicity of programs with directions of how it must be spent, \nMassachusetts can choose that. But if Texas wants to bring it through \ntheir State government and then to the local schools, they can choose \nthat.\n  Or in my State of Mississippi, I hope we would choose to let it go \ndirect to the schools. Why does it have to stop in Atlanta or Jackson \nand trickle down and trickle down and trickle down, with everybody \ntaking a bite for administrative costs--5 percent, 10 percent, 15 \npercent? Why not let it go from Washington directly to the schools and \nlet the administrators, the parents, the teachers, and the children \ndecide where that $10 billion portion that they get would be spent? \nHopefully, they would spend it for STAR teachers, merit pay for better \nteachers, teachers who work hard, do the extra thing. Maybe they would \ndecide to spend it on construction. That is OK if they make the \ndecision at the local level. That is their choice.\n  I think they are crying wolf. Those who want the status quo, those \nwho want Washington to make the decisions, those who want controls and \ndirections of how the money is going to be spent from Washington, they \ndidn't like what we did this week and what we voted on last night. \nThose who say the status quo is not good enough when it comes to \neducation should feel good about our effort last night. Now, they say, \nWell, the President is going to veto it. I don't know that he will. It \nis like laws; they are not unconstitutional until some court or the \nSupreme Court says they are unconstitutional. A bill is not vetoed \nuntil a President vetoes it. It will have to go through conference. \nPerhaps changes will be made. Perhaps the President will have a \nconversion and decide this is good legislation. But if he does veto it, \nthe parents will know who has faith in them and the local education \napparatus and those who believe Washington is the only place that can \ndecide what is best for education in America.\n\n  So I slept better last night knowing that at least we were trying to \nmake sure that my prospective grandson will have more opportunity and \ngreater choices in education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/24/senate-section/article/S3562-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3562-S3563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    STATE DEPARTMENT REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, on the legislation we are fixing to take up, \nthe State Department reorganization bill, this is the result of \nliterally years of work, give and take, by Senator Helms, the chairman \nof the committee, and by the administration. I think credit has to go \nto Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. She worked with Senator Helms \non this State Department reorganization, which is so long overdue, \nwhich would allow us to do a\n\n[[Page S3563]]\n\nbetter job in our foreign policy apparatus. Senator Biden has been a \ngood partner, I believe, with Senator Helms, as the ranking member on \nthat committee that reported this legislation, in developing this State \nDepartment reorganization.\n  So this is very important legislation which has been a long time \ncoming.\n  The second part of that bill does provide for the U.N. arrearages, \nsomething over $900 million, I believe. You can still argue about how \nmuch really the United States owes to the United Nations. You can still \nargue that the United Nations doesn't always make the right decision. \nYou can argue back and forth. But it is an agreed-to compromise which \nwill allow the United States to fulfill its commitment in a way that a \nmajority of those directly involved, Republican and Democrat, \nconservative, moderate, and liberal, feel is a fair way to get this job \ndone.\n  So that is an important part of this package, not only the \nreorganization of the State Department, which will be of tremendous \nbenefit, I believe, in the next few months and years of this \nadministration and of future administrations, but then you add to that \nthat we are finally addressing this question of U.N. arrearage. That is \nvery important.\n  There is also included in this bill language that maybe nobody is \ntotally happy with but language dealing with the so-called Mexico City \nissue, which is language that would have some restraints on lobbying \nother governments and organizations with taxpayers' dollars to promote \nthe changing of laws to provide for abortions or to deal with the \nabortion issue. It is an issue that we have been tangled with for \nyears. I am not diminishing it by putting it that way, but it is just \nsomething that we have been trying to find a fix to. There is no easy \nanswer. You have passionate people on both sides of the issue. And I \nhave clearly been on one side of the issue forever. I don't think that \ntaxpayers' dollars should be used to promote abortion. Does anybody \nwant to question Jesse Helms on this issue? Anybody? No.\n  Now, the others who are on the other side of the issue, such as \nSenator Biden, they argue very strongly. They have been consistent on \nthe other side. This is a compromise. This is a part of the package. \nThis is a way to deal with three very important issues in this package. \nIt has been agreed to reluctantly, but now I think with understanding \nand vigor, by the Senators who are involved directly with this \nlegislation.\n  So I urge my colleagues to think about it, recognize that you may not \nlike one piece of the three or maybe two of the three, but what is the \nalternative? Are we never going to reorganize the State Department? Are \nwe never going to deal with the U.N. arrearage issue? Is the abortion \nissue going to be involved with U.N. arrearage, State Department \nreorganization, IMF, appropriations bills? How long will this go on \nthis year? This is the solution. So I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation.\n  I caution the administration and urge them to stop lobbying against \nthis legislation, their bill. I have expressed this to the Secretary of \nState, in which I said, ``Madam Secretary, this is the last train out \nof Dodge on the U.N. arrearage.'' Now, I don't believe it will happen--\nif this bill doesn't pass the Senate and if this bill is not signed by \nthe President, then the U.N. issue is probably dead for the year.\n  Am I advocating that? Am I defending it? No. I am just stating a \nfact. I don't see how you do it. Senator Helms and Senator Biden have \nreluctantly agreed to this process, but it is the only process, I \nbelieve, that will allow us to deal with these three difficult, \ncomplicated, but important issues.\n  So I hope the Senate will have a good debate today and will think \nabout it. I don't think anybody is going to be surprised by what is in \nhere. We do not need a lot of pontificating on either side of the \naisle. You are for or against State Department reauthorization. You are \nfor or against the U.N. arrearage issue. And you may be for or against \nthe abortion issue. But this is a reasonable solution, and I hope it \nwill pass when we vote on it Tuesday at 2:25.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/24/senate-section/article/S3562-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  BILL PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--S. 1981\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

There will now be 6 hours of debate equally \ndivided in the usual form. The Senator from North Carolina is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the distinguished occupant of the chair, who is a \nvalued member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I say good \nmorning to him, and all the others who are here this morning.\n  Mr. President, back in the middle of the 20th century--and when I say \nthat I sound like I'm talking about a long time ago--Congress created a \nnumber of temporary, independent federal agencies. I think it was a bad \nmistake. If I had been here, I would not have voted to do that, having \nthe hindsight that I have. But, of course, members of Congress did not \nhave the hindsight. They had just gone through, not too many years \nearlier, a horrible World War and were trying to get this Government \nstabilized, trying to help get the rest of the world stabilized. This \nseemed like a good idea, to create these specialized, independent \nFederal agencies.\n  Ronald Reagan, when he was President, had to deal with what these \nindependent agencies had become--and they did grow mighty independent. \nHe would say, ``There is nothing so near eternal life as a temporary \nFederal agency.''\n  I read the other day that the responsibilities of just one of these \nagencies is duplicated by about 42 other entities in the Federal \nGovernment. And of course the cost of running the U.S. bureaucracy has \nrisen constantly. Furthermore, there is what has become an interesting \npsychology among those who not only run these agencies but are employed \nby them. The agencies have become the personal little fiefdoms of these \nbureaucrats, and they fight tenaciously at any attempt to do away with \ntheir turf or, as this conference report proposes to do, to mesh these \nagencies with the rest of the State Department foreign policy \napparatus. In order to pass this legislation, we have gone through a \ngreat deal of difficulty, but turf protection is only one of the \ndifficulties. Let me proceed, if I may, to give some further historical \nreference, with an assessment of the situation that now exists.\n  Of course, we have before us as the pending official business the \nForeign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998, which I believe, \nit is fair to say, is the most comprehensive and far-\n\n[[Page S3564]]\n\nreaching foreign policy reform ever considered by the Congress of the \nUnited States regarding both the United Nations and the executive \nbranch of this country. Now then, the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware and I, and many others, have spent not months but years \nworking on this proposition. We made every proper and reasonable \nconcession in arriving at the general draft of this legislation that is \nnow before us in the form of a conference report issued by the House \nand the Senate.\n  So it has been the result of long and painstaking negotiations \nbetween the Congress and the administration. The sweeping and \nbipartisan reforms contained in this conference report are \nclearly designed to enhance America's post-cold war foreign-policy-\nmaking process and to force some fundamental reforms on the United \nNations.\n\n  With the full support of the administration, this legislation shuts \ndown two Federal agencies--the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and \nthe U.S. Information Agency. I say ``now.'' That is a relative term, in \nterms of doing something in the Federal Government. It has to be done \nwithin the next 18 months.\n  The legislation also requires the Secretary of State to rein in the \nexisting increasingly unwieldy U.S. foreign aid agency, the Agency for \nInternational Development, and it strengthens the independence of U.S. \npublic diplomacy and international broadcasting programs.\n  The legislation also mandates a series of deep-seated reforms at the \nUnited Nations, which many Members of this Senate and of the House of \nRepresentatives have been demanding for years. I remember the \ndistinguished Senator from Kansas, a gentlelady if there ever was one, \nNancy Kassebaum, whose ire was raised when she found out what was going \non in terms of irresponsibility in the operation of the United Nations.\n  How to get it under control? I am going to discuss that in some \ndetail in just a minute. All you hear these days is talk about how \nwonderful the United Nations is--and that is not so, it is a \nbureaucratic nightmare--and how bad the United States and the American \npeople are for not paying what is called ``the arrearages.'' Hogwash. \nFor more than a year, I have worked with Senator Biden, Senator Grams, \nSenator Gregg, and others, to create a package of reform benchmarks--\nreforms that the State Department must certify that the United Nations \nhas completed--before they are paid any of these so-called arrearages. \nIn other words, it is a very clear put up or shut up.\n  For months, we negotiated these reforms with the State Department and \nthe White House. In fact, we even shared our proposals with Kofi Annan, \nthe distinguished Secretary-General of the United Nations, so that the \ninternational elite in New York and Geneva would not be blindsided by \nthese requirements for reform of the United Nations.\n  Kofi Annan came down and visited me one day. We had a nice visit. We \nwent to several places on Capitol Hill together. One by one--in S. 116, \ndown on the first floor of this Capitol, which is one of the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee hearing rooms--we went down the list, \nbenchmark by benchmark by benchmark by benchmark, and he nodded, and he \nnodded, and he nodded.\n  This conference report contains the fruits of hundreds of hours of \nbipartisan negotiations. Maybe it could be done better, but I don't \nknow anybody in this Senate who is going to take the time to do it \nbetter, because it is going to take hundreds upon hundreds more hours \nto change the kinds of things that we worked out.\n  You are going to have the lobbyists from the United Nations piling \nall over Senators, ``Oh, you can't do this, we've got to have our money \nright now.'' You are going to have lobbyists for this agency and this \nindependent agency and all the rest. They don't want to be folded into \nthe foreign policy apparatus that exists and which costs billions upon \nbillions of dollars of the taxpayers' money.\n  It is either now or never. The game playing is over, and the \nenactment of this legislation represented by this conference report \nbetween the House and the Senate is the last shot the President will \nhave at enacting this legislation. If members want to go home and tell \ntheir constituents, ``Well, I didn't like this aspect,'' or ``I didn't \nlike that aspect,'' I am going to be right behind you saying, ``Yes, \nbut `what he didn't do' or `what she didn't do' is vote to clean up a \nmess in Washington, DC.''\n  This conference report, as I say, contains the fruits of hundreds \nupon hundreds of hours of labor. Once these U.N. reform benchmarks are \nimplemented, only then will be made $819 million available for the \nUnited Nations and other international organizations. In addition, the \nPresident will be authorized to forgive an additional $107 million in \ndebt that the United Nations owes the United States. Nobody ever \nmentions that. Of course, it is a lot bigger than that when you figure \nin the American people have paid for all of these police actions that \nthe United Nations has been doing all around the world. But that is \nneither here nor there for the time being.\n  What I am saying, Mr. President, is that there has been no \ndisagreement about any of these provisions. So the substance of this \nbill, a complete overhaul of our Government's foreign policy apparatus, \nand the reform of the United Nations, which has to come before a dollar \nchanges hands, remains virtually unchanged since the Senate passed this \nbill, by a vote of 90 to 5, on June 17, 1997.\n  Let me restate for the obvious an important point. This conference \nreport remains virtually unchanged from the bill passed by the Senate \nby a vote of 90 to 5 last year. The Senate has overwhelmingly endorsed \nthe reforms, and the Clinton administration has signed off on them. \nLet's see who reneges on this agreement. Will it be the administration? \nWill the administration veto this bill because of two or three lines \nthat it happens not to like? We will find out, won't we?\n  All those Senators who say, ``Well, I don't like this aspect of it, \nso I'm not going to vote for any of it,'' had better be prepared to \nexplain what they, in effect, voted against. If they want to come and \nsit down and talk with Joe Biden and me, we will explain the purpose \nand the reason for everything in this bill.\n  And yet--and this is bothersome to me, I confess--we are now facing a \nrazor-thin majority vote in the Senate. We might not even have a \nmajority. Far from lobbying the Senate for passage of this legislation, \nthe President has been standing over there in the wings and has \nindicated that he may veto the bill, the substance of which his \nadministration had negotiated with us and agreed to with us.\n  Why is the President threatening to veto this bill? One small \nprovision--a few words included by our House colleagues--section 1816 \nbars American organizations from using U.S. taxpayers' dollars to lobby \nforeign governments to change their abortion laws. I guarantee you, \nthat is all there is to it, and the President sits down on Pennsylvania \nAvenue and says, ``If you don't take that out, I'm going to veto it; I \ndon't care whether you save billions of dollars or not.''\n  Mr. President, as they do in grade school, this is show-and-tell \nday--put-up-or-shut-up.\n  I tell you one thing, I have tried to get along with the \nadministration, but if the administration vetoes this bill because of \nthose few lines, I am going to go do everything I can, go everywhere I \ncan and explain exactly what the President did. I have dealt with him \non this thing and he has been very accommodating, and so have his \npeople, but if he wants trouble on this bill, just veto it, and I will \ngive him some trouble.\n\n  That little provision for which he is threatening to veto this bill--\nlet me repeat--it stops those who advocate abortion--that is the \ndeliberate destruction of innocent and helpless human life--from using \ntax dollars paid by the American people to lobby foreign governments to \nchange their policies on abortion.\n  I did not want to have the subject mentioned. I could have put it in \nthis bill when it went through the Senate, but I thought we ought to \naddress the real problem in this bill, and that is this foreign policy \napparatus which has become so bloated and with so many other Federal \nentities running around duplicating each other's business.\n  I do not believe in my heart of hearts, or cannot believe, that Mr.\n\n[[Page S3565]]\n\nClinton and his Democratic allies in the Senate would be willing to \nsacrifice the payment of U.N. arrears--one of their top foreign policy \npriorities--just to preserve the ability of nongovernmental \norganizations to use American tax money to lobby foreign governments on \nthe question of abortion. I refuse to believe that the President is \ngoing to ``pick up his pen,'' as Ronald Reagan used to say, and veto \nit. If he does, some of us are going to react.\n  But that is exactly what a lot of people are proposing in the Senate: \n``Oh, I can't vote for it because of that abortion language.'' They \ndon't care anything about all the millions of dollars this legislation \nis going to save, or about the elimination of the duplication of \nbureaucracy. Instead, two or three little lines involving, what I \nregard anyhow, an abuse of American taxpayers' money, are the grounds \nfor voting against this bill.\n  Some on the other side have been heard going around calling section \n1816 the ``Mexico City'' policy. It ``ain't'' the Mexico City policy, \nnot a bit of it. I helped write the Mexico City policy way back when \nRonald Reagan, by Executive order, made it part of this country's \nposition. But don't take my word for it. I want every Senator to read \nthe bill or the conference report, especially section 1816. And to help \nthem look for it and find it, section 1816 is on page 102 of this \nconference report. If you can't find page 102 of the conference report, \ncome right here, and I will find it and put it in your little hot \nhands. But let's not play games about it. Put up or shut up, show and \ntell.\n  What did Ronald Reagan's Mexico City policy do? It forbade any \nexpenditure of U.S. taxpayer money going to any organizations that \nperformed abortions abroad.\n\n  Ronald Reagan was a strong and sincere, genuine pro-life President. \nYou do not see many of them coming along. The provision in this \nconference report does not do what the Mexico City policy did.\n  As much as I wish it were otherwise, section 1816 will not cut off \nfunding to organizations that perform abortions as required under \nPresident Reagan's original Mexico City policy. All section 1816 does \nis simply prohibit population control groups from using American \ntaxpayers' money,--which they will receive under current law anyhow--to \nlobby foreign countries to overturn their laws pertaining to abortion. \nThat is it, sum total. If anybody in the press or the media doubt it, \ncome on down here; we will talk about it. No, they are not even here. \nThere is one lonely soul sitting up there in the media gallery.\n  Initially, last year, the House did include or try to include \nPresident Reagan's full Mexico City language in this bill. When the \nHouse did that, the Clinton administration said, ``No. The President \nwill veto this bill.'' And there ensued a months-long standoff which \nlasted until the waning hours of the last session of Congress.\n  Now, then, Mr. President, despite my personal support--my personal \nsupport--for the Mexico City policy, I urged my House colleagues to \nremove that provision from the bill. I said, ``We can fight that battle \non another battleground. Let's not kill this one opportunity we are \ngoing to have to revamp and consolidate and shape up the foreign policy \napparatus of this country.'' I did this because I knew that the \nPresident would never accept a full reversal of his administration's \nstand on the Mexico City policy which was totally at odds with those of \nthe stand of Ronald Reagan.\n  Last November, in an effort to reach a compromise, the House of \nRepresentatives' leaders watered down the abortion language in the bill \nto the point that I have stated over and over this morning--simply to \nban the use of U.S. dollars to lobby foreign governments to change \ntheir abortion laws. But despite an exceedingly reasonable offer from \nthe House, this was still not good enough for the administration. The \nadministration rejected this compromise as the session came to an end \nlast year, citing nonbinding report language that they claim would have \nbarred the U.S. groups from even attending international conferences \naimed at changing abortion laws. This they said would amount--get this, \nMr. President--this would amount to a ``gag rule.''\n  Come this spring, House leaders offered a second compromise. They \nagreed to remove the offending report language, softening it simply to \nprevent the use of U.S. tax dollars to sponsor such conferences. So it \nis all right to attend them, but do not use tax money to sponsor them. \nIn fact, I have to say this about the House leadership. They have been \nso reasonable in their efforts to reach a compromise that today the \nabortion language before us in this legislation is so limited that its \napproval would be little more than a symbolic concession on the part of \nthe Clinton administration.\n  But even that appears to be too much from what I hear because the \nlobbyists say all Democrats must vote against this bill. That is the \nword I am hearing floating around. And we will see when the roll is \ncalled on it. We will see.\n  At this point it is unreasonable, I think, to suggest that it is the \nHouse leaders who have been exhibiting intransigence. While the House \nhas offered compromise after compromise, giving up 90 percent of their \nground, the administration still, to this day, is demanding total and \ncomplete capitulation. What they are saying is: ``Kill the conference \nreport. Forget it. Don't do away with any of these irrelevant, \nunnecessary Federal agencies and the bureaucracies. Let's keep on \nkeeping on.'' They do not seem to care what the costs are. I have not \nheard that mentioned one time--not one time--by the administration.\n  Mr. President, I am not going to take any more of the Senate's time \ndiscussing this issue, because I do not view it as central to the \nreforms contained in the conference report. I want to get back to that \nbefore I turn over the podium to my good, fine friend, Senator Biden.\n\n  Mr. President, not anybody--not the administration, not the \nDemocrats, certainly not Jesse Helms--got everything any of us wanted \nin this conference report. I acknowledge that. But we did work together \nin a remarkably novel way to cooperate, and to craft the legislation \nthat is before the Senate today that forms the conference report. This \nlegislation, save for one single provision on international abortion \nlobbying, is the result of strong bipartisan consensus. And that is a \nnovelty around this place. And that is the reason it passed the Senate \nthe first time around 90-5.\n  I think, Mr. President, it will be a terrible mistake for the Senate \nDemocrats and the White House to kill these absolutely imperative, \nessential, necessary reforms in order to defend the bureaucratic status \nquo at the United Nations, not to mention within our own executive \nbranch, to defend the bloated foreign policy apparatus.\n  So let me be candid. This legislation represents quite possibly the \nlast chance to bring true, deep-seated change to the United Nations in \nreturn for U.S. arrearages payments. If Democrats succeed in voting \ndown this conference report or if the President chooses to veto this \nlegislation, then they together will decide what is going to happen in \nthe future; they will bear sole responsibility, I think, for the unpaid \ndues to the United Nations. And nobody is going to tell Kofi Annan, if \nthis conference report goes down in the Senate or if it is vetoed by \nthe President, ``The check's in the mail,'' because it is never going \nto be in the mail, certainly not if I have anything to do with it.\n  This Senator, for one, will delay crying, weeping, when the White \nHouse complains that funding has not been made available to the United \nNations. Next time I see the President I am going to say, ``Mr. \nPresident, you did it. You did it.''\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, there is not much that my colleague from \nNorth Carolina, the chairman of the committee, has said that I take \nissue with. Sitting with my staff here, as I was waiting to speak, I \nsaid, ``I have this long statement that is prepared that goes into \ndetail about the bill. The truth of the matter is, the debate here is \nalmost not about the bill, not about the conference report.''\n  I can and I guess I will at some point do what I probably shouldn't \ndo and that is second-guess what the rationale and motivation of the \nHouse leadership\n\n[[Page S3566]]\n\nis and what the rationale and motivation of the President and \nadministration is relative to the one thing that doesn't have a darn \nthing to do with what the Senator and I worked so hard to put \ntogether--and, I might add, the Presiding Officer, as well is a member \nof the committee. He will remember we spent a lot of time on this--a \nlot of time.\n  There has been talk, led by my friend from North Carolina, about \nreorganizing the State Department for the past several years. Nothing \never really happened. There was a lot of work, don't get me wrong, but \nin terms of producing something that would become law, nothing ever \nhappened.\n  We have been debating and talking about U.N. arrearages. We have \nreally been debating the U.N. arrearages, or whether or not it was a \nreasonable, functional, useful organization. That has been a raging \ndebate probably since the mid-1980s. It has been around for a long time \nbut, in terms of the political chemistry on this floor of the U.S. \nSenate, for the last probably 10 to 12 years in earnest. As a matter of \nfact, I think my friend from North Carolina would acknowledge with me \nthat in both our political parties it has taken on, in the fringes of \nour parties, a status that far exceeds anything about what the United \nNations does or doesn't do. On one end of my party it is the salvation \nof the world, and on the other end of the Senator's party it is the \nDevil incarnate. It has kind of replaced the fervor that involved the \ndebate for and against communism. It is a new thing, a new political \ndynamic.\n  We worked very hard and we actually came up with a resolution. I \nrespectfully suggest that what we did--and we made serious \ncompromises--the Senator from North Carolina did not come to this \nconclusion gently, nor did the Senator from Delaware in terms of the \ncompromise relative to what we did in the United Nations here. But the \nvast majority of the people who are informed on this issue, both in \npolitics and in the foreign policy establishment and in the world \ncommunity, acknowledge that what we did is a reasonable, \nstraightforward and, I think, significant piece of work.\n  I don't want to get my friend from North Carolina in trouble. I think \nthe most significant thing about it is the Senator from North Carolina \nsigned on to this. That puts in perspective not only the arrearages but \nwhat he has wanted to do to get the United Nations to change its tune a \nlittle bit. Hopefully, we will not be arguing another decade about \nwhether or not it is a salvation of the world or the Devil incarnate. \nWe will have a pretty clear-eyed view of what we expect of the United \nNations and what we think its value is. That is a very valuable \ncontribution all by itself, in my opinion.\n  The third thing we did here, and I am sure my friend will not mind my \nsaying this because we both said it publicly in different iterations \nover the last year or so--when I inherited this job from the \ndistinguished Senator from Rhode Island, who retired, I went to see the \nchairman. We came here together, same year, same time. We have been \nfriends; we have been ideological foes. We have been on the opposite \nsides on issues, and we have been together. We have been hanging out \nwith each other for 25 years. I went to him and I said--which is, I \nguess, uncharacteristically blunt for me--``We can play this flat or we \ncan play this round, Mr. Chairman; how do you want to do this?''\n  He came back and said, ``Joe, what are your priorities? What is \nimportant to you? This is what is important to me. Let's agree with \nwhat we can, and fight it out where we cannot agree.'' He has kept his \nword in everything he said to me. I said, ``It is important to me, with \nthe end of the cold war, the Berlin wall down, that we do not cut back \nour foreign policy establishment.'' As we are cutting back our defense \nestablishment I think as far as we should cut it back, cutting back our \ndefense establishment, there is a need for us to extend our foreign \npolicy reach and establishment, whether it means embassies or \nconsulates or enough personnel or intense involvement in other \ncountries. He said, ``It is not my intention in reorganization to \nemasculate the foreign policy,'' the 150 function, as we call it in \nbudget parlance.\n\n  So the third piece of this deal here is the State Department has been \ntrying to get full funding for all its operations for years. And it is \nin here. Now there are reorganization provisions. The President agreed \nto the reorganization, and we put the structure of it into this bill. \nThe Administration didn't like some of it. But the Senator and I agreed \nit was necessary. And in return we got a pretty balanced package here.\n  Now, so far, so good, as they say. The Senator, I think, is fond of \ntelling the joke about the guy who jumps off the 100-story building and \nas he passes the 50th floor a group of people are standing at a window \nand yell out, ``How is it going?'' And the guy falling down says, ``So \nfar, so good.'' That is how I felt about this whole operation. I am \nfeeling real good. We just haven't hit the ground yet. Everything we \nhave done I am, quite frankly, proud of.\n  I think we have made what has to happen. In a democracy of 250 \nmillion people, we make compromises. But the end result is, I think \nthis conference report strengthens the foreign policy and the ability \nto conduct foreign policy and the security of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Now, that is the so-far-so-good part. We both knew, the chairman and \nI, that the President wanted fast track, something he feels very \nstrongly about. He probably could have saved fast track if he were \nwilling to compromise on Mexico City, although that wasn't attached. I \nunderstand at the end of the day there were some in the House who said, \nif you attach this, we will go along with fast track. He didn't do it \nthen. He didn't do it on other things.\n  By the way, I have to say for the Record, because I want to be \nstraight up about this, my colleagues know this, but so that everybody \nunderstands how I approach this, the abortion issue is not one that I \nlive and die on. I think government should stay out of the business. I \nvote against funding of abortion and I vote against restrictions on a \nwoman's right to an abortion, which makes everyone angry with me. The \nonly person happy with me is me, in my conscience. But this for me is \nnot on the list of the 10 most important issues facing America. It \ndoesn't make that list for me. I must admit I do not have the passion \nfor or against what is being debated in here to think it is warranted \nor worthy of being attached to what I consider to be a serious array of \nforeign policy considerations affecting this Nation.\n  On the other hand, the Senator from North Carolina does. It is a \nmatter of great passion and commitment to him. His opposition to \nabortion from the day we arrived on this floor of the U.S. Senate and I \nfirst became acquainted with him to today has not waned a bit. I \nrespect him for that. I disagree with his approach--at least most of \nit. I vote against funding, so that part we agree on, but I disagree \nwith his approach. But I respect it, as I do people like my friend \nSenator Barbara Boxer and others who vehemently feel the other way on \nboth funding and access.\n  The reason I bother to tell you that, Mr. President, is this. It took \nnothing on my part, I had to make no compromise to say to our House \nfriends and to our friends in the Senate, we want to keep Mexico City \noff of this; but it did take some real sacrifice on the part of my \nfriend from North Carolina to say, as he did last year, look, keep this \noff. There are other vehicles. We can fight this out other places. \nDon't confuse it with this historic undertaking.\n  We have, I think, accomplished, in at least what we passed out of the \nSenate--I will be straight up with everybody. We hung tough on that. \nThe truth of the matter was neither one of us were able to affect the \nHouse's attitude toward this. The one thing I think we share a lot in \ncommon, the one thing the chairman and I share in common is we are \nrealists. We have been here for 25 years; we know how this place \nworks. This is not something that--not because we are so smart, you \nwould have to be an idiot to be here 25 years and not know how it \nworks--speaking for myself. It is pretty clear that once we could not \ncontrol what would happen in the House and what Representative Smith--\nwho, I might add, I suspect, although he knows a lot about the issue, \nknows a lot less about the issue than my friend from North Carolina. My \nfriend from North Carolina was dealing with this issue before a lot of \nother people knew it existed. It became clear that we could not do much \nabout it.\n\n  Although the chairman and I still disagree on a number of things, one\n\n[[Page S3567]]\n\nthing we have established--and I am proud of it, and I think he is \ntoo--is that we are absolutely straight with each other. So he came to \nme and said, ``Look, Joe, this is in. They are going to compromise on \nthis, but it's going to be in. So my position now, Joe, is it's in, so \nlet's pass the whole thing.'' I tried my best and kept my promise, I \nstuck with my commitment, but I told him, ``If it's in, I am going to \nhave a problem sticking with the deal--that is, pushing this through.''\n  Let me tell you why. It has less to do with the merits of the \nargument relating to Mexico City than it does if we pass it here with \nthis attached, even though the President will veto it. I am going to be \ncompletely blunt about this. If we pass this, my worry is that it will \nembolden the ``Congressmen Smiths'' and others to suggest that they can \nkeep doing this on everything that comes over here. I want to tell my \nfriend straight up, that is my rationale.\n  I am of the view--and this is like reading the entrails of goats and \nguessing like the soothsayers did 2,000 years ago what is going to \nmotivate Members of the House or an administration to act or not act. \nMy feeling is, since the Senate has not passed this Mexico City \nlanguage in the past, and there is a majority that votes against Mexico \nCity language--and this is purely presumptuous on my part--if Speaker \nGingrich, keeping his commitment to his people, put it in, he realizes \nand is able to say, the Senate will not pass this, the President will \nnot veto it, let's move on; we have a better chance of getting to the \nspot we want to get to--the Senator and I--which is to clear up the \nU.N. arrearages, reorganize the State Department, and fully fund the \nState Department.\n  So I guess what I am saying is, the only place we disagree is \ntactically what is the better thing to do to get what we both want, \nnotwithstanding that we disagree on Mexico City. I vote against Mexico \nCity restrictions; the Senator votes for them. But I don't think that \nis what is motivating either one of us here at this moment. To speak \nfor myself, that is not what is motivating me at the moment. What \nmotivates me at the moment is, what do I tell my colleagues on my side \nof the aisle, a fair number of whom listen to me on these issues--and \nthat is presumptuous to say, but it is just because I am the ranking \nmember. What do I tell them is the most likely route for us, at the end \nof the day, to be able to get the State Department reorganized, get the \nU.N. arrearages paid, and funding for the State Department through the \nsupplemental?\n  The conclusion I have reached--and I would not bet college tuition on \nit for my daughter--is to stand firm, demonstrate there are not enough \nvotes here to pass Mexico City, with the knowledge the President is \ngoing to veto it and the pressure is to get on with the business of \nforeign policy. I could be wrong about that.\n\n  One way or another, I think it is fair to say that at least the \nSenator and I know--from different perspectives--that isn't going to \nbecome law. The President is going to veto this with this language \nattached. I could--and I am inclined to, because I am proud of it--\nspend a great deal of time talking about the merits of each of the \npieces of this conference report. I will refrain from that, because I \nwould be preaching to the choir. I am preaching to the author here. It \nis not like I am going to say anything he doesn't know.\n  I can put in the Record the details of what constitutes what we have \naccomplished and what is in the conference report. In many respects, \nthe conference reported back a better bill than we put out. In many \nways, it has been a better bill. But time is our enemy. Time is our \nenemy.\n  I must again be completely blunt with my colleagues. At one point, I \ncounseled that we not even debate this, let's vote, get it over with, \nand send it to the President and let it be vetoed. I believe the more \ntime we take to deal with the U.N., the more difficult and intransigent \nthe U.N. becomes, the harder it is for Ambassador Richardson to take \nwhat we have given him and get the results we want, the harder it is \nfor us to unravel a State Department that needs unraveling, in terms of \nreorganization. Time is not our friend.\n  I read on the way down this morning on the train--I commute every day \nfrom my home State of Delaware. I have a little ritual, and my friend \nknows about this. I read my local paper because of its interest and out \nof self-defense, I read the New York Times, and I read the Wall Street \nJournal, and that gets me to Baltimore. From Baltimore on, I prepare \nwhatever I am going to do that morning. So commuting 4 hours a day \nisn't all bad, because you have a lot of time to prepare.\n  On the way down, I read in the New York Times this morning's lead \narticle about the IMF. It is pretty clearly unrelated to this issue but \ntangentially involved with the issue of Mexico City. But it looks like \nIMF isn't going to go anywhere. I will not put this in the Record. I \ndon't often put in news articles. But this is on page 9 of the New York \nTimes, entitled, ``GOP Snubs White House on Billions for IMF.''\n  Well, there are only three or four major foreign policy \nconsiderations on our plate right now. NATO is a big one, and the \nSenator and I will deal with this come Tuesday. Then there is IMF, the \nU.N., and reorganization of the State Department. It seems to me--and I \ndo not in any way--and I give my friend my word on this--direct any of \nthis at him or to anyone in particular. It seems a shame that three of \nthose four major issues get tied up in what is in fact a divisive and, \nunderstandably, national debate relating to abortion.\n  Sometimes I wish we had the House rules, which say that whatever you \ndo has to be germane. But then I am not so sure, because I realize they \ncan get the Rules Committee to do anything they want. But it is too bad \nwe can't say that we are going to debate foreign policy and settle it, \nthat we are going to fight out abortion, and that we will fight out \neducation, and so forth. I understand the practical reasons why that is \nnot the case, but the truth is that it creates real problems.\n  The one and only place--and I will cease after this--where I disagree \nwith my friend from North Carolina, the chairman of the full committee, \nis on this issue of whether or not there has in fact been a compromise \nthat has been put forward by the House leadership on the issue of \nMexico City. It has been stated--and this is the only place I disagree \nwith my friend--that the House anti-abortion forces, led by Smith of \nNew Jersey and Gingrich, the Speaker, compromised on 90 percent of what \nthe Mexico City language is. In truth, I think that is illusory. I \ndon't think there is any compromise.\n  Let me for the record, for those who are going to make difficult \ndecisions here on how to vote--I am going to vote no on this bill. The \nreason I am going to vote no on this bill is because I am opposed to \nMexico City. That is true. But that is not the main reason I am going \nto vote no. To be honest with you, were I President of the United \nStates, I would have a harder time deciding whether to veto this or not \nbecause I care so much about the three provisions.\n  Arguably, someone could say why not swallow on another provision that \nyou strongly disagree with, but in comparative weight, in terms of how \nit affects the national interest, arguably you should go ahead and not \nveto. But I am not President. I am a U.S. Senator. As a U.S. Senator, I \nam obliged to explain my rationale for why I am going to vote against \nthis. I am reiterating what I said at the outset. I think if we vote no \nin this body, whether you are for or against Mexico City, we, quite \nfrankly, take the House leadership off of a bit of a dilemma. I believe \nin my heart that much of the House leadership would rather this not \nhave been in this bill. They know how important this is, even though I \nam not questioning their support for the Mexico City language.\n  It is a little bit like my saying I feel very, very strongly about \ntobacco companies being able to target advertising to children--very \nstrongly. I think they have been outrageous in what they have done. \nShould I attach that tobacco language to this foreign policy bill? \nWould that be appropriate no matter how strongly I feel about it? \nShould I say I am not going to fund the United Nations arrearages, I am \nnot going to reorganize the State Department, I am not going to fund \nthe State Department, and, by the way, although it is not in this bill, \nI am not going to replenish the International Monetary Fund even though \nthere is an economic crisis in Asia that could still spill over to the \nUnited States? And the single\n\n[[Page S3568]]\n\nmost significant thing we could do to stop that from happening is \nregenerate confidence to the degree that everyone knows there is enough \nmoney in the IMF to help these countries get back on their feet. Should \nI say because of my feeling about tobacco advertising that I am ready \nto scuttle all three of those? I think that is inappropriate.\n  I think the House leadership--I could be wrong, but I think the \nmajority of the House thinks it is inappropriate. It does not matter. A \nminority in the House, as has occurred in the Senate, with Democrats as \nwell as Republicans, on other issues, both of us have attacked it. I \nthink the strongest message we could send is to stop it. The Senate is \nnot going to accept it. The President clearly will not accept it, \nbecause then I think the leadership on the other side will say, ``Look, \nminority within our minority. I know this is important to you. I kept \nmy commitment to you. We tried it. Now let's get down to the business \nof the Nation.''\n  I could be wrong about that. But that is why Joe Biden is voting \nagainst the thing that he, at least 49 percent, was responsible for \ncreating, this bill, along with the 51 percent of my friends, including \nthe Senator from North Carolina. I cannot think of anything other than \nthe crime bill that I put as much time into than this. This is a little \nbit like sacrificing your child. I put a lot of time and energy, and my \nstaff put in hundreds of hours, as has the chairman's staff. I am proud \nof our product. But I know the President is going to veto this. What is \ngoing to embolden the Chris Smiths of the world to continue to throw a \nmonkey wrench into the foreign policy of this Nation?\n  My point to my colleagues on my side of the aisle is to vote no. \nThat, coupled with the President being against it, maybe will allow us \nto get down to the regular business of the Senate again. But I could be \nwrong.\n  Again, this is a tactical judgment, from my standpoint, on how we get \non with conducting the foreign policy of this Nation and taking on our \nresponsibilities in the U.S. Senate to do that.\n  But having said that, let me make sure everybody understands what \nMexico City is. You say to people out there, ``Well, this is about \nMexico City. Well, is it about smog? What do you mean Mexico City? What \nis this about? Corruption? Drugs? No. It is about Mexico City.\n\n  Mexico City is a consequence of a reference to a meeting which took \nplace on population planning back in 1984 where a whole bunch of \nnations got together under the auspices of the U.N. They were going to \nmeet in Mexico City and decide how they should deal with the notion of \npopulation planning. The Reagan administration announced \nadministratively a new policy on international population assistance, \nwhich was a change in what the U.S. Government policy had been as it \nrelated to assisting organizations involved in population planning in \nother countries.\n  Let me make a very important distinction. Even I had to go back and \nread this. This is not about involving any restrictions on governmental \nagencies. Money we send to the Mexican Government, the Mexican \nGovernment can use in population planning funds--if we send them any--\nany way they want with one restriction, and it is the Helms law. \nSenator Helms--and I supported it--argued that we should not be sending \ntaxpayer dollars to other countries in the form of foreign aid if those \nother countries, or private organizations within those countries, are \ngoing to take our taxpayer dollars and perform abortions--in the case \nof China, coerced abortions, where the Chinese Government has coerced \npeople into having abortions, forced abortions, to maintain this one-\nchild policy, one child per family. So it became law. It is still law. \nUnder the Helms amendment, taxpayer dollars collected and sent \noverseas, in what most people would refer to as foreign aid, cannot be \nused to perform or to coerce abortions. That is the law.\n  Mexico City is in addition to that. Mexico City says--I caution my \nstaff to correct me if I make even any nuance mistake about this \nbecause it is important--Mexico City comes along and it does two \nthings. It says when the United States, by whatever mechanism, sends \nAmerican taxpayer dollars to nongovernmental organizations instead of \nto the comparable Department of Health and Social Services in Mexico--\nfor example, they have a comparable agency in their Federal Government \nlike we have in ours--sending funds to them, it gets treated one way. \nSending funds to, say, Mexico City Planned Parenthood, not a U.S. \ncorporation, not a U.S. entity, but a Mexican entity, or any other \ncountry, in Argentina, in China, in Vietnam, the Mexico City directive \nof President Reagan said not only can they not use their funds because \nthe Helms amendment blocks use of any taxpayer dollars--OK? Not only \nthe government, but to these private agencies. The add-on that \nPresident Reagan, through Executive order, laid out was the following. \nIt said not only can they not use our funds, the money we send, say, to \nPlanned Parenthood Mexico, they cannot use their funds--let me get this \nstraight for everybody. Right now, if we sent, through a population \ncontrol program, money to Planned Parenthood Mexico, Planned Parenthood \nVietnam, Planned Parenthood--I don't know that they have one but assume \nthey do--and we sent money to the Government of Vietnam, the Government \nof Mexico, the government of another country, as well for population \ncontrol under our law, if we find out they, either the private agency, \nor the government, is using that money to perform abortions, then it is \nagainst Federal law. We stop doing it. It is the Helms amendment. It \ncannot be done.\n  OK. That is the law. That is not in question here. That is the law \nnow, and it will stay the law. But this is a different deal. Former \nPresident Reagan said not only do we want to stop that; we want to stop \nthese nongovernmental agencies from using their own money. So now \nPlanned Parenthood in Mexico gets a dollar of U.S. taxpayers' money; \nthey can't use that dollar to perform abortions. They can't use that \ndollar to go out there and be promoting those abortions. OK.\n  But now let's say they have a fundraiser in Mexico City, and all \nMexican citizens show up and they contribute $2. So they have $3 to \nspend now, two of their own that they raised that has nothing to do \nwith taxpayers' dollars and one that is the American taxpayers' dollar. \nMexico City says they can't even use their own dollars, their own money \nto do either of two things: One, to perform abortions or, two, to lobby \ntheir own Government on anything relating to abortion.\n  Now, the irony here is if they were the Right to Life Committee in \nMexico City, they also could not lobby with their own money their \nGovernment to end abortions. It is a gag rule. We are saying what we \ncan't say to their Government--even Mr. Smith and others have not tried \nto say--any money we send to the Mexican Government to control \npopulation can't be used to perform abortions, and if they take any of \nour money they can't use any of their own money to do anything relating \nto abortion. We don't say that. We know we can't tell another \nGovernment they can't use their own tax dollars, but we feel we can \ntell a nongovernment agency, these NGOs they talk about, nongovernment \norganizations, we think we can tell them what they can do not only with \nthe money we send them but with their own money.\n  That is the objection this President has. By the way, we went through \na similar debate here in the United States on the so-called gag rule. \nIt would be unconstitutional. We could not say to local Planned \nParenthood in Duluth, MN, ``You are getting some Federal funding; you \ncan't use the Federal money. . . .'' We can say that. But we could not \nthen say, ``With your money, you can't even tell anybody who comes in \nto see you about the options that are available.'' We can't say to a \nlocal doctor in the United States of America, ``Look, we can pass a law \nsaying you cannot perform an abortion with taxpayer dollars''--we could \ndo that, but under our first amendment we could not say to the doctor \nor clinic, using their own funds, you cannot counsel the patient, ``By \nthe way, there are four ways to deal with your problem. One of them is \n. . .'' We can't do that.\n  That is what we call the gag rule. But we are going to gag the world. \nWe are going to tell the world, if you are involved with us in any way, \nyou not only in accepting our dollars cannot use our dollars, you can't \nuse your own dollars. The President and a vast majority of my \ncolleagues feel very\n\n[[Page S3569]]\n\nstrongly--I admit they feel more strongly than I do--about that as a \nmatter of principle.\n  So what is this fight about? Where did the compromise come in? What \ndid the House do to make this Mexico City language more palatable or \nreflect what is called a compromise by my friend from North Carolina? \nWell, the compromise contained in this report would put Mexico City \ninto place, make it law--it is not law now, but it was an Executive \norder, by the way, from President Bush and President Reagan, and \neliminated by President Clinton. This would now put into legislation \nMexico City language. But here is what the language said. It would \npermit the President to waive the restriction on U.S. funds to a group \nthat used its own money to perform abortions. Hardly any of these \ngroups do that. So it is really not giving up much, and it would \nrequire the President to say, you can use your own money to perform an \nabortion.\n  That is allegedly the compromise. But let's look at what it leaves in \nplace. And by the way, there would be a small financial cost in doing \nso. Population funds would then be limited to $356 million in that year \nas opposed to $385 million if he exercised this waiver. That is the \npenalty the President would pay to waive. But there is no waiver \nauthority on the provision which is referred to as the lobbying \nrestriction. And this is the more important provision because (a) few \nof the organizations that receive population funds actually perform \nabortions, and (b) from the administration's viewpoint, the principle \nworth upholding is one embodied in the first amendment of our \nConstitution, and that is this provision restricts free debate.\n\n  In fact, the reason the restriction applies only to foreign \norganizations and not domestic organizations is that it wouldn't be \npermitted under our Constitution under the first amendment if we tried \nto apply this language to an American nongovernmental organization. It \nwould be unconstitutional.\n  Now, the statement of the managers in the conference report \nelaborates on the definition of lobbying and makes it clear that the \nprovision is in fact designed to restrict speech. What are we doing \nnow? We are telling them they can't use their own money to speak to \ntheir own Government, not our Government, not our money, can't use \ntheir own money to speak to their own Government about the issue of \nprocreation.\n  Let me read the managers' statement, fancy term for saying what is \ncontained in the attachment to this legislation. This is relating to \nwhat constitutes lobbying. ``Such practices include not only overt \nlobbying for such changes but also such other activities as sponsoring \nrather than merely attending conferences and workshops on the alleged \ndefects of the abortion laws as well as drafting and distributing of \nmaterials or public statements calling attention to defects in the \ncountry's abortion laws.''\n  That is pretty broad. That is the problem the administration has. \nThis is so far-reaching in terms of what it does as it relates to \nspeech that as a matter of principle they have made no bones about it; \n3 days after they came into office they scrapped this language. It is \nnow being forced down their throat if they want to be able to conduct \nthe foreign policy of the United States of America.\n  So my disagreement with my friend from North Carolina relates only to \nwhether or not this is really a compromise. None of the language is \nchanged. Only the ability of the President to waive the first section, \nnot the second section. And by my understanding the managers' \ndefinition of what constitutes lobbying is even broader than anyone \nreasonably would think lobbying is in our country.\n  Now, I think this is antidemocratic. It is a gag rule. It is \ninappropriate for us to do this. It interferes in ways we should not be \ninterfering. And it will have no impact, in my view, on whether there \nare more or fewer or lesser abortions performed in the United States of \nAmerica. As a matter of fact, I am of the view--and I am, as I think 99 \npercent of Americans are, opposed to abortion. No one likes abortion. \nEven among those who have had one and/or perform them, I don't know \nanybody who likes abortion. But I think, ironically, Mexico City could \ncause more abortions to be performed worldwide. If Mexico City's \nrestrictions are reimposed, several population organizations, including \nthe largest in the world, the International Planned Parenthood \nFederation, will not any longer take any U.S. population control money. \nThey are going to say, ``If the price for us taking your money is we \nhave to not use any of our money ever again, then we don't want your \nmoney.'' Is that a good idea? What have we accomplished?\n  I think these restrictions could lead to significant cutbacks in \nfamily planning assistance in several countries. Such assistance \nincreasing access--for example, assistance to increase access to \ncontraceptive services, to information related to everything from the \nrhythm method to the use of condoms to the use of the pill, all those \nthings which are critical in preventing unwanted pregnancies--I think \nthat the lessening of the amount of money available for that, because \nyou know these organizations are not going to accept U.S. money, I \nthink it is going to increase the number of abortions.\n  I think this is especially so in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet \nUnion, where abortion, under the Communist period, was often the method \nused for family planning. For example, in Kazakhstan, U.S. assistance \nto some two dozen clinics, Planned Parenthood-type clinics in \nKazakhstan from 1993 to 1994, led to a 41 percent decline in the number \nof abortions performed in that country.\n  Did you hear what I just said? When we were engaged in pointing out \nto the people of Kazakhstan what alternatives they had to deal with \nunwanted pregnancies other than abortion, and that information was made \navailable, the number of abortions declined by 41 percent. In Russia, \ncontraceptive use increased from 19 percent to 24 percent in the years \n1990 to 1994. During this period, from 1990 to 1994, the number of \nabortions dropped from 3.6 million performed in Russia to 2.8 million. \nIf, like me, you want to stop abortions, you had over 800,000 fewer \nabortions in Russia because we were providing money to train and to \nmake available information to Russian women and men about the use of \ncontraceptives.\n  But what are these organizations going to do now, when they say, if \nwe give them money, they know they can't even talk to their governments \nor attend conferences and talk about abortion? They are not going to \ntake the money.\n  In Ukraine, the Ministry of Health reported an 8.6 percent decrease \nin abortions between January and June of 1996, which it directly \nattributes to the women's reproductive health program that began in \n1995 with U.S. funding. For every 100 abortions performed in the 6 \nmonths before, there were 8 fewer performed in the next 6 months. Why? \nBecause of population services.\n  Now, look, I don't mean to, I don't intend to, and I don't pretend to \nwant to engage my friend in a debate on abortion. As I said when he was \nnecessarily off the floor, the only place we disagree as it relates to \nthis conference report is how much of a compromise the House really \nmade. I would argue essentially they made no compromise and allowed the \nPresident to waive in one circumstance the Mexico City restriction \nwhich is hardly ever used anyway. I think--I know from the \nadministration's perspective and the majority of my colleagues on this \nside and about 8 or 10 on your side, that it is a larger principle of \nwhether or not we can impose internationally a gag rule that can't be \nimposed nationally because of our first amendment. Again, I am not \narguing the merits of it, but I am arguing that is enough, I think, to \ndoom this conference report.\n  And I will conclude by saying--and I thank my friend for \nhis indulgence--but I conclude by saying the only other thing we \nprobably disagree on, and only of late, is tactically what is the best \nway to get what we both want done. I think if the Senate rejects, as \nwell as the President veto's threat exists, tactically that puts up \nmore of a wall that says, Look, let's deal with foreign policy, not \nwith Mexico City on this; pick another vehicle.\n\n  But I want to tell you--and I don't say this to be solicitous--I \ndon't know anyone who is tactically smarter, in terms of Senate \nprocedure, than my friend from North Carolina. We have both been here \nthe same number of years, but I do not have his knowledge\n\n[[Page S3570]]\n\nand experience relative to the rules. But I think I have almost as much \nof an instinct about what will motivate or not motivate our colleagues \nin the House or the Senate.\n  So, again, we disagree on only two points: One, this is not much of a \ncompromise on Mexico City; two, tactically I am urging my colleagues to \nvote ``no'' to make the point that this is not an easy access, to keep \nattaching this kind of language. Because it will allow, in my view, the \nleadership in the House to say, ``Look, if we want to get something \ndone, let's not attach it.''\n  That is my rationale. We have no disagreement on the legislation. We \nboth made real compromises on the core of this. I think we both, on \nboth our parts--it is presumptuous of me to say this and self-serving \nfor me to say this--but think we did a good job. I think we worked the \nway one of the major newspapers in America said the way the committee \nis supposed to work. We actually heard the facts, debated it, fought it \nout, resolved it, and did what was reasonable in the outcome.\n  So I say to my friend, I don't know where this will all lead except I \nam confident, either because of action on this floor or by the \nPresident, this conference report is not going to become law and we are \ngoing to have to go at this again. But I fear, as he does, time is \nawasting. It is harder each time to put Humpty-Dumpty back together \nagain. Time is running out. We are moving into an election year. I do \nnot in any way question his motivation. I do not in any way suggest \nthat I know my tactical judgment is better than his. But I have reached \nthis conclusion--and we talked about this--I have reached this \nconclusion for the reasons I have stated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, do not be misled by the modesty of the \ndistinguished Senator from Delaware. He knows as much about tactics as \nanybody I have ever seen. It is true that we came here the same day. I \nthink we have learned at the feet of certain masters that we have \nknown. Some have gone--departed. But, anyway, it has been great working \nwith the Senator. I appreciate his kind comments, and we will have to \nsee how it comes out.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains? I believe we had, at the \noutset, a total of 6 hours allocated. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. HELMS. How much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Helms has 2 hours 31 minutes; Senator \nBiden has--somewhat less than that.\n  Mr. HELMS. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Parliamentarian.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent--and I know the Senator from \nDelaware will agree--that any quorum call that occurs during this \nallotted time be charged equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. HELMS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, can the Chair advise the Senator from \nVermont where we are on the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware used 50 minutes of \nthe 3 hours. In consequence, to his side, there are 2 hours 10 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, is the time in control of the Senator from \nDelaware?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I yield as much time as my friend from \nVermont would like, and I ask unanimous consent that since I am going \nto be absent from the floor, that he have the authority to yield any \ntime he wishes as well. I have 2 hours 10 minutes left. I yield up to 2 \nhours 5 minutes to my friend from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Thank you, Mr. President. I assure my friend from \nDelaware, I will not utilize all that time. I yield myself such time as \nI require within those constraints.\n  Mr. President, when the Senate passed its version of the State \nauthorization bill last year, it contained no reference at all to \ninternational family planning or the Mexico City policy, which, as we \nknow, restricts U.S. Government funds to private family planning \norganizations. The reason for that was obvious. Family planning has \nnothing to do with the State authorization bill.\n  This bill is about how many Assistant Secretaries of State there will \nbe, the bureaus, how they are set up, and so on. It is not about \nrunning Planned Parenthood.\n  The House saw things differently. Unfortunately, a minority in the \nHouse saw yet another opportunity to hold hostage important foreign \npolicy legislation, and they did, like funding for the United Nations \nand the reorganization of the State Department. In doing so, they \nsought to force the President to embrace a discredited family planning \npolicy he has repeatedly and publicly rejected.\n  For some reason, the House seems to think that sending it down to the \nWhite House to get a certain veto represents some kind of victory, when \nall it does is guarantee that we will revisit this issue again and \nagain and again.\n  When I came to the Senate, we had members of both parties who tried \nto represent the United States in the best way possible. They would \njoin in a bipartisan agreement on foreign policy, to act in ways that \nwould make the United States as strong as possible.\n  Somehow, in the past few years, we have some who seek to make \npolitical points or fill out forms on fundraising letters, or whatever, \nand they distort the foreign policy of the United States for their own \nshort-term political gain. It is almost as though, with their ego, they \nfeel that whatever their issue is all that matters, and the foreign \npolicy of the United States can be thrown overboard. They are going to \nmake their point, they are going to send out their fundraising letters, \nthey are going to recruit their supporters based on how they might \ndistort the foreign policy of the United States, and they could care \nless of the consequences. I will give you an example.\n  An agreement was reached last year with the Republican leadership and \nthe Democratic leadership of the House and the Senate and the President \nof the United States that we would pay the dues that we owe under law \nand under treaty and under agreement to the United Nations. It is money \nwe agreed to pay, are legally obligated to pay, and have not paid.\n  Then, on the very day that the United States was asking the Security \nCouncil of the United Nations to stand solidly with us on the question \nof sanctions on Iraq, on the very day that the United States was asking \na disparate group in the Security Council to agree with us against \nSaddam Hussein and his refusal to comply with his obligations under the \nSecurity Council resolutions, on that same day the Republican \nleadership of the House of Representatives broke its word--broke its \nword to the President, broke its word to the United Nations, broke its \nword to the American people, broke its word to the Congress--and killed \nthe bill to pay our dues to the United Nations.\n  And why? Because a handful of people in the House of Representatives \nwanted to include the so-called Mexico City language that did not have \nthe support of even a majority of the Senate not to mention enough \nvotes to override a veto, and which the President had made \nunequivocally clear he would veto.\n  The U.S. Congress should have the honesty and the maturity to put the \ninterests of the country ahead of the individual political interests of \nMembers. We are asked to do this often as we should be. There has to be \nsome reason for serving here other than sending out fundraising letters \nor making political points. Maybe it seems novel to some, but I come \nfrom the old school and we Vermonters feel that the country comes \nfirst.\n  Mr. President, it would be one thing if the only problem with the \nMexico City policy were that it is totally nongermane to this bill, \nwhich it is, but it\n\n[[Page S3571]]\n\nis a lot worse than that. It is anti-family planning, anti-free speech, \nanti-women, anti-children, and flies in the face of the very democratic \nprinciples we are encouraging other countries to adopt. It is among the \nmost illogical and misguided approaches to an issue I have seen in my \ntime here.\n  What the House has done is send us a conference report that we have \nno opportunity to amend, which contains a controversial provision that \nwas not in the Senate version, that was never voted on by the Senate, \nthat is certain to be vetoed and which, despite repeated attempts, has \nnot won a majority of votes in the Senate for over a decade.\n  Mr. President, we could simply voice vote this conference report and \nlet the President veto it, but that would resolve nothing since the \nproponents of the Mexico City policy would simply play the same game \nwith the IMF supplemental, and if that failed, with the other \nappropriations bills. I am waiting for them to put it on a bill dealing \nwith highways or national forests or agricultural research or some \nother thing. The rules are irrelevant to them. Logic is irrelevant to \nthem. Good sense is irrelevant to them. And the interests of the \ncountry are apparently irrelevant.\n  The only way we are going to put a stop to these antics is for the \nSenate to reject the Mexico City policy altogether, for the Senate to \nstand up and say, ``We will not play these games.'' We will be the \nNation's conscience.\n  I am among those who believe we should pay our debts to the United \nNations. If the United States gives its word that it is going to do \nsomething, then we should do it. We bring our children up that way. We \ntell them if they give their word, they ought to keep their word. Well, \nwe are the ones who are the keepers of the word of the United States. \nWhen the United States gives its word, we ought to be honest enough to \nback it up.\n  The United Nations is helping solve global problems that we could not \npossibly solve by ourselves, even though they are problems that affect \nthe United States of America. Unfortunately, the amount authorized here \nfalls far short of what we owe, and it is encumbered with too many \nrestrictions.\n  Others, including the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, want to reorganize the State Department. But if we pass this \nconference report with the Mexico City language, there will be no State \nreorganization because it will be vetoed and it will be held hostage by \nthe House indefinitely.\n  So the Senator from Vermont believes there is only one option: Defeat \nit, and send it back to the House. There are no guarantees, but that is \nour best hope of getting the Mexico City policy stricken from this bill \nso the President can sign it.\n  Before I discuss what this version of the Mexico City policy would \ndo, let me remind all Senators what should be common knowledge. United \nStates law explicitly prohibits the use of U.S. Government funds to pay \nfor abortion or to lobby for abortion. That has been the law for years. \nYou wouldn't know it to hear some of the proponents of the Mexico City \npolicy talk. But that is the law. We have passed it time and time \nagain. We have all voted for that. In fact, the last time I believe was \nabout 6 months ago.\n\n  We will have our next opportunity to vote to reaffirm that \nprohibition on the Foreign Operations bill in a couple of months. No \none needs to worry about where they stand on that.\n  So when the proponents of the House Mexico City language say it is \nneeded to ensure that taxpayer funds are not used for abortion, they \nconveniently forget to mention that our law already prohibits that. I \nremember the ``Saturday Night Live'' character Dana Carvey, who would \nsay, ``Isn't that convenient.'' Well, for them it is convenient.\n  Because what they really want to do is prohibit funding for private \norganizations that use their own funds for abortion even where abortion \nis legal. In fact, the version that is in this conference report goes \neven further. It would prohibit those private organizations from even \nspeaking about abortion.\n  Now, can't you imagine how we would all react if the Parliament or \nthe Congress or ruling committee of any other country passed a law, and \nstanding up they would say, ``In this law, no private organization in \nthe United States can speak on a particular issue.'' Lord love us all, \nMr. President, there would be such a flood of Senators and House \nMembers to come down and say, ``How dare they, How dare they, in \nthat''--and fill in the blank of whatever country it is--``How dare \nthey tell the United States what to say or people in the United States \nwhat they can say.''\n  Yet that is what the House would have us do. We would laugh them out \nof the Chamber because it would so obviously violate our first \namendment. But we have some in the other body who do not believe that \nprivate organizations, even American organizations, have the right of \nfree speech outside our country.\n  I was going to say that they should reread our history, but it is \napparent that I presume too much. They should simply read it. Do we \nreally want to go down this road? This isn't a Democratic issue or a \nRepublican issue; it is a free speech issue. It is about the right of \npeople to voice their opinions as representatives of private \norganizations where it is legal to do so. It is shameful for the U.S. \nCongress, which the world looks to as a beacon of free speech and \ndemocracy, to even think of curtailing that right. And yet the House \nwould have us do that in countries that are struggling to become more \ndemocratic and more free.\n  What kind of an example is that? How can the same people stand up and \nsay, we stand for the principles of America, except in those instances \nwhere they conflict with whatever our political agenda is and then we \nare willing to trample on them?\n  What is described innocently as a lobby ban is in fact a gag rule \nthat flies in the face of efforts to reduce unsafe abortion worldwide. \nPrivate organizations receiving U.S. funds would be prohibited from \neven calling attention to defects in legal abortion laws. They would be \nprohibited from trying to make abortion safer and reduce the number of \nwomen worldwide--hundreds of thousands of women--who die from unsafe \nabortions. Why on Earth would we want to do that?\n  Members of the House argue they have made a difficult concession by \nallowing the President to waive one of the restrictions. Either they \nare joking or they assume we do not bother to read what we are voting \non. They fail to mention that if the President exercises the waiver, \nwhich they fully expect him to do, scarce family planning funds would \nbe cut an additional $44 million in this year alone, meaning a $224 \nmillion cut from the 1995 level.\n  What would be the consequence? Millions of women who might otherwise \nreceive access to family planning would become pregnant, and there \nwould be millions of abortions that otherwise would have been \nprevented. The evidence that voluntary family planning reduces \nunwarranted pregnancies and abortions is beyond dispute. It can be seen \nin every country in the world. The irony is that the provisions sent to \nus by the other body would result in more abortions, not fewer, because \nit would sharply cut funding for family planning.\n  Now, let us be honest. They say they don't want abortions. That is \nfine. I respect that. Who wants abortions? I wish there would never be \nanother one. But you don't accomplish that by cutting money for family \nplanning. It is so logical. If you have good family planning the number \nof unwanted pregnancies goes down and the number of abortions goes \ndown. You can't say, ``We don't want you to have abortions but we also \ndon't want you to have contraceptives.'' Be honest. That is what it \ncomes down to.\n  Studies done in the United States show that the use of family \nplanning reduces the probability of a woman having an abortion by a \nstaggering 85 percent. In Russia, the average woman had seven abortions \nin her life, but since AID began providing modern contraceptives to \nRussia the number of abortions has gone way down and continues to go \ndown.\n  In Kazakhstan, AID support for family planning clinics led to a 59 \npercent increase in contraceptive use and a 41 percent decrease in \nabortion among women served by the clinics. There have been similar \ndeclines of abortions\n\n[[Page S3572]]\n\nwhen contraceptives were made available from Latin America to eastern \nEurope. In one of the poorest countries, Bangladesh, where abortion is \nprohibited, education about contraceptives and alternatives to abortion \nhas contributed to a significant reduction in fertility rates over the \npast 10 years. Even in Bangladesh, where abortion is illegal, 50,000 \nwomen are hospitalized each year because of complications from illegal, \nunsafe abortions. Family planning funding will help reduce those \nnumbers. These are women's lives that are saved. Why do the people who \nsupport the Mexico City language not care about them? Is it because \nthey live in a different country?\n  Another argument they make is that although U.S. funds are not spent \non abortion they free up other funds that are spent on abortion. The \nold ``money is fungible'' argument. Do they really want to go down that \nroad? Do they really want to say we cannot send aid to countries \nbecause they might use some of that aid on abortion because abortion is \nlegal there? Does that mean that because abortion is legal in Israel--\nwe give aid to Israel, it is deposited in the Israeli Treasury--that we \nshould shut off U.S. aid to Israel because other Israeli Government \nfunds are used for abortion? Whoops, not going to do that, and I am not \nsuggesting we should. Obviously, we are not going to cut aid to Israel \nbecause the Israeli Government supports abortion. But why should the \nrules be different for private citizens? If anything, they should have \nmore protection to speak freely. They are not a government. They ought \nto be able to speak freely.\n  Should we stop funding nuclear safety programs in Russia because \nabortion is legal there and abortions are provided at government \nhospitals? Should we say that we will put at risk the lives of \nAmericans for a nuclear accident and cut off funds for nuclear safety \nprograms in Russia because they won't make abortion illegal? Maybe we \nshould cut off aid to any State in the United States because abortion \nis legal. That would be all 50 States.\n  Of all things, family planning is something we should support. Unlike \nnuclear safety, it does help reduce the number of abortions. Yet the \nMexico City policy would prevent us from supporting private family \nplanning organizations. Crazy, absolutely crazy.\n  Mr. President, whether you are pro-choice or pro-life, you should \noppose the Mexico City policy. One of my best friends in the U.S. \nSenate, a man I admire greatly, a man who was a mentor to me when I \nfirst came to the Senate, served as chairman of our Senate \nAppropriations Committee, is now retired, the former distinguished \nsenior Senator from Oregon, Senator Hatfield. He is strongly pro-life. \nI greatly respected Senator Mark Hatfield for that. I greatly respected \nhim for a lot of things because I felt he was a man who always followed \nhis conscience. He opposed the Mexico City policy not because he is \npro-abortion, he was adamantly the other way, but because he said if \nyou have family planning, especially with the U.S. prohibition against \nusing it for abortion--if you have family planning the number of \nabortions will go down. He knew from the hearings we had in the \nAppropriations.\n  Voting for the Mexico City policy may make for a good press release, \nbut it would cut funding for family planning. It would increase the \nnumber of abortions. We should reject this attempt to push this \nmisguided policy down our throats. We should send the bill back to the \nHouse.\n  Mr. President, before I yield the floor I want to say a final word \nabout the tactics used here. These are vitally important foreign policy \nprograms, but this is the second time in 6 months that the House has \nused this type of blackmail. This is the second time in 6 months a \nsmall group in the House has pushed their political agenda no matter \nhow much damage it might do to the integrity and the word of the United \nStates worldwide--last year, it was the IMF and U.N. funding; this year \nit is the U.N. funding and they are threatening again to block funding \nfor the IMF. If that fails, it would be funding for disaster relief in \nVermont or California or Minnesota, Oregon, or anywhere else.\n  And all because they do not have the votes to override a veto of the \nMexico City policy. Whatever happened to democracy, to the legislative \nprocess? Instead, we have a handful who prefer gridlock and blackmail. \nThey shut down the Government first and now this. If it were up to them \nthey would hold hostage billions of dollars for these economic and \nsecurity programs indefinitely. No wonder the Congress is seen by so \nmany Americans as an embarrassment.\n  Mr. President, I have been proud to serve in the U.S. Senate for \nalmost 24 years. I am proud that the people of Vermont have sent me to \nthis body. In our over 200-year history, I am the only member of my \nparty to ever serve in the U.S. Senate. But the other party sent great, \ngreat leaders that I revere and admire, people I try to emulate. The \nSenators from Vermont have always felt that the integrity of the United \nStates must be protected, that the United States, when it gives its \nword, must stand by it. The first Ambassador to the United Nations was \na Vermonter who gave up his seat in the U.S. Senate to be appointed to \nthat post, to again stand up and say that when the United States gives \nits word, it keeps it.\n  I hope that some--mostly in the other body, and maybe some in this \nbody--will step back and say, let us worry less about our own political \nlives and our own political future, for whatever short moment that may \nbe, and think in the long term for our country. None of us owns a seat \nin the U.S. Senate; I don't, the distinguished Presiding Officer \ndoesn't, none of us do. It is the same in the other body. We are \nprivileged and honored to represent our States for the time that we are \nhere. Most of us do it with a great deal of care and in the interest of \nour State and our country. I know my friends who are on the floor here \nat this moment are all people who fall into that category.\n  But there are always times when we have to say that the political \ninterests we may have individually are greatly outweighed by the \ninterests of the United States of America, because we will come and go, \nthe country will remain, and the country can either be weakened or \nstrengthened by what we do. This is a time when we ought to stand up \nand fulfill the obligations of the United States, fulfill our high \nstandards, and keep our word. So in this case, I hope that this \nconference report is defeated.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nMinnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, the pending business before the Senate is \nthe Conference Report on H.R. 1757, the Foreign Affairs Reform and \nRestructuring Act. I take the other side of this issue. I strongly \nencourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support passage \nof this important foreign policy initiative.\n  As Chairman of the Subcommittee on International Organizations of the \nForeign Relations Committee, I spent many hours along with my \ncolleagues on the Committee and with the Clinton Administration \ncrafting legislation which will strengthen America's leadership role in \nthe international arena.\n  This Conference Report is a true ``reform'' bill. H.R.1757 abolishes \ntwo federal agencies and reorganizes their essential functions into the \nDepartment of State. It brings long overdue reform to the United \nNations. It prioritizes our international affairs expenditures and \nauthorizes important foreign policy initiatives. In fact, the core \nreforms contained in this legislation were originally approved by the \nSenate by a vote of 90-5 on June 17, 1997.\n  I think it is fair to say that this is one of the most far-reaching \nand comprehensive foreign affairs bills undertaken by the Congress. \nThis reflects Congressional acknowledgment of the need to create a more \neffective foreign affairs apparatus, both at home and at the UN, in \norder to confront the post-Cold War challenges to U.S. peace and \nsecurity.\n  The pending legislation is the result of a good-faith effort to \naccommodate conflicting perspectives on how we, as a nation, should \nallocate our resources. There were tough, lengthy negotiations on this \npackage. We had to reconcile competing interests, and as a result, no \none can claim that the final product contains everything that they \nwould wish. I will be the first to say that this bill does not contain \nall of the reforms\n\n[[Page S3573]]\n\nI originally sought. I would have preferred much more in the way of \nreforms and budget discipline. But this is a good agreement; and in \nthis case, we must not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.\n\n  Now, let me say that I understand some on the other side of the aisle \nmay vote against this bill, and the President has indicated his \nintention to veto it, because of a provision that contains a part of \nthe so-called ``Mexico City'' language. Specifically, section 1816 of \nthis bill would prohibit organizations that receive U.S. taxpayer \ndollars from lobbying to change abortion laws--either for or against--\noverseas.\n  Now, let me make clear some of the important initiatives that would \nnot be enacted if this Conference Report is defeated.\n  The President and the Secretary of State have indicated that payment \nof U.S. arrears to the United Nations is a top priority. This bill \nwould authorize a three-year payment plan of $819 million, and an \nadditional $107 million in debt reduction, to the United Nations and \nother international organizations in return for comprehensive \nmanagement and fiscal reform of the United Nations. Rejection of this \nconference report would eliminate this funding and kill the management \nand fiscal reform measures.\n  The President and the Secretary of State have agreed that a \nfundamental restructuring of U.S. foreign affairs agencies is long \noverdue. This bill eliminates the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, \nand the U.S. Information Agency and folds their functions into the \nState Department, while still maintaining firewalls between the State \nDepartment and the essential broadcasting activities and public \ndiplomacy of USIA. It also consolidates certain functions of the Agency \nfor International Development into the State Department and grants the \nSecretary of State greater authority over foreign aid spending. Without \nthe pending legislation, this reorganization cannot go forward.\n\n  The Drug Czar, General McCaffrey, has agreed that keeping our \nchildren free from drugs is a top priority. This bill requires the \nState Department to develop and implement a comprehensive \ncounternarcotics strategy. Without this bill, this important initiative \nwill not go forward.\n  The Secretary has been a tireless advocate for investment in the U.S. \ndiplomatic infrastructure, citing examples of deplorable conditions of \nU.S. missions overseas, including ambassadors washing dishes in \nbathtubs, and outdated computer systems. This bill fully funds the \ncapital investment fund and provides urgently needed resources for \nembassy construction in Berlin and Beijing.\n  Containment of Saddam Hussein and support for a democratic movement \nin Iraq are essential to advancing democracy in the Gulf. This bill \nauthorizes programs to assist a democratic Iraqi resistance, to create \na Radio Free Iraq broadcast, and to reconstruct communities not under \nthe control of Saddam Hussein. None of these programs will be \nauthorized if this legislation is not enacted.\n  Mr. President, this Conference Report lays out comprehensive and \nachievable reforms, both here at home in the nation's foreign affairs \nbureaucracy and in the United Nations. My visits to the U.N. as the \nU.S. Congressional Delegate to the U.N. General Assembly served to \nreinforce my commitment to salvage this organization. In this age, any \norganization burdened with a bloated bureaucracy and no mechanisms to \ncontrol spending, will collapse under the weight of its own \ninefficiency. If we do not take a leadership role in reforming the U.N. \nnow, a powerful, entrenched U.N. bureaucracy looking after its own \nshort-term interests may condemn the U.N. to irrelevance as we move \ninto the 21st Century.\n\n  When Secretary of State Albright was serving as Ambassador to the \nU.N., she warned that ``poor management'' could be the U.N.'s \n``Achilles' heel'' saying, `` I cannot justify to the taxpayers of my \ncountry some of the personnel arrangements, the sweetheart pension \ndeals, the lack of accountability, the waste of resources, the \nduplication of effort and the lack of attention to the bottom line we \noften see around here.''\n  Well, Congress cannot justify these excesses to the American \ntaxpayers either. That is why we have stepped forward with a bipartisan \nreform plan that will compel the United Nations to address these \nconcerns. As I stated previously, the pending legislation provides a \nthree-year payment of $819 million in arrears to the United Nations and \n$107 million in debt reduction that the U.N. owes that U.S. in \nconjunction with the achievement of specific benchmarks that will help \nenhance the vitality of the U.N.\n  Mr. President, this bill also takes steps to address another concern \nof mine, and that is the move to ensure that survivors of torture will \nbe treated with the compassion which they deserve. One provision that I \nauthored prohibits the involuntary return of any person to a country in \nwhich there are substantial grounds for believing that he or she would \nbe in danger of being subjected to torture. Another provision \nauthorizes the U.S. to contribute $3 million in fiscal 1998 and another \n$3 million in fiscal year 1999 to the United Nations Voluntary Fund for \nVictims of Torture, ensuring that treatment centers in more than 50 \ncountries will continue to receive support.\n  The United States should take a leading role in encouraging the \nestablishment of additional programs, both at home and abroad, for the \ntreatment of torture survivors. My home state of Minnesota is fortunate \nto have the first comprehensive treatment center in the United States \nfor survivors of torture. The Center for Victims of Torture has treated \nover 500 patients since it was established in 1985, and has enabled \nthem to become productive members of our communities by overcoming the \natrocities suffered in their countries of origin. We must continue to \nsupport treatment centers, like the one in Minnesota, which help those \nwho cannot help themselves--survivors of torture. Dedicating more of \nour U.N. voluntary funds for this purpose will help provide this \nimportant service to more needy survivors.\n\n  I strongly believe the U.N. is an important forum for debate between \nmember states and a vehicle for joint action when warranted. It is not \na world government. However, the U.N. must endorse reforms that provide \ntransparency and accountability so it is embraced as an important world \nforum for discussion and for coordinating action to promote \ninternational peace and security, not as a world government. I firmly \nbelieve that this package will improve the U.N. and assist it in \nwinning back public support in the United States.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation. I commend \nthe Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee for his diligence and \nperseverance in achieving this comprehensive reform plan.\n  Little has changed since the Senate approved this legislation last \nNovember by voice vote, and last July by a vote of 90-5. It certainly \nwould be disappointing, and I believe short-sighted, now to reject \nreorganization, payment of U.N. arrears, and other key foreign policy \ninitiatives because the President has decided that single-issue \npolitics is more important than U.S. foreign policy interests. My \ncolleagues should heed the warning of the Secretary of State that \nfailure to pay the U.N. arrears would result in a ``shutdown for our \nnational security policy.'' If this is the case, then it would be \nirresponsible to reject these funds because of opposition to the \nprohibition on U.S. aid recipients against lobbying foreign governments \nto change their abortion laws. Mr. President, this legislation advances \nkey American foreign policy interests, and I hope that all of my \ncolleagues will support its passage.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, there are several provisions in this \nconference report which trouble me greatly. For example, the bill \nabolishes the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) and merges its \nfunctions into the Department of State. As one who has always believed \nthat there are sensible ways to reorganize our foreign affairs \nagencies, I do not oppose this merger. However, I am concerned that the \nbill fails to augment the State Department's budget in fiscal year 1999 \nto ensure that the vital activities for which ACDA is now responsible \nwill continue. The bill also perpetuates and increases funding for \ninternational broadcasting activities--an approach\n\n[[Page S3574]]\n\nwhich, in my view, is not the most effective use of scarce resources at \na time when there are so many other sources of information available \nglobally. However, the main reason why I am going to vote against this \nconference report is that it imposes unacceptable conditions on funding \nfor international family planning organizations.\n  Section 1816 of the bill was offered by Congressman Chris Smith in a \nsham conference process in which no Democrat from the Senate or the \nHouse was invited to participate. It has been billed by its author as a \nso-called ``compromise'' to bridge the gap between the House, which has \nvoted to reinstate the Mexico City policy of the Reagan and Bush \nadministrations, and the Senate, which has repeatedly supported the \nClinton Administration's decision to abandon it. The Mexico City policy \nended assistance to private family planning organizations overseas if \nthe organization was involved in voluntary abortion activities even if \nUS funds were not used for such activities. Of course, since 1973 US \nfunding for abortions overseas has been banned by law and international \nfamily planning organizations have been prohibited from using US funds \nto pay for abortions. Even abortion opponents agree that there is no \ndirect US funding of abortions abroad.\n  Make no mistake about it. The Smith provision is no compromise. \nFirst, it tries to dictate how foreign family planning organizations \nuse their own funds by mandating that no US population assistance may \nbe given to any foreign organization unless the organization certifies \nthat it will not use its own funds to counsel or perform abortions. If \nthe President exercises the waiver of this provision, funding for \nfamily planning activities will be cut by $44 million.\n  Far worse, however, is the expanded ban on lobbying which amounts to \na gag rule on organizations receiving US population funding. The Smith \nprovision prohibits funding for any foreign organization that ``engages \nin any activity or effort to alter the laws or governmental policies of \nany foreign country concerning the circumstances under which abortion \nis permitted, regulated or prohibited.'' The statement of managers \nmakes it clear that the phrase ``alter the laws or governmental \npolicies'' is broadened well beyond traditional lobbying to include \n``sponsoring conferences, and workshops on the alleged defects of the \nabortion laws, as well as the drafting and distribution of materials or \npublic statements calling attention to such alleged defects.'' In other \nwords, under this prohibition, which is not waivable, any foreign \norganization which dares to enter a legitimate public policy debate on \nthe abortion issue in its own country would be denied US family \nplanning assistance.\n  The lobby ban in the Smith amendment is anti-democratic in every \nsense of the word. As Secretary of State Albright has said, it is \n``basically a gag rule that would punish organizations for engaging in \nthe democratic process in foreign countries and for engaging in legal \nactivities that would be protected by the First Amendment if carried \nout in the United States.'' It sacrifices free speech, a right we \nAmericans hold dear, for ideological purposes on the abortion issue.\n  This gag rule harkens back to the old days of American imperialism by \ntelling others in foreign countries what they can and cannot say and \ndo. It runs counter to our long held belief in pluralism, open \npolitical processes and democratic participation, and it undermines a \ncentral tenet of our foreign policy: encouraging democratic political \npractices abroad and participation by non governmental organizations in \nthose processes.\n  The Mexico City provision in this conference report, with its gag \nrule, will not reduce the number of abortions but rather increase it. \nThe effect of this provision, if enacted, would be to cut funding for \nfamily planning programs, thereby decreasing access to the most \neffective means of reducing abortion.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I think it is a travesty that the \nreorganization of our foreign affairs agencies--an issue on which the \nAdministration and the Congress have finally found common ground after \nmuch disagreement--and our efforts to pay our debts at the United \nNations and promote much-needed reform in that body are being held \nhostage to a domestic issue which is irrelevant to the substance and \ngoals of this bill. This is not the proper place or the proper time to \nengage yet again in a debate over Mexico City. For this reason alone, I \nurge my colleagues to vote against this conference report.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on Wednesday evening, the committee of \nconference on the reauthorization of the Intermodal Surface \nTransportation Efficiency Act, or ISTEA, had its first opportunity to \nsit down in full conference and discuss the differences between H.R. \n2400 and S. 1173, respectively, the House- and Senate-passed highway \nbills. As a Senator who is not a member of the conference committee but \nas a Senator who is, nevertheless, deeply committed to increasing \nsubstantially the size of our national investment in transportation \ninfrastructure, I rise to urge the conferees to complete expeditiously \ntheir deliberations on the highway reauthorization bill. The conferees \nand all Senators are fully cognizant of the imminent--the imminent--\narrival of May 1, the date beyond which all States will be prohibited \nby law from obligating any Federal-aid highway funds.\n  Senators will recall that, during the months of February and March, I \nand a number of other supporters of the Byrd/Gramm/Baucus/Warner \namendment, spoke on the Senate floor on a daily basis to discuss the \ncritical need for the Senate to turn immediately to the ISTEA, or the \nhighway, reauthorization bill. I thought it was extremely important \nthat all 100 Senators, all 50 Governors, and the thousands of State \nlegislators and mayors and transportation agencies throughout our \nNation were fully aware that the Surface Transportation Extension Act--\nthe short-term ISTEA extension bill passed at the end of last year--\nincludes a deadline on the authorization of our federal aid highway and \ntransit programs. That short-term bill, P.L. 105-130, the Surface \nTransportation Extension Act of 1997, includes the following passage, \nand I quote from the law of the land.\n  The Magna Carta of 1215, which the English barons forced King John to \nsign at Runnymede on the meadow near the Thames River, had a phrase\n\n[[Page S3575]]\n\nwithin it, ``the law of the land.'' That was the phrase, ``the law of \nthe land.'' And our own American Constitution later used the phrase \n``due process.'' ``Due process.'' We speak of the due process law. Due \nprocess is an evolution from the law of the land in the Magna Carta.\n  So I want to read this following passage from the law of the land:\n\n       A State shall not obligate any funds for any federal aid \n     highway program project after May 1, 1998.\n\n  There is no equivocation. There are no ifs, ands, or buts. Let me \nread it again. This passage is from the law of the land, the statute \nthat Congress passed last November:\n\n       A State shall not obligate any funds----\n\n  That is pretty absolute, pretty final. There are no doubts that arise \nfrom reading that language.\n\n       A State shall not obligate any funds for any Federal aid \n     highway program project after May 1, 1998.\n\n  The short-term bill also includes other provisions which, in effect, \nlimit our States to obligating no more than $9.8 billion through May 1 \non our Federal-aid highways. Even though the Transportation \nAppropriations Act for the current fiscal year provided a total \nobligation limitation of $21.5 billion, a historic 16 percent increase \nabove the prior year's level, the short-term authorization bill \neffectively capped that amount at $9.8 billion, roughly 45 percent of \nthe allowable appropriation. It will be necessary for a new highway \nbill to be enacted into law in order for the States to spend the \nremaining $11.7 billion allowed under the appropriations act.\n  I recently contacted the Federal Highway Administration to find out \nhow States are progressing in the obligation of this $9.8 billion and \nhow their obligations compare to amounts they have obligated in prior \nyears by this time. As of Wednesday evening, the States had obligated \nroughly $8.5 billion, or 86 percent, of the total $9.8 billion \npermitted under the short-term extension law. The Federal Highway \nAdministration expects, however, that almost all of the $9.8 billion \nwill be obligated by the time the clock strikes--by the time that clock \njust above the Presiding Officer's Chair strikes midnight one week from \ntoday. Indeed, this rate of obligations is consistent with the amounts \nthe States customarily obligate by this point in the year.\n  We now find ourselves in a situation where the Federal spigot will be \nshut off without even a dribble of funding going to States to continue \nthe annual construction process beyond the end of next week. States \nwill not be allowed to enter into any new obligations. It will be \nanything but business as usual in our Nation's highway construction \nenterprise. Roughly $11.7 billion in potential highway construction \nfunds will be frozen at the Treasury until a new highway bill is signed \ninto law. And if that highway bill is not signed into law soon, the \nStates will be required to lay off highway workers and bring their \nplanning and engineering activities to a halt. The longer it takes to \nget a new highway bill enacted, the greater the likelihood that a good \npart of the spring and summer construction season will be lost.\n  I remind my colleagues that the Federal Highway Administration \nestimates that every billion dollars in federal highway spending \ngenerates 42,000 jobs throughout our economy. This $11.7 billion in \nconstruction funds that will be withheld from our States after May 1, \npending the enactment of a new highway bill, thus, represents almost \n500,000 jobs. Put another way, Mr. President, our failure to enact a \nhighway bill in the near term could result in layoffs approaching half \na million workers over the long term.\n  I do not believe that any Senator or any Member of the other body \nwants to see half a million highway workers thrown off the job. The \nsooner the Congress sends a highway bill to the President and the \nsooner the President signs that bill, the sooner we will ensure that \nthis does not happen.\n  Mr. President, I am hopeful that the conferees on the highway bill \nwill complete their work promptly. Through the intervention of the \nbipartisan leadership of both the House and the Senate, each body has \nnow passed a comprehensive surface transportation bill with \nsubstantially increased resources. This accomplishment was long overdue \nand I commend the leadership of the House and the Senate, as well as \nthe leadership of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, \nand the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, in passing \nbills that will finally authorize the obligation of all new revenues to \nthe highway trust fund.\n  I do not mean to belittle the task that is before the conferees in \nthe development of the final conference agreement on the ISTEA \nreauthorization bill. There are significant differences in approach and \npolicy between the two bills. I am confident, however, that under the \nleadership of Chairman Shuster and Chairman Chafee and their Democratic \ncounterparts, Congressman Oberstar and Senator Baucus, these \ndifferences can be resolved so that we can adopt a conference report as \nclose to the May 1 deadline as possible. So I implore all conferees to \nwork diligently, as they always do, to ensure that our States, and our \nlocal communities, see no interruption in the flow of critically needed \nhighway investment dollars.\n  (Mr. Hagel assumed the Chair.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/24/senate-section/article/S3574-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3575-S3578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SENATOR KENNEDY AND THE EDUCATION BILL\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

I, on yesterday and on previous \ndays, voted in opposition to Senator Kennedy's position on amendment \nafter amendment to the education bill that was before the Senate, the \nbill which passed the Senate last evening. But Senator Kennedy never \nfalters--never falters. I did not agree with him, and that is why I \nvoted differently on some of the amendments and on the passage of the \nbill.\n  But I, nevertheless, never hesitate to admire his supreme dedication \nto the education of our children and to the support of the public \nschool system. He has done a magnificent job over the years. When I was \nmajority leader, he was just as magnificent, just as unyielding in his \nsupport of public education, always a superb committee chairman and \ntoday a superb ranking member of the committee.\n  He is undaunted always. He is always constant. You know where he \nstands.\n\n     How hard it is----\n\n  As we read from Caesar:\n\n     How hard it is for women to keep counsel!\n     But I am constant as the northern star,\n     Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality\n     There is no fellow in the firmament.\n\n  That is pretty constant, isn't it? Let us go over it again.\n\n     How hard it is for women to keep counsel!\n\n  Now that is not a part of my thinking in this instance, but that is \npart of the quotation.\n  Now I am thinking of Senator Kennedy.\n\n     But I am constant as the northern star,\n     Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality\n     There is no fellow in the firmament.\n\n  So even though I differ in my position, especially with respect to \nthis bill that was passed yesterday, differ in some respects from my \ncolleague, Senator Kennedy, I admire him and commend him and salute him \nfor his constancy in standing for what he thinks is the best for our \nyoung people.\n  And, of course, in differing with Senator Kennedy, I, too, stood for \nwhat I thought was best for our children. I deplore some of the things \nthat are being said in an attempt to equate highways with schools or \nwith education. The country needs both. The country is in dire need of \ninvestment in infrastructure in this country. Both highways and \neducation, the education of our young people, both constitute \ninfrastructure.\n  And I think it is unwise to attempt to equate one with the other and \nsay, ``Oh, we are spending billions of dollars on highways. Why should \nwe not spend like amounts on education?'' I am for both. But why equate \neducation with highways or highways with education? We cannot have one \nwithout the other. We have to have both. And so I hope the \nadministration will get off that tack of trying to equate highway \nfunding with education funding. We can be for both roads and schools \nand be for our children in being for both, without speaking \ndisparagingly of either.\n  My concerns, as I stated yesterday, grew out of the deplorable state \nof elementary and secondary education as\n\n[[Page S3576]]\n\nwe view it today and as we view its results. And as I cited on \nyesterday, certain reports indicate that we are not doing very well in \nthe education of our young people. And while some people seem to be \nsaying just spend more and more money, we cannot continue to just throw \nmoney at the problem and expect to resolve it.\n  I have been voting for more money for elementary and secondary \neducation now for 33 years, since the legislation was first passed in \n1965. For decades I have always been found at the gate protecting and \nsupporting Federal funds for public schools and for our education \nprograms.\n  But when one goes the last mile of the way and concludes from what he \nsees, from what he hears, and from what he reads, concludes from \nanalytical reports about public education that we are not doing well, \nthat there is something wrong, then it seems to me that, in the \ninterest of the public school system, we may have to try a little \ndifferent approach, else the confidence of the American people in that \nsystem and the support of the American people for that system are going \nto erode. We see that happening.\n  One of the things that I am greatly concerned about is the kind of \ntextbooks that our children are being given in the schools--books that \nare almost devoid of history, according to one of the reports \nyesterday. Many teachers are putting textbooks aside, not using them, \nand depending upon materials that they--the teachers--develop for \nthemselves. That is a sad commentary. One of the reports indicated that \nin many States the subject of history is no longer being taught. That \nis a tragedy. How are we going to be able to judge current events if we \nhave no knowledge of what happened yesterday or in yesteryear or a \ndecade ago or a century ago? These are guideposts, and history will \nhelp us to determine, with some amount of knowledge and wisdom, the \nsolutions that are needed concerning events and problems of today.\n  Byron, in speaking of history, said, ``History, with all her volumes \nvast, hath but one page.'' ``History, with all her volumes vast, hath \nbut one page.'' Now, what did Byron mean by that? He meant that history \ndoes really, essentially, repeat itself. And I think it does. Why? \nBecause human nature has never changed.\n  When God created the world and the solar system and all of this \nuniverse and other universes--and he is still creating the universes, \nstill creating stars, God created man, and gave him a will. If we read \nMilton's ``Paradise Lost,'' we read much about man's having been given \nthe faculty of reasoning and having been given the power of the will. \nHe may exercise his will.\n  He has been given a memory. History is a compilation, in many ways, a \ncompilation of memories. And if we don't have any sense of history, \nthen we will find ourselves lacking.\n  Cicero said with respect to history, ``To be ignorant of what \noccurred before you were born is to remain always a child.''\n  I recall that Herodotus, the father of history, who lived circa 484-\n424 B.C., wrote about Cyrus the Great of Persia. He wrote about Cyrus \nand Darius and Xerxes. Writing of Cyrus, he told the story of how Cyrus \nhad been very successful as a ruler of Persia. Cyrus ruled in Persia, \nruled as the king of Anshan, from 559 B.C. to 550 and then as the king \nof Cyrus, all the Persians and the Medes, from 550 to 529 B.C. As Cyrus \nwas nearing the end of his reign, he desired to enlarge upon his \nprovinces and he conceived the idea of going into the area of the world \nnortheast of the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, which was the land of \nthe Scythians. The ruler of the Massagetae was a woman. Her name was \nTomyris.\n  Cyrus came to a great river. He called about him his wise men, his \nseers, his soothsayers and top generals, and asked them for their \nopinions as to whether or not he should cross the river and pursue his \ndreams of adding to his mighty provinces by defeating the Scythians. \nHis advisors urged him to cross over the river. Some years earlier, \nCyrus had defeated Croesus at the battle of Thymbra, in 546 B.C. \nCroesus was at that time the ruler of Lydia--Croesus, the richest man \nin the world, I suppose. But Cyrus didn't execute Croesus as one whom \nhe had defeated, but he took Croesus into his court and used him as an \nadvisor.\n  On this occasion, Cyrus got one piece of advice from his generals, \nand he then asked Croesus what his opinion was. Croesus said \nthis: ``There is a wheel on which the affairs of men revolve but its \nmovement forbids the same man to be always fortunate.''\n\n  What was Croesus telling Cyrus? He was saying that history repeats \nitself. And in my own life, in my perception of things, I have seen men \nsuccessful for a while, but it doesn't always last. Croesus gave to \nCyrus this good advice, which, indeed, was a warning.\n  Let me just say briefly that Cyrus disregarded the advice of Croesus \nand crossed the river. And Tomyris, the ruling queen of the Massagetae, \nsent word to Cyrus, urging him to go back into his country, telling him \nthat he had been a successful king; but promising him that, if he \ncontinued in his efforts to subjugate, to conquer, the Massagetae, he \nwould get his fill of blood.\n  Cyrus disregarded the words of Tomyris and there was a great battle. \nCyrus lost the battle.\n  Herodotus tells us that after the battle, Tomyris sent her men around \nthe field to find Cyrus. They found his body. Tomyris prepared a large \nbag of skins and filled that bag with blood. When the body of Cyrus was \nbrought to her, she had the head severed from the body. She thrust \nCyrus' head into the bag that was filled with blood, and said, ``I \npromised you that, if you persisted in attacking my people, you would \nget your fill of blood. I have kept my pledge.''\n  Now, Mr. President, I believe that history is exceedingly important \nfor people who wish to become statesmen, for people who wish to become \nteachers, lawyers, ministers, doctors. Why would we want in our country \nto put history aside and to substitute social studies? One of the \nreports that I referred to on yesterday indicated that history had \nbecome a ``curricular swamp'' and indicated also that in many States \namong the 50, history is not even being taught as a study.\n  What is happening to America? No wonder our children are going to \ngrow into men and women without any idea as to what happened before \nthey were born. Cicero would not have thought very well of that. There \nare people who think that we ought to get away from memorizing things. \nWell, how could I ever instantly come up with the answer to the \nquestion, ``How much is eight times nine?'' or ``How much is six times \nseven?'' if I hadn't memorized my multiplication tables?\n  History, as I said yesterday, is a matter of dates and heroes. That \nwas my own way of putting it.\n\n  As a boy, I walked the red clay roads of Mercer County in southern \nWest Virginia and attended a little two-room schoolhouse and studied \nMuzzey and his history of the American people. I studied Muzzey by the \nlight of an old kerosene lamp--I memorized my history lessons. My first \nheroes were men like Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, John C. Calhoun, \nThomas Benton, Nathanael Greene. I studied about the Revolutionary War. \nWe read about Francis Marion, the swamp fox, and Daniel Morgan. We read \nthe story of Nathan Hale, who said, ``I only regret that I have but one \nlife to lose for my country.'' Those were our heroes.\n  Are we reaching a point in American history when young people no \nlonger have heroes, except what they see on TV? Is that going to be the \nhistory that they will remember?\n  As the story in the Washington Post had related, to which I referred \non yesterday, textbooks are being written in ways that seek to avoid \noffending this little interest group or that little interest group or \nsome other little interest group, as a result of which the pages are \nbecoming so bland and meaningless that they end up offending everybody.\n  If we want to really improve the public school system and the \neducation received in the public school system, then we ought to demand \ntextbooks that are meaningful and not just filled with pictures. ``A \npicture is worth a thousand words,'' but not a whole book of pictures. \nThere has to be some substance that goes with the dessert--some beans, \npotatoes, cabbage, and corn bread to go along with the dessert, some \nsubstance that teaches high morals and teaches the basics, teaches our \nchildren to read and to write and to spell, and teaches them about \narithmetic, science, history, and geography.\n\n  We used to have our little spelling matches on Friday afternoons back \nin\n\n[[Page S3577]]\n\nthat little two-room schoolhouse. I always looked forward to Friday \nafternoon. I looked forward to those occasions when I would be able to \nstand up with other boys and girls and see who was the last to be left \nstanding. He or she was the champ. And then we would have contests in \naddition and multiplication, with a piece of chalk on the blackboard. \nWho was the best math student?\n  Those teachers were dedicated when I was a boy. They loved us and we \nloved them. They inspired us and we, each of us, wanted to get that pat \non the back, that pat on the shoulders from the teacher, saying, ``You \ndid well.'' We were inspired by those teachers. They weren't paid much. \nI can remember that, during the Great Depression, teachers had to give \nup a certain percent of their paychecks in order to get them cashed. \nThey were dedicated teachers. That was their life. We had great \nteachers. We had good textbooks. We had discipline in the schoolroom.\n  My foster dad was not my natural father, but he raised me. He always \ntold me that if I got a whipping at school, I would get another \nwhipping when I came home. You will find most people of my age who \nreceived the same warnings from their parents. ``If you get a whipping \nat school, we are not going to the schoolhouse and beat up on the \nteacher. We are going to see you in the back room.'' We knew they meant \nbusiness. The parents supported the teachers. They supported discipline \nin the school. How can children learn and how can teachers teach unless \nwe have discipline in the schools? They can't do it. There has to be \ndiscipline in the schoolrooms.\n\n  There is something more than just money that the public school system \nin America needs today. And the public school system had better get its \nact together. Here I am, after 33 years of giving solid support to the \npublic school system in America, saying if there is another approach \nthat will work. Let's try it. We are not doing too well, as it is, \nplowing this same old furrow. We have to make some changes. I think we \nneed to start with the textbooks. Teachers ought to be paid well. Not \nall teachers are good teachers. Not all Senators are good Senators. \nPeople will take care of that sooner or later, hopefully. But not all \nteachers are good teachers. Yet, there are a lot of good teachers and \nthere are a lot of good students.\n  In speaking of good students, let me brag about my grandsons and \ngranddaughters. I have a grandson named Darius, who has a doctorate in \nphysics, a pretty tough subject, I would say. I doubt that his \ngrandfather could do that well. Darius has a degree, a Ph.D. in \nphysics. He was married recently. He married a young lady who is \nworking on her Ph.D. in physics at the University of Virginia. I have \nanother grandson who will receive his Ph.D. in physics just within a \nfew weeks, before the summer is over. I also have a son-in-law who is a \nPh.D. in physics. I could speak at great length about my sons-in-law \nand daughters and grandsons  and granddaughters. I will not do that \ntoday. But I have made my point. Those grandsons who have received \nPh.D.s in physics didn't get those Ph.D.s in physics watching \ntelevision. They didn't get those Ph.D.s reading trash. They read good \nbooks. They were taught by good teachers.\n\n  We have a lot of young people in this country who want to learn. I \nhave tried to encourage young people. My wife and I sent a young \nChinese orphan through college some years ago. We paid her tuition and \nfor her books because her mother had died of cancer. My wife and I knew \nthat the mother, who had discovered that she had terminal cancer, was \nvery concerned about her daughter. They were no relation to us. We \nhappened to get acquainted with them because we visited in those days, \na lot of restaurants in the area. At one point we had visited over 100 \nrestaurants in Northern Virginia and Maryland and the District of \nColumbia. We came to know this Chinese couple. When they were faced \nwith this tragedy, my wife and I said to the woman, ``We are going to \nsee that your child has a college education. If she continues to make \ngood grades in school and graduates with good character, and if she \nwill go to American University, we will see that she has her tuition \nand her books paid for.''\n  I chose American University because I had graduated from there with a \nlaw degree at the age of 45. I never intended to practice law. Nobody \ntold me to do it. I wanted the experience of being in a classroom with \nother law students. I went to law school for 10 years at night while \nserving in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. In fact, I \njust received my baccalaureate in political science from Marshall \nUniversity in Huntington, West Virginia, in 1994.\n\n  It never gets too late to learn. Solon, that great lawgiver who was \none of the seven wise men of Greece, said, ``I grow old in the pursuit \nof learning.'' One never gets too old to learn, and it is one of the \nbest ways to stay young--continue to study, to learn.\n  As I was saying yesterday, in 1969 I decided I wanted to establish a \nlittle recognition for the high school valedictorians in West Virginia. \nI came up with the idea of having a ``Robert C. Byrd Scholastic \nRecognition Fund.'' At that time I bought, out of my own pocket, a $25 \nsavings bond for each high school valedictorian. It only cost $18.75, I \nbelieve. But if and when it matured it would be worth $25. It wasn't a \ngreat amount of money. Nobody gave me a bond when I graduated from high \nschool. But I wanted to give a little recognition to the exceptional \nstudents in the high schools of West Virginia. I remember in one high \nschool there were seven students, I believe, who tied with a 4.0 \naverage. I gave seven $25 bonds to the students in that school. A \nlittle recognition like that is what our young people need. In recent \nyears, I have established a trust fund, and the bond is a $50 bond.\n  I often talk with the pages here. I try to take a little time out of \nmy day once in a while to tell them some good stories written by \nTolstoy or by other great authors, like Chaucer. We talk about \nwholesome, good works by great authors; a little encouragement along \nthat line. We never know when we toss a pebble in the water where the \nripples will end. They go on and on. We don't know where a little word \nof encouragement to these young people might take them.\n  Then a few years ago, I devised legislation that would provide for a \nnational scholarship of $1,500 to be awarded to the same number of \nstudents in each State as there are representatives from each State in \nthe House of Representatives and the Senate. The criteria require that \nthose children excel in scholastic studies. What they do as athletes \ndoesn't count. Neither do extracurricular activities.\n  There is a rightful place for sports. But the country's values are \nmade to stand on their heads when people revere a little too much the \nathletes while not recognizing the young people who are working in the \nlaboratories and in the libraries and in the schoolrooms poring over \ntextbooks day and night.\n  So what I am saying is, we ought to readjust our values. Let each \nhave its proper place. But no ball game ever changed the course of \nhistory. I do not say that disparagingly about ball games. We all like \nto watch them. But it is the young people who study science, math, \nalgebra, history, physics, these other disciplines; they are the people \nwho keep this country with its finely honed cutting edge in technology; \nthey are the people who put an American on the Moon.\n  Let's get back to basics. Let's recognize our young people and \nencourage them to study, to read good books, get away from the trash \nthat is on TV. It might be a good thing for some adults, too. Get off \nthat couch and quit watching so much of that junk. It is junk, most of \nit. I have seen some good movies on television. Alistair Cooke used to \nhave some great movies. But for the most part, TV programming is lousy. \nI am not sure, if my daughters were growing up today, that I would even \nhave a television set in my house. It is a great medium for good, but \nit is very destructive, the kind of programming of which we see all too \nmuch today.\n\n  I have taken some time this afternoon because I wanted to compliment \nTed Kennedy. I also wish to compliment Senator Coverdell and all those \nwho worked hard for the bill yesterday as well as those who opposed the \nbill. They all have at heart the welfare of the children of this \ncountry. I thought a little bit of my own homespun philosophy thrown in \nwhile no other Senator seeks the floor this afternoon, wouldn't hurt \neither.\n\n\n[[Page S3578]]\n\n\n     A Builder builded a temple,\n     He wrought it with grace and skill;\n     Pillars and groins and arches\n     All fashioned to work his will.\n     Men said, as they saw its beauty,\n     ``It shall never know decay;\n     Great is thy skill, O Builder,\n     Thy fame will endure for aye.''\n\n     A Teacher builded a temple\n     With loving and infinite care,\n     Planning each arch with patience,\n     Laying each stone with prayer.\n     None praised her unceasing efforts,\n     None knew of her wondrous plan,\n     For the temple the Teacher builded\n     Was unseen by the eyes of man.\n\n     Gone is the Builder's temple,\n     Crumbled into the dust;\n     Low lies each stately pillar,\n     Food for consuming rust.\n     But the temple the Teacher builded\n     Will last while the ages roll,\n     For that beautiful unseen temple\n     Was a child's immortal soul.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. President, earlier this month, I came to the floor to \nannounce that I was introducing legislation that would authorize the \nremoval of one of two dams on the Elwha River on the Olympic Peninsula \nin my state. I have always been skeptical about claims that dam removal \nwill have significant enough impact on my state's depleted salmon runs \nto justify their social and economic costs. I am willing to go along \nwith this limited experiment, however, provided that the removal or \nsignificant alteration of any dam on the Columbia-Snake River System \nwill not take place without Congressional approval.\n  As I mentioned in my statement, removing the lower Elwha Dam, a \nrelatively small, poorly maintained project, is a small price to pay \nfor the protection of the larger, more productive Columbia-Snake dams \nthat are the lifeblood of our Northwest economy and that in recent \nyears have come under attack by the Clinton-Gore Administration. I \nhoped that allowing the experiment of dam removal to move forward on \nthe Elwha River would be enough to satisfy the wishes of environmental \nextremists within this Administration. I should have known that when it \ncomes to environmental issues nothing is ever enough for this \nAdministration.\n  I was astounded by the criticism my bill has received. Big City \nnewspapers in Seattle and Portland have attacked the bill. The Sierra \nClub and other radical groups have attacked the bill. The \nAdministration has attacked the bill, as has my Democratic colleague \nfrom Washington state. Needless to say, this criticism is unfounded and \nshortsighted.\n  Let me remind my colleagues and anyone else who has an interest in \nthis subject what my bill does and does not do. It authorizes many \nmillions of dollars to remove the lower Elwha River Dam. It also \nprotects the local water supply in Port Angeles, and protects jobs at a \nlocal paper mill. As I have said repeatedly, I am skeptical that dam \nremoval will result in a significant increase in Elwha River salmon \nruns because: (1) many rivers on the Olympic Peninsula that have never \nbeen dammed are not teeming with salmon; (2) the salmon crisis \nchallenge our coastal rivers as well and yet none of those rivers have \ndams on them; and (3) Puget Sound is now home to endangered salmon \nruns, and, of course, there are no major dams on Puget Sound. Yet, \ndespite these reservations, I am still willing to go forward with this \nexperiment--it's worth the money to see the results on the ground.\n  But rural communities of Eastern Washington are so concerned about \nhow this legislation impacts their livelihood--many in Eastern \nWashington believe removal of the Elwha River dams is a precursor to \ndestroying dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers . So my bill contains \nprotections for these communities by requiring congressional approval \nfor any destruction, or significant modification, of dams on the \nColumbia and Snake Rivers.\n  I should point out that for several years federal agencies have taken \nunprecedented and unauthorized actions to alter significantly and limit \nthe effectiveness of these projects without any input from Congress. \nFor the most part, my bill allows these agencies to continue \nimplementing the present series of unauthorized actions. It simply \nprevents the executive branch from taking additional unilateral actions \nto modify these projects without Congressional approval. Why it should \nbe so controversial when Elwha dam removal will have been the subject \nof two bills in Congress, I fail to understand. Columbia and Snake \nRiver dam removal almost certainly requires Congressional approval now, \nunder present law--my bill just provides reassurances for eastern \nWashington.\n\n  I think this is also an appropriate time to remind all of those who \nare interested in this legislation--the Port Angeles community, Eastern \nWashington, environmentalists, the Administration, and Northwest \ncongressional officeholders--what I am for, and what I am not for in \nregards to management of our region's environment, and the Columbia/\nSnake Rivers system. Here are the things that I am for:\n  Salmon: On this one, everyone has the same goal--more salmon. We just \nhave different approaches for accomplishing this goal. I want more \nsalmon in our rivers, and I want solutions to our Northwest salmon \ncrisis that result in more salmon and less conflict among the region's \nvarious interests.\n  Clear, Scientific Conclusions: We need clear, scientific conclusions \nthat guide the region toward responsible salmon recovery measures.\n  Hydropower Production: Hydro is the cleanest and most cost-effective \nway to produce large amounts of electricity. Our hydropower asset is \nthe backbone of our Northwest economy. I don't want to lose that ``leg \nup'' that we have on other regions, nor do I want to resort to less \nenvironmentally friendly sources of power production to replace power \nlost because of dam removal.\n  Irrigation: Eastern Washington is America's pantry and refrigerator. \nOur farmlands produce dozens of different crops that feed the nation \nand the world. Before the dams, Central Washington had few farms, and \nwas mostly a dustbowl. Irrigated farmland has turned this part of the \nnation into some of the world's most productive farmland.\n  River Traffic: We get a large share of those crops to market by \nbarging them down the river. Studies show that it would take 700,000 \nmore trucks each year to get farm products to market if dam removal \neliminated barge traffic.\n  Recreation: I want people to have access to the river for boating, \nfishing and other recreation activities.\n  Protecting our Communities from Severe Floods: Without question, the \ndams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers were the single biggest reason \nwhy Portland and other Columbia River communities did not incur untold \nmillions of dollars in additional damages from the record winter rains \nour area has seen over the past three years.\n  A Clean Washington State: This is my most important goal--I want our \nState to have clean water, clean air, and a healthy environment for all \nof our citizens. My desire for a clean Washington state is why I have \nbacked the following environmental initiatives: Washington Wilderness \nBill; Double-hulled oil tankers in Puget Sound; Higher emission \nstandards for automobiles; and Spending taxpayer dollars on recreation \nsuch as the Mountains to Sound Greenway, the Cape Horn Trail, Alpine \nLakes, and other nature projects.\n  Given all the confusion and mischaracterizations of my bill, I think \nit is also important to talk about what I cannot support. Here is what \nI am not for:\n  Removing Dams on the Columbia-Snake: Why would anyone want to remove \nthe jewels of our Northwest economy? I will never support such efforts \nto cripple the world's most productive hydro system.\n  The Status Quo: During the past six years, we have spent $3 billion \non salmon recovery for the Pacific Northwest, most of it directed by \nthe Clinton Administration, and the crisis is even greater than it was \nwhen the Administration's efforts started.\n  Wasteful Spending of Taxpayer Dollars: Even now, our government \nspends $500 million on Columbia/Snake River salmon recovery, and most \nof that money is spent in ways that have not\n\n[[Page S3579]]\n\nproven to be successful. Until I passed legislation that ended an \noutrageous conflict of interest by which those who approved the \nspending of salmon recovery funds awarded most of the money to \nthemselves, the money was misspent. Now, at least the money goes to \nthose whom objective scientists feel will use it most effectively.\n\n  Solutions Dictated to the region from Washington, D.C.: Recently, the \nAdministration's top environmental staffer in Washington, D.C., Katie \nMcGinty, was in Oregon to discuss the government's salmon recovery \nplans for the Northwest. That is exactly the wrong way to approach this \nproblem. Why would our region put decisions about our economy, our \ncommunities, our future in the hands of someone 3,000 miles away? I \nbelieve we need to make these decisions, not Administration officials \nin Washington, D.C.\n  Rather than continuing the mindless attacks on my efforts to bring \nsome balance to this debate, I make the following offer to those who \ncriticize the Eastern Washington part of my Elwha package. If you are \nnot for dam removal and want to keep the dams intact, offer up better \nlegislative language that helps accomplish the goal of protecting our \nregion's economic future. My legislation may need improvement. I am \nanxious to listen to how others would reach my goal. If there is a \nbetter idea of how we can ease the concerns of Eastern Washington with \nregard to dam removal, I challenge the Administration, Senator Murray, \nand the Sierra Club, and other opponents of this legislation, to offer \na better alternative. I am interested in all proposals from those who \nwant to make a statement in favor of protecting the dams on the \nColumbia and Snake Rivers.\n  If you favor removing dams, however, and that is what is really \ndriving your opposition to my legislation, I think it is time for you \nto be honest with the Northwest and state your position clearly. The \nClinton Administration, and major environmental groups have sent mixed \nsignals on this issue. Many of them advocate extreme, unrealistic and \nunscientific salmon recovery measures; some do not. I think it is time \nfor these people to make their positions clear--do they want the dams \nremoved or effectively destroyed, or what? And if they continue to \ntemporize on this issue, I ask them to address the goals that I \ndiscussed earlier--salmon, irrigation, river traffic, hydropower \nproduction, recreation, and flood control--and tell me how they are \ncommitted to those traditional objectives, or if the possibility of \nattaining some salmon recovery goals is worth destroying most or all of \nthese other uses.\n  I want my Elwha Dam removal legislation fully discussed in committee \nand have requested hearings. In the past few weeks, the opponents of my \nanti-dam removal legislation have called me divisive, extremist, and a \nsalmon-hater. I am none of those things. I hope that my opponents, and \nparticularly the Administration and my Democratic colleagues from the \nNorthwest, will work together with me to craft legislation that removes \nthe lower Elwha River dam and protects Eastern Washington from those \nwho want to remove dams, stop irrigation, eliminate barge traffic, \nreduce hydropower, raise electric rates for families, restrict \nrecreation and push for dubious salmon solutions.\n  I welcome the opportunity for a full and reasoned debate on this \nsubject. It's time to put the rhetoric aside, the tired adjectives \naside, and the political smokescreens aside. It's time for everyone to \ncome clean, and make clear where they stand on this important issue. \nThis bill provides such an opportunity, and I look forward to receiving \nproposals from people throughout the region on how to improve my bill.\n  Ms. SNOWE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts).

Mr. President, I am pleased today to join with my \ncolleagues, Senator Collins from Maine and Senator Chafee from Rhode \nIsland, in the wake of yesterday's 97 to 0 vote by the Senate to pass \nSenate Concurrent Resolution 90 acknowledging the historic Northern \nIreland peace agreement reached just 2 weeks ago.\n  The agreement was produced through the hard work and patience and \ngoodwill of representatives of Northern Ireland's political parties, \nthe Prime Ministers of both Britain and Ireland, President Clinton, and \na man well known in this Chamber, the former Senator from Maine and \nformer majority leader, George Mitchell.\n  Senator Mitchell's skill, patience, and determination were largely \nresponsible for bringing opposing parties to the point where they were \nable to broker a historic agreement that offers the people of Northern \nIreland the opportunity to put an end to the longstanding fear and \nsuffering they have endured and to achieve a future that will be as \nbright as the spirit and potential of her extraordinary people.\n  In describing Senator Mitchell's pivotal role, one of the \nparticipants in the talks said, ``Here the United States sent one of \nits most able, skilled, talented, humble politicians, a supreme \ndiplomat, and frankly we didn't deserve him.''\n  Well of course, the people of Northern Ireland deserved his \nleadership that has provided, as we now know, the very best opportunity \nfor these talks to succeed.\n  After his retirement from the Senate, President Clinton invited \nSenator Mitchell to serve as a special economic adviser to Northern \nIreland. However, before he finished his efforts to attract business \ninvestment to Northern Ireland, Senator Mitchell was selected by both \nthe British and Irish governments to join a panel that recommended the \ndecommissioning of arms by the paramilitary factions in Northern \nIreland. He assumed responsibility for taking over the peace talks in \nJune of 1996.\n  Senator Mitchell faced tremendous obstacles in attempting to win the \ntrust of the parties involved in seeking an agreement. After all, \nprevious efforts resulted in failure. However, his patience, diligence \nand sincerity won them over. I know that Senator Mitchell's long \nexperience in the Senate helped prepare him for this unique challenge. \nAs one who served with him for more than 14 years in the Maine \nCongressional Delegation, I know he has an excellent ability to \nunderstand the concerns of whomever he is talking with--whether it is a \nconstituent from Bangor, or Augusta or Protestants and Catholics in \nNorthern Ireland.\n  Being an effective majority leader in the Senate, as we know, \nrequires one to be a good listener, to know when to compromise, to know \nwhen to coax and cajole, to know when to be patient and to know when to \nbe firm. All these qualities served George Mitchell well in this body \nand served him well in his most recent role which consumed 22 long, \nhard months of negotiations.\n\n[[Page S3580]]\n\n  This was by no means an easy task and often it must have seemed a \nhopeless one. However, the toll of the continuing violence in which \nover 3,200 people have died since 1969 led in the end to a deep \nyearning for peace. Individuals who grew up accustomed to violence were \ntired of going to funerals and watching their friends and family \nmembers die. Senator Mitchell led an effort that promised a way out--a \npath toward a future of peace and hope. In 1996 he proposed the \ndecommissioning of weapons be addressed during the talks and that \nparticipants make a commitment to nonviolence. That was the same year \nthat bombings took place in London and Manchester. Yet none of that \ndeterred Senator Mitchell. When the agreement was concluded, he \ncommented that ``no one wants to go back to the bitterness of the \npast.''\n  In his understated way, Senator Mitchell commented that ``This \nagreement is a reason to celebrate. But by itself, it guarantees \nnothing.'' I fervently hope that the agreement does indeed turn out to \nbe the harbinger of a new era in Northern Ireland. Ultimately it is the \nIrish people, voting on May 22nd, who will determine whether or not \nthis agreement will succeed. I am optimistic that it will.\n  The agreement is a landmark achievement. There will be a 108 seat \nassembly in which Protestants and Catholics share responsibility and \npowers. It will be elected this June, and I hope those who are chosen \nin that election will share the dream that Senator Mitchell cited when \nhe talked about the babies who were born in Northern Ireland on the \nsame day his new son Andrew was born 6 months ago.\n  Senator Mitchell said, ``I believe that they are entitled to the same \nchance in life that I want for my son. Peace, political stability and \nreconciliation are not too much to ask for. They are the minimum that a \ndecent civilized society provides.''\n  Eloquent words that I am sure touched the hearts of mothers and \nfathers on both sides of the historic divide that has scarred Northern \nIreland.\n  In the agreement Senator Mitchell helped to forge, in addition to the \nafore-mentioned assembly, there will be a North/South Ministerial \nCouncil which will provide an opportunity for ministers from the \nRepublic of Ireland to promote joint policymaking with the Northern \nIreland Assembly. This council will have the opportunity to implement \npolicies for the entire island of Ireland but only with the approval of \nthe Northern Ireland Assembly and the Irish Parliament in Dublin. This \nremarkable opportunity will allow the benefits of peace to be provided \nand to be shared by all the Irish people.\n  At the conclusion of the talks, Senator Mitchell said, ``It doesn't \ntake courage to shoot a policeman in the back of the head, or to murder \nan unarmed taxi driver.'' But he knows it does take courage to finally \nface down the horrors of sectarian violence, that it does take courage \nto realize that sometimes you have to make compromises for a future of \npeace.\n  When he first visited Belfast and saw a 30-foot wall dividing \nneighborhoods, I am sure he was reminded of the most famous wall of \nall, the Berlin Wall, which came down in 1989 when communism crumbled. \nJust 2 years before a new millennium, the wall in Belfast still divides \npeople. But this agreement may bring us one day closer to the day it, \ntoo, crumbles.\n  Senator George Mitchell has helped broker an agreement that will, I \nhope, be the spark for an era of peace and prosperity for Northern \nIreland and bring to a close one of this century's most tragic and \nstubborn conflicts. This agreement is one that should be celebrated for \nall it can bring to Northern Ireland. It should also be celebrated as \nproof of how one remarkable individual can make a difference for his \nfellow human beings. It is my fervent hope that the people of Northern \nIreland will long remember and celebrate the contributions of this one \nman, George Mitchell, toward providing them the key to a lasting peace.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. COLLINS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Maine is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased to join the senior Senator from \nMaine and our distinguished colleague from Rhode Island in paying \ntribute to the extraordinary accomplishments of a former Maine Senator, \nGeorge Mitchell, in bringing a new sense of hope, peace, and security \nto Northern Ireland.\n  Mr. President, it was Samuel Johnson who said in 1777 that knowledge \nthat you will be hanged in a fortnight does wonders to concentrate your \nmind. In 1998, former Senate majority leader, George Mitchell, proved \nthe truth of this aphorism by giving the Northern Ireland peace talks a \nGood Friday deadline, placing upon these negotiations the equivalent, \nif you will, of a sunset provision that left the parties with no \nalternative but finally to come up with a real solution.\n  This deadline accomplished its purpose wonderfully. It concentrated \ntheir minds wonderfully and led directly to the historic agreement. \nSome years ago, it scarcely seemed possible to imagine a Northern \nIreland in which children could grow up without fear of violence and \nbloodshed. Today, however, due to the extraordinary efforts of former \nSenator George Mitchell, this brighter future is not only imaginable--\nit is very nearly here.\n  That Senator Mitchell should possess such statesmanship and skill is, \nof course, no surprise to the people in my home State of Maine. Senator \nMitchell is greatly admired in this country for his work on behalf of \nthe citizens of Maine and indeed of all Americans. Today, however, the \npeople of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland--and peace-\nloving people everywhere--also owe Senator Mitchell a great debt for \nhelping to steer these talks to their successful conclusion. I do not \nbelieve that we would be celebrating this agreement without his heroic \nefforts.\n  It is my great hope that with his statesmanship and steady hand, \nSenator Mitchell has now made it possible to achieve a real \nreconciliation in Northern Ireland--and for the Irish people to go \nabout building their future together, in cooperation rather than in \nconflict.\n  I am very pleased that the Senate has passed overwhelmingly a \nresolution expressing our support for the Irish peace process and the \nbrighter future represented by this truly historic agreement.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I join the two distinguished Senators from \nMaine in paying tribute to the remarkable job that Senator George \nMitchell did in Ireland.\n  Senator Mitchell would be the first to say that success is not \nassured and that this is but the first step in a long, difficult \nprocess. But because of what Senator Mitchell did, the chances for \npeace have been greatly improved. And it truly was an extraordinary \njob, as the two Senators from Maine have outlined.\n  What patience George Mitchell showed, and what skills as a negotiator \nhe displayed.\n  I join in the sentiment that has been expressed that his success \nthere comes as no great surprise to those of us who knew him well. I \nserved in this Senate for the entire time that George Mitchell was here \nas Senator from Maine. I had the privilege of serving in not one but \ntwo committees, the Finance Committee and the Environment Committee, \nwith George Mitchell.\n  Indeed, as soon as he came to the Senate, he went on the Environment \nCommittee, and there I saw the tremendous abilities that he had. I can \nremember particularly the Clean Air Act, that George Mitchell was the \none most responsible for the reauthorization of that act, which \noccurred when George Mitchell was majority leader. Because of the \nguidance that he gave to all of us, that extraordinary reauthorization \ntook place.\n  I personally have deep ties to the State of Maine. My father was born \nin Maine. I have spent childhood summers there and adult summers \nlikewise. So I am very familiar with that State. I might point out that \nalthough Maine is large in size, it has a relatively small population, \nabout 1 million people. It is true that Maine is a very large State; it \nis as large as the rest of New England put together; but, as I said, it \nhas a relatively small population.\n\n[[Page S3581]]\n\n  Yet from that relatively small population of 1 million people have \ncome a series of extraordinary Senators. I look back, Mr. President, \njust in the ones I have had the privilege of knowing--Margaret Chase \nSmith, for example, who stands out as a beacon, particularly in \nconnection with the impeachment hearings and leading up to that of \nPresident Nixon. We remember clearly Ed Muskie, with whom I had the \nprivilege of serving on the floor of the Senate. He was active, ran for \nVice President, and gave one of the finest television speeches it has \nbeen my privilege to hear. And George Mitchell, whom we have just had \nthe privilege of extolling, and rightfully so. And Bill Cohen, who is \nnow our Secretary of Defense. And that great tradition of those \noutstanding Senators is carried on now by the two Senators from Maine, \nSenator Olympia Snowe and Senator Susan Collins.\n  It seems to me that the people of the State of Maine have great \nreason to be extremely proud not only of the Senators who have been \nbefore--and I listed some of them--but of their current Senators, \nSenators Snowe and Collins. It is a tradition that they are carrying \non. It is a remarkable one, Mr. President. As I thought about these \nremarks today and thought of the Senators I have known, I don't think \nyou could name a State that is as small in population as the State of \nMaine and has produced such outstanding Senators as those I just \nlisted.\n  Mr. President, in making this salute to George Mitchell, it seems to \nme we are saluting the people of the State of Maine, who have had such \ngood judgment. These are not all Republicans, and they are not all \nDemocrats. They are Republicans and they are Democrats, both. It has \nbeen a remarkable flow of outstanding servants, not just for the State \nof Maine but for the United States of America. I think all of us can be \nvery proud of those who have gone before and those who are now serving \nin the U.S. Senate from the State of Maine.\n  I thank the Chair, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I ask that I be allowed to proceed under the previous \norder for 60 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/24/senate-section/article/S3579-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3581]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL ORGAN DONOR WEEK\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, we are concluding National Organ Donor \nWeek. I think as we conclude our week here in the U.S. Senate, it will \nbe appropriate to pause for a moment and discuss the importance of this \nweek. This is one of the few times when the mere talking about an issue \nactually will, in fact, make a difference.\n  Why do we celebrate or why do we call attention to National Organ \nDonor Week? We do it because of a tragedy. The tragedy is that 7, 8, 9, \nin some weeks 10, of our fellow citizens die, die every week, because \nthere aren't enough organs available. They don't die because medical \nscience can't save them--medical science can save them. They die \nwaiting on a list, waiting for an organ to become available, and seven, \neight, or nine of them every week die.\n  What can be done about this? What we can do is talk about this issue. \nAs we talk about it, we can encourage people and their families around \nthe kitchen table to talk about it. Talking about it does make a \ndifference. Too many families, when faced with life's most horrible \ntragedy, which is the unexpected, usually sudden, loss of a loved one--\na daughter, son, mother, father, wife, husband--when they are asked by \nthe medical personnel at the hospital, ``Can we use your loved one's \norgans to help save someone else?'' they don't know what to say. They \nare faced with horrible trauma, something they have not expected. Too \nmany of our fellow citizens say no, not because they don't want to help \npeople, but they say no because they never thought of it.\n  I am convinced if people talk about this issue, if they talk among \nthe members of their family, that we will increase the number of \npeople, when they are faced with that horrible tragedy, to in fact say \nyes, and we will save lives. That is why we set aside a week as \nNational Organ Donor Week.\n  The ribbon I am wearing symbolizes that. One of our great pages who \nwas out in the hallway a moment ago asked me, ``Senator DeWine, what \ndoes that stand for?'' And I was able to tell her what this stands for. \nI think it is something that we want to share with all our fellow \nAmericans.\n  The Postmaster General and his committee will issue a postage stamp \nnext August to remind us all as we put postage on our letters, as we \nreceive letters, of how important it is to encourage people to become \norgan donors. I appreciate, Mr. President and Members of the Senate, \nhaving an opportunity to talk about this issue this afternoon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/24/senate-section/article/S3581-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3581-S3582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          STARR INVESTIGATION\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I have, with few exceptions, been very \ncareful not to comment about the ongoing investigation, the Starr \ninvestigation, the independent investigation--however you want to \ncharacterize it. I have refrained from doing that for many reasons.\n  I want to speak this afternoon about a very limited aspect of that \ninvestigation. I speak as a former county prosecuting attorney. I \nbring, I guess, to the Senate floor today that particular perspective. \nThis past week, there have been news stories--and again I emphasize \n``news stories;'' we don't know whether it is true or not true--news \nstories about the possible subpoena into the grand jury here in \nWashington of Secret Service agents. That has been the report.\n  Before I go any further, let me say I don't know what the facts are. \nI don't know whether that is true or not true; nor do I know what the \nfacts are underlying this investigation; nor do I know what Mr. Starr \nand his prosecutors have uncovered so far; nor, obviously, do I know \nwhat has occurred inside the grand jury. So my comments have to be \nqualified, and that fact has to be taken into consideration. My \ncomments must be understood in that light, and they are given in that \nlight.\n  Former President Bush was quoted in the Washington Post in what was \ndescribed as a private letter--it was in the Washington Post of \nThursday, April 23, yesterday. This was a letter that apparently was \nprivately sent to, directly to, the Secret Service Director, Lewis C. \nMerletti. And the Washington Post quotes the letter from former \nPresident Bush as saying, in part, the following: ```I can tell you, \nsir, that I am deeply troubled by the allegations swirling around there \nin Washington and what all this might do to the office I was so proud \nto hold,'' Bush wrote Merletti.\n\n  Continuing the quote: ``Regardless of all that, I feel very strongly \nthat the United States Secret Service agent should not be made to \nappear in court to discuss that which they might or might not have seen \nor heard.''\n  Mr. President, I hope that this issue about the potential subpoenaing \nof Secret Service agents into a grand jury, if it's true, to testify \nabout things they observed involving the President of the United States \nwould be resolved not in the courts and not by legislation. As a former \nprosecutor, I hope that this matter will be resolved by the sound, good \njudgment of the special prosecutor in this case. It should be resolved \nby the proper use, the measured use, the reasoned use of what we refer \nto as ``prosecutorial discretion.''\n  Mr. President, the prosecutor in our system has a unique role. I \ndon't know of any other country where the prosecutor has quite this \ndistinctive a role. The prosecutor, really, in many respects, is the \nmost important player in the criminal justice system. It is because of \nprosecutorial discretion the prosecutor must decide whether the \nevidence that has been gathered is sufficient to even summon a grand \njury, to even present a case to a grand jury. A prosecutor carries a \nvery, very heavy burden. It is a burden that is not carried by the \ndefense attorney, whose job it is to present the defense. It is a \nburden that is really not even carried by the judge, who is not the \nprincipal acting force because, under our system, nothing really \nhappens until a prosecutor says it happens. Nothing goes into\n\n[[Page S3582]]\n\nplay, so to speak. The game doesn't start until the prosecutor makes \nthat decision. So the burden on the prosecutor of summoning people to a \ngrand jury, of asking a grand jury to indict someone is an awesome, \nawesome responsibility.\n  Let me talk for a moment--and again, I am talking in the abstract \nwithout all of the information. At least from this Senator's \nperspective, I can express my point of view as to how I hope and expect \nthat prosecutorial discretion to be exercised in a very unique \nsituation when we are dealing with the Secret Service that is sworn to \nprotect the lives of the President of the United States and his family \nand when we are dealing with the President of the United States. \nFrankly, I am not concerned about an individual President; I am \nconcerned about the office, and I am concerned about what precedent we \nmay or may not be in the process of setting.\n  It seems to me that some reasonable standards would be as follows:\n  If the prosecutor has reasonable belief and reasonable evidence to \nindicate that a Secret Service agent has seen a direct violation of \ncriminal law, then I think it is clearly correct that that Secret \nService agent should be questioned, and it's clearly correct that that \nSecret Service agent should be brought into the grand jury. If a Secret \nService agent, it is alleged, is credible enough that the prosecutor \nbelieves that person should be called in and that he or she, as an \nagent, has seen in the course of duties, or outside of the course of \nduties, a direct violation of criminal law, I would find it very \ndifficult to make any kind of case that that person should not be \nbrought in and questioned and should not be compelled to testify in \nfront of a grand jury.\n  However, short of that set of facts, I believe there must be a \ncompelling reason to subpoena a Secret Service agent into a grand jury \non facts less than that. I think the reason for this, Mr. President, \nand the reason for my statement and the reason for this rationale is \nvery obvious. Again, we are not so concerned, really, about one \nPresident. What we ought to be concerned about, however, is the \nprecedent. We should not worry about what is in the best interest of a \nparticular President, but we should be very much concerned about what \nis in the best interest of our country. We look to the Secret Service \nto protect the President of the United States. It is not just in the \nPresident's interest that the President be protected; it is obviously \nin our national interest that the best security precautions be taken to \nprotect our President and his family.\n  If the President has to be concerned about the Secret Service being \ncalled in to a grand jury for less than compelling reasons, I think the \nconsequences are not good. I think you could make a very legitimate \nargument that that would, in fact, intrude on the very special \nrelationship that we expect the Secret Service agents to have with the \nPresident of the United States. Again, I do not know the facts of this \ncase, but I think it is important, and I felt compelled, frankly, to \noutline on the floor today at least what this Member of the Senate, as \na former prosecutor, thinks the proper use of prosecutorial discretion \nwould indicate. It is a very high standard. It is a very awesome \nresponsibility. It is a sacred trust. Whether it be in Greene County, \nOH, where I prosecuted cases, or whether he be the independent counsel \nappointed to look into allegations about the President of the United \nStates, we expect the same standard, we expect the same discretion, and \nwe expect the same responsibility.\n  In summary, in my opinion, if there has been evidence, substantial \nallegations, credible allegations that the Secret Service has seen \nsomething criminal, I have no problem; in fact, they should be brought \ninto a grand jury to help in the investigation. Short of that, there \nshould be a compelling reason for that person to be subpoenaed by the \nprosecutor. It is difficult to write legislation to deal with this. It \nis difficult for the courts to make decisions in regard to this. \nFrankly, the best person to make that decision is the independent \ncounsel. We should expect a great deal of discretion, a great deal of \ngood, common sense and judgment to be exercised by the independent \ncounsel before he or she exercises the awesome responsibility of \nsubpoenaing someone into the grand jury, particularly when we might be \ndealing with a Secret Service agent who would be testifying about what \nhe or she overheard in connection with the President of the United \nStates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/24/senate-section/article/S3581-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3582-S3583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE NATIONAL DUI STANDARD\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I will turn to another issue I have spoken \nabout on the floor a number of times. It is a question, in my opinion, \nof life or death. It is legislation that was approved by this body with \nan overwhelming--virtually a 2-to-1--vote. It is a matter presently \nsubject to the conference committee between the Senate and the House. \nThat issue, of course, is the issue of the .08 national DUI standard.\n  Members of the conference committee are working on this, or preparing \nto work on this matter, so I think my comments are timely and I think \nit is important to emphasize what this whole question is all about. I \nbelieve that one of the most important provisions of the Senate version \nof this service transportation bill was a provision that we approved by \nan overwhelming majority of 62 in favor and 32 opposed. That division, \nif this Senate approved it, would move our country forward to a \nnational .08 blood alcohol standard.\n\n  As my colleagues know, the House Rules Committee voted, I think very \nunfortunately, to stop the House from even considering this matter on \nthe House floor.\n  Mr. President, the facts are that if this does not become law, there \nwill be lives that will be lost that would have been saved if we would \nhave enacted this very reasonable national standard. The need for this \nlegislation will not go away, it will only increase.\n  How did such a clearly valuable measure, a life-saving measure, end \nup being blocked in the House and remain in such legislative peril \ntoday? I think one major reason is an effort outside this Congress, a \nwell financed campaign of what I believe are half-truths.\n  There was a full-page ad that appeared in the Washington Times before \nthe Rules Committee voted. It said that reducing the blood alcohol \nlimit to .08 would transform the average American into a lawbreaker. \nHere is what it said. I quote.\n\n       Reducing the limit to .08 would increase the number of law \n     violators by about 60 percent.\n\n  Mr. President, that is simply not true. That is wrong. It is not \ntrue. That is not what our bill does. Our amendment's purpose is not to \nget more people arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol \nbut, rather, to get more people to change their behavior so that fewer \nof them drive under the influence. One might be asked: How do we know \nthat would happen if our legislation passed? How do we know the results \nwill be fewer people actually arrested? The answer comes from our \nlargest State, the State of California.\n  In 1989, the last year California had a .10 blood alcohol content \nlimit, the highway patrol in California made 138,000 DUI arrests. In \nthe first year after the law was changed, the first year of the new .08 \nlimit, that number did jump almost 14 percent, to 158,000--138,000, \n158,000. But every year since then, Mr. President, that number has \ndeclined, all the way down to the last available figures, which were \n1997, and that figure was 91,014. Every year, it went down. That is the \nlowest level of DUI arrests in California since 1971. The efforts from \nour largest State could not be more clear.\n  A .08 standard does not turn Americans into lawbreakers. It does not \nturn the average American into lawbreakers. That is simply not true. It \ntakes impaired drivers off our streets.\n  Because precious lives depend on keeping impaired drivers off the \nroad, I promise that we will fight to keep this legislation in the \nfinal transportation bill. We will work to pass the legislation, \nbecause the facts are on our side. The facts tell a very disturbing \nstory.\n  During the recent break, when Members of the House and the Senate had \na chance to be in their home States, on April 13 the Washington Post \nhad an important, I think, revealing article laying out the facts.\n  Fact: According to a Boston University study, passing this \nlegislation would save, at a minimum, 500 lives a\n\n[[Page S3583]]\n\nyear. In fact, the majority says it is no more than between 500 and \n1,000. But even to take a minimum of this Boston University study, it \nwould be 500 families that would not be destroyed--500 families that \nwould not have to bury a son, or a daughter, or a loved one. That is \nthe fact. The only debate on this fact is, Is 500 lives a lot or a \nlittle? Is it worth doing something ``just to save'' 500 lives? I \nhappen to think it is. This is an easy question, I think, to answer. If \nby making a minor adjustment in the law--this is a minor adjustment--we \ncan save at least 500 lives across this country, I think it is very, \nvery important and very significant, and I think we ought to do it. \nThis legislation clearly would save at least 500 lives.\n  The second fact, again, as contained in this what I think is a very \nwell balanced argument: The blood streams of .08 drivers ``carry enough \nalcohol to measurably impair the symphony of neurological responses \nnecessary to drive a car well.'' This is the conclusion of the \nWashington Post article based on the current state of research and \nbased on their interviews with numerous experts, scientific experts, \nand medical experts in the field.\n  The third fact, again from this article: ``There is no question that \nnearly everything you can think of in terms of driving impairment is \nevident by a .08.'' That is a quote from UCLA Professor Herbert \nMoskowitz, the president of the Southern California Research Institute.\n  Science tells us that at .08, drivers have a lot of trouble dividing \ntheir attention between different visual stimuli. They also have \ntrouble processing new information as fast as driving requires. Mr. \nPresident, these are absolutely critical driving skills, crucial \nskills, when you are driving a car. At .08, a person's ability to do \nboth of these things is seriously impaired. That is a fact.\n  I had a chance to talk to an old friend of mine, ``KO'' Martin, who \nused to be a highway patrolman. In fact, ``KO'' and I prosecuted a \nnumber of cases together. He brought a number of cases to me while I \nwas a county prosecutor. He was a highway state trooper for many, many \nyears. He told this story. Once he pulled over a motorist who was so \nimpaired that ``KO'' had to literally carry him to the patrol car. He \nliterally couldn't get him there, he was so impaired. That particular \nmotorist tested at .05 blood alcohol level. Apparently, this man had \nreceived a promotion at work. They had just thrown a party for him. He \nwasn't used to drinking. He was clearly unable to drive a car after the \ndrinks he had. He tested .05. Clearly, he should not have been behind \nthe wheel. Someone who is so under the influence that he can't even \nwalk is not going to be able to react fast enough to drive a car \nsafely. That is the simple fact.\n  My fourth fact: According to a study published in the Journal of \nStudies on Alcohol, ``Drivers with readings between .08 and .05 had 1.4 \ntimes the risk of dying compared to people who had no alcohol in their \nblood. For people between .05 and .09, that risk was 11 times higher.''\n  Again, Mr. President, that is a fact, a tragic fact that costs human \nlives.\n  Another fact: There is evidence that a .08 standard will have a \ndeterrent effect on the whole range of impaired drivers. Allen F. \nWilliams of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety says, ``There \nseems to be a deterrent effect all across the whole range of blood \nalcohol concentrations, including the very high levels,'' the very high \nones all the way across on all drivers.\n  Mr. President, let me mention in this regard that this last fact \ndoesn't surprise me at all.\n  In fact, in 1982, as a member of the Ohio State Senate, I wrote a law \ntoughening Ohio's standard on impaired driving. That law went into \neffect March 17 of 1983. In the first year after our bill became law, \nwe saw an across-the-board change in public attitude towards driving \nunder the influence. The biggest impact our bill had was not who was \nbeing arrested but, rather, in the public perception of drunken \ndriving, the public perception of driving under the influence. It \nhappened all across Ohio. We saw auto fatalities from drinking and \ndriving going down. We sent a very strong message. That message could \nbe sent across this country in all 50 States by this Congress by \napproving what the Senate approved by a 2 to 1 margin, and that is to \ngo to a very reasonable standard of a .08 national blood alcohol \nstandard.\n  No matter where someone was driving, whether they were driving in \nyour great State of Kansas or my great State of Ohio, or Indiana or \nKentucky or Maine or California, they would have some assurance that \nthe law would be uniform; that when they put their child in a car, got \nbehind the wheel, that whatever State they were in, the standard would \nbe at .08.\n  America needs this legislation, and I will make sure we keep \nreturning to this issue until we get the job done. I urge the \ntransportation bill conferees to consider these basic facts and to \ninclude what the Senate did, and that is the .08 legislation in the \nfinal transportation bill.\n  (The remarks of Mr. DeWINE pertaining to the introduction of S. 1987 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/24/senate-section/article/S3582-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ELECTION OF LARRY DOBY INTO THE BASEBALL HALL OF FAME\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to what I \nbelieve is a truly excellent decision by the baseball Hall of Fame's \nVeterans Committee. On the 3rd of March, one of the true greats of \nbaseball history, Larry Doby, was elected to the baseball Hall of Fame. \nI think we all know the story, at least the outline of the story. On \nJuly 5, 1947, Larry Doby became the first African American to play in \nthe American League--just 3 months after Jackie Robinson had broken \nbaseball's color barrier in the other league, the National League.\n  The legendary Bill Veeck was at that time, of course, the owner and \nhad control of the Cleveland Indians. Veeck saw that Larry Doby was \nleading the Negro National League with a .458 batting average and had \nat that time 13 home runs. He and Doby, Veeck and Doby, made the \nhistoric and courageous decision to break the color barrier in the \nAmerican League.\n  It is sometimes difficult for us to remember what the situation was \nback in 1947 or to really truly understand it. The Jackie Robinson \ndecision was still highly controversial. It was really at this point by \nno means self-evident that support for integrated baseball would take \nhold. Larry Doby and Bill Veeck made an act of faith in America's \nfuture and in the American people.\n  In his autobiography, Bill Veeck wrote that he ``received 20,000 \nletters, most of them in violent, sometimes obscene protest.'' But then \nhe went on to say, ``When Doby hit a tremendous home run to put us \nahead in the fourth game of the Series, it could be observed that none \nof the people who were on their feet cheering seemed at all concerned \nor even conscious of Larry Doby's color.''\n  Mr. President, it took courage for Larry Doby to get up to the plate, \nbut once he got there his record of accomplishment silenced his \ncritics. In 1948, his first full season, he led the Indians to victory \nin the World Series batting .318 and hitting a game-winning home run. \nHe was named to the All-Star Team every single year from 1949 to 1955. \nIn 1952, he led the American League in home runs and runs scored. Two \nyears later, in 1954, he led the league in home runs and RBIs.\n  He left the Indians in 1956 to play for the Chicago White Sox, and \nlater the Detroit Tigers. He retired in 1959, but returned to baseball \nin 1978 to manage the White Sox--becoming only the second African-\nAmerican manager in the history of the major leagues. The first, I \nmight add, was the great Frank Robinson--who managed the Indians from \n1975 to 1977, and who played as a player, of course, for the Cincinnati \nReds and then for the Baltimore Orioles.\n  Mr. President, I join all Ohioans--and indeed all lovers of baseball \nnationwide--in congratulating Larry Doby on this well-deserved \nrecognition of a truly outstanding career.\n  (Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire assumed the Chair.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/24/senate-section/article/S3583-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3583-S3584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           JOSELIN HERNANDEZ\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, we observe, this month, National Child \nAbuse Prevention Month. On this occasion, I would like to give the \nSenate an\n\n[[Page S3584]]\n\nupdate about the fate of a little girl about whom I testified \npreviously before the Senate Finance Committee.\n  In my testimony on October 8, 1997, I told the story of a little 2-\nyear-old girl from Ventura County, CA, a little girl by the name of \nJoselin Hernandez. This poor little girl was beaten, bitten and slowly \ntortured to death by her parents. She first was taken into foster care \nwhen she was 6 weeks old, hospitalized with six fractured ribs, broken \nlegs and burns to her hands and feet. She was also malnourished and \ndehydrated. The little girl, little Joselin, was placed at that time \nwith her grandmother. But when her grandmother died, Joselin was \nreturned to her parents, and 3 months later, as I testified before, she \nwas dead.\n  Now, after a 6-week trial, Joselin's father has been convicted of \nfirst-degree murder and torture, and her mother of second-degree \nmurder. The judge sentenced Joselin's father to life in prison. He will \nbe eligible for parole in 42 years. The judge sentenced her mother to \n15 years to life, and she will be eligible for parole in 13 years. The \njudge, after listening to the evidence, after listening to this \nhorrible story, this horrible tragedy, told Joselin's father:\n\n       I have been in court with literally scores of people--some \n     brutal, sadistic killers, but none of them were treated by \n     society as Joselin was treated by her father.\n\n  Joselin's mother's attorney asked the judge to take into \nconsideration the mother has lost two children--Joselin and a 3-year-\nold son who was placed in foster care. The judge replied, I think \ncorrectly:\n\n       She hasn't lost two children. She killed one and lost the \n     other. And it seems the reason she did it was not a pretty \n     one. She was getting what she needed, so it was acceptable. \n     It was not unacceptable enough for her to lift a hand to make \n     it end.\n\n  These killers have been brought to justice. We, as Americans, I don't \nthink, can truly believe that justice has been done when any child has \nbeen left to the mercy of people like this. The bill that we passed--my \ncolleague in the chair helped pass last year--to reform the foster care \nsystem in this country to help liberate children from abusive parents, \nis just the beginning, just the beginning of a strong struggle to \nreduce the number of lives lost in this kind of senseless tragedy.\n  We need to move children into safe, stable, loving and permanent \nhomes. Just about a year ago, on April 30, 1997, I told the Senate \nabout another little girl, and her story has a happier ending. This is \na little Ohio girl. She was less than 4 months old when she was \nhospitalized in critical condition, suffering from shaken-baby \nsyndrome. When she was released from the hospital she went to her first \nfoster home. By the time this little girl was 4, she had been shuttled \nthrough eight separate foster homes in 4 short years of life.\n  By the time she finally got out of foster care, she became hysterical \nwhenever she saw a full black garbage bag. Why? That's because that was \nthe luggage that was used whenever she had to be moved from one foster \nhome to another. They always put her belongings in a plastic garbage \nbag. She knew when she saw that that she was going to be moved again.\n  Last week this little Ohio girl finally got permanent adoptive \nparents. That is what she and every child in this country needs and \ndeserves. I'm sure all my colleagues join me in wishing her well in her \nnew home and her healing process. I'm sure all of my colleagues also \njoin me in pledging that we will redouble our common efforts to help \nall of America's children find safe, stable, loving and permanent \nhomes.\n  In short, and in conclusion, the bill that we passed last year is \ndoing some good. It will continue to do good. But it is only the first \nstep. As long as there are half a million children in this country, as \nthere still are today, who are in foster care at any one given moment, \nas long as children are in some abusive homes, as long as we continue \nto lose children every week who are killed by their caregivers, this \nSenate and legislative bodies across this country must remain vigilant. \nWe must continue to examine this issue. We must do all that we can to \nmake sure that every child has what we all want for our own children, \nand that is a permanent and loving home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/24/senate-section/article/S3583-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   APPOINTMENT BY THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A bill to equalize the minimum adjustments to prices for \nfluid milk under milk marketing orders; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n                      THE DAIRY REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nseeks to restore fairness to the nation's dairy system--fairness that \nhas long been missing, particularly in the Upper Midwest and especially \nin my home state of Minnesota.\n  When Minnesotans are asked to name my state's leading industries, \nagriculture will certainly be at or near the top of most every list. \nFarming and farm-related business plays a critical role in Minnesota's \neconomy. One out of every four Minnesota jobs is tied in some way to \nagriculture, and 25% of the state's economy is dependent upon farmers \nand agri-business, most of it focused in the dairy industry.\n  What many people do not realize is that, despite those statistics, \nour state's dairy industry is in real trouble.\n  Since dropping to number five in milk production--behind Wisconsin, \nCalifornia, Pennsylvania, and New York--Minnesota has been slowly but \nsteadily losing its clout among the top dairy states in the nation. We \nhave lost over 10,000 dairy farms in just the last decade, and today, \ndairy farms are drying up at a rate of about three every single day. \nMilk production has dropped significantly as a result--nearly 20% in \nthe last decade.\n  What makes this especially troubling is that much of the decline in \nMinnesota's dairy industry can be traced\n\n[[Page S3586]]\n\ndirectly to farm policies mandated outside of Minnesota's control, in \nWashington. And the outdated federal milk marketing orders program is a \nserious part of our dairy problems.\n  The Midwest is one of the best places in the country for dairy. It \nshould be growing and expanding in the Midwest, but because of the \nGovernment's outdated policies and programs, it is hurting and killing \nthe dairy industry in the Midwest.\n  The milk marketing orders is yet another example of a well-\nintentioned scheme dreamed up by Washington bureaucrats that has gone \nseriously awry. Instead of helping Minnesotans, the milk orders \nactually hurt the state's economy and penalizing its taxpayers, while \nbenefiting dairy farmers outside the Midwest.\n  The problem can be traced back to 1937, when Congress enacted the \n``Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act.'' The legislation was created \nto encourage the milk production near the nation's major population \ncenters and set a minimum price paid to dairy farmers for Class I milk. \nThat federal ``nudge'' was necessary in some instances, because without \nrefrigerated trucks, fluid milk could not be transported over long \ndistances.\n  In 1985, as part of that year's farm bill, Congress expanded the milk \norders program to aid the dairy industry outside the Midwest by \nincreasing the minimum price for Class I milk based on a ridiculous \nformula.\n  This basically helps producers outside the Upper Midwest, while \nmaking dairy production less profitable for producers inside the Upper \nMidwest region.\n  That is not because of anything that the farmers are doing, their \nproductivity, the land, the climate, whatever. The only reason for the \ndecline, again, is because of an outdated Federal dairy policy.\n  This process is unfair and archaic. Above all, it is opposite in \nevery way to the free market.\n  The Upper Midwest dairy industry, one of the most efficient in the \nworld, is only asking for a fair shake in this process. And so, Mr. \nPresident, the legislation I introduce today will amend one of the most \ninequitable components of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1937--the \nClass I milk price differentials.\n  USDA is currently in the process of reforming its system of Federal \nMilk Marketing Orders. Unfortunately, the Class I differentials \nproposal released earlier this year was disappointing. Two options have \nbeen offered under the proposal. Option ``1A''--the status quo option--\nis plainly unacceptable. Option ``1B'' does take a small step in the \nright direction, but it does not go far enough. However, a small step \nfor reform is most certainly preferable to a step backward as ``1A'' \nwould do.\n  As short-term progress, I support Option ``1B'' because, as I have \nsaid, it is the only option USDA is currently considering that makes a \nmove toward fairness in federal dairy policy. My bill would continue \nthe reform beyond the small gains for equity that ``1B'' establishes. \nWe cannot allow ourselves to become satisfied until we secure \nsubstantive federal dairy reform.\n  Common sense would tell us that USDA's proposal of a small step \ntoward market-policy is the compromise position for dairy reform. \nHowever, as you can imagine, there has been the typical, standard-fare \noutcry against any sort of reform--even the minimal reform that was \noffered in the form of Option ``1B.'' And surely that is little more \nthan an acknowledgment on the part of USDA that equity and fairness \nreally do matter in national dairy policy.\n  USDA has explicitly expressed its preference for ``1B.'' However, my \noptimism is guarded, given the fact that ``the status quo option'' is \nbeing seriously considered as a measure of reform.\n  It is all too likely that they may move us a step backward and call \nit reform. There is every reason to believe that USDA will succumb to \nthe pressure of maintaining the unjustifiable status quo.\n  So many constituencies have been built up around this antiquated \ndairy pricing policy, and now to try to put any fairness into the \nsystem we are going to have these outcries from across the country.\n  So, in addition to the objective of shaping the policy debate beyond \nshort-term fixes, I believe that we in the Upper Midwest must now \nproceed with progressive dairy reform in the event we once again, find \nourselves standing alone in the name of justifiable, equitable, dairy \npolicy.\n  The Dairy Reform Act of 1998 establishes a uniform Class I price \ndifferential of $1.80 for each marketing area subject to an order. The \nnewly proposed 11 Federal Milk Marketing Orders will remain in place to \nprovide necessary over order premiums that would raise the $1.80 in \nsome areas. This legislation directs us toward market-oriented reform \nbecause it removes the arbitrary, artificial price structure and its \nresulting interference with the market itself.\n  As far as dairy policy is concerned, we're at a pivotal juncture. The \ngroundwork is being laid for a national patchwork of regional compacts. \nRoughly half the country has either passed enabling compact \nlegislation, is debating such legislation, or is involved in the \nNortheast Interstate Dairy Compact. We must either decide to support a \nnational system, or regionalize. As I've said, USDA's Option ``1B'' is \na small step in the right direction for dairy policy. The Dairy Reform \nAct brings us closer yet to substantive reform. The compact \nalternative, on the other hand, is not reform--it is retreat. It is \nanti-market and anti-consumer, by definition.\n  There is no substantive, equity-based justification to support random \nClass I differentials. In fact, USDA's current federal marketing order \nsystem was deemed ``arbitrary and capricious'' by a Federal district \ncourt judge late last year.\n  That is the fourth time that the courts have come out and said that \nthe current dairy policies in this country are, again, arbitrary and \ncapricious. So, bottom line, it means they are unfair, they are \nantimarket, they are anticonsumer.\n  So, the case brought against USDA has been in the courts for 7 years, \nand the judge's ruling was no less than the fourth such proceeding in \nthe history of the case. Given the outrageously drawn-out history of \nthe case, the judge decided not to grant USDA's request to justify the \npricing scheme.\n  However, the ruling has been stayed now pending the appeal of the \ndecision of the eighth circuit. After the courts have been cleared on \nthe marketing order system, why is the USDA appealing? Why are they \nappealing to keep in place a system that the courts have ruled four \ntimes is basically unfair? Why don't they focus their efforts on \nchanging the system, as the court has required, but, most important, \nchanging the system to make sure that it is fair, that it does not \ndiscriminate against one part of the country over another, that it does \nnot pick winners and losers, and it does not step on the necks of \nfarmers in the Midwest?\n  Under the current Federal order marketing system, the Government is \npicking winners and picking losers. This system of nonuniform \ndifferentials is inherently unfair, and I welcome debate of other dairy \npolicy proposals for reform as well.\n  Mr. President, finally, I just want to say the Dairy Reform Act of \n1998 is simply a call to fairness, just fairness, in dairy policy. It \nis a statement in no uncertain terms that we who represent upper \nMidwest dairy farmers are going to fight for equitable reform, for \nmarket-driven policy. I urge my colleagues to take a look at it, to say \nwhat is fair. Why not have everybody on a level playing field? Why not \ngive farmers all over the country the same opportunity for success or \nfailure? Why not get consumers market-driven prices, rather than unfair \nFederal policies aimed at the Midwest?\n  So, I urge my colleagues to give their support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire (for himself, Mr. Helms, and Mr. \n        Faircloth):\n  S. 1983. A bill to amend section 991(a) of title 28, United States \nCode, to require certain members of the United States Sentencing \nCommission to be selected from among individuals who are victims of a \ncrime of violence; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 u.s. sentencing commission legislation\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, this is National Victim \nRights Week and today I am introducing a bill to amend section 991(a) \nof\n\n[[Page S3587]]\n\ntitle 28, United States Code, to require certain members of the United \nStates Sentencing Commission to be selected from among individuals who \nare victims of a crime of violence.\n  Each year, Mr. President, about 40 million Americans are victimized \nby crime. Yet, all too often, the voices of those victims are lost in \nthe criminal justice system. In fact, it often seems that the voices of \nthose who commit crimes are heard with greater attentiveness by our \ncriminal justice system than are the voices of the victims of crime. As \nPresident Reagan's Task Force on Victims of Crime stated in its 1982 \nreport, ``the criminal justice system has lost its essential balance.''\n  One response to this problem has been S.J. Res. 44, a constitutional \namendment to protect the rights of victims of crime, which has been \nintroduced in this Congress by Senators Kyl and Feinstein. I am proud \nto be a cosponsor of that crime victims constitutional amendment.\n  The bill that I am introducing today, Mr. President, is another \nresponse to the problem of the under representation of victims' rights \nin our criminal justice system. My bill, which my distinguished \ncolleagues from North Carolina, Senators Faircloth and Helms, are \ncosponsoring, would reserve two of the seven seats on the United States \nSentencing Commission for victims of violent crime.\n  Mr. President, the United States Sentencing Commission is an \nindependent entity within the judicial branch that establishes \nsentencing policies and practices for the Federal courts. This includes \nsentencing guidelines that prescribe the appropriate form and severity \nof punishment for offenders convicted of Federal crimes.\n\n  The U.S. Sentencing Commission is composed of seven voting members \nwho are appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the \nSenate, for six-year terms. The Commission also includes two non-voting \nmembers. Of the seven voting members of the Sentencing Commission, \nthree must be Federal judges.\n  Under my bill, two of the four seats on the Sentencing Commission \nthat are not filled by Federal judges would be reserved for victims of \na crime of violence or, in the case of a homicide, an immediate family \nmember of such a victim. My bill utilizes the existing statutory \ndefinition of a crime of violence that is found in section 16 of title \n18 of the United States Code.\n  Mr. President, my bill preserves, to a large extent, the discretion \nof the President in making decisions about whom to nominate to seats on \nthe Sentencing Commission. Under my bill, the President remains free to \nseek individuals who have professional expertise in the criminal \njustice field, so long as they also are victims of crime. Sadly, Mr. \nPresident, I do not believe that the President would have much \ndifficulty identifying such qualified individuals.\n  Mr. President, six of the seven voting seats on the Sentencing \nCommission are vacant. Let's give victims of crime a voice by requiring \nthat two of those vacant seats must be filled by Americans who have \nbeen victimized by violent crime.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1983\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. COMPOSITION OF UNITED STATES SENTENCING \n                   COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 991(a) of title 28, United States \n     Code, is amended by inserting after ``same political party.'' \n     the following: ``Of the members who are not Federal judges, \n     not less than 2 members shall be individuals who are victims \n     of a crime of violence (as that term is defined in section 16 \n     of title 18) or, in the case of a homicide, an immediate \n     family member of such a victim.''.\n       (b) Applicability.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply with respect to any appointment made on or after \n     the date of enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG:\n  S. 1984. A bill to prohibit the transfer of a handgun by a licensed \ndealer unless the transferee states that the transferee is not the \nsubject of a restraining order with respect to an intimate partner of \nthe transferee, a child of the transferee, or a child of an intimate \npartner of the transferee; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n            brady handgun violence protection act amendments\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nadd a provision to the Brady Handgun Background Check Form to enforce \nthe prohibition that persons under a restraining order for harassing, \nstalking or threatening an intimate partner or child cannot purchase a \ngun.\n  The Background Check Form, used by law enforcement and gun dealers to \nenforce the Brady Handgun Violence Protection Act, currently requires a \npurchaser to answer questions on whether he or she falls into one of \nthe categories prohibited from purchasing a gun. The form asks whether \nthe purchaser has been convicted of a felony, has been declared \nmentally defective or been committed to a mental institution, is an \nillegal alien, fugitive from justice or an illegal user of drugs--all \nof which would disqualify the person from lawfully purchasing a gun. \nHowever, there is one very important disqualification not listed on \nthis form. The 1994 Crime Act prohibits a person under a restraining \norder for harassing, stalking or threatening an intimate partner or the \nchild of that partner from purchasing a gun. But this disqualification \nis not on the Brady Background Check Form--in fact it is the only \ndisqualification not on the Form.\n  Dealers, law enforcement agencies, and purchasers rely on the form to \nprovide notice as to who is prohibited from purchasing a handgun, and \nlaw enforcement agencies use the form as a guide in making background \nchecks. This omission on the Brady Form means persons under restraining \norders for harassing, stalking and threatening their partners and their \npartner's children can more easily obtain a gun even though it is \nillegal for them to do so. My legislation is necessary because all \nchanges to the form are required to be done by legislation rather than \nby regulation or order.\n  This simple change to the Brady Check List can mean the difference \nbetween life and death for women and children across America. Domestic \nviolence in the United States remains the number one threat of injury \nto women ages 15 to 44, and hundreds of thousands of women are forced \nto obtain restraining orders to protect themselves and their children \nfrom abusive partners every year. More than twice as many women are \nshot and killed each year by their husbands or intimate partners than \nby strangers.\n  Mr. President, Congress has already recognized that persons who are \nunder restraining orders for harassing, stalking, and threatening their \nspouses, partners, and children should not be able to buy a gun. This \nsimple bill will help to enforce this important prohibition to keep \nguns out of the hands of those who pose a real and serious threat to \ntheir partners and children. Every year we see tragic incidents of \nvictims of domestic violence who have obtained restraining orders only \nto be murdered by their partner.\n  I hope you will join me and support this worthy bill to protect \nvictims of domestic violence from the dangers that follow when their \nabusive partner gains access to a gun.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1984\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PROHIBITION OF THE TRANSFER OF A HANDGUN BY A \n                   LICENSED DEALER UNLESS THE TRANSFEREE STATES \n                   THAT THE TRANSFEREE IS NOT THE SUBJECT OF A \n                   RESTRAINING ORDER WITH RESPECT TO AN INTIMATE \n                   PARTNER OF THE TRANSFEREE, A CHILD OF THE \n                   TRANSFEREE, OR A CHILD OF AN INTIMATE PARTNER \n                   OF THE TRANSFEREE.\n\n       Section 922(s)(3)(B) of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of clause (vi); and\n       (2) by adding ``and'' at the end of clause (vii); and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(viii) is not subject to a court order that--\n       ``(I) restrains the transferee from harassing, stalking, or \n     threatening an intimate partner of the transferee or child of \n     such intimate partner or transferee, or engaging in other \n     conduct that would place an\n\n[[Page S3588]]\n\n     intimate partner in reasonable fear of bodily injury to the \n     partner or child;\n       ``(II) was issued after a hearing of which the transferee \n     received actual notice, and at which the transferee had the \n     opportunity to participate; and\n       ``(III)(aa) includes a finding that the transferee \n     represents a credible threat to the physical safety of such \n     intimate partner or child; or\n       ``(bb) by its terms explicitly prohibits the use, attempted \n     use, or threatened use of physical force against such \n     intimate partner or child that would reasonably be expected \n     to cause bodily injury;''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Biden, Mr. Leahy, Mr. DeWine, and \n        Mr. Sessions):\n  S. 1985. A bill to amend Part L of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe \nStreets Act of 1968; read twice and placed on the calendar.\n\n\n               the care for police survivors act of 1998\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, during the week of May 12, the country will \nhonor once again those law enforcement and public safety officers who \nhave died in the line of duty. It is entirely fitting that we do this. \nAnd as we remember those who have fallen in defense of the public \nsafety, we should also do all we can to comfort and assist the families \nand loved ones they have left behind. The bill I rise to introduce \ntoday, the Care for Police Survivors Act of 1998, will help ensure that \nwe are doing so.\n\n  First, this bill, which was introduced in the House as H.R. 3565, \nwill strengthen programs available to the families of slain police \nofficers. For instance, the bill will allow groups like Concerns for \nPolice Survivors, more commonly referred to as COPS, to increase and \nimprove their services to these families. Second, this bill provides \nauthority to the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance to spend \nno less than $150,000 out of the Public Safety Officers' Benefits \nprogram to support and enrich national peer support and counseling \nprograms for families of police officers lost in the line of duty.\n  Second, this act will expedite the process of handling cases pending \nbefore the Public Safety Officers' Benefits Office by allowing the \nexpenditure of PSOB program funds on outside hearing officers. \nCurrently, survivors of fallen police officers have to wait entirely \ntoo long to obtain an appeal hearing for the denial of benefits. By \nenacting this bill, we will make the process of helping these families \nless burdensome.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senators Biden, Leahy, DeWine, and \nSessions in introducing this bill in the Senate. On Tuesday of this \nweek, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed H.R. 3565 by a \n403 to 8 vote. I urge my colleagues to join me in expeditiously passing \nthis legislation to demonstrate our tremendous gratitude and support \nfor these heroes and their families.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DeWINE (for himself and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 1987.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Child \nProtection and Sexual Predator Punishment Act of 1998. The purpose of \nthis legislation is to address the problem of child molesters and \npedophiles who use computers, and the Internet in particular, to commit \ncrimes of sexual abuse and exploitation against our most vulnerable \ncitizens--our children. I appreciate Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison \njoining me in this important effort.\n  The Child Protection and Sexual Predator Punishment Act is a \ncomprehensive bill that combats the growing problem of criminals who \nmisuse our information superhighway to contact children for purposes of \nsexual abuse and exploitation. Not only does this legislation send a \nstrong message that America will not tolerate the abuse of its \nchildren, it will also make it easier to put these heinous criminals \nout of commission.\n  Mr. President, my wife Fran and I have eight children--ages 6 to 30. \nThere is nothing more important to parents than protecting their \nchildren from harm. There was a time, not so long ago, when parents \ncould feel secure when their children were at home or in a library--\nthat their child would at least be safe from danger in those places. \nBut along with the tremendous benefit of the Internet, we have also \nunfortunately, unintentionally invited strangers into our homes, and \nsometime our children's rooms, just because computers may be located \nthere. Strangers who sometimes have the immoral and criminal intent to \nlure our kids into deviant sexual, abusive, and illegal activity right \nunder our noses.\n  Not long ago, a 47-year-old Ohio man used the Internet to entice a \n12-year-old girl in New Jersey to make pornographic videos of herself. \nHe posed on-line as a 15-year-old, who promised that he would forward \ncopies of the pornographic video to her favorite music band members. \nShe made four sexually explicit videos before the man was apprehended \nby authorities. There are literally hundreds of these examples, and \nmany even worse, occurring every day in America. It has become \ncommonplace to hear about a child being lured across the country via \nthe Internet by a pedophile.\n  I hope, and believe, that through this legislation we can begin to \nrestore the peace of mind parents should have when their children use \nthe Internet at school, at the library, or in their home.\n  This bill will protect children from cyber-stalkers and porn peddlers \nby prohibiting contacting of a minor on the Internet for the purpose of \nengaging in illegal sexual activity. It prohibits knowingly \ntransferring obscene materials to a minor over the Internet. In \naddition, the maximum penalty is doubled for enticing a minor to travel \nacross State lines for illegal sexual activity. Using a computer to \npersuade a minor to engage in prostitution or a sexual act will carry a \nmaximum sentence of 15 years, and a minimum sentence of 3 years.\n  Also, law enforcement is given the tools to quickly and effectively \ninvestigate sex and kidnaping crimes involving children. Pretrial \ndetention is provided for Federal sex offenders, and administrative \nsubpoenas are allowed in certain child exploitation investigations. In \naddition, the bill clarifies that kidnaping investigations do not \nrequire waiting 24 hours--they can be initiated immediately. Further, \nFederal jurisdiction is provided in kidnaping cases where a facility or \nmeans of interstate or foreign commerce is used.\n  Mr. President, a person today can get almost anything on the \nInternet. With this bill, we are trying to make sure that they cannot \nget our children.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, technology has opened many doors for \ncommunications and information sharing. Unfortunately, criminals have \nfound new ways to use the innovations to hurt children.\n  Today I am introducing with Senator DeWine the Child Protection and \nSexual Predator Punishment Act of 1998. Our bill will give law \nenforcement the necessary tools to stop crimes against children, \nespecially those initiated through the Internet and commercial on-line \nservices.\n  Along with the proliferation of users of on-line services, our nation \nhas seen a rise in crimes committed against children by sexual \npredators on-line. Every day, pedophiles stalk children through the \ncomputer, transmitting pornography to them and enticing them to \nparticipate in illegal activity. In some of the most tragic instances, \nthese criminals have convinced children to travel long distances to \nmeet them, only to face horrendous abuse by their ``hosts.''\n  In response to the growing number of these crimes. Congress has and \nwill surely continue to appropriate funds to allow collaboration among \nFBI and state and local law enforcement to develop effective means to \nprevent innocent children from being exploited. In the past, funds have \nbeen used to train officers to detect cybercrime, pursue sexual \npredators and establish child sexual exploitation cyber-squads of state \nand local officers.\n  But the responsibility of Congress is not only to provide necessary \nresources. We have an unfinished responsibility to give officers the \nlegal tools they need to stop these crimes before they happen. In \naddition, Congress must send the unequivocal message to criminals who \ndare to prey on children that such crimes will not be tolerated.\n  As children and adults increase their use of computers and online \nservices, this problem will only get worse. Only through aggressive \nenforcement will\n\n[[Page S3589]]\n\nwe be able to combat this rise in tragic crimes against our most \nvulnerable citizens--children.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself and Mr. Shelby):\n  S. 1986. A bill to restructure the regulation of the Federal Home \nLoan Bank System; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n\n\n      the federal home loan bank system restructuring act of 1998\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Federal \nHome Loan Bank System Restructuring Act of 1998'' to eliminate the last \nvestiges of a bureaucratic structure which contributed to the downfall \nof the savings and loan industry in the 1980's, and cost American \ntaxpayers $125 billion. I am referring to the structural weakness \ninherent in a regulatory system which allows the combination of basic \nsafety and soundness oversight with management and governance \nfunctions. This structural weakness exists today in the Federal Housing \nFinance Board (FHFB) which oversees the Federal Home Loan Bank System. \nMoreover, the FHFB appears to be the only regulatory agency where the \nresponsibility for safety and soundness regulation has not been \nseparated from management and governance functions.\n  I am very pleased that Senator Richard Shelby has joined as a co-\nsponsor because he is the Senate's leading proponent of regulatory \nreform and eliminating outdated and unnecessary regulation.\n  Mr. President, throughout most of its history, the Federal Home Loan \nBank System was regulated by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, the same \nagency responsible for regulating the thrift industry. In 1989, \nCongress passed the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and \nEnforcement Act (FIRREA) to abolish the Bank Board and create the \nFederal Housing Finance Board (``FHFB'') to assume responsibility for \nthe regulation and supervision of the Federal Home Loan Bank System \n(FHLB System). FIRREA provided the FHFB with the authority to supervise \nthe Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLBanks), ensure that the FHLBanks carry \nout their mission of housing finance, ensure the FHLBanks remain \nadequately capitalized and able to raise funds in the capital markets, \nand ensure the FHLBanks operate in a safe and sound manner.\n  Safety and soundness regulation became the primary duty of the FHFB \nas a result of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992. In \nthat Act, Congress also recognized problems at the Federal Housing \nFinance Board and specifically identified this structural flaw as a \nserious problem. In search of a solution to this problem and \ninformation concerning the future of the Federal Home Loan Banks in the \ncontext of changing markets for housing finance, Congress mandated \nseveral studies. In the study conducted by the FHFB, the agency itself \nexpressed concern about its dual role: ``The roles of regulation and \ngovernance residing in one entity are not compatible and, indeed, \nrepresent a long standing, well-understood inherent conflict when \njoined''. [The Report on the Structure and Role of the Federal Home \nLoan Bank System, The Federal Housing Finance Board, submitted to \nCongress on April 28, 1993, page 153.] The FHFB recognized that \nconcerns about shareholder dividends and profitability should not be in \ncompetition with concerns over safety and soundness and the \navailability of housing finance for American taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, this bill would eliminate this serious and dangerous \nconflict by transferring functions from the FHFB to the Office of \nFederal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) and the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development (HUD). This is the current system of \nregulation designed by Congress for the other two housing-related \ngovernment sponsored enterprises (GSEs)--Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n  In addition, consolidating safety and soundness regulation in one \nregulatory is consistent with the core recommendations of GAO and HUD--\nthat the conflict with the FHFB be resolved through the creation of a \nsingle housing-related GSE. Even the Chairman of the FHFB, in testimony \nbefore a House Banking Subcommittee last July, endorsed the GAO's \nrecommendation for a single independent safety and soundness regulator \nfor the Federal Home Loan Banks, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. He \nacknowledged that consolidation will yield more effective regulation.\n  Mr. President, consolidating regulation of the housing GSE's is also \nconsistent with the Administration's objective of reducing government \nby eliminating unnecessary, duplicative or redundant regulation--an \nobjective we all share. By placing FHFB's safety and soundness \nfunctions with OFHEO, administration costs would be cut and regulatory \nconsistencies would be realized as a result of the complementary nature \nof the housing finance roles played by the Federal Home Loan Banks, \nFannie Mae, and Freddie Mac. Another important public benefit of \nconsolidating oversight of the housing missions of these agencies \nwithin HUD is to enable HUD to more effectively assess and respond to \nthe nation's affordable housing needs.\n\n  Mr. President, the legislation would abolish the conflicting dual \nroles of the FHFB, streamline an overburdened bureaucratic process, and \ninsure that those entities with the mission of promoting housing \nfinance--Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Federal Home Loan Banks--are \nmeeting that challenge in the most effective way possible. We owe \nnothing less to the working families most in need of our assistance \nthan to insure the system is working for them.\n  Mr. President, this bill would address the regulation of the Federal \nHome Loan Bank System by transferring its safety and soundness \nfunctions to OFHEO and mission oversight to HUD. It does not--and is \nnot intended to--address other policy issues pertaining to the future \nrole of the Federal Home Loan Banks which remain under consideration by \nthe Banking Committee, Improving the level of affordable housing, \nensuring effective, efficient and objective regulation, cutting the fat \nout of the government, and managing the taxpayers' dollars wisely--that \nis what this bill is all about.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1986\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the release of interests of the United \nStates in certain real property located in Augusta, Maine; to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n\n\n                      kennebec arsenal legislation\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, along with my colleague, the senior \nSenator from Maine, I am pleased today to introduce legislation that \nwould bring about the release of certain interests of the United States \nin property that the Federal Government conveyed to the State of Maine \nmore than 90 years ago. The property in question, which is situated on \na bluff overlooking the Kennebec River in Augusta, Maine, is known as \nthe Kennebec Arsenal.\n  In 1905, the Secretary of the Army, acting pursuant to a \nCongressional mandate, executed a deed transferring the property to \nMaine. That conveyance was subject to the conditions that the property \nbe used for what was then called the Maine Insane Hospital and that the \nUnited States could take possession should the President determine that \nthe country had a need for it. In\n\n[[Page S3592]]\n\n1980, Congress provided that the first condition be broadened to allow \nthe property to be used for any public purpose. Today, I seek to \ncomplete the transfer process through legislation that would \neffectively eliminate the conditions attached to the conveyance.\n  Mr. President, the property is no longer needed for it former \npurposes, and my bill would set in motion a chain of events that would \nallow for new uses that would benefit not only the City of Augusta and \nthe State of Maine but our entire country. With the exception of the \nKennebec Arsenal, virtually all of the great arsenals of the nineteenth \ncentury have been demolished or so completely altered that their \noriginal appearance has been lost. The new uses contemplated by Maine \nwould raise money needed for repairs that would maintain what historic \npreservation experts have described as the most perfectly intact of the \nnineteenth century arsenals.\n  To be more specific, the State of Maine and City of Augusta plan to \nform a nonprofit corporation to oversee the property. That corporation \nwould seek out private parties interested in using the land and \nbuildings for such purposes as a marina, a museum, and a restaurant. \nThose parties would provide the capital for infrastructure development \nthat would likely include sidewalks, streets, water, sewer and other \nutility service, and landscaping. In addition, the Arsenal's retaining \nwall needs repair, and a marina cannot be established without \nsubstantial dredging of the river.\n  The objective of my bill is to open the way for these improvements \nand new uses by eliminating any reversionary interests of the United \nStates. The existence of such interests is a barrier to the private \nsector making the long-term commitments required to fund the \nimprovements. In other words, Maine needs clear title for this plan to \ngo forward.\n  Mr. President, the Kennebec Arsenal occupies an important place in \nthe history of Maine and the nation. It was established in 1827 to deal \nwith the threat of invasion from Great Britain, either from across the \nsea or from Canada to the north. The possibility of such an invasion \nwas seen as a major threat to American security during the first half \nof the nineteenth century.\n  Much of the tension with the British stemmed from our disputed border \nwith Canada, and in the late 1830's that dispute nearly blossomed into \na full-scale war. While the so-called bloodless Aroostook War proved to \nbe more talk than action, it caused a flurry of activity at the \nKennebec Arsenal, with newly fabricated munitions sent there in \nanticipation of full-scale fighting. Fortunately, cooler heads and the \narrival of the spring planting season brought the parties to the \nnegotiating table.\n  During the Mexican War, rockets and fixed ammunition were \nmanufactured at the Arsenal and shipped to the front. During the Civil \nWar, the post became an important depot of military stores. Indeed, a \nfear that Confederate guerrillas based in Canada would seek to burn the \nArsenal led to the stationing of extra guards there, but despite the \napproach late one dark night of an unidentified boat, nothing came of \nthis concern. During the latter half of the century, the Arsenal's \nimportance declined, and in 1901, the Army posted an order for its \nabandonment. That process culminated in the legislation signed by \nPresident Theodore Roosevelt providing for the transfer of the property \nto the State for use as a hospital to serve the mentally ill.\n  Mr. President, I have offered this greatly abbreviated history of the \nKennebec Arsenal to demonstrate the value of finding uses for the \nproperty that will guarantee its permanent preservation. That is the \ngoal of the State of Maine and the City of Augusta, and this \nlegislation will remove an anachronistic obstacle to the realization of \nthat goal.\n  I thank you, Mr. President, and I hope to have your support for this \nvery important legislation when it comes before the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/24/senate-section/article/S3585-6", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                S. 1286\n\n  At the request of Mr. Jeffords, the name of the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Faircloth) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1286, a bill to \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude from gross income \ncertain amounts received as scholarships by an individual under the \nNational Health Corps Scholarship Program.\n\n\n                                S. 1360\n\n  At the request of Mr. Abraham, the name of the Senator from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Santorum) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1360, a bill \nto amend the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility \nAct of 1996 to clarify and improve the requirements for the development \nof an automated entry-exit control system, to enhance land border \ncontrol and enforcement, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                                S. 1649\n\n  At the request of Mr. Ford, the name of the Senator from South \nCarolina (Mr. Hollings) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1649, a bill to \nexempt disabled individuals from being required to enroll with a \nmanaged care entity under the medicaid program.\n\n\n                                S. 1724\n\n  At the request of Mr. DeWine, the name of the Senator from Alabama \n(Mr. Sessions) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1724, a bill to amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal the information reporting \nrequirement relating to the Hope Scholarship and Lifetime Learning \nCredits imposed on educational institutions and certain other trades \nand businesses.\n\n\n                                S. 1930\n\n  At the request of Mr. Nickles, the name of the Senator from Montana \n(Mr. Burns) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1930, a bill to provide \ncertainty for, reduce administrative and compliance burdens associated \nwith, and streamline and improve the collection of royalties from \nFederal and outer continental shelf oil and gas leases, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                         Senate Resolution 188\n\n  At the request of Mr. Moynihan, the name of the Senator from Illinois \n(Mr. Durbin) was added as a cosponsor of Senate Resolution 188, a \nresolution expressing the sense of the Senate regarding Israeli \nmembership in a United Nations regional group.\n\n\n                         Senate Resolution 201\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kempthorne, the name of the Senator from Iowa \n(Mr. Grassley) was added as a cosponsor of Senate Resolution 201, a \nresolution to commemorate and acknowledge the dedication and sacrifice \nmade by the men and women who have lost their lives while serving as \nlaw enforcement officers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/24/senate-section/article/S3592-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3592-S3593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 91--RELATIVE TO A POSTAGE STAMP\n\n  Mr. WARNER (for himself, Mr. Robb, and Mr. Graham) submitted the \nfollowing concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 91\n\n       Whereas 1999 marks the 200th anniversary of the death of \n     George Washington;\n       Whereas George Washington's extraordinary virtue commanded \n     the respect of America's early leaders, who called on him to \n     preside over the framing of the Constitution;\n       Whereas George Washington was an indispensable figure in \n     the founding of our Nation, and served as our country's first \n     commander in chief and President with unparalleled \n     distinction;\n       Whereas all Americans remain indebted to George Washington \n     for the liberties we enjoy today;\n       Whereas the death of George Washington on December 14, \n     1799, marked the first instance of national mourning in this \n     country;\n       Whereas George Washington's tremendous accomplishments over \n     the course of a remarkable lifetime are studied and admired \n     in this Nation and around the world; and\n       Whereas issuing a postage stamp to honor the life and \n     contributions of George Washington, ``The Father of Our \n     Country'', is proper and fitting: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) a postage stamp should be issued by the United States \n     Postal Service to commemorate the life of George Washington \n     and his contributions to the Nation; and\n       (2) the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee should recommend \n     to the Postmaster General that such a postage stamp be \n     issued.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to submit legislation to \nhonor one of the greatest men in American history. Many of my esteemed \ncolleagues have joined me in a resolution paying tribute to the life of \nGeorge Washington. However, I believe the\n\n[[Page S3593]]\n\nyear 1999, the bicentennial of Washington's death, may be further \nconsecrated. Therefore, I am introducing a Sense of the Senate \nResolution calling upon the Citizen's Stamp Advisory Committee to issue \na stamp which celebrates the leadership and courage possessed by \nWashington.\n  The life of this great patriot is an extraordinary parable of \nnationalism and a belief in the power of a republican form of \ngovernment. Upon emerging victorious in the Revolutionary War, General \nWashington laid aside the instruments of destruction to craft a young \nnation. Discarding any intimations of personal glory, Washington \nspurned the title of Monarch and instead chose to model the new country \non the ancient principles of democracy. He was truly a ``First among \nEquals''. Washington was very much aware of the momentous nature of the \nfirst presidential term for our emerging democracy. He wrote,\n\n       I walk on untrodden ground. There is scarcely any part of \n     my conduct which may not hereafter be drawn into precedent.\n\n  We must, as a Nation, recognize the value of responsibility. \nWashington shouldered the responsibility of his two terms in office \nwith grace and dignity, ever aware that he would be an example for \ncountries around the world for time eternal. Through a heightened \ncognizance of the actions and beliefs of Washington, we can convey the \ntrue meaning of service to our Nation. I ask my colleagues what better \nway to honor such a man, than to devote a year to honoring his life. In \nthis pursuit, it is fitting to request that a George Washington stamp \nbe issued in 1999. Let us reflect upon the tradition of character of \nour Nation, inaugurated by our first President. Washington will remain, \n``First in War, first in Peace, and first in the hearts of his \nCountrymen.'' I look forward to the swift passage of this legislation.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today to join the Senior Senator from \nVirginia, Mr. Warner, in submitting a concurrent resolution expressing \nthe sense of the Senate that the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee \nexamine issuing a stamp to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the \ndeath of our first President, George Washington.\n  I hardly need to expound on the legacy George Washington has provided \nour nation--his courageous leadership through the Revolutionary War, \nhis vision as our first President, and his personal example as a \ncitizen.\n  I recently joined Senator Warner and Senator Graham in introducing a \nresolution, S. Con. Res. 83, calling on the country to commemorate the \n200th anniversary of Washington's death with ceremonies and activities \nthat explore the life and legacy of George Washington.

Res. 216\n\n       Whereas the United States and Japan share common goals of \n     peace, stability, democracy, and economic prosperity in the \n     Asia-Pacific Region;\n       Whereas the current economic crisis in the Asia-Pacific \n     Region represents a new challenge to United States-Japan \n     cooperation to achieve these common goals;\n       Whereas the Japanese economy, the second largest in the \n     world, has been growing a little over 1 percent annually \n     since 1991 and most forecasts suggest that Japan is unlikely \n     to experience any significant growth in the near future;\n       Whereas Japan's is the second largest trading partner of \n     the United States and accounts for 11 percent of our total \n     foreign trade;\n       Whereas Japan accounts for over 70 percent of the Asia-\n     Pacific Region's gross domestic product and therefore has a \n     particular interest in the stability of the Region's economic \n     and financial system;\n       Whereas a strong United States-Japan alliance is critical \n     to American forward engagement and stability in the Asia-\n     Pacific Region;\n       Whereas the importance of the United States-Japan alliance \n     was reaffirmed by the President of the United States and the \n     Prime Minister of Japan in the April 1996 Joint Security \n     Declaration;\n       Whereas United States-Japan bilateral military cooperation \n     was enhanced with the revision of the United States-Japan \n     Guidelines for Defense Cooperation in 1997;\n       Whereas Japan's failure to contribute to the Region's \n     recovery from the current economic crisis or failure to \n     prevent a further contraction of the Japanese economy could \n     undermine regional stability, cause a setback in the close \n     United States-Japan bilateral security cooperation achieved \n     over the past 3 years, and increase Japan's bilateral and \n     global trade surplus;\n       Whereas the low level of foreign direct investment in \n     Japan, at less than 1 percent of Japan's gross domestic \n     product compared to foreign direct investment in the United \n     States of over 8 percent of the United States gross domestic \n     product, contributes to large external trade imbalances and \n     impedes market access for competitive foreign firms and \n     products;\n       Whereas the United States bilateral trade deficit with \n     Japan increased from $48,000,000,000 in 1996 to \n     $56,000,000,000 in 1997 and has recently increased from \n     $4,000,000,000 in January of 1998 to $5,300,000,000 in \n     February of 1998;\n       Whereas the recent weakness in the yen, following a more \n     than 20 percent depreciation of the yen against the dollar \n     over the last few years, has placed competitive price \n     pressures on United States industries and workers;\n       Whereas a period of deflation in Japan would lead to lower \n     demand for United States products;\n       Whereas the estimated $574,000,000,000 of problem loans in \n     Japan's banking sector has the potential to threaten the \n     recovery of the Asia-Pacific Region and could destabilize \n     global capital markets;\n       Whereas the unnecessary and burdensome regulation of the \n     Japanese market constrains Japanese economic growth, raises \n     the costs to business and consumers, lowers the standard of \n     living, and impedes imports;\n       Whereas the United States strongly encourages Japan to \n     pursue a domestic demand-led economic recovery and thereby \n     prevent further increases in Japan's external trade surplus;\n       Whereas the Japanese Government has responded to the Asia-\n     Pacific Region's economic crisis with financial commitments \n     of approximately $19,000,000,000 to the International \n     Monetary Fund; and\n       Whereas the United States appreciates Japan's efforts to \n     stimulate its economy with the recently announced package of \n     16,000,000,000,000 yen that includes 4,500,000,000,000 yen in \n     tax cuts and 11,500,000,000,000 yen in government spending: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the American people and the countries in the Asia-\n     Pacific Region are looking for a demonstration of Japanese \n     leadership and close United States-Japan cooperation in \n     resolving the current crisis;\n       (2) encouraging the strengthening of the Japanese economy \n     should be one of the Administration's central priorities in \n     all its bilateral and multilateral discussions with Japan;\n       (3) every effort possible should be made to ensure that all \n     other negotiating objectives are consistent with the overall \n     goal of promoting economic growth in Japan, improving market \n     access to Japan, and restoring stability to international \n     financial markets;\n       (4) the President should continue to voice his serious \n     concern about the economic situation in Japan, the \n     international, regional, and bilateral implications of the \n     situation, and the need to address significant structural \n     impediments to competition in the Japanese markets, in order \n     to restore confidence in the Japanese economy and contribute \n     to the Asia-Pacific Region's political stability and economic \n     recovery;\n       (5) the President, the Attorney General, the Secretary of \n     the Treasury, and the United States Trade Representative \n     should emphasize the importance of financial deregulation, \n     including banking reform, market deregulation, and \n     restructuring bad bank debt;\n       (6) the President, the Secretary of the Treasury, the \n     United States Trade Representative, and the Secretary of \n     Commerce should press vigorously for comprehensive and urgent \n     deregulation and fundamental structural reform of the \n     Japanese economy and sectoral markets, liberalization of the \n     distribution system, and elimination of nontariff barriers \n     and anticompetitive business practices that restrict the free \n     flow of competitive goods and services, in order to increase \n     market efficiencies and enhance competition, lower prices, \n     improve market access, and redress global trade imbalances;\n       (7) the President, the United States Trade Representative, \n     the Secretary of Commerce, and the Attorney General should \n     continue to press for--\n       (A) increased antitrust enforcement by the Japan Fair Trade \n     Commission, and\n\n[[Page S3594]]\n\n       (B) strengthening of the Antimonopoly Act to eliminate \n     private practices that restrict competition;\n       (8) the President, the Secretary of the Treasury, the \n     United States Trade Representative, the Secretary of \n     Commerce, and the Secretary of State should urge the \n     Government of Japan to open the Japanese market to increased \n     foreign direct investment and eliminate barriers to foreign \n     direct investment in order to increase the competitiveness of \n     the Japanese economy and stimulate investment and consumer \n     spending; and\n       (9) restoring economic growth in Japan and stability in \n     international financial markets should be given the highest \n     attention at the upcoming meeting of the G-7 countries that \n     will be held in Birmingham, England.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bipartisan \nresolution expressing the sense of the Senate regarding Japan's \ndifficult current economic condition.\n  I am privileged to do so on behalf of my original cosponsors, Senator \nLugar, Senator Graham, Senator Brownback, Senator Bingaman, and Senator \nRockefeller.\n  Mr. President, for the last 46 years almost to the day--since April \nof 1952, when the American occupation of Japan ended and immediately \nour two Nations entered into a security agreement--the United States \nand Japan have shared the common goals of peace, stability, democracy \nand prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region and throughout the world.\n  The fact is that Japan has been our most critical strategic ally and \nour most important economic partner in the region. We have worked \ntogether to bring unprecedented prosperity and security to our people's \nthrough mutual understanding and cooperation. The importance of the \nUnited States-Japan alliance was reaffirmed by President Clinton and \nPrime Minister Hashimoto in the April 1996 Joint Security Declaration \nand the United States-Japan bilateral military cooperation critical to \nour security in the Asia-pacific region. It was enhanced with the \nrevision and promulgation of the United States-Japan Guidelines for \nDefense Cooperation in 1997.\n  Japan is our second largest trading partner--not in Asia but in the \nworld--and a huge and growing consumer of American goods and services. \nJapan imported $65.6 billion of American goods in 1997, third only to \nour neighbors to the north and south, Canada and Mexico. That figure \nhas increased 37 percent from 1992 to 1997. In addition, Japan has \nplayed an important role in the current Asian financial crisis with \nfinancial commitments of approximately $19 billion through the \nInternational Monetary Fund, while we, as the news indicates today, \nhave trouble coming up with a comparable amount authorized by members \nof Congress.\n  However, the current economic crisis in Japan is real and represents \na new and serious challenge to United States-Japan cooperation to \nachieve the common goals of economic prosperity and national security. \nWe must not allow this extraordinary bilateral relationship to falter \nat this critical time, but, rather, we should do everything in our \npower to support the people of Japan and encourage the Government of \nJapan to implement new policies that will promote strong and sustained \neconomic recovery.\n  In less than a decade, Japan's economy has slowed so much that \npundits have coined the phrase ``passing Japan,'' meaning that many in \nthe world now look past Japan and toward its continental neighbor, \nChina, as the economic engine for Asia. But I take these observations \nto be premature. Japan retains enormous long-term economic strength \nbut, nonetheless, has some very serious immediate economic problems \nwhich cannot be ignored. Experts believe that Japan's economy will be \nstagnant or shrink this year; real industrial output was down 3 percent \nfor the first 2 months of this year. Unemployment, while still low by \nworld standards and American standards, is at approximately 3.6 \npercent, which is a 45-year high in Japan, in a society that, \nincidentally, lacks the kind of social safety nets that we have built \nin our country. The Nikkei Index is hovering around 15,000, near its \nlowest level in 10 years; bad and doubtful bank debts are estimated at \nan astounding $574 billion; the Asian crisis has dried up an important \nsource of trade and corporate earnings for the Japanese economy--that \nis, the regional crisis--and the Bank of Japan's most recent Tankan \nsurvey showed Japanese business outlook for the future to be gloomy.\n\n  At least so far, we have been fortunate that the fallout on our \neconomy from Japan's economic woes, as well as the collapse of the \nother troubled Asian economies, has been minimal. That is another way \nof validating the enormous resilience and strength in the American \neconomy. Nonetheless, we have had serious and real early warning signs. \nIn the trade figures announced last week, we see evidence that Japan's \neconomic troubles are starting to have a direct impact on us here in \nthe United States. If Japan's economy continues to deteriorate, there \nis good reason to believe that it will affect our ability to create \njobs and to sustain current GDP growth.\n  Today, my colleagues and I introduce this resolution to express to \nour President and to the Government of Japan that the Congress of the \nUnited States is deeply concerned about Japan's poor economic \nperformance and the pressure it is putting on our overall bilateral \nrelationship. It is widely agreed among economists throughout the \nworld, including most that I have read about in Japan, that more than a \nquick-fix fiscal stimulus is needed to address the underlying problems \nthat are now being seen in the Japanese economy.\n  In that regard, I was very encouraged to see that earlier today Prime \nMinister Hashimoto announced a more long-term approach to restoring \neconomic growth in Japan than had previously been presented by his \ngovernment. Along with the details of the Japanese Government's $123 \nbillion stimulus package, the Prime Minister announced today that he \nwould delay by 2 years his self-imposed deadline to balance the \nnational budget. That is a significant change. This will provide the \nopportunity for Mr. Hashimoto to make his proposed income and targeted \ntax cuts permanent. And I believe this is the right policy and will \nhelp lead Japan out of its current economic troubles.\n\n  The resolution that we submit today also calls for a number of \nfundamental economic reforms in Japan--deregulation of the Japanese \neconomy, improvement of market access, and enforcement of fair trade. \nThese are all actions which should increase the competitiveness of the \nJapanese markets and of Japanese companies and provide greater \nopportunities for investment in Japan and for the success of individual \nentrepreneurs within that country.\n  Finally, the resolution describes the implications of the weakening \nJapanese yen which could lead to another round of competitive currency \ndevaluations throughout the region. Of particular concern is the effect \nof the weak yen on the Chinese yuan. Further devaluation of the yen \ncould lead to a devaluation of the yuan, an event with significant \nramifications of the regional, global and, therefore, of course, \nAmerican economies.\n  For economic, political and strategic reasons, we must support and \nencourage economic reform in Japan. It is absolutely necessary. In the \nend, a more open and healthly Japanese economy is in the interest of \nthe Japanese and American people. The sooner Japan recovers from its \neconomic problems, the sooner the United States, Japan, and the world \nwill reap the benefits of a stable and growing Asian-Pacific region.\n  As we express our concerns about Japan's current economic \ndifficulties, we must also remember the very significant economic \nstrengths that Japan has. It is the second largest economy in the \nworld, second only to ours, and maintains enormous human and capital \nassets. The fact is that one of this century's most dramatic stories is \nJapan's rise to economic superpower status, achieved by a citizenry \ndedicated to education, hard work, and fiscal responsibility. Japan is \nthe most literate society in the world, and 94 percent of the \npopulation completes high school. The Japanese save more than any other \npeople in the world. I know some critics may argue that too much \nsavings is not good for the economy, but the point I want to make here \nis that in Japan saving is a virtue, as it was for a large parts of our \nown history. We lost that truth for a period of time and, fortunately, \nwe are now recovering it, saving in larger numbers again, and that is \npart of the reason why our economy is doing so much better today.\n\n[[Page S3595]]\n\n  Japan also maintains huge foreign reserves and continues to be a \nmajor contributor to international organizations. Unlike the United \nStates, Japan is a net creditor nation. Simply put, Japan's potential \nfor the 21st century continues to be very bright. Its strategic \nimportance to the United States continues to be critical. Long into the \nnext century, Japan will remain our economic trading partner and \nstrategic ally, sharing our goals of regional and world prosperity and \npeace.\n  Given the significance of the current crisis in Japan and the \nimportance of Congress making its voice heard on this crisis, I urge my \ncolleagues to review and hopefully support this bipartisan resolution.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as someone who has had a tremendous \ninterest in Japan throughout my life, I have gained a great deal by \nmaintaining direct and meaningful contact with Japan as a country, a \npeople and a fascinating culture since my days as a student there in \nthe 1950s. And although it is tested constantly, I truly believe the \nrelationship between Japan and the United States continues to be \nstrong. It is a relationship based on shared interests in democracy and \nthe market economy, as well as mutual respect and fundamental \nfriendship. It is from that perspective--as a friend of the Japanese \npeople--that I feel it is so important to introduce this resolution \ntoday with my esteemed colleagues.\n  It was not very long ago that Americans were up in arms about the \ntrade deficit and Japan in particular--blaming the Japanese and other \nforeign countries bitterly for plant closings, job losses and our long \nlist of economic ills. It was a very difficult time for our \nrelationship with Japan, and a very difficult time for America as we \nstruggled to get our own economic house in order.\n  It was, however, also a cathartic time that I think was both \ninevitable and ultimately healthy for both countries.\n  During that time, the United States was going through its own banking \ndifficulties with the S scandals that saw many of our banks close \ntheir doors. Unemployment was way up and wages were stagnating. Our \nfederal deficit was exploding and our national debt was climbing into \nthe trillions. And corporations, many of which had traditionally \nemployed their workers throughout their lifetime, were shedding \nemployees by the thousands.\n  The pressure to change intensified, as the American people watched \nour edge in certain industries and technologies slip and our people's \nanxieties and personal pain grow. The pressures strained our political \nsystem. In a nation of great diversity, ideas were born and rejected, \nconsensus embraced, then rejected. While the U.S. still has plenty of \nroom for improvement, I think there would be a large consensus that \nwould agree that the United States has effectively tackled many of our \n``structural problems''--the ones that Japan was right to point out to \nus so often.\n  Today, Japan faces a similar crisis. A creeping economic crisis that \nhas profound and dangerous implications for all of Asia, and the world. \nAt stake, in my opinion, is Japan's leadership in the world and the \nstabilization of the Asian economies. This world and the United States \ncannot move forward successfully, without Japan's leadership.\n  I feel so strongly about this and that is why this resolution is so \nvery important. It is not to speak harshly of Japan, but to push for an \nhonest, frank discussion, among friends, to talk about the very serious \nissues facing Japan that could lead to problems around the world.\n  I would remind my colleagues that this crisis is not a recent \nphenomenon. For more than six years, we have had warnings of problems \non the horizon. Many Japanese have told me the biggest mistake that \nJapan could make would be to continue to delay action and postpone \nreform. One of the things I and many Japan watchers worry about is that \nbecause of Japan's strong financial reserves, they will somehow get \nthrough this crisis, and there will be those who say, ``see everything \nis OK. The system works fine;'' that Japan will get through this crisis \nwithout learning anything from it.\n  By turning inward and ignoring the need for change, at the moment \nthat Japan is challenged to lead, Japan risks abdicating its long term \nglobal and regional security and economic responsibilities to emerging \npowers like China or even India. This has serious implications for the \nUnited States, as well.\n  In terms of Japan, it is hard to not believe that Japan will once \nagain face the problems that require action, and come out stronger as a \nresult. The Japanese know more than anyone that many so-called ``Japan \nwatchers'' in the United States and elsewhere are more pessimistic--\nsaying that the talk in Japan of reform, adjustment, and stimulating \nthe economy from within is not real. But when I think of Japan's \nhistory and what Japan's leaders in government and business know about \neconomic success, I still personally choose to be more optimistic.\n  I recall 1973, with the oil shock and the end of the Bretton Woods \nsystem, when it led the Japanese to a national commitment to reduce \nenergy consumption and to increase energy efficiency. The overall \neffect on Japan as a whole was dramatic and impressive.\n  Again, in 1985, with the Plaza Accord, when the yen began its \ndramatic strengthening--resulting in a commitment from Japanese \nindustry to become much more efficient and squeeze out enormous waste \nand costs. The result was an incredibly competitive manufacturing \nmachine.\n  Now it is 1998, when the problems of other Asian countries require \nplans for international bail-outs and very harsh measures. President \nClinton has called on Japan to become the engine of growth and recovery \nin Asia. I agree with him and encourage him to continue pushing Japan. \nFrankly put, Japan's future depends on a prosperous Asia and world. And \nAmerica's future does as well.\n  But, we also need to be realistic about what can and cannot work in \nJapan. American or European solutions to problems will not necessarily \nwork there. If Japan is to lead Asia out of this crisis, Japan needs to \nmove more quickly to recognize the extent of this problem and to find \nthe uniquely Japanese solutions to them. But, only Japan can chart \nJapan's future.\n  Japan needs to continue to work toward the reforms in their \nregulatory system which Prime Minister Hashimoto has begun. While there \nhas been some small movement on this front, still, many more \nregulations remain that are a strait jacket on competition and free \ncommerce. Telecommunications, housing and distribution are all sectors \nripe for deregulation.\n  In a similar vein, opening Japanese markets to more products, \nparticularly products  from Asia, is critical to the Asian recovery. \nThis won't be easy--and that's where leadership comes in--especially as \nJapan itself struggles to regain its balance. Open markets, over the \nlong term, will position Japan to become the leader of a reborn Asian \nmiracle.\n\n  One extremely important foundation in a Japanese recovery, and in \npromoting Japanese economic leadership in an Asian recovery, is the \nfostering of a new pluralism of ideas in their political system. Every \nnation goes through times of introspection. America often does. \nCertainly, a national dialogue in Japan on this crisis and how to \nemerge from it stronger than ever, can't hurt. And efforts to institute \nsignificant political reform here should not be slowed. Diet Members, \nas the most direct representatives of their districts, need to become \nactively engaged in finding solutions. At all levels of government, \naccountability is key. Ministers need to have the power to lead their \ndepartments, and become responsible for their success and failure. \nBureaucrats need to take orders, as easily as they give them.\n  Over and over again, my Japanese friends point to the fact that \nMinistry of Finance and its bureaucracy has a far greater influence on \npolicy than is appropriate and prudent in a parliamentary democracy. \nThis has been said to me by Japanese time and time again over a number \nof years. It would seem to me, and not to be idealistic here, that the \nministry ought to reflect the views of the Prime Minister and those \nelected to represent the people, and not the reverse. In our country \nthis is a subject of extensive discussion and complaint by people who \ncare about Japan. Accountability in a democracy is paramount.\n\n[[Page S3596]]\n\n  Why should it be that when I meet the Minister of Finance, or any \nMinister for that matter, that I know that I'm not speaking to the \nperson who makes the decisions? How can that be in a democracy? In \nGreat Britain they share Japan's Parliamentary system, but their \ncabinet agencies reflect the views of the Prime Minister and the people \nwho elect the parliament, and they run the agency. Of course the \nMinisters consult with the bureaucrats, but they are held accountable \nfor reflecting the Prime Minister's views and the national will. \nUnfortunately, that can't be said about today's Japan.\n  I also find it ironic that the political reforms, such as single \ndelegate districts, that were supposed to open up Japan's democracy and \ndecision making, have not brought about the fundamental change in the \nsystem that everyone expected. The lack of a strong multi-party system, \nwith a strong and viable opposition party remains a barrier to reform \nand serves as a wall through which ideas and change cannot penetrate.\n  Just as Americans still have much to learn from Japan's successes, my \npoint must also be to emphasize that we are affected by how Japan \nhandles the challenges now posed by the weaker parts of their economy. \nOur relationship is not just a matter of the ties between our leaders, \nthe tremendously important military alliance we share or the many forms \nof business and investment we transact between one another. We are \nincreasingly connected through currencies, our banking systems and loan \npolicies, the value of stocks, and whether Japan puts too much emphasis \non exporting its way out of the problems rather than internal measures. \nWe in the U.S. hope that our economic condition will insulate ourselves \nfrom the downturns in Asia. But we have to worry about markets \nshrinking for our products and especially any growth in our sizable \ntrade deficit with Japan.\n  My biggest fear is that if the Asian crisis remains unchecked, and \naverage Americans begin to feel the impact of the succeeding market \ncollapses on their incomes, they will begin to question Japan's \nnational resolve and political will to deal with these problems. I \nespecially don't want to see any further reasons for Americans to turn \nwithin or fear an active role in world trade. Throughout my political \ncareer, I have pushed very hard in my state of West Virginia for open \nmarkets, a global economy and fought against the forces of isolation \nand protectionism. Competition has served both my state and my country, \nand they will Japan as well.\n  So, the actions Japan takes, or does not take, will affect America, \nas surely as they will their neighbors in Asia.\n  I hope both our nations' leaders will continue to place the utmost \nimportance on the U.S.-Japan relationship. Its strength is the basis \nfor honesty with one another, for the ability to address problems \ntogether, and to pursue regional and shared objectives. We also must \nmaintain and nurture this strength, which especially requires us to \nappreciate the role that our economies have on one another--because of \ntheir effect on our people and our sense of ourselves as nations. And \nthis is a time when steps are more urgently required to ensure progress \nand prevent any kind of setback. I pledge to do my part in continuing \nto promote the importance and the potential of a strong, close U.S.-\nJapan relationship at all levels.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/24/senate-section/article/S3593-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 COMMEMORATION OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today as I and a number \nof my colleagues do every year to mark and remember a dark day in human \nhistory: The beginning of the systematic extermination of 1.5 million \nArmenian men, women, and children.\n  On April 24, 1915--eighty-three years ago--the Ottoman Empire \nlaunched a brutal and unconscionable policy of mass murder. Over an \neight year period, 1.5 million Armenians were killed, and another \n500,000 were driven from their homes, their land and property \nconfiscated.\n  As we remember the dark past of the Armenian people, however, our act \nof remembrance also offers the opportunity to celebrate hope and the \nresilience of the human spirit. Today, the people of Armenia can look \nto a promising future, as they continue to work for democracy and peace \nin their homeland.\n  The Armenian genocide was the first genocide of the twentieth \ncentury, an appalling precursor to events in Nazi Germany, Soviet \nRussia, Cambodia, Bosnia and Central Africa, as well as too numerous \nother places. As we mark this day of remembrance, people of conscience \naround the world must redouble our commitment to fight for human \ndignity and freedom, and vow to never again allow genocide to \noccur.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/24/senate-section/article/S3596-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, April 24th is the day we remember \nthe horrors inflicted upon the Armenians in Turkey during World War I \nand afterward. Today, we express our solidarity with Armenians \neverywhere, and reflect upon the meaning of their suffering and \nsacrifice. We mourn the dead, and express our condolences to their \nliving descendants. During that terrible tragedy, about 1.5 million \npeople were killed.\n  The massacres and deportations of the Armenians during that period \nwere a forerunner of subsequent horrors perpetrated against other \npeoples. The Armenians were the first victims of genocide in this \ncentury, when civilian populations, defined by ethnicity, race or \nreligion, have been targeted by soldiers or paramilitary groups, and in \nsome cases, by sovereign states using all their instruments of military \npower to destroy a people.\n  We mark this day so as never to forget what happened, and to \nstrengthen our conviction to prevent any recurrences in the future. Not \nonly against Armenians, but against any people.\n  During and after World War I, Armenians did not have a state of their \nown. Today, independent Armenia defends Armenians everywhere, and they, \nin turn, protect the interests of their ancient homeland. Armenia is a \ncountry of great promise, despite its many troubles. We fervently hope \nthat the efforts of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \nEurope's Minsk Group will be successful and the Nagorno-Karabakh \nconflict will be resolved peacefully. We pray that we may see a \nprosperous Armenia living in peace with all its neighbors, continuing \nto teach the world lessons, as a light unto the nations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/24/senate-section/article/S3596-2", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3596-S3597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             THE 83RD ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in \ncommemorating the 83rd anniversary of the Armenian genocide, which \nconsumed the lives of one and a half million men, women and children. \nToday, as we remember the sacrifice of the Armenian people, we honor \nthem by renewing our commitment to protecting the fundamental rights \nand freedoms of all humanity.\n  It is imperative, Mr. President, that no nation or individual ever \nforget the injustices suffered by the Armenians in 1915. Perhaps the \nmost prominent witness to the Armenian genocide was Henry Morgenthau, \nthe U.S. Ambassador to Turkey at the time, who described the wide-scale \nand deliberate orchestration of atrocities against the Armenian people \nas ``the Greatest Horror in History.'' He later wrote,\n  ``Whatever crimes the most perverted instincts of the human mind can \ndevise, and whatever refinements of persecutions and injustice the most \ndebased imagination can conceive, became the daily misfortunes of this \ndevoted people. I am confident that the whole history of the human race \ncontains no such horrible episode as this. The great massacres and \npersecutions of the past seem almost insignificant when compared to the \nsufferings of the Armenian race in 1915. The killing of the Armenian \npeople was accompanied by the systematic destruction of churches, \nschools, libraries, treasures of art and of history in an attempt to \neliminate all traces of a noble civilization some three thousand years \nold.''\n  Ambassador Morgenthau's assessment of the great tragedy was consonant \nwith public reporting at the\n\n[[Page S3597]]\n\ntime the events took place. Newspaper headlines in mid-1915 heralded, \n``More Armenian Massacres,'' ``Armenian Horrors Grow,'' ``Tales of \nArmenian Horrors Confirmed,'' ``800,000 Armenians Counted Destroyed,'' \n``Spare Armenians, Pope Asks Sultan.'' On July 16, 1915, Morgenthau \nsent the following message by telegraph to the Secretary of State:\n  ``Deportation of and excesses against peaceful Armenians is \nincreasing and from harrowing reports of eyewitnesses it appears that a \ncampaign of race extermination is in progress under pretext of reprisal \nagainst rebellion.''\n  Other diplomats and consular officers substantiated the Ambassador's \nreport of what was taking place. Abram Elkus, Morgenthau's successor, \nthrough his cables to the State Department confirmed his predecessor's \nassessment.\n  We must not allow a handful of revisionists to shake our resolve to \nprompt recognition and acceptance of responsibility for this well-\ndocumented historical event. Indeed, Morgenthau and other diplomats who \nwitnessed and reported in great detail the enormous devastation of the \nArmenian community would be astonished to learn today that the abundant \nevidence they collected, much of which is held in our own National \nArchives, and the testimony of survivors who are still with us, have \ncome under challenge. Despite the irrefutability of the documentation \nand testimony, including extensive accounts from survivors, witnesses, \nand historians, there are those who deny the past, blame the victims, \nand oppose reconciliation.\n  It is a tribute to the indomitable spirit of the Armenian people \nthat, after enduring centuries of oppression, they have reestablished a \nfree and independent state that is making new strides toward democracy \nand economic revitalization. In its short existence, the Republic of \nArmenia has survived the earthquake of 1988, the dissolution of the \nSoviet Union and a blockade by its neighbors. The spirit of the \nArmenian people is reflected not only in their dedication to rebuilding \na nation from the ashes of totalitarianism, but also in the strength \nand vibrancy of the Armenian-American community. Americans of Armenian \norigin have successfully contributed to the cultural, social, economic, \nand political life of this country while preserving the rich faith and \ncultural traditions of their forebears. Clearly, the spirit of the \nArmenian people continues to thrive.\n  Mr. President, to ensure that such a tragedy never be repeated it is \nincumbent upon us to remember the victims of the Armenian genocide and \npay tribute to the survivors. Just as we have vowed never to forget the \nNazi Holocaust, we must continually remind ourselves of the events of \n1915. They became, after all, a precedent for Hitler, who rationalized \nhis barbarism by asking, ``Who remembers the Armenians?''\n  As citizens of a nation founded on the ideals of freedom and human \ndignity, we must educate ourselves about the events that constituted \nthe Armenian genocide and renew our commitment never to remain \nindifferent in the face of such assaults on humanity. In the words of \nthe great philosopher, George Santayana, ``those who cannot remember \nthe past are condemned to repeat it.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/24/senate-section/article/S3596-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 COMMEMORATION OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to commemorate the 83rd \nanniversary of the Armenian Genocide.\n  Old and young around the world today remember the Armenian holocaust. \nWe remember that on this date in 1915, the Ottoman Empire and the \nsuccessor Turkish nationalist regime began a brutal policy of \ndeportation and murder. Over the next eight years, 1.5 million \nArmenians would be massacred at the hands of the Turks and another \n500,000 would have their property confiscated and be driven from their \nhomeland.\n  Although it seems that the world stood silent while the Armenian \npopulation was devastated, a few witnesses did try to tell the terrible \nstory. In 1919, Henry Morganthau, Sr., the American Ambassador to the \nOttoman Empire, published a memoir which extensively detailed what he \nhad seen and heard in Turkey during the previous six years. Of the \nevents of the genocide, Ambassador Morgenthau wrote, ``I am confident \nthat the whole history of the human race contains no such horrible \nepisode as this. The great massacres and persecutions of the past seem \nalmost insignificant when compared to the sufferings of the Armenian \nrace in 1915.''\n  Last August, I had the opportunity to visit Armenia and Nagorno \nKarabagh. I was able to see the treasures of that land firsthand and \npay tribute to the indomitable spirit of the people of Armenia. One \nmorning I toured the Genocide Monument and Museum in Yerevan and then \nstood by the eternal flame while a vocalist sang a haunting solo. It \nwas the most moving moment of my visit.\n  My trip to the Transcaucasus made it clear that despite having \nalready undergone such terrible persecution and hardship, the people of \nthe Armenian Republic still suffer today. The economy is struggling and \nthe area has still not recovered from the 1988 earthquake. The Karabagh \nconflict remains unresolved and Turkey continues to blockade \nhumanitarian aid to Armenia.\n  However, the Armenian people remain resilient, hopeful, and an \ninspiration to others. In Armenia, they continue their quest for peace \nand democracy. Just last month, the residents of Armenia showed their \ncommitment to democracy when they participated in the third \npresidential election since independence in 1991. In America, many \ncommunities, like those in my home state of Rhode Island, are enriched \nby the traditions of Armenians who have immigrated to our shores.\n  Because Armenia is a part of our world and persons of Armenian \ndescent are members of our community, we must remain committed to \nalways remember the Armenian genocide. As Peter Balakian, author of the \ncritically acclaimed ``Black Dog of Fate'', wrote:\n\n       Commemoration is an essential process for the bereaved and \n     for the inheritors of the legacy of genocide. It is a process \n     of making meaning out of unthinkable horror and loss. The \n     burden of bereavement can be alleviated if shared and \n     witnessed by a larger community. Only then can redemption, \n     hope and community be achieved.\n\n  Menk panav chenk mornar.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/24/senate-section/article/S3597-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3597]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CONGRATULATIONS TO DUNWOODY HIGH STUDENTS\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate \nDunwoody High School students, Bakari Brock, Jennifer Campbell, Richard \nCartwright, Michael Cayes, Carol Chandler, Melissa Chastnew, Zack \nCullens, Melissa Derick, Kevin Franklin, Erin Green, Judy Hudgins, \nRebecca Lamb, Dwayne O'Mard, Sandra Park, Andrea Pierce, Jennifer \nPrice, Scot Prudhomme, Carlyn Sibler, Geren Stone, Dannon Taylor, David \nWeiner, David Yoo, and their teacher, Celeste Boemker, who will be \ntraveling to Washington to represent our state in the ``We the People . \n. . the Citizen and the Constitution Program'' in early May.\n  As a strong proponent for the education of our nation's youth, it is \nwith great pride that I hear of children from my home state to compete \non a national level to test their knowledge of politics and the \ngovernment of the United States.

Mr. President, now that the budget resolution has \nbeen adopted, I wanted to take a few moments to discuss several of the \nmore important votes that took place.\n  The first of these was the Allard amendment to create a new point of \norder against future budgets that fail to eliminate the federal debt by \nthe year 2028. Mr. President, I fully support reducing the size of the \nfederal debt, and I am glad the pending resolution cuts the relative \nsize of the debt by almost 20 percent over the next five years. On the \nother hand, the Allard amendment may require making payments on debt \nthat is not actually due.\n\n[[Page S3598]]\n\n A significant portion of the debt is held by foreign investors. It \ndoes not make sense to me to use American taxpayers' dollars to make \nearly debt payments to foreign investors like the central banks of \nChina, Japan, and Germany. I believe there are several priorities \nfacing this Congress beyond reducing the federal debt, including \nreforming the Social Security system and improving our onerous tax \ncode, and I do not support amendments that would tie Congress' hands \nwith regard to these important reforms.\n  Two other amendments that require comment were the Kennedy and Murray \namendments to increase funding in Function 500, the eduction and \ntraining function, while making across-the-board cuts to all other \ndomestic discretionary accounts. Mr. President, the underlying budget \nresolution accomplishes two priorities with regard to education. First, \nit lives up to the budget agreement signed by both congressional \nleadership and the President just last year. That agreement targeted \nsufficient resources at federal education programs to fully fund the \npriorities of both the President and Congress. Second, this resolution \nadds to those agreed-to levels by increasing funding for important \nprograms like IDEA and the Innovative Strategies State Grant program--\nprograms that work by block-granting federal resources back to the \nstates and local governments.\n  Mr. President, if we have learned anything regarding effective \neducation policy, it is that building an ever larger federal presence \nin historically local- and state-controlled public schools simply \ndoesn't work. The Senate budget recognizes this fact, while the Kennedy \nand Murray amendments ignore it. This budget increases federal \neducation funding by $2.6 billion over the next five years at the same \ntime that many budget areas are being cut. I believe this is a clear \nindication of the priority the Senate places on eduction issues.\n  Several other amendments were offered, including the Lautenberg, \nWellstone, Dorgan, and Feingold amendments, which would have \nestablished so-called reserve funds for the creation of new mandatory \nspending programs. Mr. President, by definition, these amendments call \nfor creating new, uncontrolled federal entitlement programs. Exactly \nwhat these programs would do, and how they would be funded, is left \nunclear. On the other hand, my position regarding new mandatory \nspending is extremely clear--until Congress takes the necessary steps \nto ensure the future solvency of our existing entitlements, including \nSocial Security and Medicare, we should have the discipline to refrain \nfrom creating new programs which will endanger the solvency of existing \nprograms and the federal government. For that reason, I opposed these \nreserve fund amendments.\n  The Kempthorne amendment regarding the Endangered Species Act also \nrequires comment. Under the budget resolution, funds raised from \nselling surplus BLM lands were to be targeted at programs designed to \nprotect endangered species. In my mind, Mr. President, this funding \nmechanism represents a win-win situation for everyone involved in \nprotecting this nation's wildlife. First, by selling surplus lands, the \nfederal government rids itself of the cost of managing lands for which \nit has no purpose. Second, the proceeds from these lands would go \ntowards continued protection of endangered wildlife. During debate, \nSenator Reid raised concerns that tying ESA funding solely to the sale \nof federal lands was not good policy. For this reason, I supported the \nKempthorne amendment which addressed some of Senator Reid's concerns by \nexpanding the possible funding sources for Endangered Species Act \nenforcement.\n  Another important vote was the Bumpers amendment to increase the \nroyalty on the net return on the profits from mining gold, silver and \nplatinum and channeling those funds into IDEA. Mr. President, the \nunderlying budget resolution takes a dramatic step towards increasing \nthe funding for IDEA. This is a program that I fully support and look \nforward to continued increases in federal participation.\n  Nevertheless, I opposed this amendment because I do not believe the \nimposition of new taxes on the mining industry is the proper means of \nreforming our mining law. Hard rock mining is a capital intensive \nindustry that has struggled in recent years despite the booming U.S. \neconomy. The reason is simple--the costs of extracting these metals \nfrom U.S. soil is only slightly less than the market value of these \nmetals. I believe there are better approaches for reforming our mining \nlaws than simply raising taxes, and I look forward to working with \nSenator Bumpers and other Senators to seeing those reforms take place.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I wanted to discuss the Domenici amendment \nregarding the recent ruling by the Veterans' Administration General \nCounsel to include some smoking-related illnesses in the qualified list \nof ``service connected'' diseases. Mr. President, I want to help \nveterans and their families, but it is my firm belief that such an \nincrease in the federal government's liability should result only from \nan act of Congress, not a judge's ruling, and that Congress should only \nact with all the pertinent facts before it. For these reasons, I \nsupported the Domenici amendment to require a year-long study of the \nmerits of such claims. This study will enable Congress to avoid the \ncurrent vacuum of knowledge that surrounds this issue and devise the \nbest policy for our veterans. If the study supports these claims, then \nI will support expanding the current program to accommodate \nthem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/24/senate-section/article/S3597-3", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3598]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO UNIVERSITY OF UTAH ROTC CLASS OF 1944\n\n Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nUniversity of Utah ROTC Class of 1944 which responded to the call for \nactive military duty during World War II. On May 2, 1998, at the \nUniversity of Utah members of the ROTC Class of 1944 will hold a \nreunion commemorating the 55th anniversary of their activation into our \nnational armed services. I believe it is fitting that we honor them \ntoday in the United States Senate.\n  The University of Utah Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) was an \nunique organization. It was one of the few military units which were \ncalled into service during World War II from a specific community and \nwhich can return to that home area for a reunion. Most military units \ninclude individuals whose residences are scattered throughout the \ncountry. Through an Act of Congress in 1916, ROTC programs were \nestablished in higher education institutions across the country. Since \nthat time, they have been an important part of this nation's civil \ndefense--in times of war and peace--training generations of students \nfor service to their country.\n  In the early 1940s, this class trained at the University of Utah with \nhorse-drawn artillery working with an old French 77 millimeter cannon \nand with a 105 millimeter howitzer, new at the time. As a unit, this \nROTC class was first assigned to Camp Roberts in California, for basic \ntraining in truck drawn artillery. Later they were assigned to Fort \nSill, Oklahoma, for further training and ultimately received further \nschooling at the Infantry Officers School at Fort Benning, Georgia. \nAfter graduation from Fort Benning, these young men, whose average age \nat the time was slightly over 20, served as officers in various combat \nunits in Italy, France and the South Pacific.\n  These were brave and honorable men, each one of them. Of the 99 who \nwere called to active duty in 1943, two were killed in action while \nserving in the 10th Mountain Division in Italy. One was later killed in \nthe Korean Conflict. Of the group's original 99 members, 71 are still \nalive. Today, I speak for all Utahns and all Americans when I say, we \nhonor these brave men and pay tribute to them for their service and \nsacrifice for this great country. The Class of 1944's great tradition \nof discipline and leadership continues today as many of its members are \nrespected professionals in the public and private sector as well as \ntheir own communities.\n  Finally, Mr. President, before I close, I want to thank Chris S. \nMetos of Salt Lake City, Utah, for the outstanding job he has done to \nhelp organize this upcoming reunion and for the many years of service \nhe has provided to this country and to the people of the state of \nUtah.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/24/senate-section/article/S3598-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S3599]]\n              NATIONAL COUNTY GOVERNMENT WEEK, APRIL 19-25\n\n Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to salute the work of \nthe 3,072 county governments nationwide, and in particular, the work of \nthe 87 counties in my home state of Minnesota. Counties are often an \ninvisible, but extremely important part of our intergovernmental \nsystem. County officials in my home state have also taken leadership \nroles in their national organization, namely Commissioner Randy \nJohnson, who chairs the Hennepin County Board of Commissioners and \nserves as the President of the National Association of Counties (NACo), \nand his colleague, Hennepin County Commissioner Peter McLaughlin, who \nchairs NACo's Large Urban County Caucus which represents the interests \nof the nation's 100 largest counties.\n  Counties can trace their roots to the English shire of a thousand \nyears ago. Serving a dual function, the shire acted as the \nadministrative arm of the national government as well as the citizen's \nlocal government. The structural form of the shire was adopted along \nthe eastern seaboard of North America by the colonists and adapted to \nsuit the diverse economic and geographic needs of each of the \ncolonists.\n  Traditionally, counties performed state-mandated duties which \nincluded assessment of property, record keeping such as property and \nvital statistics, maintenance of rural roads, and administration of \nelection and judicial functions. Today, counties are moving rapidly \ninto other areas, undertaking programs relating to consumer protection, \neconomic development, employment training, planning and zoning, and \nwater quality, to name just a few.\n  This week, counties across the country are celebrating National \nCounty Government Week. This celebration is an annual event for \ncounties. First held in 1991, the goal of National County Government \nWeek is to raise public awareness and understanding about the roles and \nresponsibilities of the nation's counties.\n  There have been activities at the national, state and local levels \nthis week. More than 1,000 counties annually participate in National \nCounty Government Week by holding a variety of programs and events. \nThese include tours of county facilities, presentations in schools, \nmeetings with business and community leaders, recognition programs for \nvolunteers, briefings on environmental projects, and adoption of \nproclamations.\n  There is a theme each year for National County Government Week. This \nyear, the theme has been ``Creating Sustainable Communities.'' Counties \nare being encouraged during National County Government Week to make \ntheir communities more livable by engaging their citizens in a process \nthat promotes job growth and environmental stewardship.\n  I know that NACo has encouraged counties this week to hold a town \nmeeting or launch a series of community-wide dialogues to solicit \ncitizen participation to identify the community's most pressing issues \nand to establish a comprehensive vision for the future.\n  NACo has also suggested that counties develop a public participation \nstrategy to identify and solve local problems that bring local \ngovernment officials, business leaders, and community representatives \ntogether.\n  Counties have brought their citizens closer to their government by \ngetting them to come to county facilities to learn about county \nservices--or by going where the people are. Some counties this week \nheld an open house at the county courthouse and administration \nbuilding. They created displays by county departments showing what each \ndepartment does. Employees were on hand to describe the services they \nprovide and their responsibilities.\n  Some counties focused on their county's history as well. Local \nhistorical societies and libraries put together presentations or \ndisplays to inform citizens about the county's history.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to support the efforts of \nour county governments throughout the country, and in particular, my \nhome state of Minnesota. National County Government Week has been \nsuccessful in attempting to raise public awareness of the good work of \nour nation's county governments and how they help improve the lives of \ntheir residents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/04/24/senate-section/article/S3599-1", "month": "04", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3599]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR--H.R. 3565 AND S. 1985\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.
